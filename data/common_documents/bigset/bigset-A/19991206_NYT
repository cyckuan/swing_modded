   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ If you're traveling in a foreign
country and planning to stay in a remote bed-and-breakfast, it's a
good idea to take a look at the rooms before making a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   No problem at La Campagne Jeanne. You can look even before
making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, it's possible to take a Web-site tour of
the home of Martine and Daniel Alexandrian, which they opened to
the public as a B&AMP;B in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Online, www.campagne-jeanne.com features text and photos
detailing rooms, decor, bathroom facilities, meals and recipes,
plus views of the countryside where you'll be staying.
</P>
<P>
   That's Daniel's contribution to the enterprise, thanks to his
expertise in computers. Martine takes it from there, doing all the
cooking and cleaning herself for as many as six guests at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It's what she always wanted, said Daniel, who speaks English and
translates for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dreamed of having her own bed and breakfast for a long,
long time,'' he said, ``and it has all come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Martine _ now in their middle to late 40s and with
two grown children _ invested in a couple of acres of fields in the
countryside some three miles from the city of Aix-en-Provence,
restored a pair of century-old farmhouses and joined them together
with a new structure of stone, stucco and antique timbers in
keeping with the old style of Provence.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing they added that was very much new for B&AMP;Bs in
rural France: a site on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Has it been successful?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good,'' Daniel said, laughing. ``Exceptional ...
unbelievable. ... Sometimes we could have rented the rooms two or
three times over.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful to the point that 80 to 90 percent of their business
comes from the Web, mostly from people in the U.S. and other
countries where use of the Internet is commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   But not so much in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French make it a habit to call just the day they are
coming,'' Daniel said. ``As a result, they often find that no rooms
are available.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that La Campagne Jeanne has cast a wide net, attracting
visitors from South Africa, Australia, Brazil and India.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be Martine who keeps them coming back, and staying
longer.
</P>
<P>
   A room for two costs $40 to $60, including breakfast. For an
extra $20 per person, you get dinner. Martine serves as chef,
specializing in traditional dishes of Provence.
</P>
<P>
   A few of her favorites: Anchoiade, barigoule, grilled sweet
pepper salad, stuffed sardines, pistou soup, Provencal tomatoes.
Recipes are included on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who works in Aix, pop. 150,000, for a company dealing in
environmental issues, said that operating the B&AMP;B has been an
enjoyable experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come looking for this kind of accommodation are
looking for something different, and maybe they are different
themselves,'' he said. ``One French couple stayed two months. By
the time they left, it was like losing old friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Daniel and Martine hope to add an extra room and,
perhaps in three years, yet another one, for a maximum of 10
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Such is Martine's dream - along with one other thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then,'' Daniel said, ``she hopes we can also add some
staff.''

 &HT;    MARINES DIGGING IN AS AIR FORCE SEEKS APPROVAL FOR MEMORIAL
 &HT;    860&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Dec. 12.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rallying his troops by e-mail, retired Marine Gen.
Charles G. Cooper warns, ``we're in the assault phase of this
momentous battle.''
</P>
<P>
   His foe: the United States Air Force. The Air Force has won most
of the early skirmishes, but ``we are dug in and determined,'' said
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is over control of a strategic Virginia ridge
overlooking the Potomac River. The Air Force chose this prime spot
near the rows of somber white crosses at Arlington National
Cemetery to build a memorial. But the Marine Corps charges that the
site is too close to its famed Iwo Jima Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular site has a special meaning,'' retired Air
Force Gen. Robert Springer told a congressional committee. ``It is
less than a mile from the site of this nation's first-ever military
flight, which took place on the parade ground at Fort Myer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iwo Jima statue and surrounding grounds represent the ``soul
of the Marine Corps,'' counters Cooper. Even though he credits Air
Force combat support with helping him survive in Korea and Vietnam,
he now leads the Iwo Jima Preservation Committee because ``we had
to defend our sacred site.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting is taking place in courtrooms and on Capitol Hill.
Both sides set up informational fortresses on the Internet.
Unfriendly fire is exchanged on newspaper editorial pages. Lawyers
have been retained. Bureaucrats are actively engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The arts community even entered the fray. Marines were outraged
by reports that at a meeting of the Commission of(cq) Fine Arts,
Chairman Carter Brown called the Iwo Jima statue ``kitsch.'' By
contrast, Brown has praised the ``uplifting'' abstract design for
the proposed Air Force Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The idea of an Air Force memorial took off at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation was incorporated in 1992 to design and fund a
memorial to honor the men and women of the U.S. Air Force and its
predecessor, the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Springer was enlisted as the first president. Brewing magnate
Joe Coors Jr. was named chairman of the board of trustees. Their
goal was to raise $30 million and complete the project within a
decade. Defense contractors were ready to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, authorizing legislation was passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton. The National Park Service
offered 18 possible sites. In 1994, Arlington Ridge was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   James Freed, the architect for the Holocaust Museum, designed
the new memorial. His impressionistic concept centered on the
five-pointed Air Force star and aimed to invoke the ``idea'' of the
flying armed service.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said its memorial would occupy two acres, compared
to eight for the Iwo Jima Memorial and three for the nearby
Netherlands Carillon. That would leave 12 acres of open space on
the ridge. Stands of trees would separate the memorials. The
abstract Air Force Memorial would be more than 500 feet from the
realistic statue of Marines raising an American flag on Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   But 500 feet is far too close to suit many active and retired
Marines. The counter-attack began quicker than you can say ``Semper
Fi.''
</P>
<P>
   Author James Webb, a former secretary of the Navy and the son of
a deceased Air Force officer, wrote a letter of opposition that
popped up on op-ed pages across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it simply, the proposed Air Force memorial would
pollute Arlington Ridge, forever changing its context,'' wrote
Webb, who led a Marine platoon in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since its dedication in 1954 by President Eisenhower, the Iwo
Jima statue has served as the major World War II memorial in the
capital region. Based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning combat photo by
Joe Rosenthal, the statue depicts five Marines and a Navy corpsman
raising the American flag on a Pacific atoll where nearly 6,000
Marines died in battle and another 17,000 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statue by Felix de Weldon is ``the nation's most
famous military landmark,'' wrote Webb. ``It is, for many
Americans, truly sacred ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents organized the Iwo Jima Preservation Committee, Combat
Veterans of Iwo Jima and the Friends of Iwo Jima to lobby against
this site for the Air Force Memorial. Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
a former Marine, even introduced a bill to block the project. The
legislation died.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the opposition has raised the ire of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree that our memorial will have a negative impact on
their memorial,'' said Pete Lindquist, a retired Air Force colonel
and a spokesman for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a National Park Service hearing on the project,
retired Air Force Gen. Doyle Larsen took exception to Webb's notion
of memorial site pollution. The Air Force would never show
disrespect for the Marine Corps or their memorial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force honors the memory of all 19,733 Marines who died
in World War II _ and the 52,173 combat dead of the Army Air Corps
during the same war ``deserve a similar respect,'' he said
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Even without controversy, an aspiring memorial in the nation's
capital faces a political and bureaucratic gantlet. After initial
approval by Congress and the president, the National Park Service
has a voice in site selection. Then the project must go repeatedly
before three appointed boards: the National Capital Memorial
Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the National Capital
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the Air Force Memorial also faced a lawsuit to
block the project that was filed by the Friends of Iwo Jima and
Solomon, who retired from Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Air Force has prevailed. The lawsuit was dismissed
by a federal district court, and that decision was upheld by an
appeals court. The project has passed muster in its early review by
the regulatory boards.
</P>
<P>
   Only three hurdles remain, said Lindquist.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation must raise about $10 million more to meet its
goal of $30 million to build the memorial. Then two more sets of
approvals are needed from the Commission of Fine Arts and the
National Capital Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents, meanwhile, retained the Washington law firm of
Covington &AMP; Burlington to continue the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always the possibility of congressional
intervention. Senators Pat Roberts, R-Kan., Conrad Burns, R-Mt.,
Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., and Chuck Robb, D-Va., are all Marine
veterans. However, Senators Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., served in the Air Force and support the
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a push to find common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all believe there should be an Air Force Memorial, but it
should have its own unique site,'' said retired Marine Gen. Fred
Haynes. ``There are alternate locations available, including the
ridge above the Pentagon or near the Air and Space Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the location near the Smithsonian National Air and
Space Museum has already been rejected because of size and other
complications. The other site won't be available until 2010 or
later and is really not an option, said Lindquist.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the designed memorial is ``site specific.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force hopes for final approvals in the coming months and
then a ground-breaking late next year. The memorial would then take
18 to 24 months to build, said Lindquist.
</P>
<P>
   But the phrase ``give up'' is not in the Marine vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we are going to prevail,'' said Cooper, the retired
Marine general who heads the Iwo Jima Preservation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He sends out periodic e-mail ``sitreps'' _ situation reports _
to keep his troops informed. Environmental objections have been
filed with the National Capital Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The battle will continue, he recently reported, ``until the last
shot is fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the Air Force Memorial can be viewed on the Internet
at www.airforcememorial.org.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents maintain a Web site at www.iwofriends.com.

   THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED _ Columnist
James Garcia didn't know what to expect when he attended a recent
Republican presidential debate in Tempe, Ariz. ``It seemed like a
good opportunity to catch a glimpse of the new kinder,
compassionate and more inclusive GOP in action,'' Garcia writes.
Instead, Garcia was struck by the topics not mentioned by the
candidates. For example, they failed to discuss the ``guest
worker'' program under consideration in Arizona that would allow
laborers from Mexico and elsewhere to receive temporary work visas
so they can take jobs in the United States. The candidates also
failed to address the controversy over the future of bilingual
education in the state.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT GAYS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Family-values and
religious-right advocates are in an uproar over the publication and
distribution of a 12-page booklet, ``Just the Facts About Sexual
Orientation,'' to the superintendents of nearly 15,000 school
districts nationwide. The main premise of the booklet is the simple
fact that homosexuality is neither abnormal nor a mental illness _
a fact that is endorsed by a dozen of the nation's leading
professional health, mental-health and educational organizations.
``Just the Facts'' makes a case for acceptance of, and respect for,
gay and lesbian youths. ``No wonder the right wing is in an
uproar,'' writes columnist Chuck Colbert. ```Just the Facts'
debunks misinformation about homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS COME IN ALL SHAPES, SIZES AND COLORS _
``Housewife, banker, mechanic, doctor, lawyer, merchant or Indian
chief, we all become people with special interests when the
national elections roll around,'' writes columnist Tim Giago. In
this commentary, Giago discusses the current presidential
candidates and who he thinks will get most of the Native-American
vote. ``Bradley would best serve the special interests of the
Indian people. Gore and McCain would be excellent alternatives.
However, we are still months away from Election 2000, and many
things can happen between now and then,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK ON POSSIBLE AIDS ORIGIN IN AFRICA RECALLS SYPHILIS
EXPERIMENT AT HOME. This week, columnist Vernon Jarrett takes
another look at the controversial book ``The River: A Journey to
the Source of HIV and AIDS'' (Little Brown &AMP; Co.), in which author
Edward Hooper offers his theory on how AIDS began. Jarrett believes
that the content of the book resurrects the suspicion among
darker-skinned people that in recent history they have been used as
guinea pigs for scientific research. To bolster this argument,
Jarrett cites the infamous ``Tuskegee Syphilis Study'' of 1932 in
which 623 rural, unlettered black men in Macon County, Ala., took
part in a scientific study of this sexually transmitted disease.
Two-thirds of the participants were left untreated, and
consequently many died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   IN A KIMCHEE JAR, A LESSON ABOUT LIFE. In this poignant essay
from A. Magazine, writer Hugh Son reflects on his tumultuous
relationship with his father, an immigrant from South Korea. ``When
a boy and his father look at each other, they sometimes see a
mirror reflection,'' he writes. ``The burgeoning young man sees in
the older gentleman his unchangeable past and his malleable future.
He despises and reveres his father, only as he singularly loves and
hates himself. He can see how he is growing tall and strong and new
to the world, just as his father is losing hair and becoming
thinner with years.''

   THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED _ Columnist
James Garcia didn't know what to expect when he attended a recent
Republican presidential debate in Tempe, Ariz. ``It seemed like a
good opportunity to catch a glimpse of the new kinder,
compassionate and more inclusive GOP in action,'' Garcia writes.
Instead, Garcia was struck by the topics not mentioned by the
candidates. For example, they failed to discuss the ``guest
worker'' program under consideration in Arizona that would allow
laborers from Mexico and elsewhere to receive temporary work visas
so they can take jobs in the United States. The candidates also
failed to address the controversy over the future of bilingual
education in the state.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT GAYS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Family-values and
religious-right advocates are in an uproar over the publication and
distribution of a 12-page booklet, ``Just the Facts About Sexual
Orientation,'' to the superintendents of nearly 15,000 school
districts nationwide. The main premise of the booklet is the simple
fact that homosexuality is neither abnormal nor a mental illness _
a fact that is endorsed by a dozen of the nation's leading
professional health, mental-health and educational organizations.
``Just the Facts'' makes a case for acceptance of, and respect for,
gay and lesbian youths. ``No wonder the right wing is in an
uproar,'' writes columnist Chuck Colbert. ```Just the Facts'
debunks misinformation about homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS COME IN ALL SHAPES, SIZES AND COLORS _
``Housewife, banker, mechanic, doctor, lawyer, merchant or Indian
chief, we all become people with special interests when the
national elections roll around,'' writes columnist Tim Giago. In
this commentary, Giago discusses the current presidential
candidates and who he thinks will get most of the Native-American
vote. ``Bradley would best serve the special interests of the
Indian people. Gore and McCain would be excellent alternatives.
However, we are still months away from Election 2000, and many
things can happen between now and then,'' he writes.

   BOOK ON POSSIBLE AIDS ORIGIN IN AFRICA RECALLS SYPHILIS
EXPERIMENT AT HOME. This week, columnist Vernon Jarrett takes
another look at the controversial book ``The River: A Journey to
the Source of HIV and AIDS'' (Little Brown &AMP; Co.), in which author
Edward Hooper offers his theory on how AIDS began. Jarrett believes
that the content of the book resurrects the suspicion among
darker-skinned people that in recent history they have been used as
guinea pigs for scientific research. To bolster this argument,
Jarrett cites the infamous ``Tuskegee Syphilis Study'' of 1932 in
which 623 rural, unlettered black men in Macon County, Ala., took
part in a scientific study of this sexually transmitted disease.
Two-thirds of the participants were left untreated, and
consequently many died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   IN A KIMCHEE JAR, A LESSON ABOUT LIFE. In this poignant essay
from A. Magazine, writer Hugh Son reflects on his tumultuous
relationship with his father, an immigrant from South Korea. ``When
a boy and his father look at each other, they sometimes see a
mirror reflection,'' he writes. ``The burgeoning young man sees in
the older gentleman his unchangeable past and his malleable future.
He despises and reveres his father, only as he singularly loves and
hates himself. He can see how he is growing tall and strong and new
to the world, just as his father is losing hair and becoming
thinner with years.''

 By ROSE-MARIE TURK 
 c.1999 Fairchild Publications   
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fall TV lineup is bursting at the seams with
women who are passionate about fashion and costume designers who
are meeting their needs _ not only with designer labels, vintage
looks and brand names, but with lots of sexy clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the fall shows will produce the next ``Y''
necklace, Jennifer Aniston haircut or Ally McBeal's short skirt is
still a question, but this season's offerings are still bound to
amuse viewers who focus on what the characters wear as much as on
what they say and whom they covet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the looks now popping up on the small screen are Vera
Wang and Zandra Rhodes gowns, full karate-style pants, cropped
cargo pants, Levi's L-2 line and 701 brands, trendy leathers, vinyl
and fake fur. In addition, there are Zelda velvet jackets,
Native-American pieces and over-the-top looks such as Moschino's
fur-trimmed sweaters and leopard pants.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designers say they scour both coasts, Canada and Europe
for hot looks and vintage pieces. Neiman Marcus, Betsey Johnson,
Patricia Field, Bebe, BCBG, Holt Renfrew, Decades, Wasteland, Jet
Rag, Saks Fifth Avenue, Urban Outfitters, Gucci and Diesel are
among their favorite haunts. Some costumers even design their own
clothes for their characters.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a look that will take off is less of a concern to most
costume designers than simply doing their job, which is wardrobing
their characters week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide to the fall shows, the costumes and the costume
designers' favorite shops.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Popular'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Network: WB.
</P>
<P>
   Concept: The trials and tribulations of the high school pecking
order, in which clothes _ from Jean Paul Gaultier to the Gap _ play
a prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Carol Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: With 60 to 80 changes per episode for the principals,
who include three ``wealthy girls,'' the labels include Gaultier,
Theory, Chakin &AMP; Capone, BCBG, Mooks, Banana Republic, Gap, Sold
and ``a little bit of Betsey Johnson when we want to inject that
funkiness here and there,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: Ramsey shops Madison and Curve on Robertson Boulevard,
Ambrosia in Beverly Hills, where she finds ``a lot of interesting
things from Europe,'' and Urban Outfitters ``for that high-school
funky look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Love and Money'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Network: CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Concept: Will it be love or money (and more Vera Wang) for Paget
Brewster, who plays the heiress/teacher lead in this romantic
comedy, which also features Swoosie Kurtz as her wealthy mother in
stellar threads.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Simon Tuke.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: A Vera Wang wedding gown with full tulle skirt, Ralph
Lauren and Donna Karan pants along with Laundry's ``very classic,
simple dresses'' and sweaters. Tuke, who prefers short, fitted
sweaters in soft colors, is also using Autumn Cashmere. Kurtz wears
Vera Wang, a mix of Herve Leger and St. John Knit dresses, as well
as a green velvet bias-cut Zandra Rhodes gown.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: Tuke shops Diane Merrick on Melrose Avenue, Saks Fifth
Avenue, Betsey Johnson, Neiman Marcus and features used jewelry by
Allison Schmidt of Marble Canyon Metalworks in Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Wasteland'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Network: ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Concept: A group of twentysomething friends in Manhattan face
the realities of life-and-dress after college.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Trish Summerville.

Sarah Jessica Parker's character, as well as a Donna Karan
``invisible-strap'' dress.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is what Patricia Field calls ``the bag of the year''
_ the Fendi baguette Parker carried for most of the season in many
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: The overall look for the show is ``hippie rock 'n' roll
couture. It could be a $5 shawl with a $400 pair of shoes _ a mix
of a whole range of things,'' Patricia Field noted, describing a
Parker outfit that mixes a leather halter top from a Patricia Field
store with an Alberta Feretti taffeta ballgown skirt.

   LOS ANGELES _ The fall TV lineup is bursting at the seams with
women who are passionate about fashion and costume designers who
are meeting their needs _ not only with designer labels, vintage
looks and brand names, but with lots of sexy clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the fall shows will produce the next ``Y''
necklace, Jennifer Aniston haircut or Ally McBeal's short skirt is
still a question, but this season's offerings are still bound to
amuse viewers who focus on what the characters wear as much as on
what they say and whom they covet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the looks now popping up on the small screen are Vera
Wang and Zandra Rhodes gowns, full karate-style pants, cropped
cargo pants, Levi's L-2 line and 701 brands, trendy leathers, vinyl
and fake fur. In addition, there are Zelda velvet jackets,
Native-American pieces and over-the-top looks such as Moschino's
fur-trimmed sweaters and leopard pants.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designers say they scour both coasts, Canada and Europe
for hot looks and vintage pieces. Neiman Marcus, Betsey Johnson,
Patricia Field, Bebe, BCBG, Holt Renfrew, Decades, Wasteland, Jet
Rag, Saks Fifth Avenue, Urban Outfitters, Gucci and Diesel are
among their favorite haunts. Some costumers even design their own
clothes for their characters.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a look that will take off is less of a concern to most
costume designers than simply doing their job, which is wardrobing
their characters week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide to the fall shows, the costumes and the costume
designers' favorite shops.

and ``a little bit of Betsey Johnson when we want to inject that
funkiness here and there,'' Ramsey said.
</P>

Ambrosia in Beverly Hills, where she finds ``a lot of interesting
things from Europe,'' and Urban Outfitters ``for that high-school
funky look.''

<P>
   Stores: The overall look for the show is ``hippie rock 'n' roll
couture. It could be a $5 shawl with a $400 pair of shoes _ a mix
of a whole range of things,'' Patricia Field noted, describing a
Parker outfit that mixes a leather halter top from a Patricia Field
store with an Alberta Feretti taffeta ballgown skirt.

mayor's office in New York and gets a sexy, sophisticated new look.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Patricia Field.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: Among a number of Gucci pieces for Locklear is what
Field calls a ``sharply cut'' pantsuit. There is also a Chloe silk
dress ``with a mellow print,'' as well as a range of selections
from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and Ralph Lauren. Skirts are knee-length and
the color palette includes black, white, bone and red.

   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Anthony Minghella needs a cigarette.
Actually, he's in need of a brow-smoothing, stomach-soothing tonic
strong enough to calm the nerves of an Oscar-winning director about
to unveil his Next Big Film. But he'll settle for one of the
American Spirits he's clutching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mind?'' he asks in his soft English accent, nodding
toward the roof deck of Fantasy Films, the Berkeley, Calif., studio
where the director has spent the past five months editing ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ his first film since his darkly romantic
epic, ``The English Patient,'' won Oscars for Best Picture and Best
Director three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he says, padding out to the windswept roof with
its dazzling, sun-raked view of the California hills, ``but it's
the only place where they let me smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Such consternation on the part of a director who is considered
to be, after a mere three films, a major Hollywood talent might
seem laughable or even pretentious. Especially given that ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley,'' due this holiday season, is already being
touted as an Oscar contender.
</P>
<P>
   The film, half romance, half psychological thriller, is not only
blessed with Minghella at the helm, but boasts the hippest,
handsomest, most Oscar-decorated young cast going: Matt Damon,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Jude Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, several potential blessings did fall on this project,''
says Minghella, smiling, just for a moment, behind his Armani
sunglasses before his brow furrows once again. ``But as with all
blessings, there's a curse attached. And there's an expectation of
what kind of film this will be, because it's so inflected with the
casting.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Minghella says, all those Oscars _ Best Actress for
Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love''), Best Screenplay for Damon
(``Good Will Hunting'') and a Best Actress nomination for Blanchett
(``Elizabeth'') _ happened after he'd handpicked a cast of what he
considered talented character actors rather than movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Minghella, who says his own Oscar win ``changed my life in
no ways'' (he still lives in the same Hampstead home in London with
his wife, producer and choreographer Carolyn Choa, and their two
children), is feeling the pressure that befalls a bona fide
Hollywood outsider who finds himself squinting in the limelight.
Especially when you consider that at $40 million, ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' _ a co-production from Paramount and Miramax _ is
Minghella's biggest-budget film to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as nervous as it is possible to be, because I know the
audience is not going to have an easy night in the cinema,'' he
says, trying, vainly perhaps, to deflate some of the film's
pre-opening hype.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Minghella from Patricia Highsmith's 1953 suspense
novel, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is the story of a wealthy young
playboy (Law) and his equally privileged girlfriend (Paltrow), who
are befriended during a trip through Italy by Tom Ripley (Damon), a
young American who does more than just envy his friends' lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central character is not a hero in any sense of the word.
He's a man who commits murder and isn't caught,'' Minghella
cautions. ``There are no enemies. There's not even a central
protagonist-antagonist dynamic,'' he says with resignation. ``It's
really a journey into a purgatory.''
</P>
<P>
   That Minghella can spout such aphorisms without
self-consciousness reveals much about the kind of thoughtful,
philosophic observer of human nature he is. With his close-cropped
goatee, bullet-shaped head and quiet, almost monkish demeanor,
Minghella looks like the Soprano brother who ditched the mob for a
more contemplative, scholarly life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very intense,'' says Matt Damon, who became close friends
with the director during the film's 14-week shoot last year. ``He's
also the most caring man, who has the patience of Job.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the 45-year-old director, a former playwright and
university lecturer, has never been one for convention.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Italian immigrants living on the Isle of Wight,
Minghella spent the first part of his career as an academic
teaching literature at the University of Hull. That was followed by
a decade in which he was considered one of Britain's most promising
young dramatists. (His 1985 play, ``Made in Bangkok,'' remains his
best-known work.)
</P>
<P>
   When Minghella finally stepped behind the camera in 1991 to
direct his first film, ``Truly, Madly, Deeply,'' it was, he
recalls, ``the moment when I suddenly realized what I was meant to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only had he found the perfect outlet for his intensely
visual imagination, but Minghella discovered a broader canvas on
which to explore themes that had bedeviled him since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father left Italy and came to England because he saw it as
a place of bounty and opportunity,'' says the director, whose
father still works as an ice-cream seller on Wight. ``But I grew up
on an island looking at England. When I'm in England, I feel
Italian, and when I'm in Italy, I feel English _ and I always feel
like I've got my face pressed up against the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of the outsider, so apparent in his plays and ``The
English Patient,'' was also what drew him to ``Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fixated on Ripley because I saw so many similarities (to
myself),'' says Minghella, who nonetheless seriously reworked
Highsmith's 1953 novel. He gave the film a strong injection of
glamour by updating the story by six years, to a time in Italy
known as Il Boom, when, Minghella explains, ``fashion began to
invade; when men were suddenly hanging around on Vespas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to imagine making this movie as if `La Dolce Vita' was
being shot on the next street,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Minghella brought an equally discriminating eye to casting. He
chose Damon to play the duplicitous Ripley, he says, ``because Matt
seems to be somebody you can trust, so your first instinct is to
root for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow, he adds, also plays against expectations as
Dickie's unsuspecting lover, who ages about 20 years throughout the
course of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right actor to play Dickie Greenleaf, the
Gatsby-esque American scion, proved more difficult. After looking
at several American actors, Minghella selected Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for someone who effortlessly summoned class, and
that is so much simpler for an English actor.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cate Blanchett, who actively lobbied for a role in the
film and who plays Meredith Logue, the young woman who falls for
Ripley, Minghella says, ``She's the kind of present you don't get
very often. She and Gywneth have that same long-limbed thoroughbred
quality, and to see these two big engines working together was
fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is very concerned with the beguiling surface and the
chaos that lurks beneath that, and so Italy is almost a
character,'' says Minghella, shaking his head at the memory of
struggling to shoot in crowded public places like Venice's Piazza
San Marco and the Spanish Steps in Rome. ``It's like what Edith
Wharton said: `Why would you be anywhere else when you can be in
Italy?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Italy can be very dark, very primitive,'' says the
director, sounding suddenly like a man concerned less with
Hollywood than with his own cultural past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole film plays that game between surface and reality.
It's about beauty with thorns.''

   (Judith Shulevitz is New York editor of Slate)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's Choice,'' Gail Sheehy's latest study of political
character, confirms her status as America's leading village
explainer--which, as Gertrude Stein once pointed out, ``is fine if
you're a village. If not, not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy is the journalist turned self-anointed psychologist who
transformed the scary-sounding ``crises'' of academic
adult-development theory (such as the mid-life crisis) into the
user-friendly ``Passages,'' the name of her 1976 megabestseller.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's diagnosis of the first lady-slash-senatorial candidate
has the compelling obviousness of good local gossip, though with
the upbeat ending you'd expect from an author whose message has
consistently been, ``The more intense the suffering, the better the
chance to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, according to Sheehy, became the brilliant and driven
woman she is today out of a desire to avoid becoming her mother, a
withdrawn and frustrated housewife.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary's emotional life was stunted by an unloving,
unavailable father who didn't even attend his own daughter's
college graduation. His lack of supportiveness left her susceptible
to the needy, seductive Bill Clinton, which led her to abandon her
political dreams and take up his, which made her resentful, which
caused her to push him even harder than his own, considerable
ambitions were already doing, whereupon he self-destructed, which
left them both in a horrible mess, from which she has emerged in
her early 50s a new woman, ready to break out of her chrysalis and
fly.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very American story, much more so than that of Daisy
Buchanan, to whom Hillary has also been compared. Sheehy's faith in
change and redemption reflects an Oprah-esque optimism about human
malleability, whereas F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrait of an egotist
whose selfishness wrecks her life and the lives of everyone around
her reeks of dourness.
</P>
<P>
   That the newly hatched butterfly that is Hillary's psyche seems
to be fluttering straight into the flames of New York State
politics and Rudolph Giuliani's popularity does not conform to
Sheehy's triumphalist narrative, so although she discusses what
Hillary's candidacy means to Hillary, Sheehy doesn't give us a
single outside perspective on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy is a therapist to the stars, not a political reporter.
She tells us how our leaders feel, not what they stand for or what
might become of them or even what we should think about the things
they do.
</P>
<P>
   The way we talk about the character of leaders has come a long
way since Leo Tolstoy railed against Macaulay's great-man theory of
history 130 years ago in ``War and Peace'': ``To study the laws of
history, we must entirely change the subject of our observation,
must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the
common, infinitesimally small elements that influence the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, history has been through a host of
determinisms--economic, demographic, biological, geographic, even
meteorological--each meant to relegate the individual psychology of
great men to the realm of the contingent. Sheehy's innovation is to
boldly cast all of that aside and bring us back to the pre-Tolstoy
era. For her, the national stage exists as nothing more nor less
than a setting for grand personalities.
</P>
<P>
   So closely does Sheehy follow Macaulay, in fact, that the only
thing that matters to her is personality; she doesn't give a damn
about the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Sheehy is like listening to a botany professor describe
the inner life of plants. What she extracts from the public figures
in whose private selves she traffics is how well they adhere to the
rules of growth--preferably the ones she has sketched out.
(Sheehy's key works in this regard are ``Passages,'' which deals
with life up until one's 50s; ``The Silent Passage'' (1991), about
menopause; ``New Passages'' (1995), about the second adulthood that
begins in one's 50s; and ``Understanding Men's Passages'' (1998),
about male menopause.)
</P>
<P>
   When she writes in ``Character,'' her 1988 study of the
political temperament, that Michael Dukakis learned from his defeat
for re-election as governor of Massachussetts to demonstrate some
warmth, that's good. Ronald Reagan has never transcended the
patterns of denial common to the children of alcoholics, and that,
she pronounces, is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how Dukakis's and Reagan's psychological
idiosyncracies may have changed the nature of presidential
campaigning, the presidency, or the country. To Sheehy, Dukakis and
Reagan and Hillary Clinton are case studies, just like the ones
laid out in ``Passages'': Rosalyn, the Jewish-American princess and
wife who had to flee to Marin County to find herself; Mia, who
enslaved herself to a saintly philosopher and had to divorce him to
find herself; Donald Babcock, the Hotchkiss and Yale graduate who
unconsciously emulated his father in everything he did, and who,
Sheehy implied, had damn well better go through a crisis in order
to find himself, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Each story she tells is a cautionary tale with the exact same
moral: You have to pass through the stages of adult development or
wither and die.
</P>
<P>
   What are these stages to which Sheehy claims we are all subject,
regardless of class, race, or creed? Each has its own clever
nickname--the Trying Twenties, the Catch Thirties, the Forlorn
Forties--and archetypal member: the Transient, the Wunderkind, the
Caregiver, the Nurturer Who Defers Caregiving, the Caregiver Who
Defers Nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, says Sheehy, is not to skip a step: ``One
cannot jump from A to C, and the only path to D is through engaging
the tasks of C; there are no alternative routes.'' It's not as if
these steps are unusual or bizarre; on the contrary, they're
soothingly familiar. At one point, you're supposed to break away
from one's parents and find one's own way. At another, you have to
commit to a ``lifework'' or risk drifting into stasis.
</P>
<P>
   All this is so anodyne as to be completely unobjectionable. If
you believe that personality trumps everything else, you might as
well have an idea about how it works, no matter how banal. The
disturbing part is that Sheehy uses her theories not just to
explain decisions that have proved historically momentous, but to
explain them away.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Passages,'' for instance, Panther co-founder Eldridge
Cleaver's role in the black nationalist movement is perceived as
nothing more than an example of one man's difficulty making a
necessary passage:
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken to the extreme,'' she writes, ``the unwillingness to
commit leaves no quarter for expression of the merger self. If no
school, organization, or love match can be trusted (or if, as in
the case of Eldridge Cleaver, the only way the individual sees fit
to redress the wrongs of society is to smash it or choose exile
from it), the path leads to isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Banished in those two sentences is the entire world outside
Cleaver's pushing, expanding, developing self--any racism and
poverty he may have endured, the ideas that inflamed him, the time
in which he lived. Sheehy claims he became a revolutionary because
he failed to grow properly, like a vine that has unhealthily
abandoned its stick.
</P>
<P>
   That's the strangest thing about Sheehy's model of development:
The self comes off as organic, context-less, and amoral, judged
only in reference to the imperative to grow. Is Hillary's decision
to run for the Senate while still first lady good for anyone but
her? Is it an opportunity to expand the oppressive limits of
political wifery, or is it an abuse of her power? Should New York
be glad or sad that she might become its next senator? About all
this Sheehy has nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to get up on one's high horse and declare this a
wrongheaded way to approach politicians, whose actions have an
impact on the rest of us too. But that would be like denouncing the
weather, because Sheehy's view is now the journalistic norm. (These
days, any effort to arrive at a deeper understanding of a candidate
is referred to as ``the Sheehy treatment.'')
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether and how a politician has grown in his or
her adult years has become the master narrative of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Consider George Bush, who is more or less running on a record of
turning his life around after having done nothing until he was 40.
Or Al Gore, who never stops rediscovering yet another inner child.
</P>
<P>
   Has Bush changed in a way that makes him better suited to
govern? Do we really like Al Gore's latest reincarnation? Who
knows? Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's Hillary longs to be given the same free pass--to have
hers be yet another uplifting tale of growth in the face of
personal suffering. Will New Yorkers buy it?

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's Choice,'' Gail Sheehy's latest study of political
character, confirms her status as America's leading village
explainer--which, as Gertrude Stein once pointed out, ``is fine if
you're a village. If not, not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy is the journalist turned self-anointed psychologist who
transformed the scary-sounding ``crises'' of academic
adult-development theory (such as the mid-life crisis) into the
user-friendly ``Passages,'' the name of her 1976 megabestseller.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's diagnosis of the first lady-slash-senatorial candidate
has the compelling obviousness of good local gossip, though with
the upbeat ending you'd expect from an author whose message has
consistently been, ``The more intense the suffering, the better the
chance to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, according to Sheehy, became the brilliant and driven
woman she is today out of a desire to avoid becoming her mother, a
withdrawn and frustrated housewife.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary's emotional life was stunted by an unloving,
unavailable father who didn't even attend his own daughter's
college graduation. His lack of supportiveness left her susceptible
to the needy, seductive Bill Clinton, which led her to abandon her
political dreams and take up his, which made her resentful, which
caused her to push him even harder than his own, considerable
ambitions were already doing, whereupon he self-destructed, which
left them both in a horrible mess, from which she has emerged in
her early 50s a new woman, ready to break out of her chrysalis and
fly.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very American story, much more so than that of Daisy
Buchanan, to whom Hillary has also been compared. Sheehy's faith in
change and redemption reflects an Oprah-esque optimism about human
malleability, whereas F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrait of an egotist
whose selfishness wrecks her life and the lives of everyone around
her reeks of dourness.
</P>
<P>
   That the newly hatched butterfly that is Hillary's psyche seems
to be fluttering straight into the flames of New York State
politics and Rudolph Giuliani's popularity does not conform to
Sheehy's triumphalist narrative, so although she discusses what
Hillary's candidacy means to Hillary, Sheehy doesn't give us a
single outside perspective on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy is a therapist to the stars, not a political reporter.
She tells us how our leaders feel, not what they stand for or what
might become of them or even what we should think about the things
they do.
</P>
<P>
   The way we talk about the character of leaders has come a long
way since Leo Tolstoy railed against Macaulay's great-man theory of
history 130 years ago in ``War and Peace'': ``To study the laws of
history, we must entirely change the subject of our observation,
must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the
common, infinitesimally small elements that influence the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, history has been through a host of
determinisms--economic, demographic, biological, geographic, even
meteorological--each meant to relegate the individual psychology of
great men to the realm of the contingent. Sheehy's innovation is to
boldly cast all of that aside and bring us back to the pre-Tolstoy
era. For her, the national stage exists as nothing more nor less
than a setting for grand personalities.
</P>
<P>
   So closely does Sheehy follow Macaulay, in fact, that the only
thing that matters to her is personality; she doesn't give a damn
about the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Sheehy is like listening to a botany professor describe
the inner life of plants. What she extracts from the public figures
in whose private selves she traffics is how well they adhere to the
rules of growth--preferably the ones she has sketched out.
(Sheehy's key works in this regard are ``Passages,'' which deals
with life up until one's 50s; ``The Silent Passage'' (1991), about
menopause; ``New Passages'' (1995), about the second adulthood that
begins in one's 50s; and ``Understanding Men's Passages'' (1998),
about male menopause.)
</P>
<P>
   When she writes in ``Character,'' her 1988 study of the
political temperament, that Michael Dukakis learned from his defeat
for re-election as governor of Massachussetts to demonstrate some
warmth, that's good. Ronald Reagan has never transcended the
patterns of denial common to the children of alcoholics, and that,
she pronounces, is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how Dukakis's and Reagan's psychological
idiosyncracies may have changed the nature of presidential
campaigning, the presidency, or the country. To Sheehy, Dukakis and
Reagan and Hillary Clinton are case studies, just like the ones
laid out in ``Passages'': Rosalyn, the Jewish-American princess and
wife who had to flee to Marin County to find herself; Mia, who
enslaved herself to a saintly philosopher and had to divorce him to
find herself; Donald Babcock, the Hotchkiss and Yale graduate who
unconsciously emulated his father in everything he did, and who,
Sheehy implied, had damn well better go through a crisis in order
to find himself, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Each story she tells is a cautionary tale with the exact same
moral: You have to pass through the stages of adult development or
wither and die.
</P>
<P>
   What are these stages to which Sheehy claims we are all subject,
regardless of class, race, or creed? Each has its own clever
nickname--the Trying Twenties, the Catch Thirties, the Forlorn
Forties--and archetypal member: the Transient, the Wunderkind, the
Caregiver, the Nurturer Who Defers Caregiving, the Caregiver Who
Defers Nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, says Sheehy, is not to skip a step: ``One
cannot jump from A to C, and the only path to D is through engaging
the tasks of C; there are no alternative routes.'' It's not as if
these steps are unusual or bizarre; on the contrary, they're
soothingly familiar. At one point, you're supposed to break away
from one's parents and find one's own way. At another, you have to
commit to a ``lifework'' or risk drifting into stasis.
</P>
<P>
   All this is so anodyne as to be completely unobjectionable. If
you believe that personality trumps everything else, you might as
well have an idea about how it works, no matter how banal. The
disturbing part is that Sheehy uses her theories not just to
explain decisions that have proved historically momentous, but to
explain them away.

from it), the path leads to isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Banished in those two sentences is the entire world outside

poverty he may have endured, the ideas that inflamed him, the time
in which he lived. Sheehy claims he became a revolutionary because
he failed to grow properly, like a vine that has unhealthily

the 1960s counterculture.)

   &UR; By MARK OPPENHEIMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When University of Chicago researchers set out to discover which
religious denominations have the best sex, they learned that the
faithful don't do all their shouting in church.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Protestant women, their 1994 survey found, report
by far the most orgasms: Thirty-two percent say they achieve orgasm
every time they make love. Mainline Protestants and Catholics
lagged five points behind. Those with no religious affiliation were
at 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unitarians may not wish to read any further.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world--those twice-born
PTA moms--doing in bed that the agnostics and unbelievers are not?
Education may explain some of their sexual satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   But they also may be getting better sex advice. Thanks to
evangelism's surge during the past quarter-century, America is in a
golden age for Christian sex manuals. Evangelicals may not want
their children to study sex ed in school, but they are not afraid
of studying a little sex ed in their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Christian sex advice business dates to 1973, when the
evangelical Marabel Morgan achieved brief notoriety for ``The Total
Woman.'' Morgan famously suggested that wives spice up their
marriage by greeting their husbands at the door wearing nothing but
Saran Wrap--a seduction attempted with sad consequences for Kathy
Bates in the movie ``Fried Green Tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dobson, founder of the evangelical group Focus on the
Family, published a sex-and-marriage book in 1975. Best-selling
Christian authors Tim and Beverly LaHaye followed in 1976 (also the
year of Helen Wessel's ``The Joy of Natural Childbirth,'' which
taught Lamaze from a Christian perspective). Scores of books have
followed, selling millions of copies.
</P>
<P>
   While the Marabel Morgan book aimed chiefly to comfort and
instruct the wife on holding the attention of her husband--implying
without subtlety that any sexual problems were her fault--later
writers have expanded the boundaries of the field, which is now
marketed as ``family counseling,'' a category that includes
child-rearing, lovemaking, marital relations and, of course, sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the genre has even subdivided into niche markets. Teens
can buy ``I Kissed Dating Goodbye,'' by Joshua Harris, which
counsels against early sexual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Johnson's ``Single Life: Being Your Best for God as He
Prepares His Best for You'' assures black women that their single
status, which demographics may brutally enforce, can be ``a
celebration rather than a burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous books target gays for ``recovery,'' including ``Coming
Out of Homosexuality,'' by Bob Davies, dean of the ex-gay
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Sex-and-marriage guides are the best sellers of the genre, and
Tim LaHaye has emerged as its Alex Comfort. If you're a Christian
who wants to go forth and multiply, he's your guide. Lately on the
best-seller lists for the six apocalyptic novels in his ``Left
Behind'' series, which have sold nearly 10 million copies, LaHaye
has long been a household name among fundamentalists for his works
on sexual and family life. His most famous book, the wonderfully
titled ``How To Be Happy Though Married,'' hearkens back to another
era, in ways both quaint and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye rehashes all the conventional ideas about male and female
sexuality. For example, he perpetuates the Freudian myth about
vaginal vs. clitoral orgasms, and he views male sexuality as
essentially dangerous. ``The sex drive in a man is almost volcanic
in its latent ability to erupt at the slightest provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Men are stimulated by sight, says LaHaye, women by words and
touch. In the LaHaye scheme, the New Testament is a sexual guide.
Matthew 5:28, for instance, says, ``But I say unto you, that
whosoever look unto a woman to lust after her hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jesus made no such statement about women because most women
do not look at men with lust. Thus man ``should be the initiator
because of (his) stronger sex drive,'' while ``the role of the
woman is to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye's books have their share of quackery and pseudoscience,
but that does not preclude some genuinely wise counsel to
lovers--especially inexperienced ones. He is wonderfully clear and
clinical about the mechanics of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Here is part of his description of female sexual arousal, for
example: ``When a woman is sexually aroused, several of her glands
begin to secrete a lubrication that bathes the vulva area with a
slippery mucous, easing the entrance of the penis into the
vagina.'' For young marrieds who have grown up shielded from the
universal sex talk of the secular world, these details are surely
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notable quality of the Christian sex business
is that it is evangelical, not puritanical. It is very pro-sex--as
long as sex takes place in the context of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Gaye Wheat, authors of ``Intended for Pleasure: Sex
Technique and Sexual Fulfillment'' in Christian Marriage, may
curiously advise ``taking an acid or alkaline douche just before
intercourse'' to select the sex of one's baby (they don't say which
douche is for which sex), but their overall tone is both practical
and sensual.
</P>
<P>
   They note that lubricant works best if you first ``warm the K-Y
Jelly by holding the tube in warm, running water.'' They advise
that newlyweds should ``not get a TV set for at least one year''
and that ``every master bedroom needs a good lock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wheats and LaHaye offer finely wrought anatomical diagrams,
exhortations to married couples to communicate, reminders to
``observe daily hygiene habits,'' and constant refrains about
making sure to satisfy your partner. Bob Davies allows that
masturbation is biblically permissible. The Wheats condemn oral sex
and vibrators only because they might be too fun, thus souring
couples on intercourse. The writers do not invoke the language of
sin.
</P>
<P>
   Christian sex counselors are most alienating to worldly
audiences when they talk about masculinity and homosexuality. They
are obsessed with manliness and have a narrow idea of what that
means.
</P>
<P>
   Self-styled natural law theologian Anthony Moccia writes in
``Happily Ever After: How To Stay Married and Be Happy Too!'' that
``a husband has more of a chance to keep his marriage together if
he is rough and abusive but assertive than if he is kind and
considerate but submissive.'' Moccia's greatest professional
qualification, according to the jacket flap, is an appearance on
the Morton Downey Jr. Show.
</P>
<P>
   Moccia's tone is atypically harsh, but his message is shared by
other counselors. Noted preacher T.D. Jakes, who presides over a
Dallas-based empire of books, tapes, and TV shows, wants to
``heal'' not just homosexuals, but all ``men who are feminine in
their mannerisms.''
</P>
<P>
   These Christian sex writers contend unequivocally that gays can
simply turn straight through faith and willpower. They generally
describe gays with crude stereotypes. ``In What Everyone Should
Know About Homosexuality,'' LaHaye employs Galen's theory of the
four humors to help explain gayness. ``It has been my
observation,'' LaHaye writes, ``that most homosexuals reflect a
high degree of Melancholy temperament''--``sensitive, artistic,
gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian love doctors believe, against all evidence, that
teen-agers can squelch their hormones and homosexuals their
essences. Still, for the tens of millions of married couples who
just need a little cheerleading--or a detailed diagram--their books
may literally be a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye's advice, from the most florid talk of ``eruptive'' and
``electrifying'' touches to his prim injunction to ``refrain from
the use of back-alley words'' during coitus, won't please
everybody. But with more than 2 million copies sold, he's one
evangelist who is spreading the good news.

   Here is part of his description of female sexual arousal, for
example: ``When a woman is sexually aroused, several of her glands
begin to secrete a lubrication that bathes the vulva area with a
slippery mucous, easing the entrance of the penis into the
vagina.'' For young marrieds who have grown up shielded from the
universal sex talk of the secular world, these details are surely
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notable quality of the Christian sex business
is that it is evangelical, not puritanical. It is very pro-sex--as
long as sex takes place in the context of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Gaye Wheat, authors of ``Intended for Pleasure: Sex
Technique and Sexual Fulfillment'' in Christian Marriage, may
curiously advise ``taking an acid or alkaline douche just before
intercourse'' to select the sex of one's baby (they don't say which
douche is for which sex), but their overall tone is both practical
and sensual.
</P>
<P>
   They note that lubricant works best if you first ``warm the K-Y
Jelly by holding the tube in warm, running water.'' They advise
that newlyweds should ``not get a TV set for at least one year''
and that ``every master bedroom needs a good lock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wheats and LaHaye offer finely wrought anatomical diagrams,
exhortations to married couples to communicate, reminders to
``observe daily hygiene habits,'' and constant refrains about
making sure to satisfy your partner. Bob Davies allows that
masturbation is biblically permissible. The Wheats condemn oral sex
and vibrators only because they might be too fun, thus souring
couples on intercourse. The writers do not invoke the language of
sin.
</P>
<P>
   Christian sex counselors are most alienating to worldly
audiences when they talk about masculinity and homosexuality. They
are obsessed with manliness and have a narrow idea of what that
means.
</P>
<P>
   Self-styled natural law theologian Anthony Moccia writes in
``Happily Ever After: How To Stay Married and Be Happy Too!'' that
``a husband has more of a chance to keep his marriage together if
he is rough and abusive but assertive than if he is kind and
considerate but submissive.'' Moccia's greatest professional
qualification, according to the jacket flap, is an appearance on
the Morton Downey Jr. Show.
</P>
<P>
   Moccia's tone is atypically harsh, but his message is shared by
other counselors. Noted preacher T.D. Jakes, who presides over a
Dallas-based empire of books, tapes, and TV shows, wants to
``heal'' not just homosexuals, but all ``men who are feminine in
their mannerisms.''
</P>
<P>
   These Christian sex writers contend unequivocally that gays can
simply turn straight through faith and willpower. They generally
describe gays with crude stereotypes. ``In What Everyone Should
Know About Homosexuality,'' LaHaye employs Galen's theory of the
four humors to help explain gayness. ``It has been my
observation,'' LaHaye writes, ``that most homosexuals reflect a
high degree of Melancholy temperament''--``sensitive, artistic,
gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian love doctors believe, against all evidence, that
teen-agers can squelch their hormones and homosexuals their
essences. Still, for the tens of millions of married couples who
just need a little cheerleading--or a detailed diagram--their books
may literally be a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye's advice, from the most florid talk of ``eruptive'' and
``electrifying'' touches to his prim injunction to ``refrain from
the use of back-alley words'' during coitus, won't please
everybody. But with more than 2 million copies sold, he's one
evangelist who is spreading the good news.

TOUGH STANCE BY CHRETIEN COULD STIR SEPARATISTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   QUEBEC CITY _ Five years ago, Canada seemed a country about to
rip itself apart.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of
Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging
Canada into its darkest political hour in decades.
</P>
<P>
   And when Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard, vowed that within a
few years Quebecers would vote to break away from the nine other
provinces, no one could dismiss the vision. The drive to create a
French republic north of New England seemed all but irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Quebec's separatist movement lies in tatters. Not dead,
certainly, but in disarray. There seems little possibility Bouchard
will risk humiliation by calling for another independence vote next
year, as he had pledged.
</P>
<P>
   But if the separatist cause suddenly bounces back _ and that
also remains a possibility in this most unpredictable of provinces
where French language, customs, and civil law reign supreme _
federalist folly will be mostly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Recent days have seen officials in Ottawa, Canada's capital,
insistent on wagging the red Maple Leaf in the face of the Quebec
bull. And that's always risky.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers warn that a new ``tough love'' campaign by
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a French Quebecer deeply
opposed to separatism, represents a monumental political blunder _
one that risks giving Bouchard and his secessionist supporters the
lift they need.
</P>
<P>
   Even the usual Quebec-baiting voices of English Canada are
cautioning Chretien against imposing a law that would spell out,
for the first time, the conditions under which Quebec would be
allowed to quit Canada's 133-year-old confederation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why get tough with Quebec now?'' asked the Toronto Star in an
editorial. ``Bouchard's demoralized troops crave nothing more than
a move that could rekindle nationalist passions.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's efforts _ which have divided his Cabinet, with some
ministers quietly warning that the current course makes no
political sense _ have mostly succeeded in appalling Quebecers of
all ideological stripes. Only Bouchard's separatists seemed to
relish the prospect of renewed confrontation, with the fiery
premier railing against ``attacks on Quebec democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, Chretien's determination to impose strict ``rules
of secession'' might seem sensible enough, a worthy precaution
against the day when Quebec might rise again. But French Quebecers,
even ardent federalists, have bridled at any suggestion that the
rest of Canada deserves a say over their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I don't like separatists; I'm OK in Canada,'' said
Denis Cote, a lawyer in the southwestern Quebec city of Hull. ``But
I also think Canada has no damn business setting rules for Quebec.
Whether to stay or go should be our decision, and ours alone. Every
Quebecer feels that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's sudden determination to formalize the rules of
divorce seem especially strange given that the Quebec-Canada
marriage seems stronger than it has in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, Quebec's largest city and its economic engine _ and
the only center with a large population of English speakers _
businesses and professionals are no longer fleeing in droves to
Ontario to escape political uncertainty. The language laws so
despised by anglophones are being less rigorously applied,
high-tech sectors are booming, and relations between French and
English are noticeably friendlier and more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Into this new bonhomie wades Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is my business, sir, and it's the future of Canada we
are dealing with,'' the prime minister snapped during a recent news
conference, vexed by reporters who questioned Ottawa's timing.
``This has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard characterized Ottawa's hard line as a ``brutal and
demented attack,'' and said his province does not need the
permission of anyone except its voters to break away.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a `Yes' vote, . . . the doors will be wide open to a
unilateral declaration of independence,'' he told reporters, barely
concealing his glee that journalists were again asking about
Quebec's future.
</P>
<P>
   For Canada is getting tough on Quebec just as polls show the
sovereignty movement going nowhere. A survey released last month
found 41 percent of Quebecers would vote ``Yes'' in a vote on
separation. That's a long way from the ``winning conditions'' that
Bouchard has said must exist before he will call for another
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the decline of support for separatism is
difficult to pinpoint. There has been no scandal, Bouchard remains
a basically popular figure, and French Quebecers, according to
polls, feel as distant from the rest of Canada as ever and still
want some sort of new deal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, familiarity with Bouchard and his governing
Parti Quebecois has bred a certain cynicism, if not contempt. Right
now, Quebecers are steamed at hospital closures, slashed school
spending, public service strikes, and an economy that is lagging
behind that of other parts of Canada. Quebec is the country's
second most populous province, after Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are unhappy with the basic services that the government
is supposed to provide them, whether it's health care, education,
job training,'' said political analyst Jean-Marc Leger of the
Quebec polling firm Groupe Leger &AMP; Leger. ``You can't be trying to
talk sovereignty when people aren't happy with the basic
services.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the separatist Parti Quebecois regained control of
Quebec's National Assembly, the provincial Legislature, after more
than a decade on the political sidelines, Quebecers were bitter
about Canada's refusal to grant the province special political
status as a ``distinct society'' under an amended federal
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, no one talks much about ``distinct society''
and the Parti Quebecois seems just another political party _ one
that has done an adequate job of running Quebec, but not much more
_ while Bouchard, although still respected and personally popular,
increasingly seems just another Quebec premier, not the
larger-than-life personification of heady nationalist dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you govern, you hurt yourself,'' said Alain Gagnon,
director of the Quebec studies program at Montreal's McGill
University.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say separatist fortunes could revive if Canada
is perceived as trying to bully Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   What Chretien is seeking is a federal law that would not forbid
Quebec or any other province from seceding, but would lay down
formal rules, including that the process take place ``in
consultation'' with the rest of Canada and only after a vote in
which a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers choose independence. These
seem risky demands, but federal hard-liners are adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop being inhibited by the dual fear of backlash and
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said Stephane Dion, a Cabinet minister
and point man for the tougher line on Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has refused to specify what it means by a
``clear majority,'' although the National Post newspaper, quoting
unnamed Chretien government sources, reported recently that Ottawa
would not accept Quebec's secession unless the separatists win 60
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard calls this hypocrisy, noting that in 1949 Newfoundland
was able to quit the United Kingdom and join Canada with a simple
majority vote of 50 percent plus one vote. The big difference was
Canada and Britain wanted Newfoundland to switch allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule has always been 50 percent plus one; that's
democracy,'' Bouchard said. ``Making it any different means a
federalist vote counts for more than a separatist vote. That's the
sort of rule Ottawa wants.''

   &UR; By JAMES SUROWIECKI &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the greatest comeback in business history, but the
re-ascendance of OPEC is certainly one of the more surprising
turnarounds in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Back in March, the benchmark price of West Texas Intermediate
crude oil was $13 a barrel, and it seemed to be a foregone
conclusion that the ability of the world's key oil-producing
nations to keep prices high had forever vanished. The combination
of new oil-discovery and oil-recovery technology with the advent of
the spot futures market in oil had this observer convinced that
OPEC's glory days were long gone.
</P>
<P>
   So why have oil prices doubled, with consumption actually
outpacing production, and the OPEC nations holding firm?
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer is that no one ever suggested that
transformations in the oil industry were going to have the effect
of repealing the laws of supply and demand. Oil prices have doubled
because the global economy has made a powerful recovery in the past
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy has grown faster than it did in 1998, Europe is
now humming along nicely, Japan has crawled out of recession (at
least for the moment), and much of Asia is now moving again. Some
predictions call for Korea, for instance, to grow at 12 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since oil prices are prospective, the markets do not anticipate
a global slowdown any time soon. And the more oil consumers want,
the more expensive it will become.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, more oil becomes available, either through
expanded production by the leading oil-producing nations or
expanded exploitation of existing reserves by the giant oil
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where the ``foregone conclusion'' looks a little less
foregone, primarily because both OPEC and non-member countries,
such as Mexico and Norway, have shown restraint in the face of
rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The history of OPEC, at least since the mid-1980s, has been one
of massive cheating on the part of its members, who have regularly
violated their production quotas in order to reap as much profit as
possible. That, of course, has sent prices tumbling. At the same
time, OPEC has had an impossible time dealing with its non-member
competitors, who were prone to flood the market at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have also stayed high because the major oil companies,
having been burned in the past, have been temperate in expanding
their exploration and production budgets. Although most of the
majors will do more capital spending in 2000 and 2001 than they did
last year, their annual budgets for the next couple of years will
probably not equal what they were as recently as 1996. That's what
a few of years of $13-a-barrel prices will do for you.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's another way to look at the relatively tempered
way the oil giants are expanding those budgets, and that is that
they do not see prices going, as some have suggested, to $35 a
barrel. In fact, the oil companies appear to be planning on prices
between $20 and $25 a barrel, which would mean that while filling
up your tank is going to be more expensive than it was nine months
ago, any inflationary impact from oil prices will be seriously
muted.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that the oil companies are right. But
there's an excellent chance that they are, because the structural
transformations in the world oil market are real, and so too is the
fact that running a cartel has not gotten any easier in the past
couple of years. Price-fixing cartels can work quite well in the
short term. But over the long run the incentive to cheat is simply
too high, and the measures of coercion and punishment simply too
weak, to keep everyone in line.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the memories of what low oil prices were like are
probably strong enough to keep Venezuela, for instance, from
pumping oil as fast as it can. But memories fade, and cash in the
bank can sometimes look like forever.

FOR TWO AFRICAN COUNTRIES, DEMOCRACY COMES HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ To the west lies Namibia: arid, scrubby,
battered by cold Atlantic swells. To the east is Mozambique:
fertile as Eden, teased by the warm lapping tides of the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   There was little suspense to the elections held over the past
several days in these two countries along Africa's southern rim,
the last African ballots in a century that brought this continent
great despair. Few doubt that the incumbents will be back at work
when all the votes are counted.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the similarity in the voting ends, and behind
the results lies a parable of Africa's progress on the eve of what
South African President Thabo Mbeki hopes will be ``the African
century.'' For while the continent has made great strides in the
past decade, shedding such scourges as apartheid and Zaire's
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, the elections in Namibia and
Mozambique, as divergent as the two countries' terrain, reflect the
critical struggle in Africa between domination and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is holding in Namibia is the old nationalist model,'' in
which the liberating or ruling party ``is the custodian of the
nation, and anyone who disagrees is unpatriotic,'' said Mahmood
Mamdani, a specialist on Africa at Columbia University in New York.
``That model cracked in Mozambique. The ruling party was forced to
recognize its opponent. Mozambique is way ahead politically as a
pointer in how to deal with tensions in a postnationalist
society.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the elections _ Namibia's third, Mozambique's
second _ are benchmarks of the continent's progress. Ten years ago
Africa was torn apart by Cold War rivalry, Mobutu, and white-ruled
South Africa's regional war to preserve apartheid. Mozambique, like
Angola, another former Portuguese colony, was mired in a brutal,
decades-old war. Nelson Mandela was still in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Namibia is celebrating a decade of independence. South
Africa has majority rule. Nigeria has a civilian leader for the
first time in 20 years. Mozambique is peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But the past 10 years were as bloody as they were transforming.
Ethiopia and Eritrea stopped fighting, and then started again.
Sudan's civil war never ceased. Liberia and Sierra Leone imploded.
More than 10,000 South Africans died in the final flames of
apartheid. Hutu killed roughly 800,000 Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994. An
international military coalition drove Mobutu out of Zaire in 1997,
and a year later the renamed Congo became a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have cease-fires and elections forged democracies in Africa.
Angola emerged from decades of civil war in 1992, brokered a peace
pact, held elections, and descended back into chaos when the losers
returned to the bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 20th century, the positive changes of the past
decade have encouraged prominent leaders on the continent to talk
about an African renaissance. They want debt relief, an end to
Northern dominance in the United Nations, and greater cooperation
among developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other two events, however, the elections
in Namibia and Mozambique illustrate that African nations,
individually and collectively, hold the key to their own success or
failure. The voting in both countries will be deemed substantially
fair, and polling stations were generally free of the intimidating
presence of police and military.
</P>
<P>
   But Namibia and Mozambique approached their elections from
decidedly different angles.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining independence in 1989 after a long and arduous liberation
struggle with South Africa, Namibia at first showed encouraging
signs. It encouraged the growth of civil society and strove for
fair and good governance. The trend did not last. President Sam
Nujoma and his former liberation movement, the South-West Africa
People's Organization, held a monopoly on power. By their second
term in power, priorities changed.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the average person would be unable to afford
$1.40 test for the AIDS virus, members of parliament rushed through
a bill prior to the election granting themselves huge retirement
packages, whether or not they leave office. Earlier this year,
Nujoma spurred constitutional changes allowing him to seek a third
term, and persuaded the legislature to fund a large new home for
himself. The party used government letterhead for its campaign
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia's is a well-trod path in Africa. Liberation movements
become ruling parties, start off well-meaning, but veer without the
checks and balances of political opposition. In the 1960s there was
Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia. By the 1980s
there was Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
Unsatisfied with 19 years in power, Mugabe is rewriting Zimbabwe's
Constitution to allow him to rule until 2014.
</P>
<P>
   Some now worry that South Africa, ruled by the unrivaled African
National Congress, could go the same way as Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postcolonial state is the legacy of the subjugation of
Africa by other continents,'' said Makau Mutua, a law professor at
the State University of New York at Buffalo. ``Liberation
movements, riding the emotion of independence, delegitimize
opposition to their rule. It is an open question whether these
states can cohere into viable entities, and whether democracy is
the device that will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique may provide the answer. It fell quickly into war
after independence in 1975. The Soviets backed the Marxist
government. The United States and South Africa, each serving its
own ends, built up a rebel movement. By the time the war ended in
1992, the country was devastated, ranking as the poorest nation on
Earth, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mozambique is an African success story. The economy, though
still modest, has doubled in size since 1992, growing at 7.4
percent each of the last three years. Privatization is well
underway and the budget deficit has been cut to 7 percent of gross
domestic product since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The end of apartheid in South Africa has had a huge impact. Once
bent on destroying Mozambique, Pretoria is now an important
development partner. The road linking Maputo harbor to South
Africa's industrial heartland around Johannesburg is under
reconstruction. So is Maputo, Mozambique's capital and major port.
And South Africa is also one of the main partners in the
construction of a new $1.34 billion aluminum smelter outside
Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign aid would not be pouring into Mozambique at the rate
of $1 billion annually, nor would foreign investment have risen 70
percent since 1993, without political stability. With neither side
able to win control of the country on the battlefield, Mozambique's
warring parties agreed in 1992 to coexist. In the first democratic
elections in 1994, the former rebel movement, Renamo, won 112 out
of 250 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is a bigger test than 1994,'' said Obede Baloi,
a sociologist at Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo. ``If the
vote goes well, we're back to normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the accommodation has held. Both sides campaigned freely
and openly ahead of the weekend election and vowed to honor the
result. The government allowed a third day of voting Sunday to
ensure the elections reached remote rural villages. Power may
split: President Joaquim Chissano is expected to retain his job,
but Renamo may gain a slight majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On a continent long abused by strongmen and their parties, that
might be the best possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to Mozambique is wise leadership,'' said James Coates,
head of the World Bank in Maputo. ``The depth and severity of the
war has showed people the alternative to democracy. The
negotiations for peace were for real, and the party in power opened
itself to the idea of competition from other parties. Trust has
been developed.''

OLD DISCONTENT REACHES HIGH HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's Battle in Seattle may have surprised the World Trade
Organization and the high priests of US foreign policy, but the
demonstrations and violence that turned the Emerald City into an
armed camp reflect frustrations years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   For the last half decade, the discontent with America's trade
policy has been masked by a strong economy and a basic consensus
among major presidential aspirants about the overall value of free
and untrammeled trade.
</P>
<P>
   But as unions, progressives, and environmentalists have
witnessed an erosion of their prerogatives, power, and protection,
they have become convinced that the current trading regime hasn't
lived up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Although politically polyglot, the group is unified by its
opposition to value-neutral free trade, open markets, and an
unrestricted flow of capital. The key phrase, of course, is
value-neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Told that trade would lift most boats, those groups think what
globalization has actually wrought is an invidious race to the
bottom, pitting US workers and their sensibilities against
countries that repress labor and despoil the environment.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened against the backdrop of speculator-driven
currency crises that have thrown nations into panic, International
Monetary Fund strictures that have favored the preservation of
investment climates over stimulating employment, and a growing
backlash against the loss of cultural identity that has accompanied
globalization in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement has been building for the last 10 years,'' said
Robert Scott, an economist who works on trade issues for the
Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank based in
Washington, D.C. ``Now it has really reached the boiling point.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the anger bubbling over on the Seattle streets is
that those groups have had little effect on policy by working
inside the system.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bush and Clinton administrations, the mainstream policy
mantra in Washington has been simple: Unfettered trade will
naturally maximize wealth by focusing each country's economy on
what it does best. And if jobs are lost to foreign competitors, the
market will reallocate that displaced labor to a more productive
function. Or so goes free-trade theory, as developed by classical
economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly today's free-traders see the current economy as proof
that the theory is right. ``Here we are with the best economy we
have ever had, with unemployment at historically low levels, with
the Fed expected to raise interest rates because the economy is so
tight,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, chief trade negotiator for Asia
under President Reagan and now president of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington policy research group. ``There is just no
evidence that trading with these countries is having any (negative)
effect on us.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's hardly the way the skeptics see it. They started to
grow dubious in the 1970s, when a dramatic increase in trade
coincided with a stagnating economy and the start of a long decline
in income.
</P>
<P>
   In anything less than a full-employment economy, labor displaced
by trade wouldn't necessarily be put to a more productive use,
those skeptics said. Rather, experience taught that the more
probable effect was for unemployed workers to swell the labor pool,
increase supply, and thus drive down wages.
</P>
<P>
   What's notable about last week's huge protests, however, is that
they came at a time when record prosperity has driven joblessness
down to a level below what economists had theretofore regarded as
full employment.
</P>
<P>
   So why the discontent in a time of seeming economic plenty?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the different effects trade has on various sectors
of the economy. It's a bit of a generalization, yet basically
accurate, to say that the United States exports sophisticated,
high-value-added products while importing lower-end goods.
</P>
<P>
   Thus well-educated workers do well under a policy that maximizes
free trade. ``Highly skilled professionals seem to be largely
immune from trade and probably benefit because we have lower prices
for goods that we buy,'' says Barry Bluestone, a professor of
political economy at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for lesser-skilled workers, and particularly those in the
manufacturing sector, who have long borne the brunt of competition
with low-wage foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanding trade almost by definition means stiffer competition
at the lower end, and some of what working people are reacting to
is definitely connected to that,'' says James K. Galbraith, an
economist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In sectors where international competition is fierce, the
questions those workers are asking are good ones _ and the answers
they are getting are not.
</P>
<P>
   Take labor conditions. The cost of labor is key to the price of
a product. Is it fair that workers in the United States, where the
minimum wage sets a floor, are forced to compete with foreign
workers who earn only a fraction of US wages?
</P>
<P>
   A pure free-trader would say yes, since low wages are the
comparative advantage a developing country commands.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the low-wage country has suppressed unions, thereby
keeping wages artificially low, as, for example, is the case in
China? Or what if US factories are competing with goods produced by
child labor? Should that repression or exploitation of labor also
be considered part of a country's natural comparative advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Although the World Trade Organization is attuned to business
concerns such as subsidized exports or copyright violations, it
hasn't addressed workers' concerns with similar alacrity, said Thea
Lee, assistant director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, in an
interview from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, its response has been that those labor concerns are not
appropriate issues for its sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very resistant, and that is why we are out on the
streets,'' said Lee. ``We want the World Trade Organization to
address these issues with the same vigor and effectiveness with
which it currently addresses issues of concern to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns have driven the AFL-CIO to advocate the inclusion
of five basic labor standards _ freedom of association, the right
to organize and bargain collectively, and prohibitions on child
labor, forced labor, and discrimination in employment _ into the
WTO and world trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps the best crystallization of the tenets of the
growing fair-trade movement: Proper international trade policy
would lift working conditions in developing countries rather than
see competition erode US wages and working standards.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentally, the issues are different, but the underlying
concerns are the same: an erosion of US protections as a result of
competition with lower-standard countries.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental community cites a string of WTO decisions that
have essentially degraded US environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent is the October 1998 ruling that, though
recognizing the legitimacy of the statute's goal, nevertheless
undercut a US law banning the importation of shrimp from countries
that don't include ``turtle excluder'' devices on all shrimp nets.
The WTO said the law violated world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that they acknowledged that this kind of law was
legitimate, but we still lost a case we should have won,'' said
David Shorr, director of the World Wildlife Fund's sustainable
commerce program. ``The case reflects a consistent bias of WTO
rules against environmental priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem for free-trade skeptics is the lack of a plausible
candidate to carry their message nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Of this year's presidential hopefuls, only Pat Buchanan, former
Republican, current Reform Party member, has broken with the
free-trade establishment _ and his views on other issues are
sufficiently outside the mainstream that he is hardly credible.
Party founder Ross Perot, meanwhile, probably hurt the cause of
fair trade with his blunderbuss predictions of disaster if the
North American Free Trade Agreement passed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the skeptics fare much better in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton won on NAFTA in 1993 and on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994, he has since suffered a
string of defeats and frustrations as he has sought fast-track
negotiating authority and tried to expand NAFTA-like free trade to
Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, says
growing numbers of lawmakers think the old model must be changed to
include standards to protect workers and the environment. He
compares the effort to Franklin D. Roosevelt's determination to
take the rough edges off capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really the New Deal versus trickle-down, taken
internationally,'' Frank says. ``They are saying, `Just let capital
go where it can get the best return,' and we are saying, `No, that
is not enough, you have to look at the adverse economic effects.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sense, the protesters have scored an important
victory in Seattle. Their efforts made front-page news of arcane
issues often all but ignored by the mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton's speech on Wednesday championed their
cause, urging the WTO to address labor and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Frank thinks the issue could grow to be as important, powerful,
and divisive as the Vietnam War or civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   And though free-traders reflexively label any other system
protectionist, as if that term itself should deter debate, smart,
thoughtful people are reconsidering old verities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a wake-up call about the need to reexamine the
values underlying our international economic policy,'' says
Galbraith.

BRADLEY'S HOMAGE TO A RACE-BAITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley likes to talk about race. He likes to talk about it
a lot. He has made it a central theme of his presidential campaign.
He describes how his career with the New York Knicks gave him keen
insights into racism. He says he became a Democrat because ``it was
Democrats that stepped forward . . . in the Senate and cast their
vote for the Civil Rights Act in 1964.'' (Actually, Republicans
voted for the bill en masse while nearly one-third of the Democrats
voted against it.) His campaign Web site (www.billbradley.com)
offers the full text of not one, not two, but five separate
speeches on race, plus an excerpt on the subject from his 1996
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   He brings up racial issues before almost every audience. At the
University of Iowa, Bradley was asked why he was talking about race
to a roomful of white Iowans. ``Why not to you?'' he answered. ``I
talk about it everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can a president can do about race relations? During a
Q&AMP;A last week at The Boston Globe, Bradley had a ready answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tone that an administration takes,'' he said. ``When
Ronald Reagan was president, if you wanted to please the boss, what
you did was increase defense spending to fight communists. If I'm
president and you want to please the boss, you're going to show how
in your life, in your job, in your business, you promoted racial
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be no bad thing to have a president who everyone knew
was deeply committed to promoting racial understanding. But if
Bradley cares so deeply about improving race relations, why would
he go out of his way to curry favor with a racial demagogue?
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, Bradley appeared before the Rev. Al Sharpton's
National Action Network in New York. With his most senior campaign
aides on hand, he spoke about how much racial unity means to him.
``It is who I am,'' he told the audience. ``It's what I believe.
It's what I care most about.'' He issued a string of promises,
including more affirmative action, more money for inner cities, and
lighter penalties for using crack cocaine. At one point, he led the
hall in chanting Sharpton's battle cry, ``No justice, no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bradley didn't say, what he didn't even hint at, was that
the man he was paying homage to is a race-baiting bigot, a
notorious liar, and a Jew-hater.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Sharpton helped peddle the incendiary Tawana Brawley
hoax, insisting loudly that a 15-year-old black girl had been
kidnapped and raped by white men. He told reporters that one of the
rapists was a young prosecutor named Steve Pagones. When the
shocked Pagones, who had never met Brawley, objected, Sharpton
taunted him. ``If we're lying, sue us!'' Pagones did and was
vindicated. But it took years to get his verdict, and Sharpton has
never recanted the slander.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, anti-Semitic riots erupted in Brooklyn when a
7-year-old black child, Gavin Cato, was accidentally killed by a
Hasidic driver. Sharpton gleefully poured gasoline on the fire.
Three hours after the child was killed, a gang of 20 young black
men shouting ``Kill the Jews!'' knifed to death an Orthodox Jew, a
visiting scholar. At Cato's funeral, Sharpton blasted Jewish
``diamond merchants'' for the boy's death and egged on the rioters.
``We must not reprimand our children for outrage,'' he insisted.
``It . . . was put in them by an oppressive system.'' As the
violence raged, he mobilized hundreds of anti-Jewish demonstrators.
They marched along Eastern Parkway, chanting, ``No justice, no
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sharpton led protests against Freddy's Fashion Mart, a
Harlem clothing store with a Jewish owner. On his radio show, he
demanded that the ``white interloper'' be forced out of Harlem. The
head of Sharpton's Buy Black committee vowed to ``make this cracker
suffer.'' On Dec. 8, one of the protesters walked into the store,
began shooting, and set Freddy's Fashion Mart on fire. Eight people
died.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is a vicious racist, the very antithesis of a racial
healer. If Bradley cares as deeply about improving race relations
as he says he does, why would he agree to appear with such a thug?
And why would he say nothing _ not a word _ to dissociate himself
from Sharpton's racial malice?
</P>
<P>
   Asked the question, Bradley begins with a small boast. ``I think
I was the first Democratic politician in a primary campaign to go
to Harlem since 1968.'' (Not true; a five-minute search of 1992
news clips turns up coverage of Jerry Brown's appearances there
that year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sharpton event was a forum,'' Bradley went on. ``He
introduced me, I spoke, I answered questions. I don't agree with Al
Sharpton on all the issues, not at all. But that was an opportunity
to speak to a community that doesn't have presidential candidates
come and speak to them.'' Besides, he said, while ``Sharpton has
made some big mistakes . . . everyone has the possibility of
evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are hollow rationalizations, thin and unworthy. No one who
believes in racial harmony has any business sharing a stage with
the likes of Sharpton. If Bradley felt obliged to go for the sake
of the ``community,'' he had a moral obligation to speak up about
the racial poison in which Sharpton traffics. He kept silent. It is
on the silence of good men like Bradley that evil men like Sharpton
grow strong.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED FOR 007 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's talk legs, the movie kind.
</P>
<P>
   James Bond has the best in the business. He is the Cyd Charisse
of the box office. No other franchise in film history approaches
the Bond oeuvre, which spans early Kennedy to late Clinton.
Thirty-seven years after Ursula Andress walked out of the ocean in
``Dr. No'' like a new species of amphibian, Bond still gets the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else that comes remotely close,'' notes Peter
Graves, former president of marketing for Polygram Films.
</P>
<P>
   Take the latest offering, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' with
Pierce Brosnan as 007. It opened two weekends ago with a $35
million gross to grab the top spot at the domestic box office.
</P>
<P>
   Its theatrical take alone _ it is being released in 51 countries
_ should approach $400 million worldwide. In South Africa, for
example, it opened larger than did ``Titanic'' or ``The Phantom
Menace.'' With video and television, it will earn more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, the annual juggernaut of Bond films aired since
1991 on cable by TBS Superstation. The ``15 Days of 007'' is up
once again, with former Monty Python stalwart John Cleese flacking.
It boosted the station's normal prime-time audience by 30 percent
on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an on-line orgy on the TBS Web page called
CyberBond that runs trivia games as the movies are being shown. The
turnout has been scary. Two years ago, there were 977,000 hits
during the programming on the page. Last year, the number
mushroomed to 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Bond franchise has immunized its movies from
the judgments of film critics. Bond films are routinely lambasted
by serious reviewers, yet audiences that make gimlet-eyed calls
about other movies suspend such critical thinking at the theater
door when they watch a Bond flick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four percent of our audiences reads the reviews,'' confirms
Michael Wilson, stepson of the creator of the Bond franchise,
Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli, who died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, the Bond formula is treated like the Holy Grail by its
owners. ``It is a promise kept,'' says Ira Teller, who has run his
own motion picture advertising business in Los Angeles for 22
years, ``You can ask, `Why not a better script or why not a better
villain?' But it doesn't matter. Why mess around with that
formula?''
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed? The worldwide theatrical grosses for the first 18
movies topped $2.8 billion, excluding video and television.
Somewhere around 2 billion people have seen Bond in one of those
three mediums.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, there have been 19 movies in the Bond canon. Not
included for legal reasons are a weird 1967 spoof of ``Casino
Royale'' with David Niven as Bond and a 1983 remake of
``Thunderball'' called ``Never Say Never Again'' with an aging
Connery at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's a spiral notebook explaining how to make a
Bond film that has been passed down,'' says Graves. ``I started
thinking of them as Kabuki plays a long time ago. There is a
perfect balance of X amount of this and that. There is a reassuring
cadence to the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond movies are confected from dollops of action, cleavage, and
gadgets. In the end, they are staid affairs. There has never been,
and presumably never will be, an R-rated Bond flick. There has
never been nudity, swearing, or believable violence on the watch of
Broccoli or his daughter, Barbara, and stepson who have succeeded
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is safe, predictable family entertainment that in
a weird way resembles Disney fare. And PG-13 is Hollywood's yellow
brick road. Broccoli and his former partner, the late Harry
Saltzman, figured that out early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not `Pokemon' or `Toy Story' entertainment. We're not
going that low. But we don't want to make it embarrassing for a
mother and father with their children,'' says Wilson, from London,
where EON Productions, the Broccoli film arm, is based.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's core audience, men over 35, includes those who have been
watching him since they began to express their interest in the
opposite sex at drive-ins during the Cuban missile crisis. For
them, a Bond movie _ any Bond movie _ is as comfy as an old flannel
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movies connect you back with your younger days. It's that
simple,'' says Rusty Aertsen, who is pushing 50 and saw the latest
movie last weekend with his two college-age children. ``I've seen
every single one of them when they opened in theaters. You can
watch them over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for such affection are the spectacular stunts
pioneered by the Bond franchise that are the norm in action films
today. Nothing, says Wilson, will ever match the sequence in ``The
Spy Who Loved Me'' where Roger Moore skis off a cliff in the
Austrian Alps and, after falling ghostlike through the ether, opens
a parachute that becomes a giant Union Jack. This is the echt Bond
blend of sangfroid and bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Such footage matters hugely to the Broccoli team. At the
beginning of ``Moonraker,'' Moore jumps from a plane without a
parachute and eventually wrestles one from another soul who is also
descending. That stunt, according to Wilson, took six weeks and 88
jumps to wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Bond people also trumpet the numerous live action shots that
still dominate the series. Larry Gleason, president of worldwide
theatrical distribution for MGM, the studio that distributes the
films, estimates that 90 percent of the action footage in the
latest Pierce Brosnan vehicle was shot live _ the reverse, he
claims, of the industry norm these days where roughly the same
percentage is hatched with computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as it is to contemplate now, there was a time when Bond had
no gadgets. Sean Connery was on his own against Dr. No in 1962. It
was not until the third offering, ``Goldfinger,'' that audiences
were introduced to an Aston Martin with an ejector seat.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, we've been introduced to a dizzying array of things
that go bang. The Bond movies pioneered the techno-action we take
for granted on the screen today. But the growth in gadgetry has
come at the expense of good scripts and acting. With rare
exceptions, the Bond villains sleepwalk through their parts,
perhaps to satisfy divorce decrees or pay for new houses in the
Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   The gadgetry has reached a fever pitch in the last three Bond
films because of the critical need to attract younger audiences. To
that end, a huge promotional connection with MTV has been mounted
to draw more younger viewers into theaters. The video game from
``Goldeneye'' has been a big hit, and much is expected from the
video offering for ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' that has just been
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this was done specifically to appeal to younger
audiences,'' explains Gleason, who says the campaign is working.
Sixty-five percent of the audience before ``Goldeneye,'' Brosnan's
first, was over 25, he says, whereas 60 percent in the latest thus
far is under 25.

   Many younger viewers have no clue who Sean Connery is. But he
remains the definitive Bond. Ian Fleming initially wanted Cary
Grant, who never gave it serious consideration. Good call. ``You
can't have Cary Grant shooting people in the back,'' says Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   George Lazenby was, by all accounts, a disaster in one of the
best written Bonds of all, ``On Her Majesty's Secret Service.''
(The formidable Diana Rigg so despised him, according to one James
Bond Web site, that she chewed garlic before the love scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   Then came Roger Moore, a likable fellow who lacked the necessary
testicular fortitude to be convincing in the role and by the end of
his run resembled a mannequin in Madame Tussaud's. Timothy Dalton
was considered too dark to succeed as Bond. In the latest
incarnation, we arrive at Pierce Brosnan, accepted by all as a nice
blend of Connery and Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquity of Bond tells us more about ourselves than we may
want to know. The Bond franchise is one of the great cash cows in
the history of entertainment because it assumes we really don't
want a lot of heavy lifting when the lights go down. Fellini?
Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   If Bond was modern in 1962, he is kitsch in 1999. No matter.
Pilloried for sexism, superficiality, predictability, the man
transcends it all. He is, after all, the mind candy of the global
village.

ART BOOKS: IRELAND TO PICASSO

   Sure, Georgia O'Keeffe's flowers were erotic. But do they really
require a plain brown wrapper? That's what they get with the
cardboard case around the new two-volume catalog raisonne of
O'Keeffe's work by Barbara Buhler Lynes (Yale, $195). It's the
culmination of a recent spate of O'Keeffe books, and also an
indication of another art-world trend: The catalog as carry-on
luggage. ``Georgia O'Keeffe'' weighs in at 20 pounds, and that
cardboard box comes with a suitcase handle.
</P>
<P>
   Books on African art, once rare, are more plentiful this year.
The most spectacular 1999 example is another two-volume
extravaganza, ``African Ceremonies'' (Abrams, $150), part of an
ongoing collaboration by photographers Carol Beckwith and Angela
Fisher. They've produced an opulent record of contemporary ritual
across the continent. ``To Conserve a Legacy: American Art from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities'' (MIT Press, $60) by
Richard Powell and Jock Reynolds documents a project involving the
conservation and exhibition of a rich array of art owned by the
nation's black schools. It's a fascinating read. African masks, so
influential in 20th-century art, are put into context in ``Masks:
Faces of Culture'' (Abrams, $60) by John Nunley and Cara McCarty,
who examine masks from ancient funerary examples to Darth Vader's.
Egypt _ an African nation, although that fact jolts some people _
is the country of origin for antiquities avidly collected by other
nations. There are masterworks that stayed at home, though, as
attested by ``Egyptian Treasures from the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo'' (Abrams, $75), edited by Francesco Tiradritti. Araldo De
Luca's lavish photography gives a better view of the objects than
you get in the actual museum, where they're stifled by their
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Of this year's Asian art books, ``The Golden Age of Chinese
Archeology: Celebrated Discoveries from the People's Republic of
China'' (Yale, $75), edited by Xiaoneng Yang, offers breathtaking
images of jade and bronzes, and captivating photographs of the
objects being dug up.
</P>
<P>
   Reputations are being resuscitated with fat books this season.
In ``Victorian Painting'' (Phaidon, $59.95), former Victoria &AMP;
Albert Museum curator Lionel Lambourne makes a case for the smarmy,
the sentimental, and for John Singer Sargent, one of Boston's
best-loved artists. The irradiated, star-gazing nude maidens and
Hallmark-worthy landscapes of one of America's most popular
painters are reconsidered in ``Maxfield Parrish: 1870-1966''
(Abrams, $39.95). And in ``Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the
American People'' (Abrams, $35), Maureen Hennessey and Anne Knutson
reexamine the homey world of the much-loved Stockbridge resident,
focusing in part on the evolution of his Christmas imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land of the Winged Horsemen: Art in Poland 1572-1764'' (Yale,
$65) by Jan Ostrowski and ``Poland's Gourmet Cuisine'' (Hippocrene,
$35) by Bernard Lussiana and Mary Pininska will go a long way
toward correcting the stereotypes about that Eastern European
country. The former chronicles the lifestyle of Poland's monarchs,
merchants, military, and churchmen during the Baroque era, through
a look at exquisitely fabricated artifacts from swords to silk
sashes. The Polish food book offers a total aesthetic experience.
Moody, misty photographs of the Polish countryside and fragments of
Polish poetry are interspersed with instructions for saucing wild
boar. The recipes _ all translated into American measurements _ are
by Lussiana, executive chef at Warsaw's Hotel Bristol, the
country's most elegant hostelry. For any benighted soul who still
thinks kielbasa is the beginning and end of Polish cuisine, the
book will be a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   After Christianity came to Ireland in the fifth century,
ecclesiastical art flourished in that country: The Book of Kells
and the Ardagh Chalice are among the most celebrated examples of
the treasures produced there during the Middle Ages, their hallmark
that eccentric, obsessive interlace that crawls over every
available surface. Peter Harbison examines the phenomenon in ``The
Golden Age of Irish Art: The Medieval Achievement, 600-1200''
(Thames &AMP; Hudson, $95).
</P>
<P>
   Words, not pictures, dominate ``Late Antiquity: A Guide to the
Postclassical World'' (Harvard, $49.95) by G. W. Bowersock, Peter
Brown, and Oleg Grabar. A scholarly book, it will also fascinate
the lay reader. Dipping into 11 essays and more than 500 individual
entries, you discover, say, the significance of angels in Islamic
as well as Judeo-Christian and classical culture, or that
physicians in antiquity believed that homosexual lovemaking between
men was more tiring than ``straight'' sex. Just the sort of thing
to elevate your holiday party conversation from the Pokemon level.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Krauss is one of our foremost feminist critics. Clement
Greenberg was an influential champion of macho art. Books of the
writings of both are out this year. In ``Bachelors'' (MIT, $29.95),
Krauss looks at nine women artists, Cindy Sherman and Agnes Martin
among them, and argues that ``art made by women needs no special
pleading.'' ``Homemade Esthetics: Observations on Art and Taste''
(Oxford, $27.95) includes the transcripts of Greenberg's 1971
seminars at Bennington College, where he articulated his rigid
views on taste and quality.
</P>
<P>
   Most welcome 1999 book on a brand-name artist: ``Picasso:
Painter and Sculptor in Clay'' (Abrams, $60), edited by Marilyn
McCully. In addition to being one of the century's groundbreaking
painters, Picasso was one of its great ceramists. This gorgeously
illustrated book shows how he sometimes adapted his imagery to
conventional shapes like the round plate, and how at other times he
let figure and form erupt out of the clay together.
</P>
<P>
   Most welcome 1999 book on a single artwork: Luciano Bellosi's
``Duccio: The Maesta'' (Thames &AMP; Hudson, $120). The ``Virgin in
Majesty'' cycle that Duccio painted early in the 14th century for
the Siena cathedral is the pinnacle of Sienese painting. It is also
arguably the finest surviving Italian altarpiece. Bellosi's book
lovingly documents the complex masterpiece in its entirety, front
and back. Its most dazzling aspect is a wealth of detail shots
reproduced to scale, each shown with the ultimate artbook luxury _
a blank facing page, so there's nothing to distract you.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig Bemelmans is famous for his ``Madeline'' books about the
little girl who lived in the ``old house in Paris that was covered
in vines.'' But he was also a novelist, muralist, bon vivant, and
painter of juicy, joyful, Dufy-like urban and bucolic scenes. In
``Bemelmans: The Life &AMP; Art of Madeline's Creator'' (Viking, $40),
his grandson, John Bemelmans Marciano, offers a suitably charming
account of the grandfather he never met.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,600 years ago, a lot of people arranged a lot of big
rocks in a big circle in Wiltshire, England. On that everyone
agrees. The accumulated lore about Stonehenge since then involves
human sacrifice, Druid ceremonies, and the widely accepted notion
that the stones were dragged all the way from Wales. Nonsense,
writes stone circle authority Aubrey Burl in ``Great Stone Circles:
Fables, Fictions, Facts'' (Yale, $30). It was glaciers that
deposited the stones on the Wiltshire Plain, he contends, not
thousands of people in an effort worthy of a Cecil B. De Mille
epic. He also argues, on stylistic grounds, that this most British
of monuments was not even made by Britons, but by foreigners. In
this sacred season, Burl demonstrates that nothing is sacred.

SEASON'S GREETINGS: THE BEST FICTION OF 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the good old days, when fin de siecle actually meant
something, people used it to refer to a particularly world-weary
school of late-19th-century artistic expression. I'm not surprised
it's been resurrected for this end-of-century, given our propensity
for recycling and the generally effete state of the arts. Not with
a bang but a whimper, indeed. This was the year publishing
rediscovered Hemingway by churning out his so-called fictional
memoir, ``True at First Light,'' which should have never seen
morning and did nothing but insult a master. Ralph Ellison's
finally released (but never finished) second novel, ``Juneteenth,''
didn't exalt his memory either, except by way of what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Now rumors abound of the imminent appearance of Fitzgerald's
``Trimalchio,'' the novel he wrote before Maxwell Perkins
(publishing's legendary Mr. Fix-It) helped him turn it into ``The
Great Gatsby.'' Some three-score of Chekhov's previously
uncollected stories were rounded up (never mind that they were
uncollected for a reason); likewise the complete short fiction of
Evelyn Waugh (who would have scowled inimitably at such a desperate
venture). Even the pop maestros at the other end of the spectrum
seemed fonder of the past: Michael Crichton had his Yalies go
medieval in ``Timeline,'' and Thomas Harris tried to out-gross his
own previous ``Silence of the Lambs'' with the return appearance of
his flesh-eating psychiatrist in ``Hannibal.'' No nostalgia for
Kurt Andersen, though: His high-octane ``Turn of the Century'' was
the top Zeitgeist contribution to the millennial craze, replete as
it was with day trading, cyber-conspiracies, and the hegemony of
Starbucks. With all that edge and caffeine paranoia, who says we
aren't ready for the future?
</P>
<P>
   But the best writers don't care what year it is, of course, and
so there are always exceptions to such grumblings. This year, some
of the finest consistent work was done in the short story. Nathan
Englander's first collection, ``For the Relief of Unbearable
Urges,'' announced a young heir to I. B. Singer and Cynthia Ozick _
his stories range from Russia to Jerusalem to New York's Orthodox
Jewish community, and all of them are taut, evocative, and
perfectly contained. David Gates, whose drier-than-dry-ice novels,
``Jernigan'' and ``Preston Falls,'' have left some cult readers
reeling for more, gave us more of that drop-dead narrative voice in
``Wonders of the Invisible World.'' Local heroes Gish Jen and
Christopher Tilghman both made wonderful additions to the form
with, respectively, ``Who's Irish?'' and ``The Way People Run.''
Thom Jones gave us more down-and-dirty revelations about Nietszche
and hard living in ``Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine.'' Bliss
Broyard waxed poignant in her debut stories, ``My Father,
Dancing''; there were also contributions from Alice Adams (``The
Last Lovely City''), A. S. Byatt (``Elementals: Stories of Fire and
Ice''), and Chris Offutt (``Out of the Woods'').
</P>
<P>
   The novel, which every couple of years is said to be ailing, in
fact seems more resilient than ever, if only because of its range
in both subject and technique. Claire Messud wrote a beautifully
haunting exploration of the past's intrusion on the present,
between America and French Algeria, in ``The Last Life.'' Ward Just
captured splendidly the nonchalant cruelties of the bureaucratic
war machine in Vietnam in ``A Dangerous Friend.'' Ha Jin took us
into a world of personal sorrows in communist China in ``Waiting,''
which won the National Book Award last month, while Kent Haruf
delivered the dawn's glow of ordinary life in rural Colorado in
``Plainsong.'' Peter Matthieson finished his Florida-based Watson
trilogy in ``Bone by Bone,'' while Andre Dubus III would have
surely made his father proud with his anti-pastoral ``House of Sand
and Fog.'' And Stewart O'Nan masterfully emulated the quiet horrors
of the classic ``Wisconsin Death Trip'' in his understated Gothic,
``A Prayer for the Dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Salman Rushdie, proving that exile has hurt neither his love for
rock 'n' roll nor his unstoppable prose, combined both in his
globally footloose ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet.'' Wayne Johnston
was similarly abundant in his gravelly epic about Newfoundland,
``The Colony of Unrequited Dreams.'' Oscar Hijuelos stayed
stateside in ``Empress of the Splendid Season,'' where he displayed
his usual humanity in capturing the life of a housekeeper in New
York. Gail Godwin wrote a quiet novel about devotion and staying
put in ``Evensong,'' and David Guterson headed inland from Puget
Sound in ``East of the Mountains.'' Sue Miller gave us a Big Chill
suspense story in ``While I Was Gone''; Leslie Epstein revisited
the foibles of his Leib Goldkorn in ``Ice Fire Water.'' In yet
another nod to yesterday's lure, Sena Jeter Naslund imagined
``Moby-Dick'' from another point of view in ``Ahab's Wife: Or, The
Star-Gazer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother-daughter novels are by now endemic to contemporary
fiction, and this year's yield was headed by Elizabeth Strout's
wistful psychological portrait in ``Amy and Isabelle.'' Janet
Fitch's ``White Oleander'' had its moments as well, despite a
propensity for catastrophic repetition. Elizabeth Graver was more
delicate and less dramatic in her second novel, ``The Honey
Thief.'' A good crop of comic novels included Michael Frayn's
``Headlong,'' Elinor Lipman's ``The Ladies' Man,'' and Jane
Shapiro's farcical ``The Dangerous Husband.'' The intellectually
haunting Kathryn Davis returned with ``The Walking Tour'';
Katharine Weber wrote about the collision of art and politics in
``The Music Lesson''; and A. M. Homes added another wildly creepy
novel to the suburban genre with ``Music for Torching.'' In the
ongoing effort to produce the Gidget-ized version of ``Bridget
Jones's Diary,'' Melissa Bank enjoyed her 12 minutes upon the stage
with ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli A. B.Yehoshua took on history and the diaspora in ``A
Journey to the End of the Millennium''; Japanese Haruki Murakami
explored the world of ill-fated lovers in ``South of the Border,
West of the Sun.'' The South African writer J. M. Coetzee won his
second Booker Prize for ``Disgrace,'' a fierce, laconic novel set
in a post-apartheid world. From Scotland, A. L. Kennedy, whose
strange, forceful prose is beginning to be read here, wrote about a
Glaswegian woman in ``Original Bliss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brits did their usual hogging of the stage in English
letters; the sun may have set on imperialism, but certainly not on
the motherland's way with words. Pat Barker's shadowy domestic
drama, ``Another World,'' had the spectral presence of the First
World War in its drawing room. Sebastian Faulks, whose earlier
``Birdsong'' captured trench warfare with such acuity, went to the
dark moral center of Occupied France in ``Charlotte Gray.'' John le
Carre managed to make international finance interesting in ``Single
&AMP; Single,'' while Penelope Lively made a retired anthropologist's
rural life less than bucolic in ``Spiderweb.'' Julian Barnes, whose
penchant for satire is decidedly Brit, fancied his birthplace a
theme park in ``England, England.''
</P>
<P>
   So: Despite all the hype and folly and millennium prophecies,
not such a bad showing in the world of fiction after all. But the
best fiction of 1999 took us even further aflight _ to the desolate
beauty of Wyoming, the hellish memories of Burma during World War
II, the infinite pleasures and past of Ireland, and, finally, to
this century's own written evidence of the triumph of the
imagination. The brevity of this list _ two novels, one story
collection, and one anthology _ is not meant to seem chary. It's
simply that these four titles are each so elegant that they deserve
a little room of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Star Called Henry'' by Roddy Doyle. In the first volume of a
projected trilogy spanning the 20th century, Doyle's evocation of
Dublin _ its slums, its heartbroken mothers, its political factions
_ is as ambitious as it is emotionally generous. But its real
achievement is the voice of its cheeky protagonist, Henry Smart,
who delivers the inner geography of this story with the mouth of a
wiseacre and the soul of a poet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Gesture Life'' by Chang-rae Lee. Lee's elegant, exquisitely
careful novel concerns the story of old Doc Hata, a retired
Japanese-American businessman who is trying to live by his own code
of honor in Bedley Run, N.Y. With the same titrated secrecy and
narrative precision that defined Kazuo Ishiguro's ``Remains of the
Day,'' Lee returns to the dark burial grounds of Hata's past in
order to illuminate the present. The result is a quiet tragedy set
to the tone of a single cello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close Range: Wyoming Stories'' by Annie Proulx. Cast against
the magical badlands of the American West, Proulx's most recent
short fiction can stand up to anything she has written. Her subject
matter is hard-edged and genuine: a kid on a bull that could break
his back; an old man at the mercy of the land; a couple of cowboys
whose love may break your heart. With its whitewater cadences that
beg to be read aloud, ``Close Range'' has the breathtaking
authenticity of a spring blizzard in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best American Short Stories of the Century,'' edited by John
Updike; series editor Katrina Kenison. Selected from the original
motherlode of some 2,000 stories published in Houghton Mifflin's
annual series since 1915, this volume is an extraordinary testament
to modern America: its literature, its street corners, its suburban
hopes, and city-lights illusions. From the expected (Sherwood
Anderson, Saul Bellow) to the slightly idiosyncratic (an early
Philip Roth), you can feel the imprint of Updike's critical acumen.
By the time you get to Raymond Carver, Tim O'Brien, and Lorrie
Moore, you know how splendid American fiction really can be.
</P>
<P>
   Happy sojourns, everybody.

THE YEAR'S BEST GIFT BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's gift books range in subject from the universe to
Elvis _ or, if you prefer, the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmos is represented by a gorgeous object called ``The
Invisible Universe'' by the astronomical scientist and celestial
photographer David Malin (Bullfinch/
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $50). The images are staggeringly beautiful and
mysterious _ phenomena of light as much as 50 million light-years
away, phenomena that can be ``seen'' only in the complex way these
photographs represent, but phenomena that can also be immediately
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Our own world is a traditional subject for gift books, and one
of the most fascinating this year is ``Voyages of Discovery''
(Clarkson Potter, $60). This is Dr. Tony Rice's genial and
enthralling survey of three centuries in the study of natural
history, as reflected in the collections of the Natural History
Museum in London. There are chapters on Sir Hans Sloane's voyage to
Jamaica in the last part of the 17th century, and Captain Cook in
the Pacific, Charles Darwin on the Beagle, and the Challenger
expedition to explore the deep seas in the last part of the 19th
century. One is left with a profound appreciation of natural
wonders, not the least of which is human curiosity and valor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gothic,'' edited by Rolf Toman (Koenemann, $39.95), surveys an
era of human achievement that can still inspire awe. The first
Gothic buildings were erected in France in the middle of the 12th
century, and the style spread throughout Europe. The book
concentrates not just on cathedrals but on sculpture and painting
as well, working through them to understand the world view that
created these prodigious structures and beautiful objects; there
are also chapters on other pertinent subjects, like stained glass,
and the advances of technology that made these wonders possible.
</P>
<P>
   Other historical gift books of interest include a pair on Egypt,
once more a focus of international and especially local interest.
``Gold of the Pharaohs'' by Hans Wolfgang Mueller and Eberhard
Thiem (Cornell University Press, $60) presents photographs of the
staggering caches of gold in the great Egyptian tombs; the text
describes both the symbolism of gold and jewels in this culture and
the practicalities of how gold was mined, refined, and transformed
into art. ``Sacred Luxuries'' by Lise Manniche, with photographs by
Werner Forman (Cornell University Press, $39.95), surveys the
important place of fragrance, aromatherapy, and cosmetics in
ancient Egyptian culture and provides recipes for herbal potions.
Baldness, the makers of Rogaine might want to know, was treated
``with fat of powerful animals such as lion, crocodile,
hippopotamus, ibex, cat, and serpent. If these creatures were not
available, hedgehog bristles provided an appropriate substitute.
The tooth of a donkey ground in honey was also recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``North American Indian Jewelry and Adornment'' by Lois Sherr
Dubin (Abrams, $75) surveys its colorful subject from prehistory to
the present; as in Egyptian culture, jewelry was totemic for Native
Americans. The craftsmanship that went into the beautiful objects
in these photographs was an exercise not only in artistry but in
religious discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War: Unstilled Voices'' by Chuck Lawliss (Crown
Publishers, $29.95) is described as a ``three-dimensional
interactive book.'' What it represents is a designer run amok.
Every page _ and there are only 33 of them _ brings something new
to unfold, untie, or unwrap, usually a reproduction of a letter or
document related to the subject of each two-page chapter. ``The
Fanatic,'' John Brown, is represented by the note he handed to a
guard on his way to the gallows; ``The Blacks'' by a recruiting
poster; ``The Generals'' by a field dispatch from Stonewall
Jackson. The reproductions, not always chosen in the best of taste
(there is a pair of tickets for the dress circle in Ford's Theater
for April 14, 1865), eerily make the past feel simultaneously more
present and more distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``National Geographic: Eyewitness to the 20th Century''
(National Geographic Society, $40) is a convenient digest of the
last 100 years, organized by decade, with special focus on topics
the magazine has treated over the years. Essays introduce each
decade, but probably most readers will scan the ``Trends and
Trivia'' column first. This collection of miscellaneous facts is
simultaneously interesting, arbitrary, and sometimes slovenly.
Where else could you learn at a glance that Simon and Garfunkel's
``The 59th Street Bridge Song'' was released the same year as
``Cabaret,'' not to mention the same year that Bill Russell signed
on as Celtics coach for $125,000 and that the chemical structure of
DNA was discovered?
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment is always a prime topic for gift books. One
historic form of entertainment, the art of geisha, has newly
fascinated Westerners thanks to Arthur Golden's recent novel,
``Memoirs of a Geisha'' (the fascination will redouble when the
movie is completed and released). ``The Life of a Geisha'' by
Eleanor Underwood (Smithmark Publishers, $9.98) is a small, elegant
book, only 64 pages, illustrated by woodblock prints, photographs,
old postcards, and posters along with actual geisha songs and poems
in translation _ and a jacket testimonial from Golden.
</P>
<P>
   Trends are another form of entertainment, but ``Dreads'' by
Francesco Mastalia and Alfonse Pagano (Artisan, $35) treats
dreadlocks as a form of cultural expression; the keynote address is
by Alice Walker (``After all, if this major mystery could be
discovered right on top of one's head, I thought, what other
wonders might not be experienced in the Universe's exuberant,
inexhaustible store?''). ``Looking for Jackie: American Fashion
Icons'' by Kathleen Craughwell-Varda (Hearst Books, $50) treats 13
women who changed the way other American women wanted to look _
from Dolley Madison through Katharine Hepburn, with sidelong
glances at figures as diverse as today's Madonna and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music has done an extraordinary
job of preserving and promoting the legacy of Kurt Weill and Lotte
Lenya. Last year there was a gorgeous picture book concentrating on
Lenya; this year, in conjunction with an exhibit sponsored by the
foundation in the library for the performing arts at Lincoln
Center, there comes ``Kurt Weill: A Life in Pictures and
Documents'' (Overlook Press, $75), a book that seeks to
depolemicize and depoliticize a figure who was actively involved in
politics and polemics but whose achievement was not defined or
restricted by them. It is a wonderful survey of a life that spanned
some of the most important events of the first half of our century
_ and that has helped our half of the century understand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Century of Country: An Illustrated History of Country
Music'' by Robert K. Oermann (TV Books, $39.95) is an entertaining
survey of a strand of musical history that should neither be
worshiped nor condescended to. Oermann tends to write in
hyper-English (``Dixie Chicks cooked up a musical stew that
virtually everyone approved of . . . (Their debut album) stunned
and delighted the industry by selling more than six million
copies,'' which pretty much takes care of the issue of art versus
commerce). But the story is an entertaining and paradigmatic one,
about how the art tries to remain faithful to its roots while
remaining contemporary by reflecting its own times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny Ladies'' by Stephen M. Silverman traces ``100 years of
great comediennes,'' a word that, like ``actress,'' is on the
endangered list even though what the word defines is still merrily
flourishing among us. Silverman begins with Fanny Brice and Mabel
Normand and ends up with Cameron Diaz, and there is many a salty
anecdote and sizzling one-liner in his survey. Try the paragraphs
on Belle Barth, for example, who specialized in ``blue'' humor and
gave Bette Midler one of her best lines. Many of these women were
years ahead of the society that surrounded them, and out of that
conflict they created humor that still stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Cooper Off Camera'' is an affectionate photographic
memoir of the American screen icon by his daughter Maria Cooper
Janis (Abrams, $35.00), with a quiet and telling introduction about
screen acting by Tom Hanks. Janis has her points, too: ``Acting
isn't so bad as long as you always know the difference, and can
drop the act or mask at will.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Hollywood books are fun. ``Sin in Soft Focus'' by Mark
A. Vieira (Abrams, $39.95) is a survey of early ``suggestive''
Hollywood films and a photographic record of the cunning through
which artists and charlatans pushed the envelope, found themselves
faced with the draconian demands of the Production Code, and got
around it with limitless guile _ although only today are we able to
see some pictures from the early '30s with sequences the censors
deleted. ``The Noir Style'' by Alain Silver and James Ursini
(Overlook Press, $50) surveys a style that helped define the 1940s
(but whose origins the authors trace back to such diverse sources
as German expressionism, the paintings of Edward Hopper,
hard-boiled fiction, and improved film stocks) and whose
consequences linger today in such movies as ``The Player'' and
``Murder in the First.'' Period production stills still create
uneasy moods that don't have anything to do with period.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Elvis? Well, there's ``Elvis: The Official
Auction Catalogue,'' documenting the materials from the Graceland
archives that were auctioned in October at the MGM Grand Hotel and
Casino in Las Vegas (Abrams, $40). Item A is Elvis's 6th grade
report card _ he didn't always do too well in Reliability and
Industry, or even in Cooperation and Courtesy, although he excelled
in Music, Spelling, and Phys. Ed. (minimum bid, $10,000); the last
item is a Smith's Food King credit card issued to Priscilla Presley
(minimum bid, only $200). The book affords a paper trail through
Elvis's life, which is more enjoyably traced on vinyl and CD, and
it is testimony to the nesting instinct, and to the sentimental
value of clutter _ which the book not only documents but
represents.

 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Etched into Gelareh Asayesh's memory is the moment she cast off
the conservative culture in which she grew up and gingerly began
embracing a more permissive way of life. It happened at her high
school prom, with an innocuous gesture: The teenage girl placed an
arm around her date's waist.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Saffron Sky: A Life Between Iran and America,'' Asayesh
lyrically describes the impact that simple touch had on a girl who
came from a world where young people barely dated. The memoir
describes her family's immigration from Iran and her struggle to
maintain her Iranian identity while steeped in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember,'' writes Asayesh, 37, ``as if it were
seared into the palm of my hand, the cool silk of his jacket, the
forbidden heat of the body beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember the moment when I let go of that girl
from Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Published last month, ``Saffron Sky'' knits together stories
Asayesh gathered during seven trips to Iran in the 1990s with
excerpts of articles that originally ran in the magazines of The
Washington Post, The Miami Herald, and The Boston Globe. The
journalist has worked for the Miami paper, the Globe (where she was
an intern the summer of 1982), and The Sun in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   As Asayesh journeys from her idyllic Iranian childhood to a
traumatic period of assimilation in Chapel Hill, N. C., and then to
her emotional reimmersion into Iranian culture, she manages to yank
the veil off a country that often seems inscrutable to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Asayesh delves into the dichotomy of the religiously strict
land: Women must wear scarves or shawls, known as chadors, to cover
their hair and bodies, yet they hold 14 seats in the Iranian
parliament. She captures the contrast of the ``Death to America''
signs spotted on buildings during her first visit with Iran's
enduring love of American culture, exemplified by her cousins'
conspicuous consumption of Danielle Steel novels and Madonna CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Asayesh humanizes Iran by broaching subjects many
Iranian-Americans have feared discussing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranians have been a silent presence in this country for a
long time,'' says Asayesh, sitting in a room at Beacon Press in
Boston, which published ``Saffron Sky.'' ``During the hostage
crisis, a lot of people didn't want to admit that they were
Iranian.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the crisis, Americans still tell hurtful
hostage jokes, says Asayesh. People know so little about the
country, they don't even pronounce its name properly. It's
``Eee-rahn,'' Asayesh gently corrects in her book and during the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of Iranian-Americans are no longer
satisfied to blend into the background of the American landscape.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine recently profiled Sarah Shahi, an
Iranian-American Dallas Cowboy cheerleader. Iranian-American S. Rob
Sobhani is running for the US Senate in Maryland. And on the
literary front, two works released earlier this year, ``To See and
See Again,'' a memoir by Tara Bahrampour, and ``A World Between,''
a compilation of poetry, short stories, and essays by
Iranian-Americans, delve into issues of Iranian identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming to terms with somewhat of a traumatic
experience,'' says Kamran Dadkhah, a Northeastern University
economics professor who also runs the school's Center for Iranian
Research and Analysis. ``They have one foot in the other world and
one foot in this world, trying to find out where they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the pain of that experience that Asayesh brings to life,
says Deanne Urmy, the Beacon Press executive editor who edited
``Safron Sky.'' ``She was able to talk about it in such a moving
way,'' says Urmy.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of the prejudice Asayesh faced pepper ``Saffron Sky.''
The police secretary she encounters during a newspaper assignment
who casually says of Middle Easterners, ``You know, it says in the
Bible those people over there are descended from jackals.'' The
Baltimore Sun colleague who tells Asayesh, upon learning she's
Iranian, ``I have nothing against Iranian people.'' Asayesh writes
sarcastically in response, ``I want to say: Thank you for granting
me benediction.''
</P>
<P>
   The stereotypes extend to how Americans view the women of Iran,
says Asayesh: ``This idea that (they) are the downtrodden
population just languishing, awaiting deliverance from their
Western sisters.'' The women she encounters in Iran, a mixture of
friends, relatives, and acquaintances, are professors, filmmakers,
socialites, and bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But she also highlights another pain, one born of the struggle
to maintain her Iranian culture in a country that she says almost
forces newcomers to cast it away. Asayesh, whose luxurious black
hair falls in tendrils against her high cheekbones, calls
forgetting one's heritage the ``path of least resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the route she followed from her teenage years to 1990. And
it cost her.
</P>
<P>
   She describes waking up from nightmares during that period with
the desire to speak Farsi, the language of Iran. ``When I started
to speak English again,'' she remembers, ``it left the worst taste
in my mouth. A part of me knew that something was shriveling
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Asayesh tackled these difficult topics by writing about them.
She has kept a journal since she was 17 years old. ``Sometimes,
I've even run to the bathroom to write down a particular thing''
during trips in Iran, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although issues of dislocation and identity fill the pages of
her notebooks, they were not subjects her family discussed, Asayesh
says. Even as her father, Khalil, helped edit ``Saffron Sky'' and
fact-checked information about religious holidays, the deeper
issues weren't aired.
</P>
<P>
   Asayesh's mother, Homa, says she has read only a section of the
book because she does not want to reopen the wounds of immigration.
To give their two daughters, Gelareh and Afsaneh, the educational
opportunities America afforded, the couple left successful careers,
a house, their extended family, and an active social life in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you become nobody,'' says Homa, flatly.
</P>
<P>
   When the girls were young, Khalil and Homa held weekly Sunday
brunches-cum-lectures during which they tried to ease their
daughters' assimilation process with informal lessons about Iranian
cultural values. The question of whether they were successful draws
a laugh from Homa, who now heads a women's resource center in
Toronto, where she and her husband live.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that her daughters visit Iran often. Gelareh
Asayesh spent three months there this spring with her American
husband, Neil Brown, managing editor of the St. Petersburg (Fla.)
Times, and their two children, Mina, 5, and Max, 2.
</P>
<P>
   Homa Asayesh also proudly notes that all her grandchildren speak
Farsi. Gelareh Asayesh even teaches a weekly class on the language
to the children of other Iranian-Americans living near her St.
Petersburg home.
</P>
<P>
   Those are small but important actions in a world where,
according to Gelareh Asayesh, many Iranian-Americans don't speak
Farsi and rarely visit Iran. Yet the discomfort of moving between
two worlds remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like that diving term `getting the bends,' ''
says Asayesh. ``There's a very painful psychic process that occurs,
you know, feeling alienated from one (culture) or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten better dealing with that. But it does not go away,
unfortunately, and probably never will. And maybe it shouldn't go
away.''

FIRST IN ROLE WAS NELSON, BARRY NELSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Barry Nelson, not Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Fleming's first book, ``Casino Royale,'' was adapted into a
one-hour television show that aired in 1954 as part of a series
called ``Climax.''
</P>
<P>
   In this bizarre spectacle, Nelson plays ``card sense Jimmy
Bond,'' an operative known for his skills at baccarat. He is up
against the evil Le Chiffre, played by Peter Lorre. A mere glimpse
of Lorre reminds us how fabulous he would have been as a villain in
a full-blown Bond vehicle on the big screen. Linda Christian plays
a French operative from the Deuxieme Bureau who can't keep her
hands off Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Appalling as it is to contemplate, Bond in this first
incarnation is an American who drinks scotch and water, not the
Brit who sips vodka martinis, shaken not stirred. And Felix Leiter,
the stolid CIA agent in all of the Bond movies, is named Clarence
Leiter here and is British. Go figure. This is primitive stuff. The
sets, the acting and the script have the whiff of a high school
play. Never mind. This is still the birth of Bond on the screen.
Curiosity, if not respect, is due.
</P>
<P>
   It would be eight more years before Sean Connery appeared as
Bond to bed Ursula Andress and demolish Dr. No in an impressive
display of testosterone. The rest is history. But, for the record,
it all began with Barry Nelson.

BOTH SIDES AVOWING VICTORY IN NO-WIN BATTLE OF CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND DMITRY SHALGANOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARGUN, Russia _ The Russians are in the mud, the Chechens are in
the mountains, and both sides are convinced they are winning.
</P>
<P>
   Russians and Chechens are made for each other, locked in a
bloody but chronic conflict where each side can claim victory
regularly without ever defeating the other.
</P>
<P>
   In a muddy field on the outskirts of Argun, the last rebel
stronghold east of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, Russia's commanders
were feeling cocky four days into a fierce battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels are offering fierce resistance, but they know the
end is near,'' Russian General Gennady Troshev said Thursday as his
filthy troops brushed mud off a battery of howitzers during a break
in the shelling. Nearby, helicopter gunships prepared to take off
on another deadly raid.
</P>
<P>
   But in the high mountains to the south, across Chechnya's border
with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Troshev's words brought
a derisive round of laughter to a group of rebels taking a break
from the fighting. The view up here is that the Chechens are
winning their war against the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going fine,'' said a rebel fighter who gave only
his first name, Musa, and who arrived from the front line in Argun
on Wednesday. ``The Russians can bombard us from afar, but they are
afraid to fight us. Whenever they get close, we wipe them out. They
are losing many men and weapons. They can never take Argun, but
even if they did, it would not matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is right: the Russians, with their confidence in the mud, or
the Chechens, with their bravado in the mountains? The answer is
both, and neither.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops and Chechen insurgents are facing off on the
battlefield, but they might as well be fighting in different wars.
This is true not only because of the vastly different tactics and
strategies used by the two sides, but also because of a basic
incompatibilty of their societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is about a clash of histories,'' said Fiona Hill,
deputy director of the Washington-based Eurasia Foundation. ``It is
about one side building up an extensive empire, the other trying to
forge a national entity, and each side being totally unprepared for
dealing with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is fighting to control a warrior nation on its southern
border that has resisted Moscow's rule for nearly 300 years.
``Imagine if America's Indian wars had never ended, except that now
the Apaches possessed hand-held missile launchers, Kalashnikov
assault rifles, and state-of-the-art communications,'' a Russian
reporter recently asked an American.
</P>
<P>
   Russians believe failure to control Chechnya produces drastic
consequences, both on a geopolitical level _ the loss of influence
in the oil-rich Caspian Sea basin _ and especially for domestic
security. Russians blame a two-year epidemic of kidnappings, a year
of increasingly bold attacks on neighboring regions, and last
summer's deadly apartment bombings in Moscow on Islamic militants
operating out of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But Russians are also looking to the military to restore
national pride battered by years of setbacks beginning with the
Soviet debacle in Afghanistan and continuing through Moscow's
failed 1994-1996 campaign to tame Chechnya. As the latest Russian
campaign in Chechnya has intensified, its popularity has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop somewhere, as we have been retreating for 15
years,'' Russia's most celebrated living writer, former Soviet
exile Alexander Solzhenitsyn, said recently, capturing the public
mood. ``We have capitulated everywhere. We capitulated in 1996. Our
country cannot abandon the right to defend itself, and defense
means completing the operation in some way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking the other way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there is a sinister side to the unity behind Russia's
hawkish stance toward Chechnya. The indiscriminate shelling and
shootings of civilians; the poor treatment of hundreds of thousands
of refugees; allegations of looting and of abuse of suspected
terrorists goes largely unreported, and uncritized, in Russian
society.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Grozny Saturday described a massacre of as many as
40 civilians by Russian commandos who fired on a column of refugees
at point-blank range. Russian officials denied the reports as
``disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen insurgents, meanwhile, said they are fighting for
their existence as a nation, prolonging a tradition of gallant
resistance against Russia that began when Peter the Great sent his
armies into the Caucasus in 1722 and continued against czars,
Bolsheviks, Stalin, and now post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Always outnumbered and outgunned, the Chechens have tried to sap
the Russians of their resolve by launching ambushes and raids in
the wars of the 19th century and the wars of the 1990s. The idea is
to exact heavy casualties on their adversary, then to retreat to
fight another day. This is what appears to be happening in Argun;
the Russians will take the town, and the majority of the Chechen
defenders will get away.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Chechens' defeats have been resounding, such
as the failed rebellion that led Stalin in 1944 to deport the
entire Chechen nation and their ethnic cousins the Ingush. But such
setbacks have produced a series of heroic role models, and a sense
of national resolve in the face of an enemy, that have made the
Chechens what British analyst Anatol Lieven describes as ``one of
the great martial peoples of modern history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 280 years, the Chechens have been surpressed and
forced to submit to the Russians,'' said Lieven, author of a book
on the 1994-1996 Chechnya war. ``But whenever Moscow is weak, or
too oppressive, they revolt and fight again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes prevail &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is fueled by each side's romantic view of itself,
and basic misperceptions about the other side.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, the Chechens are a bandit nation, forever
entrenched in a clan-like society that rejects modern traditions of
hierarchical organization and laws. A 19th-century czarist general
branded them ``a people who cannot be assimilated,'' and poet
Mikhail Lermontov described the ``evil Chechen, crawling along the
bank, sharpening his knife.'' Those stereotypes remain the defining
characteristics of Chechens held by Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian image of the Chechens is encapsuled in the violent
footage shown on nationwide news, depicting Chechen captors
torturing and murdering their hostages, and enjoying it. One
popular program repeatedly played a video of Chechens shooting the
fingers off the hand of a small boy, laughing as he pleaded for
mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Chechen civilians may be suffering under the
Russian military assault, but by their complicity in the chronic
lawlessness and violence that took root in Chechnya during the past
three years of de-facto independence, they deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lest you should worry too much about those refugees, I'll show
this videotape again,'' said the show's anchor, Sergei Dorenko.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens, too, have a favorite videotape: ``Braveheart,'' the
1995 film that cast Mel Gibson as William Wallace, the highland
rebel who united diverse Scottish clans to hold off, for a while,
the British oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace eventually lost. The Chechens are convinced they can
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought no Russian could ever beat a Chechen in
anything,'' said Apti, a Chechen rebel resting in Georgia last
week.``They have the numbers, but they are weak. They are afraid to
fight, but we enjoy it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Courageous and complacent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain informality to the Chechen resistance that
the Russians do not seem to understand. Troshev, the Russian
general in Argun, said Chechen rebels are demoralized and continue
to fight only because they are afraid of rebel leader Shamil
Basayev. But Chechens seem to drift in and out of the combat zone
at their own whim. One Chechen named Bilal spent last week in the
trenches at Argun; next week, he plans to travel to Europe to work
on his career as a rap musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens are great individualists,'' Bilal said. ``This is why
we always beat the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Yo'av Karny, a Washington-based journalist who has written
extensively on Chechnya, said this confidence points to what he
calls ``a profound flaw in Chechen society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Chechens think that fighting, killing, for that matter
being killed, is fun,'' he said. ``They have profound courage. But
as peacetime politicians, they have failed. Where does law-breaking
end, and where does national salvation begin?''
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians say they are trying to fill this void. They
have visited recaptured regions and promised to rebuild damaged
schools, hospitals and homes; but no one reasonably believes Moscow
will see through an economic revival here that it has been unable
to fashion anywhere else outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Another force, Islamic fundamentalism, is competing for
influence in Chechen society. The rebels themselves argue over
whether they need radical Islam, and whether it is responsible for
the events that led to the latest war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Islamic fighters are coming from Afghanistan and Arab
countries and I don't want this to happen,'' Apti said. ``I like my
Chechen religion and traditions the way they are. But if the war
continues, we will not be able to stop the Islamic fighters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No win situations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Russian military assault shows no signs of abating. ``We
must not stop,'' said Yevgeny Ganyukov, a Russian major stationed
outside Argun. ``Once we've started to pound them, we have to pound
them to the end, so that not one living soul remains.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens will never win that way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hatred of the federal forces grows with every
civilian casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will never win that way.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was found high in the mountains to the south, in a
small border hamlet filled with women and children who have fled
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   There, a Chechen named Musa, all of 4 years old, was asked where
his father was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at home, fighting the Russians,'' the child said. ``And
one day, I'll grow up and fight them, too.''
</P>

INVESTING FOR AN INFANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am going to have a baby in March and my parents have
offered to give us $5,000 to invest toward the child's education.
How would you invest this money to get the best returns over the
next 18 years? My father says bonds are the best choice; my husband
and I say stocks. We currently have money invested in Twentieth
Century Ultra, Templeton Foreign I, Putnam OTC. and Putnam Emerging
Growth funds, as well as Cisco Systems common stock, all of which
have been doing extremely well in this market. Are there better
funds for this type of investing? Also, do you recommend putting
the investment in the child's name?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Brookline, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Before I get into what I would do, I would suggest you think
about an old adage I have always followed, which is that the gift
must please the giver.
</P>
<P>
   If your parents have provided the money and strongly suggest
that it go into bonds or a bond fund, that's really what you should
do. And if your parents propose to give the money to the yet-unborn
child, it's not really up to you to decide whose name the money
should be in.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, I certainly agree that stock investments would
be better than bonds. I don't think I'd go with investments as
aggressive as your current holdings, but I think one of the many
Standard &AMP; Poor's Index 500 funds would be a good holding for the
first 13 years, followed by five years in a balanced fund, and
then, upon the child's entry into college, a money market fund. You
might do this with Vanguard by using Vanguard Index 500, followed
by Vanguard Balanced Index, followed by its Prime Money Market
fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you followed that plan and if the Index 500 fund produced
average 10 percent returns for 13 years, followed by 8 percent
returns from the Balanced Index fund for the next five years, the
accumulation would be $25,362 after 18 years. If you simply went
into a bond fund for the 18-year duration and produced total
returns of 6.5 percent, you would have $15,533.
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of whose name is best for the investment,
the general byword is that unless you anticipate that you will be
rich _ really, really rich _ by the time the student enters
college, the funds are best put in the parents' name, where they
will be taxed much less heavily by the authorities who determine
financial aid eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, these authorities deem that up to 5.65
percent of the parents' assets should be available for college
expenses, but that up to 50 percent of the student's assets should
be available to meet each year's college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But to end up where I started, I think the wishes of the giver
of this gift should be a prime consideration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Q. I am 35 and make $35,000 a year. I have a wife and two kids
at home. My wife doesn't work; the money she would earn would all
be spent on day care, so it doesn't make economic sense. My
employer doesn't have a 401(k) plan, but I've put $2,000 a year
into an IRA account, which is currently worth more than $10,000. We
have no assets and no other investments. Our checking account has
about $1,000 in it, depending on the time of the month and whether
we've just paid our rent. We have no significant debts, carefully
paying off our credit cards each month. I try to set aside more
money, but car repairs, school supplies, and the occasional dental
visit seem to empty the account every month. I have read your
column for some time now. You give advice to people with a half
million dollars in various accounts and who earn between $80,000
and $200,000 a year. They all want to retire at around age 50 or
55. My income is about the median for people my age and gender;
half the people in the country earn less than me. I also would like
to retire someday. I would also like to be able to send my kids to
college. What financial advice do you have for me? Will my kids go
to college? Will I ever be able to retire?
</P>
<P>
   M.J., Seattle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sure does look a long way away, doesn't it? What you need
to do is set yourself small goals, and then keep plugging away at
them.
</P>
<P>
   The $2,000 a year that you're putting into your IRA represents
5.7 percent of your earnings. If you keep contributing the maximum
to the IRA until you're 65 years old, you would accumulate a total
of $518,558.
</P>
<P>
   That presumes average investment returns of 10 percent, which
would be a reasonable expectation if you have the money in a stock
mutual fund; if you have it with a bank, you might expect long-term
returns in the area of 6 percent, which would take you to $219,896.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with a modest increase _ basically a token. To take your
savings rate to 6 percent would require saving only an additional
$100 a year. Just that additional $100 a year would take the
accumulation to $535,775 after 30 years, using the stock investment
assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you get a raise, give your retirement savings a raise
as well. Suppose you got a 3 percent raise, taking your earnings to
$36,050. If you're serious about retirement you could not only
increase your dollar savings to reflect the raise, but also
increase the savings level.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose with the raise you boosted your savings level to 6.5
percent of your earnings. This would mean total retirement savings
of $2,343.25 for that year. Then, when you get another raise, do it
again. If you keep at such a schedule, the increases should not
hurt too much, and over time they would build handsome rewards.
</P>
<P>
   As for an investment vehicle for the extra savings, the tax laws
now allow your wife to put as much as $2,000 into an IRA each year,
even if she doesnt work.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the extra savings into an IRA account for her would at
least give her a small sense of a tangible reward for the work she
does, which is every bit as much work as if she were toiling away
at a job to pay for day care.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the question of college. The brutal fact of the
current reality is that mediocre students who have a lot of money
behind them can go to college with no problems, but only the good
students can obtain financial aid to cover their college expenses,
regardless of the family's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   (And your assets in retirement accounts such as IRAs aren't
counted when tallying the parents' assets on the current financial
aid forms.)
</P>
<P>
   So it would behoove you to get your children to take their
schooling seriously, teaching them that what they do in elementary
and high school will largely shape their future careers and earning
power.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your reply to R.S. of Newburyport, Mass. raised a question
that might interest many readers: How much can you withdraw from
savings in retirement without running out of money? When you told
R.S. that $589,844 would last 30 years, that implied a withdrawal
rate of about 7.4 percent. A recent piece at www.morningstar.net by
Frank Armstrong, ``Making It Last Forever,'' provides historical
calculations indicating that at 7.4 percent withdrawals, you'd have
perhaps a 14 percent chance of going broke. Once withdrawal rates
exceed 7 percent, things go downhill rapidly, Armstrong argues. Is
he being too conservative?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Wayland, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you misunderstood what I was saying to R.S. This was
a fellow who had a fairly modest retirement nest egg and believed
that if other people were worried about their retirement situation,
he should be frantic.
</P>
<P>
   But what he also had was a substantial pension, and the
calculation I made (which presumed a 6.5 portfolio yield) was
simply to demonstrate how much capital he would require to supply
the same income stream as the pension over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, since what's in question is a pension rather than a
pool of savings, the money would never run out, although it would
become steadily less valuable as inflation took its toll.
Fortunately, R.S. was building a supplementary retirement account,
upon which he could rely to offset the effect of inflation in his
later years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in our calculations was that you simply tallied
that $43,750 a year represents 7.4 percent of the pool. But if you
calculate the portfolio with monthly withdrawals from a pool
returning 6.5 percent, you get to zero shortly after 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, Armstrong's column is an excellent one,
describing a study that showed historical results of what he calls
successful portfolios over various time periods with various rates
of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, a successful portfolio is one that still exists at
the end of the period. The primary focus on the study was to
determine what portfolio mix of stocks and bonds fared best at
various levels of withdrawal. I recommend it highly.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In a test this summer, Alexander Graethe of the European Media
Lab in Heidelberg, Germany, trudged through the rain-swept streets
of the city, asking directions from locals, with the aid of a
talking machine stashed in his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It translated his questions into German, then dictated people's
answers back to him in English. It even plotted his course on a map
display strapped to his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his colleagues booked flights and hotel rooms with
PCs, using the same software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please reserve two rooms for me at the Dom Hotel in Limburg,
Thursday to Sunday'' would come out the other end of the phone as
``Ich moechte zwei Zimmer im Dom-Hotel in Limburg bestellen, von
Donnerstag bis Sonntag.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the masterminds behind this attempt at computer
translation is Alexander Waibel, the director of Carnegie Mellon's
Interactive Systems Lab.
</P>
<P>
   His own bilingual existence, which requires shuttling back and
forth between Pittsburgh and the University of Karlsruhe in
Germany, has made him painfully aware of the difficulties involved.
The trial _ conducted in Pittsburgh; Heidelberg and Karlsruhe,
Germany; Grenoble, France; Kyoto, Japan; Trento, Italy; and Taejon,
South Korea _ was a showcase for C-STAR, an international
collaboration of researchers who are trying to get computers to
understand spoken words well enough to render them in another
language.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a small but notable step toward creating a universal
translator: a machine that allows seamless conversations between
people, or between people and machines, regardless of language or
software.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been working on machine translation for half a
century, yet only in the past few years have microchips grown
powerful enough to even approach the kind of processing human ears
and brains perform effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to do the job is called example-based
translation. It distills a few million words worth of translated
conversations into a giant set of syntax rules.
</P>
<P>
   A computer program containing those rules works like a tourist
with a phrase book, taking each word and plugging its translated
equivalent into the right place in a sentence in the target
language. The approach is crude but efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Department of Defense needed translation help
for English-speaking forces in Bosnia, Carnegie Mellon scientists
developed a rudimentary Serbo-Croatian-to-English system in a
matter of months, relying largely on example-based techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel and other researchers are exploring a more sophisticated
approach called Interlingua-based translation, which breaks down
utterances into an internal, language-neutral representation of
their meaning. Then, rather like what goes on in the head of a
multilingual person, it generates a translated sentence that says
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Interlingua requires a lot of programming skill, but it provides
a lot of flexibility in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interpretation rather than translation,'' Waibel says.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer hears ``It would please me very much if you
would be so kind as to reserve me a room in your fine hotel,'' it
extracts something like ``Reserve (object ``room'') (user ``me'')
(form polite).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the computer has captured the meaning of a sentence,
repeating it in another language may not even be necessary. If
someone has asked a question, the computer may be able to provide
an answer from its own database.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT's Laboratory for Computer Sciences, speech-recognition
expert Victor Zue is more interested in smart, voice-responsive
computers than in Waibel's Pentium-packed knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Oxygen Project, he is studying speech interfaces
that could bring a flood of computerized information to the vast
majority of the world that has yet to see PCs and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Zue predicts, people around the world may carry cheap,
souped-up cell phones that will enable them to tap into nearly
limitless networked resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the information on the Internet _ literature, news, chat
rooms, medical research _ will then be accessible to anyone who
picks up a handset and asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Before such grand changes can take place, there's a great deal
of work to be done. Current systems make a lot of mistakes when
they respond to a broad range of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Waibel says, is that people speak ``dysfluently'':
They repeat themselves, don't complete sentences and sometimes
don't even complete words.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists are striving to develop software that can
handle ``ers,'' ``umms'' and fragmentary sentences, then select
crucial words from garbled ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice interfaces also have limited vocabularies, confining
themselves to restricted subject areas in which each stage of
conversation allows only a few sensible responses.
</P>
<P>
   True conversations with computers may require overhauling the
way speech-recognition programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions range from new mathematical methods for
analyzing spoken sounds to computer programs that draw on vast
databases of abstract knowledge about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harper, who develops computer-language models at Purdue
University, points out that even human beings can hear the exact
same sounds in several different ways depending on their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are fond of the phrase ``how to wreck a nice beach''
_ or is that ``how to recognize speech''?
</P>
<P>
   Given the ambiguities of human language, she suspects it may
never be possible to craft flawless computerized representations of
what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial-intelligence expert Jack Mostow of Carnegie
Mellon contends that even severely limited language-recognition
programs can be surprisingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic interviews, which present relevant selections from a
previously filmed interview in response to spoken questions,
consistently leave interlocutors thinking they have talked to a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: Grand Illusion Studios has synthetic
interviews with sports figures on the Web at
www.grandillusionstudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   So Mostow created the Reading Tutor, a computer program that
coaches children in reading by using a variety of conversational
tricks. The software follows the child's spoken words and makes
encouraging noises to give the impression it is listening
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account how fluently or haltingly a student
speaks in addition to whether individual words are correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a small pilot study, students advanced an average of two
years in reading skills over eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Similar psychological tricks could help other imperfect
conversational systems perform better. Waibel predicts that people
will eventually be able to talk to a hodgepodge of special purpose
programs, each of which passes control to another if it recognizes
a conversation is wandering outside the bounds of its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Your digital travel agent might connect you with a news wire,
weather service or local tourist board, all using the same voice
during the same phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself, meanwhile, might be part of a voice-activated
wearable computer, with a tiny earpiece speaker and a microphone
woven into your shirt. To most observers, you'd appear to be
holding a conversation with thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Language pioneers like Waibel and Zue imagine the next
generation of kids will grow up conversing with machines as
naturally as they do with people.
</P>
<P>
   If you think today's posters, billboards and on-line ads are
intrusive, just wait. Twenty years from now, talking and listening
computers might be as ubiquitous as print is now.

   &UR; MICROSCOPE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electron microscopes are murder on their subjects, because the
devices work only in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of California at San Diego
have developed a more tender way to study tiny life.
</P>
<P>
   In the new system, an intense but harmless laser burst
illuminates the specimen _ such as this bit of algae, just 1/250
inch wide. Atoms in the specimen resonate in response to the laser
and generate a pulse of light.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping a laser through the algae and plotting the return
signals, scientists crafted this detailed image without creating
laboratory carnage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOSE-BOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many of his colleagues work on robots that can see, Andy
Russell, an electrical engineer at Monash University in Australia,
realized that a sense of smell could be helpful to robots as well,
allowing them to navigate along scent trails like ants leading
comrades to food.
</P>
<P>
   After a lead ant marks the path, a follower picks out the
aromatic marker with its antennae. When the left antenna hits the
trail, the ant turns until the right antenna picks it up, and so
forth. Russell's robots follow paths using the same method.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines that an odor detector could tell a troop of robots
where they have been, useful for sweeping for land mines or mopping
a floor. And a robotic explorer could blaze a trail for cheaper,
simpler followers _ for mineral prospecting or even planetary
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETURN TO THE FORGOTTEN PLANET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is an enigma _ moonlike on the outside, Earth-like on
the inside, hotter than molten lead yet possibly capped with water
ice.
</P>

   What little we know about the planet closest to the sun comes
from Mariner 10, which observed less than half of its surface in
1974 and 1975. But NASA is working on a return trip that should
answer a lot of lingering questions.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip has been a long time in the making because
Mercury is a tough target. It orbits just 36 million miles from the
sun, where intense solar gravity makes spacecraft visits difficult,
and fierce heat challenges spacecraft designers.
</P>
<P>
   The $286 million Messenger spacecraft, set for launch in 2004,
will benefit from a sun-blocking parasol and a loopy path that will
fly it several times by Venus and Mercury and then ease it into
orbit around Mercury in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Messenger will study Mercury's strangely dense
interior and strong magnetic field, reminiscent of Earth's. The
probe will also look for ice at Mercury's poles, where shadowed
craters remain frigid even when equatorial temperatures soar to 800
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury gives us the best chance to learn why Earth is unlike
Mars and Venus, why our planet is special,'' says Sean Solomon of
the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., who leads the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO FLY LIKE A FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary housefly performs wing strokes so complex that
conventional aerodynamics theory can't explain how it gets off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So Michael Dickinson of the University of California, Berkeley,
built a scaled-up set of mechanical wings that have at last
revealed how flies stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Flies flap their wings forward, then flip them over so the
leading edges point to the rear before flapping them back again.
Dickinson observed that the rotation of the wings speeds air over
them and provides extra lift.
</P>
<P>
   When the wings shift to the backward stroke, they also travel
through the faster-moving air from the forward stroke, which acts
like a head wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really spiffy mechanism, because the insect
recaptures energy it lost to the air,'' Dickinson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHINA'S ON FIRE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep beneath the rugged terrain of northern China, flames are
gnawing their way through the country's extensive coalfields.
</P>
<P>
   While the world focuses its attention on more visible crises,
China's underground fires are quietly consuming up to 200 million
tons of coal each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fires spew nearly as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
as do all the cars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John van Genderen, a geomorphologist at the International
Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences in the
Netherlands, is leading an international high-tech counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Heat measurements from satellites, airplanes and ground-based
detectors have been combined to determine the size and depth of the
fires and which direction they are burning.
</P>
<P>
   Some fires started naturally by lightning or spontaneous
combustion, others as a result of coal mining.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, extinguishing the smoldering coal is a laborious
process. Chinese workers suffocate surface fires by burying them
under a three-foot layer of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper fires, some of which have persisted for centuries, are
more difficult. Quenching them with water can produce explosive
methane fumes, so engineers pour a water-clay slurry into cracks
created by the heat of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Even after treatment, the ground can take several years to cool
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``These coal fires weren't given due attention in the past,''
says Anupma Prakash, a thermal remote-sensing expert who works with
van Genderen at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Chinese partners, Prakash has helped alert the
Chinese government to the magnitude of the problem, but he
recognizes that nature has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting out all the fires in one go is not possible. Sometimes
it is more feasible to isolate the fire and let it burn,'' he says.

SURGERY MISTAKE UNDERSCORES NEED FOR VIGILANCE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was supposed to be a routine repair of a fractured
left hip.
</P>
<P>
   Things went wrong from the start. No mark was made by the
surgeon or patient indicating which joint was to be operated on. No
nurse was assigned to the presurgery holding room, so no one could
catch that the joint had not been marked. None of the patient's
permanent X-rays were in the operating room, and when those X-rays
finally arrived, there was no indication which hip was to be
operated on. No attempt was made by the resident who was operating
to check the patient's chart or consent form.
</P>
<P>
   The result: An incision was made on the right hip, the wrong
one. Fifteen minutes later, after a nurse discovered the error,
that incision was closed and the left hip was repaired.
</P>
<P>
   How could so many mistakes happen at a widely respected teaching
hospital like Worcester's University of Massachusetts Memorial
Health Care?
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which
investigated the incident and released its report last week,
presented in detail what went wrong..
</P>
<P>
   The state also reported that the nurse who eventually caught the
mistake at first misread the operating room schedule and never read
the consent form, while the orthopedic resident told investigators
that he heard someone say ``yea'' when he asked, ``Is this the
right leg?''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ridley, the assistant commissioner of public health who
oversees hospital inspections, said: ``Wrong-site procedures do
occur. Over the last few years we've probably seen at least a
half-dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   While UMass Memorial is a participant in various error-reduction
programs, its mistake last February, officials said, offers
evidence that more vigilance is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Steinberg, chief medical officer at UMass Memorial,
added in a statement that the incident ``occurred because the
appropriate procedures were not followed'' and that it ``led to a
comprehensive examination of the relevant policies and procedures,
and revisions of practice that we are confident will eliminate the
potential for a similar occurrence.''

   &UR; MICROSCOPE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electron microscopes are murder on their subjects, because the
devices work only in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of California at San Diego
have developed a more tender way to study tiny life.
</P>
<P>
   In the new system, an intense but harmless laser burst
illuminates the specimen _ such as this bit of algae, just 1/250
inch wide. Atoms in the specimen resonate in response to the laser
and generate a pulse of light.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping a laser through the algae and plotting the return
signals, scientists crafted this detailed image without creating
laboratory carnage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOSE-BOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many of his colleagues work on robots that can see, Andy
Russell, an electrical engineer at Monash University in Australia,
realized that a sense of smell could be helpful to robots as well,
allowing them to navigate along scent trails like ants leading
comrades to food.
</P>
<P>
   After a lead ant marks the path, a follower picks out the
aromatic marker with its antennae. When the left antenna hits the
trail, the ant turns until the right antenna picks it up, and so
forth. Russell's robots follow paths using the same method.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines that an odor detector could tell a troop of robots
where they have been, useful for sweeping for land mines or mopping
a floor. And a robotic explorer could blaze a trail for cheaper,
simpler followers _ for mineral prospecting or even planetary
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETURN TO THE FORGOTTEN PLANET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is an enigma _ moonlike on the outside, Earth-like on
the inside, hotter than molten lead yet possibly capped with water
ice.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In a test this summer, Alexander Graethe of the European Media
Lab in Heidelberg, Germany, trudged through the rain-swept streets
of the city, asking directions from locals, with the aid of a
talking machine stashed in his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It translated his questions into German, then dictated people's
answers back to him in English. It even plotted his course on a map
display strapped to his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his colleagues booked flights and hotel rooms with
PCs, using the same software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please reserve two rooms for me at the Dom Hotel in Limburg,
Thursday to Sunday'' would come out the other end of the phone as
``Ich moechte zwei Zimmer im Dom-Hotel in Limburg bestellen, von
Donnerstag bis Sonntag.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the masterminds behind this attempt at computer
translation is Alexander Waibel, the director of Carnegie Mellon's
Interactive Systems Lab.
</P>
<P>
   His own bilingual existence, which requires shuttling back and
forth between Pittsburgh and the University of Karlsruhe in
Germany, has made him painfully aware of the difficulties involved.
The trial _ conducted in Pittsburgh; Heidelberg and Karlsruhe,
Germany; Grenoble, France; Kyoto, Japan; Trento, Italy; and Taejon,
South Korea _ was a showcase for C-STAR, an international
collaboration of researchers who are trying to get computers to
understand spoken words well enough to render them in another
language.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a small but notable step toward creating a universal
translator: a machine that allows seamless conversations between
people, or between people and machines, regardless of language or
software.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been working on machine translation for half a
century, yet only in the past few years have microchips grown
powerful enough to even approach the kind of processing human ears
and brains perform effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to do the job is called example-based
translation. It distills a few million words worth of translated
conversations into a giant set of syntax rules.
</P>
<P>
   A computer program containing those rules works like a tourist
with a phrase book, taking each word and plugging its translated
equivalent into the right place in a sentence in the target
language. The approach is crude but efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Department of Defense needed translation help
for English-speaking forces in Bosnia, Carnegie Mellon scientists
developed a rudimentary Serbo-Croatian-to-English system in a
matter of months, relying largely on example-based techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel and other researchers are exploring a more sophisticated
approach called Interlingua-based translation, which breaks down
utterances into an internal, language-neutral representation of
their meaning. Then, rather like what goes on in the head of a
multilingual person, it generates a translated sentence that says
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Interlingua requires a lot of programming skill, but it provides
a lot of flexibility in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interpretation rather than translation,'' Waibel says.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer hears ``It would please me very much if you
would be so kind as to reserve me a room in your fine hotel,'' it
extracts something like ``Reserve (object ``room'') (user ``me'')
(form polite).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the computer has captured the meaning of a sentence,
repeating it in another language may not even be necessary. If
someone has asked a question, the computer may be able to provide
an answer from its own database.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT's Laboratory for Computer Sciences, speech-recognition
expert Victor Zue is more interested in smart, voice-responsive
computers than in Waibel's Pentium-packed knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Oxygen Project, he is studying speech interfaces
that could bring a flood of computerized information to the vast
majority of the world that has yet to see PCs and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Zue predicts, people around the world may carry cheap,
souped-up cell phones that will enable them to tap into nearly
limitless networked resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the information on the Internet _ literature, news, chat
rooms, medical research _ will then be accessible to anyone who
picks up a handset and asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Before such grand changes can take place, there's a great deal
of work to be done. Current systems make a lot of mistakes when
they respond to a broad range of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Waibel says, is that people speak ``dysfluently'':
They repeat themselves, don't complete sentences and sometimes
don't even complete words.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists are striving to develop software that can
handle ``ers,'' ``umms'' and fragmentary sentences, then select
crucial words from garbled ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice interfaces also have limited vocabularies, confining
themselves to restricted subject areas in which each stage of
conversation allows only a few sensible responses.
</P>
<P>
   True conversations with computers may require overhauling the
way speech-recognition programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions range from new mathematical methods for
analyzing spoken sounds to computer programs that draw on vast
databases of abstract knowledge about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harper, who develops computer-language models at Purdue
University, points out that even human beings can hear the exact
same sounds in several different ways depending on their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are fond of the phrase ``how to wreck a nice beach''
_ or is that ``how to recognize speech''?
</P>
<P>
   Given the ambiguities of human language, she suspects it may
never be possible to craft flawless computerized representations of
what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial-intelligence expert Jack Mostow of Carnegie
Mellon contends that even severely limited language-recognition
programs can be surprisingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic interviews, which present relevant selections from a
previously filmed interview in response to spoken questions,
consistently leave interlocutors thinking they have talked to a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: Grand Illusion Studios has synthetic
interviews with sports figures on the Web at
www.grandillusionstudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   So Mostow created the Reading Tutor, a computer program that
coaches children in reading by using a variety of conversational
tricks. The software follows the child's spoken words and makes
encouraging noises to give the impression it is listening
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account how fluently or haltingly a student
speaks in addition to whether individual words are correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a small pilot study, students advanced an average of two
years in reading skills over eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Similar psychological tricks could help other imperfect
conversational systems perform better. Waibel predicts that people
will eventually be able to talk to a hodgepodge of special purpose
programs, each of which passes control to another if it recognizes
a conversation is wandering outside the bounds of its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Your digital travel agent might connect you with a news wire,
weather service or local tourist board, all using the same voice
during the same phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself, meanwhile, might be part of a voice-activated
wearable computer, with a tiny earpiece speaker and a microphone
woven into your shirt. To most observers, you'd appear to be
holding a conversation with thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Language pioneers like Waibel and Zue imagine the next
generation of kids will grow up conversing with machines as
naturally as they do with people.
</P>
<P>
   If you think today's posters, billboards and on-line ads are
intrusive, just wait. Twenty years from now, talking and listening
computers might be as ubiquitous as print is now.

would be so kind as to reserve me a room in your fine hotel,'' it
extracts something like ``Reserve (object ``room'') (user ``me'')
(form polite).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the computer has captured the meaning of a sentence,
repeating it in another language may not even be necessary. If
someone has asked a question, the computer may be able to provide
an answer from its own database.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT's Laboratory for Computer Sciences, speech-recognition
expert Victor Zue is more interested in smart, voice-responsive
computers than in Waibel's Pentium-packed knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Oxygen Project, he is studying speech interfaces
that could bring a flood of computerized information to the vast
majority of the world that has yet to see PCs and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Zue predicts, people around the world may carry cheap,
souped-up cell phones that will enable them to tap into nearly
limitless networked resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the information on the Internet _ literature, news, chat
rooms, medical research _ will then be accessible to anyone who
picks up a handset and asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Before such grand changes can take place, there's a great deal
of work to be done. Current systems make a lot of mistakes when
they respond to a broad range of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Waibel says, is that people speak ``dysfluently'':
They repeat themselves, don't complete sentences and sometimes
don't even complete words.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists are striving to develop software that can
handle ``ers,'' ``umms'' and fragmentary sentences, then select
crucial words from garbled ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice interfaces also have limited vocabularies, confining
themselves to restricted subject areas in which each stage of
conversation allows only a few sensible responses.
</P>
<P>
   True conversations with computers may require overhauling the
way speech-recognition programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions range from new mathematical methods for
analyzing spoken sounds to computer programs that draw on vast
databases of abstract knowledge about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harper, who develops computer-language models at Purdue
University, points out that even human beings can hear the exact
same sounds in several different ways depending on their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are fond of the phrase ``how to wreck a nice beach''
_ or is that ``how to recognize speech''?
</P>
<P>
   Given the ambiguities of human language, she suspects it may
never be possible to craft flawless computerized representations of
what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial-intelligence expert Jack Mostow of Carnegie
Mellon contends that even severely limited language-recognition
programs can be surprisingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic interviews, which present relevant selections from a
previously filmed interview in response to spoken questions,
consistently leave interlocutors thinking they have talked to a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: Grand Illusion Studios has synthetic
interviews with sports figures on the Web at
www.grandillusionstudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   So Mostow created the Reading Tutor, a computer program that
coaches children in reading by using a variety of conversational
tricks. The software follows the child's spoken words and makes
encouraging noises to give the impression it is listening
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account how fluently or haltingly a student
speaks in addition to whether individual words are correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a small pilot study, students advanced an average of two
years in reading skills over eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Similar psychological tricks could help other imperfect
conversational systems perform better. Waibel predicts that people
will eventually be able to talk to a hodgepodge of special purpose
programs, each of which passes control to another if it recognizes
a conversation is wandering outside the bounds of its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Your digital travel agent might connect you with a news wire,
weather service or local tourist board, all using the same voice
during the same phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself, meanwhile, might be part of a voice-activated
wearable computer, with a tiny earpiece speaker and a microphone
woven into your shirt. To most observers, you'd appear to be
holding a conversation with thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Language pioneers like Waibel and Zue imagine the next
generation of kids will grow up conversing with machines as
naturally as they do with people.
</P>
<P>
   If you think today's posters, billboards and on-line ads are
intrusive, just wait. Twenty years from now, talking and listening
computers might be as ubiquitous as print is now.

   &UR; MICROSCOPE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electron microscopes are murder on their subjects, because the
devices work only in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of California at San Diego
have developed a more tender way to study tiny life.
</P>
<P>
   In the new system, an intense but harmless laser burst
illuminates the specimen _ such as this bit of algae, just 1/250
inch wide. Atoms in the specimen resonate in response to the laser
and generate a pulse of light.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping a laser through the algae and plotting the return
signals, scientists crafted this detailed image without creating
laboratory carnage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOSE-BOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many of his colleagues work on robots that can see, Andy
Russell, an electrical engineer at Monash University in Australia,
realized that a sense of smell could be helpful to robots as well,
allowing them to navigate along scent trails like ants leading
comrades to food.
</P>
<P>
   After a lead ant marks the path, a follower picks out the
aromatic marker with its antennae. When the left antenna hits the
trail, the ant turns until the right antenna picks it up, and so
forth. Russell's robots follow paths using the same method.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines that an odor detector could tell a troop of robots
where they have been, useful for sweeping for land mines or mopping
a floor. And a robotic explorer could blaze a trail for cheaper,
simpler followers _ for mineral prospecting or even planetary
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETURN TO THE FORGOTTEN PLANET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is an enigma _ moonlike on the outside, Earth-like on
the inside, hotter than molten lead yet possibly capped with water
ice.
</P>
<P>
   What little we know about the planet closest to the sun comes
from Mariner 10, which observed less than half of its surface in
1974 and 1975. But NASA is working on a return trip that should
answer a lot of lingering questions.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip has been a long time in the making because
Mercury is a tough target. It orbits just 36 million miles from the
sun, where intense solar gravity makes spacecraft visits difficult,
and fierce heat challenges spacecraft designers.
</P>
<P>
   The $286 million Messenger spacecraft, set for launch in 2004,
will benefit from a sun-blocking parasol and a loopy path that will
fly it several times by Venus and Mercury and then ease it into
orbit around Mercury in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Messenger will study Mercury's strangely dense
interior and strong magnetic field, reminiscent of Earth's. The
probe will also look for ice at Mercury's poles, where shadowed
craters remain frigid even when equatorial temperatures soar to 800
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury gives us the best chance to learn why Earth is unlike
Mars and Venus, why our planet is special,'' says Sean Solomon of
the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., who leads the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO FLY LIKE A FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary housefly performs wing strokes so complex that
conventional aerodynamics theory can't explain how it gets off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So Michael Dickinson of the University of California, Berkeley,
built a scaled-up set of mechanical wings that have at last
revealed how flies stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Flies flap their wings forward, then flip them over so the
leading edges point to the rear before flapping them back again.
Dickinson observed that the rotation of the wings speeds air over
them and provides extra lift.
</P>
<P>
   When the wings shift to the backward stroke, they also travel
through the faster-moving air from the forward stroke, which acts
like a head wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really spiffy mechanism, because the insect
recaptures energy it lost to the air,'' Dickinson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHINA'S ON FIRE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep beneath the rugged terrain of northern China, flames are
gnawing their way through the country's extensive coalfields.
</P>
<P>
   While the world focuses its attention on more visible crises,
China's underground fires are quietly consuming up to 200 million
tons of coal each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fires spew nearly as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
as do all the cars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John van Genderen, a geomorphologist at the International
Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences in the
Netherlands, is leading an international high-tech counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Heat measurements from satellites, airplanes and ground-based
detectors have been combined to determine the size and depth of the
fires and which direction they are burning.
</P>
<P>
   Some fires started naturally by lightning or spontaneous
combustion, others as a result of coal mining.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, extinguishing the smoldering coal is a laborious
process. Chinese workers suffocate surface fires by burying them
under a three-foot layer of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper fires, some of which have persisted for centuries, are
more difficult. Quenching them with water can produce explosive
methane fumes, so engineers pour a water-clay slurry into cracks
created by the heat of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Even after treatment, the ground can take several years to cool
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``These coal fires weren't given due attention in the past,''
says Anupma Prakash, a thermal remote-sensing expert who works with
van Genderen at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Chinese partners, Prakash has helped alert the
Chinese government to the magnitude of the problem, but he
recognizes that nature has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting out all the fires in one go is not possible. Sometimes
it is more feasible to isolate the fire and let it burn,'' he says.

<P>
   Tick, tick, tick. As the millennium looms, film is an endangered
species, an endangered word. Images on celluloid with sprocket
holes will soon become collector's items, along with the round flat
cans they travel in. Before long, digital images from digital
cameras will be transmitted via satellite and decoded at theaters.
Film will barely make it across the millennial finish line. It
probably won't last until 2020, much less Y3K. Yet it took our
century on some terrific rides. It's been the biggest ride in the
theme park known as the 20th century. Although the millennial
passage ends with TV mopping up after movies, it's movies that got
us through most of the century, feeding us models of what was cool,
waving the baton over collective dreams we learned to dream in the
dark.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking life spans of new technologies now make us speak
of image delivery systems. But what they deliver won't change.
Stories. Big pop myths that have been with us since shadows
flickered on the walls of caves, serving us up to ourselves,
arranging experience, giving form to dreams, showing us how to
look, act, and behave. Film and projectors will go away; we'll call
films something else. But people spent the century learning to
believe in film. That won't change. We'll still sit in big spaces
in the dark. Those big images will imprint with their unique
psychovisual authority. Hitler, Stalin, and Mao (the first two were
big film fans) may have been insane, but they weren't stupid. All
three knew that what film could do for Chaplin and Garbo, it could
do for them.
</P>
<P>
   Although film came late to the art party, and most of its
greatest artists were more comfortable thinking of themselves as
craftsmen, there's no question that it's the century's dominant art
form. Prove it to yourself by doing a little data retrieval from
your 20th-century cranial attic. Our brains are awash in imagistic
flotsam. We all carry bits of hundreds of movies in our head,
massive collages. Umberto Eco once wrote that in certain cases a
movie is no longer a movie. It becomes part of a larger entity _
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Eco was writing about ``Casablanca.'' Before he took on eternal
life in cyberspace, Bogey had long been living in the heads of
millions of us, looking creased and world-weary in his white dinner
jacket, masking his idealism with cynicism. He has no end of
company. Cary Grant survives, immaculately tailored, suave, edgy.
E. T. is there, looking pickled. Marlon Brando's Godfather, too,
mumbling an offer you can't refuse. Westerns are bookended on John
Wayne's face, open and hopeful in ``Stagecoach,'' bitter and
misogynistic in ``The Searchers.'' Katharine Hepburn or Bette Davis
could have straightened him out. A leering Groucho Marx could have
shriveled him with a wisecrack. Maybe you'll conjure up Dietrich
slinking toward a white piano. Or Fred Astaire dancing away from
one. Or Cagney or De Niro or Schwarzenegger smashing one.
</P>
<P>
   They're all there. Darth Vader, Meryl Streep, and Jack
Nicholson, too. Alfred Hitchcock, Audrey Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart.
And that's only the Hollywood contingent. What about Jean Gabin,
Jean Renoir, Catherine Deneuve, Francois Truffaut, Gerard
Depardieu? France, after all, gave film its public launch when the
Lumiere brothers hung a sheet in a room in 1895 and sent audience
members shrieking out into the street at the sight of a locomotive
rushing toward them. Edison and his assistant, William Kennedy
Laurie Dickson, a native of France who actually invented the movie
camera credited to the Wizard of Menlo Park, were first with film,
which they saw as an adjunct to recorded sound. None of these
pioneers knew exactly what they had, never imagined what it could
turn into.
</P>
<P>
   Movies deny time, freeze moments, render them immune from aging,
trump death with immortal looping. Nothing has shaped our
consciousness as film has. Shakespeare wrote his plays for the ear.
In this century, art is aimed at the eye _ as portal to the
subconscious. Film never was an intellectual construct: more
primal, it flies in under our radar. It wasn't the potency of cheap
music that should have struck the Noel Coward of ``Private Lives,''
but the potency of cheap films.
</P>
<P>
   Silent film quickly became the universal art form. At its most
potent, film is about faces, about messages sent from behind the
eyes of big, shimmering faces. And the silents stopped time with
light on the faces of stars _ Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Rudolph
Valentino, Clara Bow, John Barrymore, Garbo. In Hollywood's hands,
film became mostly about stars, about colossal silvery revelries.
</P>
<P>
   At first, film was about whatever the camera was pointed at. The
first Lumiere film on the first Lumiere program was of factory
workers at quitting itme. Grainy and flickery as those early shorts
seem today, their lifelike look grabbed audiences. So did the
illusion of motion. What people saw not only looked real _ it acted
real. Only the ignorant condescend to early silents. Often they're
bursting with energy and innovation. The grammar of film was put in
place by D. W. Griffith in the United States, by Abel Gance in
France, by Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Dovzhenko, and Dziga-Vertov in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And we can still understand the same film language. ``The Great
Train Robbery'' of 1903 is more than just exciting to watch. It's
not only the model for Westerns; it's more dynamic, more thrilling
than most Westerns that followed it. Eventually, of course,
Westerns turned our grabbing and transforming of a continent into
myth _ then made war on the myth in such films as ``My Darling
Clementine,'' ``The Wild Bunch,'' and ``Unforgiven.'' It was a
natural match _ a country born of self-reinvention hooking up with
a medium based on self-reinvention. Not that the recasting of
experience into palatable form was an American invention. World
cinema has played the game, too, often for big psychic stakes; one
need only recall Japan rejiggering its nuclear trauma via
``Godzilla'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   So we're not talking about a yawning gulf between that train
that terrified Parisians in 1895 and the locomotive crash that
thrilled audiences in ``The Fugitive'' in 1993. As much as it has
been about romance, adventure, and comedy, film has also been about
spectacle, about visceral thrills and movies' capacity for
delivering them. At the heart of film's appeal is its ability to
make private fantasies communal _ whether love stories or train
wrecks. Or even simple speed.
</P>
<P>
   The one constant throughout the history of film is change. When
sound arrived, people still argue, the greatest era in film comedy
died. Not just Keaton and Chaplin with their exquisite grace and
astonishing inventiveness, but the Keystone Kops, with their sheer
pizazz and flivvers souped up by running the projector fast.
Comedy's energy level dropped when sound came in, though screwball
comedy soon proved that sound could mean the addition of wit.
Paradoxically, the Depression unleashed a gusher of gusto _ urban
(and urbane) comedies: ``The Awful Truth,'' ``Bringing Up Baby,''
``The Thin Man,'' ``It Happened One Night.'' Working-girl
melodramas, too: ``Skyscraper Souls,'' ``Sadie McKee,'' ``Stella
Dallas,'' ``Platinum Blonde.'' And gangster movies that jumped off
the screen: ``Scarface,'' ``Public Enemy,'' ``Little Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   In England, Hitchcock put his German Expressionist training to
resourceful use, fashioning a string of crisp suspense
entertainments: ``The 39 Steps,'' ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,''
``The Lady Vanishes.'' Then he came to this country and did it all
over again. In France, Renoir gave us ``Grand Illusion'' and ``The
Rules of the Game.'' Eisenstein dominated Russian cinema with
``Strike,'' ``Battleship Potemkin,'' ``Alexander Nevsky,'' and,
Stalin permitting, ``Ivan the Terrible.'' And Hollywood
extinguished a comet named Orson Welles almost as soon as he rose
with ``Citizen Kane'' by hacking away at his even greater ``The
Magnificent Ambersons'' and essentially drumming him out of the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Color, arriving with postwar prosperity, was a mixed blessing,
slowing things, yanking film away from the stylization that enabled
it to reach the dream state more readily in black and white _
especially in genre pictures. Film noir transmitted entrapment and
dread _ of nuclear uncontrollability, of strong women, who were
being crowded back into traditional roles after having been
liberated by performing many hitherto male jobs in World War II.
But mainstream postwar film almost did itself in, first by ignoring
TV, then by generating too many dead-whale spectacles in an effort
to give the public what TV could not. For every ``Lawrence of
Arabia' or ``Bridge on the River Kwai,'' Hollywood cranked out
stillbirths like ``King of Kings,'' ``El Cid,'' ``The Fall of the
Roman Empire,'' or ``Cleopatra.'' Eventually Hollywood realized TV
wasn't an enemy, but another film market. Steven Spielberg and
George Lucas rediscovered and reinvented spectacle in ``Jaws,''
``E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' and the ``Star Wars'' and
``Indiana Jones'' series, putting the fun back in bigness as
expressed through amped-up Saturday serials.

   At the same time, the '70s brought to fruition the postwar
American rebel acting school led by Brando, James Dean, Paul
Newman, and Jack Nicholson. The door was opened to films _ ``Bonnie
and Clyde,'' ``Easy Rider'' _ that challenged Hollywood's
business-as-usual reinforcement of the status quo even more than
``The Blair Witch Project'' freaked the big studios this year
because it was a huge hit they had nothing to do with. What
Hollywood didn't realize at first was that the antiestablishment
cachet of these films was largely what made them popular. When it
did, it threw lots of money at making silly films trying to nail
the youth market. But the Vietnam era had led to a challenging of
values, a rise of antiheroes. Clint Eastwood's alienated loner
succeeded John Wayne and his retooled Monroe Doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro broke
the ethnicity barrier, giving us ``The Graduate,'' ``The
Godfather,'' and ``Mean Streets.'' Mike Nichols, Martin Scorsese,
and Francis Ford Coppola became important directors. Blaxploitation
movies _ determined to go beyond the saintly presences of Sidney
Poitier and Harry Belafonte _ opened the door to serious black
filmmaking aspirations. A young generation of black filmmakers, led
by Spike Lee, has followed, and African-American stars _ Denzel
Washington, Angela Bassett, Laurence Fishburne, Whitney Houston _
have joined the A-list.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, also, America discovered an appetite for foreign
film. Serious filmgoers wouldn't think of not seeing the latest
Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Truffaut, Antonioni, Godard, Satyajit
Ray. America also began to reevaluate and revere figures it had
taken for granted _ Hitchcock, John Ford, Howard Hawks. And it
stopped being ashamed of a weakness for trash, once the doctrine of
camp was invented to rationalize it. It was more than a case of
anything goes: It was nothing less than a reversal of high and low
culture. Hollywood never was comfortable with art, really. Its idea
of art was a handful of lavish, stuffy spectacles that it called
artistic. Suddenly, Hollywood relaxed, or at least relaxed its
standards. Comic books (rechristened graphic novels in a
post-literate age) became films. TV shows became films, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, today's films in many cases are becoming TV.
Writers, directors, and the executives who bankroll them often come
from TV, bringing the same reflexes. TV screens, thanks to the
growth of ancillary markets, have become film's ultimate
destination. It sometimes seems that film has shrunk, changing from
something larger than life to something smaller than life. Of
course, it tried to bulk up again in the Reagan-Bush years, with
``Top Gun,'' ``Terminator 2,'' ``Total Recall,'' and the ``Batman''
franchise. ``Jurassic Park'' blurred once and for all the line
between films and theme parks. For all the clucking about the huge
sums present-day films cost, the aggregate Hollywood budget of
several billion dollars approximates the cost of tailfins for the
Stealth bomber. And besides, I suspect that, in our hearts, hearing
about all that money feeds a certain perverse satisfaction. If
Hollywood can't come up with quality, it's some consolation that it
can at least still come up with lavish excess.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, some of us believed that small, personal films
_ many made in foreign languages _ would supplant the big
sensory-jolt movies. Instead, big, technologically sophisticated
Hollywood action spectacles are driving out the national cinemas of
Europe and Japan. It's encouraging to note that the cinema of
China, the rest of Asia, Africa, and Latin America seems able to
renew itself. And even more plentiful than small, personal films
from these countries have been films from American independents. A
generation ago, they hardly existed. Now they matter. As better,
cheaper equipment arrives, they'll matter more. The Internet
reinforces the up-for-grabs feeling. I find it hard to believe that
people will switch in big numbers to watching feature-length movies
on the Internet any time soon, not when DVD is moving in. But the
Internet is a terrific calling card, a tool to create visibility
and awareness.
</P>
<P>
   It also plays mightily to widespread anti-monolith sentiments.
The bigness of the studios just as often works against them as for
them, especially with a generation that listens to music by a group
called Rage Against the Machine. In fact, opposing forces seem to
be at work as the millennium aproaches. Ironically, George Lucas
could emerge as the prophet of the new century, with his ``Star
Wars'' vision of a world ruled by trade federations, with the role
of the Evil Empire played by merged multinational coroporations
sporting budgets larger than those of many countries. On the other
hand, monoliths are breaking down, as evidenced by the fact that
networks are losing their grip on audience shares. Newspapers and
magazines, too: The so-called big media no longer have a monopoly
on public visibility. For every ``Jurassic Park'' or ``Phantom
Menace'' in the '90s, there's been a ``Pulp Fiction'' or ``The
Crying Game'' or ``Full Monty'' _ something original that came out
of nowhere to rebuke Hollywood for becoming bigger, slicker, and
glitzier, an assembly line for product (apt word!) with the
spiritual energy of a dead battery.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, today's stars aren't the actors we see in movies.
They're the people who control movies. Artists and executives have
been at one another's throats in Hollywood since day one. What's
changed is that money and power have become what's sexy in an era
when any video-store clerk can quote you weekend grosses. As the
century ends, Europe apes Hollywood and Hollywood apes Citizen
Kane. Hollywood no longer is just about movies. Hollywood sees
itself _ but fears it isn't _ at the center of a reinvented
vertical corporation finding multiple ways to sell the same item,
ranging from viewings on ancillary outlets to merchandising, to TV
and theme-park franchising. And Hollywood wonders why it's losing
audience share to video games.
</P>
<P>
   The film business may yet be replaced by the image-delivery
business. IMAX and other new projection techniques (recalling
CinemaScope and the technologies of the '60s) rear their
three-dimensional heads. Filmmakers now have competition from
alternative dream factories. Edison's dream of fitting images to
music lives on in music videos. Movies no longer have a captive
audience for models of what's cool or captivating. But movies' only
hope is to keep trying to force its unnatural marriages between
artists and pitchmen. Administered with enough of a free hand,
hokum has always been as good a rocket fuel as any for movies. And
hokum was, is, and ever shall be Hollywood's stock in trade.
Perhaps the most underappreciated millennium-themed movie is
Kathryn Bigelow's 1995 ``Strange Days.'' What's memorable is not
its apocalyptic LA, but its gadgetry, especially that tinny
electronic claw that Ralph Fiennes and his shady buddies clap on
their heads to receive images directly in their cerebral cortices.
If movies have taught us anything, it's that today's peep show is
tomorrow's ``Intolerance'' or ``Gone With the Wind'' or
``Casablanca.''

AVERTING MEDICAL MISTAKES A PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The top brass were set to meet all day one Friday to
brainstorm on how hospitals in their CareGroup chain could root out
medication mistakes and other potentially deadly errors _ then came
word that the hospitals, already facing tens of millions of dollars
in debt, were even worse off than imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The chief financial officer immediately called for a delay in
the discussion on errors to zero in on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief executive officer said no. ``I said, `We're going
to have the meeting on errors, and we'll work on the financial
thing on Saturday,' '' said Dr. James Reinertsen, who runs
CareGroup and its flagship hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, recalling the meeting last spring. ``I'd said before that
our goal is to become the safest place in the world. . . . Now I
was sending a very strong signal to our management team and
everyone connected with it that we really meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what the national Institute of Medicine called
for last week in a landmark report on how faulty diagnoses and
other medical errors kill as many as 100,000 Americans each year.
It is also one of many signs that Massachusetts is out in front in
attacking a crisis the institute said costs more than $15 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the Bay State's trailblazing role is everywhere. The
agency that regulates doctors has pushed its powers to embrace
hospitals, ordering them to admit when something bad happens and to
fix it. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has one of
the nation's toughest must-tell requirements, while the recently
passed state budget provides more inspectors and more protection
for whistle-blowers. The Massachusetts Hospital Association has
been so effective in rallying the medical community that it will be
a model for a program to be unveiled this week by the American
Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a superb model in Massachusetts,'' said Dr. Lucien
Leape of the Harvard School of Public Health, one of the authors of
the Institute of Medicine report. ``We probably erred in our report
in not citing that model, fleshing it, and showing how it's done. .
. . We can't say we here in Massachusetts are a model for the world
because we haven't proved we make a difference yet, but yeah,
others ought to be trying to do these things we are trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy
of Sciences, tapped the nation's top specialists on errors to
assess the problem and propose solutions. While its report last
week was praised for its dramatic assessment of how deadly mistakes
can be, those tolls came from earlier studies by Leape and others
and were reported in a Globe series earlier this year. What was new
was the call for top-to-bottom changes in America's health care
system, from creating a National Center for Patient Safety, to
setting mistake-reduction goals, to ensuring that all states
require hospitals to report their most serious errors.
</P>
<P>
   The report also served as a wake-up call of all that can go
wrong and how those mistakes kill more people each year than
highway accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis O'Leary got his wake-up call years ago, and he said
he realizes he has to do more to root out errors in his role as
president of the Illinois-based Joint Commission on the
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. So, starting next month,
the joint commission no longer will give hospitals 24-hour notice
of its random surveys and it no longer will award special
commendations, a competition that had hospitals focusing more on
scores than on safer facilities.
</P>
<P>
   All those steps, O'Leary said, amount to ``symbolism,'' ``but
they are important symbols'' that the commission is a watchdog not
the lapdog it has been accused of being.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals around the country have been moving on their own to
determine how errors happen and how they can be reduced. LDS
Hospital in Salt Lake City has crafted 60 error-reduction models.
The Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Kaiser Permanente health network in
California, and the Veterans Administration also have been
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is more going on than in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the Massachusetts Coalition on the Prevention of
Medical Errors. Earlier this year it gave Bay State hospitals 12
recommendations for reducing medication errors: from packaging
drugs in individual doses to having pharmacists rather than floor
nurses mix intravenous solutions. Its drug warnings also have gone
out to nursing homes, and the coalition plans to issue comparable
guidance on everything from how to ensure surgeons perform the
correct procedures to safe uses for patient restraints.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, serious errors must be reported to the
Department of Public Health and are available to the public.
Reports also must be made to the Board of Registration in Medicine.
The board receives four times as many reports as the health
department. It does not require the names of individuals, keeps its
findings confidential, and has doctors advise on how to correct the
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are a model. We don't go out there and try to put
the finger on doctors and nurses. We're doing the right thing,
namely, making sure we hold the hospital's feet to the fire,'' said
Dr. Arnold Relman, who runs the board's hospital safety program and
is editor in chief emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Massachusetts is so far ahead is that some of
the nation's most dramatic errors happened here, including the
chemotherapy overdose in 1994 that led to the death of Boston Globe
health columnist Betsy Lehman. With nearly every high-profile
error, the hospital involved substantially upgraded its safety
systems and taught other hospitals to do the same. It happened
first at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where Lehman was
treated, and later at Newton-Wellesley Hospital and Sturdy Memorial
in Attleboro, which had their own widely publicized troubles.

MAN FOR THE CENTURY: THOMAS ALVAH EDISON GAVE US LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So who's it going to be _ Stalin or Hitler? Churchill
or Roosevelt? Einstein or Gandhi or Martin Luther King?
</P>
<P>
   The great debate is coming to a close over who will win the
title ``Man of the Century'' _ or ``Person of the Century,'' as at
least half the planet (and admirers of Mother Teresa) would prefer
it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prize that several publications, most dramatically Time
magazine, will bestow in coming weeks, in an era-ending ritual that
is inherently absurd _ how could one person epitomize 100 years of
earthly existence? _ but also good sport.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit: A case could be made for any of the
larger-than-life figures cited above. This, after all, has been the
Century of Totalitarianism, the Century of the Warrior-Statesman,
the Century of Peaceful Disobedience, the Century of the Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But looking beyond the sheen of politics and into the structures
of daily life _ the transformations that have set the 20th century
apart from the eons preceding _ a few things stand out: the
incandescent bulb, which lit up the night; the electric power
plant, which spread light and energy to virtually every town around
the world; the motion picture, which forever altered the way we
look at ourselves; the phonograph, which preserved sounds and music
that would otherwise vanish into the air.
</P>
<P>
   All these things were invented by one man, Thomas Alva Edison,
and if anyone deserves to be called the most influential soul of
the century _ the person who shaped the century most broadly and
deeply _ Edison fits the bill.
</P>
<P>
   True, he worked out his most famous inventions toward the end of
the 19th century, but they were not in much use, nor was their full
impact clear, until after the start of the 20th. He also lived long
enough into the 20th century _ he died in 1931, at the age of 84 _
to see his creations transform the fabric of society and to find
himself revered as a central figure of the modern era. &QL; 
 &QL; 
1,093 patents, one person &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edison successfully filed 1,093 patents for inventions, the most
granted to one person. The biographer Robert Conot has likened them
to ``the building blocks of an obelisk rising out of the history of
the world,'' adding, ``No other man has ever been responsible for
striking the spring of so much wealth, nor had such influence on
the lives of so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   He was obsessive in his search for nature's secrets, oblivious
to others, disheveled, often working 24 hours straight, except for
frequent five-minute naps, which he had a knack for taking
anywhere, including on his lab's hard floor.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, he casually talked of devising ``a minor
invention every 10 days and a big thing every six months or so.''
And he very nearly kept to his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   However, contrary to schoolbooks that paint him as a lone
tinkerer, Edison also created the first modern research laboratory,
with vast staffs, project teams, and outside funding. He was the
first inventor to link up with the titans of corporate finance,
forging a new kind of relationship between technology and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The incandescent lamp and the electric power plant would be
cause enough for giving Edison the century's prize. Before their
invention, in the age of gas and kerosene lamps, only a few homes
had enough ``candlepower'' for reading at night. Today, the typical
household generates as much light as an entire village of the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   But electricity meant more than the lightbulb, of course. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The skyscraper's the limit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It meant that elevators, previously powered by steam, could rise
to limitless heights, making the skyscraper possible.
</P>
<P>
   Factories, which had relied on coal and water for their power,
continued to grow in the cities, spurring an urban migration.
</P>
<P>
   Horses, once the mainstay of urban transportation, could be put
out to pasture and replaced with electric trains and trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists could drill and repair cavities, rather than simply
pull teeth. Everything became quicker and easier, making work more
productive and leaving more time _ including night time _ for
leisure. Or more work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking things about Edison's geyser of
invention is that his was a genius largely untrammeled by
education. The son of a ne'er-do-well grain and lumber
entrepreneur, he dropped out of school at age 12 (though he later
took a college chemistry course when he felt the need). It is also
striking that the things he made and the puzzles he solved, for the
most part, were not on the verge of being made or solved by anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The electron had not been discovered when he started work on
electricity in the 1870s. The measurement of inductance and
resistance was dimly grasped, at best. As one of his researchers,
Francis Jehl, later put it, ``There were no instruments for
measuring volts and amperes _ it was like a carpenter without his
foot rule.''
</P>
<P>
   His breakthroughs, which he announced with a showman's gusto
before a pack of reporters, were often ridiculed by the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   After he proclaimed success at designing an incandescent
lightbulb, the British Parliament formed a board of inquiry, which
concluded that Edison's claim was physically impossible and
``unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar derision greeted his claim of inventing the phonograph.
A Yale University professor assured the New York Sun, ``The idea of
a talking machine is ridiculous.'' The heads of the French Academy
scoffed that Edison was obviously a fraud and a ventriloquist.
</P>
<P>
   When these inventions were finally proved real beyond all doubt,
a reporter asked Lord Kelvin, a physicist and the most
distinguished inventor of the day, why no one else had thought of
these things. ``The only answer I can think of,'' he replied, ``is
that no one else is Edison.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A World's Fair plaudit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The World's Fair of 1904 in St. Louis, with its
home-of-the-future exhibit called ``Palace of Electricity,'' marked
the first recognition that his inventions would change the nature
and tempo of life everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Thomas A. Edison and the Modernization of
America,'' Martin V. Melosi said that during the 20th century's
first decade, the number of industrial electric motors expanded by
580 percent. By 1920, companies were making electric stoves,
washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners. By 1927, two-thirds
of US households had electricity.
</P>
<P>
   When Edison first demonstrated his feats, usually in or near his
lab in Menlo Park, N.J., or, later, West Orange (which stands
preserved as a landmark site by the National Park Service), they
were viewed as almost supernatural events, greeted with an awe
unmatched until men walked on the moon. He was hailed as ``The
Wizard of Menlo Park,'' ``The Prometheus of Light,'' ``The Napoleon
of Science.''
</P>
<P>
   When he displayed the talking machine at the 1889 Exhibition in
Paris, 30,000 people lined up to see it, an attraction second only
to the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   When his first movies were shown in a Broadway parlor _
90-second flicks, viewed through a nickel-drop peephole, heralded
by a banner that read ``The Wizard's Latest Invention!'' _ riots
nearly broke out as impatient crowds waited all day and long into
the night for a peek. &QL;

NEW OSHA STANDARDS: GOOD FOR EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many businesses across the nation say it would be a
bureaucratic nightmare that could cost them untold billions of
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration _ OSHA _ says,
on the other hand, that its proposed new ergonomics standard could
prevent 300,000 job-related injuries a year and save businesses an
estimated $9 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are designed to prevent musculoskeletal disorders
(known as MSDs) which, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
constitute the largest number of job-related injuries and illness
problems in the US workplace.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the new OSHA standard would be the most significant
worker and safety law of the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and their allies
in Congress have been trying to block passage of the proposed
standard. But if they succeed, businesses could end up paying
billions more in costs because of work-related injuries that are
preventable. Already, companies are spending $15 million to $20
million per year in workers' compensation costs for work-related
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Under OSHA's proposed rules, employers must: provide for
management leadership and employee participation; inform workers of
common MSD hazards; analyze problem jobs and control the hazard;
provide training about MSDs; provide medical attention to injured
workers; and occasionally evaluate whether the chosen method to
control the hazard is working.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would cover general industry employers and workers in
manual-handling or manufacturing jobs at about 1.6 million work
sites. Those rules would also eventually apply at other general
industry sites at which one or more workers had suffered from a
musculoskeletal disorder. Construction, maritime, and agricultural
industry workers would be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed standard is not as far-reaching as it could have
been. Overall, it would apply to only 25 percent of general
industry employers; the other 75 percent would not be affected
unless a documented, work-related injury occurred at their work
sites.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA defines ergonomics as ``the science of fitting the job to
the worker.'' Ergonomic programs help prevent musculoskeletal
disorders when there is a mismatch between a worker and his task.
</P>
<P>
   Such mismatches have resulted in 1.8 million injuries related to
overexertion or repetitive motion, and some 600,000 of these
resulted in lost time from work.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups argue that the new standard would cost employers
far more than do the current number of work-related injuries, but
if OSHA's numbers and fact sheets are even half-correct, opponents
may have a tough time explaining why OSHA's proposal should not
become law.
</P>
<P>
   Along with preventing an average of 300,000 musculoskeletal
disorders per year over 10 years, the new standard would:
</P>
<P>
   --Protect 27.3 million workers at 1.9 million work sites.
</P>
<P>
   --Save $22,500 in direct costs for each MSD prevented ($6.75
billion per year), for a total average savings of $9 billion each
year. According to OSHA, the total cost to employers for fixing
work stations to meet the new standard would be $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the obvious benefits, physical and financial, to
both the employers and their workers, business groups are using
every available tactic to delay passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   At their prodding, Congress recently passed a bill that would
prohibit OSHA from issuing a final ergonomic standard until the
National Academy of Science completes another study in 2001. But
OSHA sees this for what it is _ another delaying tactic.
</P>
<P>
   In its report titled ``Misleading Myths on Ergonomics,'' OSHA
said that a second NAS study ``is unlikely to alter the firm
conclusions from the first that musculoskeletal disorders are
work-related and that ergonomic programs can reduce the incidence
of these injuries.'' The second NAS study, OHSA adds, ``is
essentially another analysis of much of the same body of evidence
that (the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or
NIOSH) and NAS reviewed previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposal contend that ergonomics has not proved
that musculoskeletal disorders are necessarily related to the
workplace. However, in 1997 NIOSH _ after evaluating 600 studies _
concluded that there is a link. NIOSH's finding was confirmed by 27
peer reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   While OSHA acknowledges that workplace injuries and illnesses
are on the decline, it notes that work-related MSDs ``remain the
most prevalent, most expensive, and most preventable occupational
injuries in the US today.''
</P>
<P>
   Musculoskeletal disorders account for more than one-third (or
600,000) of the injuries and illnesses each year that force people
to miss work. An additional 1.2 million injuries are severe enough
to cause workers to seek medical attention or light duty. There is
no doubt among specialists in MSD that OSHA's proposed standard
could dramatically reduce the problem.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not pass this most important bill, working
people will have a great opportunity to make their voices heard in
the next election, before many more thousands of them miss work
with injuries that an ergonomic standard could have prevented.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... for a peek.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few spectators could have foreseen how dramatically these
marvels would alter daily life. Edison did.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1878, Edison listed the possible uses of the
phonograph _ dictation without a stenographer, books for the blind,
music (``the phonograph will undoubtedly be liberally devoted to
music,'' he wrote), and the preservation of speeches after the
speaker is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, given that many of those who gaped at the machine,
including the industrialists who would end up making lots of money
from it, saw little more than a parlor trick.
</P>
<P>
   His evolution as an inventor both reflected and shaped his
times. Born in 1847, Edison came of age during the Civil War, as
the frontier was closing, steel mills were prospering, railroads
were expanding. There was a great need for new technology to
process raw materials, devise consumer products, transport both,
and unify the continent into a network of suppliers and markets.
</P>
<P>
   Edison was hardly the only one trying to fill those needs. In
the 40 years following the Civil War, 1 million patents were filed
with the US government. Yet no inventor approached Edison in
volume, versatility, or doggedness.
</P>
<P>
   During his hunt for the ideal material to use as filament in his
lamp, Edison tested, as he put it later, ``no fewer than 6,000
vegetable growths.'' By chance, he happened upon a strip of bamboo
from the lab's fan and, finding it highly durable under extreme
heat, scattered his men to the West Indies, Japan, and Central
America (one of them died of yellow fever in Cuba) in search of the
best bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists of a later era would roll their eyes at this
scattershot approach. Even Karl Compton, in an otherwise
appreciative obituary in Science magazine, acknowledged that it led
Edison to ``many futile experiments.'' However, as he also noted,
Edison was not just inventing new products but discovering new
principles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Staying the course &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of his inventions, seen in retrospect, followed a logical
course, one leading to the next. This may explain why he threw so
many scientists for a loop; they weren't following his course,
weren't sifting through the 1,001 things he had accumulated from
his earlier experiments.
</P>
<P>
   He started as a telegraph operator, and his first invention, at
age 16, was for his own use _ a device that repeated a Morse code
signal at a slower speed, so he could more easily transcribe the
messages.
</P>
<P>
   This led him to invent a machine that converted the Morse code's
dots and dashes into Roman letters, which he turned into the ticker
tape that conveyed stock-market prices to brokerage houses. It was
the first invention that made him money and put him in touch with
big business.
</P>
<P>
   That invention led him to design a wire that could
simultaneously transmit telegraphic messages in opposite
directions. That led to the idea of a telephone. When Alexander
Graham Bell barely beat him, he rechanneled his own idea for a
telephone speaker into the phonograph, which sparked the idea for
movies. (``It should be possible,'' he wrote in his notebook, ``to
devise an apparatus to do for the eye what the phonograph was
designed to do for the ear.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he designed improvements to the phone,
including a carbon-button transmitter that made the signal much
louder and clearer. This experiment with carbon led to his design
for an incandescent lamp, and on it went.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Josephson, an early biographer, estimated that by the
time of Edison's death in 1931, the electric light and power
industry was worth $15 billion in the United States alone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Worst businessman'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little if any of it wound up in Edison's pockets. He did make
lots of money in his lifetime, from contracts signed with Cornelius
Vanderbilt (who owned Western Union) and J. Pierpont Morgan (whose
bank underwrote Edison's first commercial power station, in lower
Manhattan).
</P>
<P>
   But he was cut out of his own companies when they grew big
(General Electric started out as Edison General Electric, before
his backers removed Edison in more ways than one). What money he
did make he lavished on his otherwise neglected family and on
experiments in search of further inventions.
</P>
<P>
   His friend and admirer, Henry Ford, called Edison ``the world's
greatest inventor and worst businessman.'' This wasn't quite true;
Edison died a millionaire. But, as Paul Israel, editor of the
Edison papers at Rutgers University, says, ``He was interested in
solving technical problems and bringing them to market; he wasn't
interested in running a business.'' So, he never dominated an
industry in a sustained way, as Ford did with cars, Rockefeller
with oil, or Carnegie with steel.
</P>
<P>
   He also made some bad turns at critical junctures. He championed
DC power, when George Westinghouse pushed and won with AC. He
invented and stuck with an electric-battery car, while Ford (who
learned how to build cars at Detroit Edison before leaving to form
his own company) put out a cheaper, more convenient gas-engine
model. He dumped millions into pre-fab concrete houses and an
ore-separating project, neither of which panned out. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A late-life vindication &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His vindication came in August 1929, two years before he died.
Ford (perhaps the century's second-most-important figure) threw a
jubilee in Dearborn, Mich., to celebrate the 40th anniversary of
Edison's lightbulb. Orville Wright, Marie Curie, and President
Herbert Hoover were among the hundreds who came to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had reconstructed a mockup of Edison's original lab in
Menlo Park, complete with old bulbs, beakers, and ticker tape. (An
ailing but spirited Edison told Ford, ``You've got this 99 1/2
percent perfect,'' complaining only, ``We never kept it this
clean.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the evening's end, Edison pulled a switch, as he had done
back in the real Menlo Park long ago, and the filaments of lamps
all across Dearborn lit to a blaze. As the crowd cheered, the NBC
radio announcer, who was broadcasting the festival live, excitedly
told the millions of Americans tuning in from their electrified
homes, ``And Edison said, `Let there be light!' ''

LONGING FOR AN OLD HABIT SUFFUSES POETIC `SMOKING BOOK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SMOKING BOOK 
By Lesley Stern 
University of Chicago Press, 238 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Smoking Book'' does not concern itself with the ongoing
tobacco wars, cigarette use among teen-agers, or the long-term
effects of second-hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   It's a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the smoker, smoking becomes second nature _ like breathing
and talking and eating and touching,'' writes Lesley Stern. ``Every
act of smoking is potentially ceremonial, a staged performance of
the everyday, a way of enabling so many daily pleasures and
struggles, repititious moments of work and leisure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smoking Book'' is one woman's ode to a great love lost, a
wistful caress of memories from a long romance with cigarettes.
Composed of essays and vignettes, this is a book so defiantly out
of step with popular and conventional belief that Stern even calls
one of her chapters ``Life-Giving Mist,'' borrowing a term from the
Mbuya-guarani tribe of South America, who believed tobacco was a
source of vitality and made the smoking of it a sacred ritual
reserved for shamans. Here, Stern examines her own smoking rituals
_ the anticipation of that first drag of the morning, a postcoital
cigarette shared between lovers, the mating dances performed in a
trail of blue smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when some consider cigarettes as dangerous as bullets
and smokers are society's favorite pariahs, Stern has written a
fever-dream reminiscence about smoking, even as she details her
efforts to leave the lover _ tobacco _ that may eventually kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   It can be said that Stern was born to love cigarettes. She was
raised on a tobacco farm in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). One of her
favorite photographs features her father, standing in the midst of
his tobacco seedbeds, holding Stern as an infant in one hand and
cradling a cigarette in the other. Stern grew up with the smell of
tobacco, and its aromas summon ``childhood sensations from the
past,'' just as the smell of biscuits might revive the warmth of a
grandmother's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Stern was barely old enough to see over a store
counter, she was swapping a handful of coins for a pack of
cigarettes to be shared with her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first deep breath they take, drawing in the nicotine, is
sickening; nausea wells up and their bodies are shaken by
coughing,'' she writes, recalling that first cigarette. ``As the
spasms subside they stub out, but do not relinquish, the
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be the last time for many years that Stern would stub
out a cigarette. Oh, there would be attempts to quit, such as those
hilariously recalled in ``Burial.'' She tried massage, and attended
meetings of Smoke Stoppers. She recalled the words of a former
boyfriend who said kissing a smoker was like ``putting your tongue
into a cremation urn _ full of the ashes of a dead person.'' In an
effort to literally bury her addiction, Stern would dig a ``grave''
for her last pack of cigarettes in her yard. But inevitably she
would always be drawn back to the spot, shovel in hand; she
realizes that it wasn't a burial spot as much as a ``safety deposit
box, a last resort, a final refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Stern would eventually quit, she is unabashed in
remembering how profoundly cigarettes affected her life. They were
a tool for dating when a handsome stranger offered a light, a means
to begin a casual conversation. Along with a glass of scotch and
Sinatra on the stereo, they were comfort and companion on a long,
lonely night.
</P>
<P>
   Stern does not spend a lot of time mixing it up with the
antismoking commandos, though she believes their campaign
``operates within an economy of moralism, with a rhetoric of
abhorrence that appeals to the `common good,' '' and that ``smokers
are made to feel socially guilty, as though acting criminally
against the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stern isn't really interested in rants. Instead, she has
fashioned a book with the dexterity of a jazz riff and the ethereal
beauty of a smoke ring. One need not be a smoker to understand or
appreciate Stern's work. In a way, it's a book about all vices and
about every craving we know is not good for us, but is nonetheless
oh-so-good to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We project, we invest the object with all our desires, all our
needs for curative affect, all our fantasies of divine
transcendence, all our fears of dirt, contamination and death,''
she writes. ``And it _ not the object in itself but that smoky ring
of desire in which the object is conjured into being and circulates
_ returns us to ourselves more complete, almost completely
satisfied.''

ALREADY LAYING PLANS FOR 3000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time capsule fever is gripping the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is time capsule crazy right now,'' Paul Hudson,
founder of the Atlanta-based International Time Capsule Society,
recently told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. There are so many time capsules that Hudson felt
the need to start an organization to keep track of them all. He has
his hands full, because, as he told the AP, most of the world's
10,000 known time capsules are missing. Some are doubtless
destroyed, but many others are still out there, lost, waiting to be
found. It seems that people tend to forget where they put time
capsules, especially if they're buried, as most of them are. Don't
squirrels do something similar with nuts?
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Magazine devoted its entire 212-page issue
Sunday to The Times Capsule, a project aimed at capturing the
essence of our time for whoever or whatever happens to be around to
find it in the year 3000. The Times sponsored a competition for the
capsule's design. A number of ingenious ideas were put forward, but
in the end the Times went with something traditional, in function
if not in form. The winner was Spanish architect Santiagao
Calatrava's many-chambered stainless steel capsule, a graceful
design ``reminiscent of an origami flower or fortune cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   I was pleased to read that conservation expert Margaret MacLean
put the kibosh on the newspaper's plans to fill the capsule with
digital records, which last a few decades at most. The
longest-enduring medium is good-quality, acid-free paper. For a
born-again Luddite, it's exhilarating to think that paper may well
outlast the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Capsule panel decided against burying it. Instead, it
will go on permanent display in the courtyard of the American
Museum of Natural History, where, it is hoped, it will endure until
the year 3000. Among its contents will be a copy of Sunday's New
York Time Magazine. Looking through it, I wondered what people
1,000 years hence might make of it, and concluded that one of the
few things that may still be relevant to life in the year 3000 is
the nine-page supplement extolling the timeless delights of Scotch
whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have an abiding interest in fermented beverages. Mead, a
light wine made from honey, was ``the reveler's drink of choice,''
around the turn of the last millennium, according to ``The Year
1000,'' Robert Lacey's and Danny Danziger's most interesting book
about life in England 1,000 years ago. Ale was the everyday drink,
safer than water, ``probably quite a sweet beverage with a porridgy
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   What will people in the year 3000 want to know about the way we
lived? Probably the same sorts of things that Lacey and Danziger
write about life in 1000 A.D. What we ate and drank. How we loved,

   Several companies are selling do-it-yourself time capsule kits.
I have one here, called ``The Ark To the Future,'' touted as ``a
priceless gift your family will treasure _ forever.'' For $27.50
you get a couple of metal containers, plus a ``memory album'' and a
family tree to fill in. There's room in the containers for a few
artifacts that will capture the essence of your particular life in
the late 20th century. What would I include in mine? I'm making a
list. So far I have Prozac, the SelfCare catalog, the ``Y2K

<P>
   Widespread immunization programs have been deemed one of this
century's biggest public health successes. Gone are the days when
parents kept their children from the movies, the beach, or other
crowded areas, mostly in the 1940s and 1950s, for fear that they
would be struck down by the fast-moving poliovirus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, vaccination programs have essentially eradicated
infectious childhood diseases in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   But many parents of today's children weren't even born when the
threat of disease made childhood disability and death an all too
common event. Because they haven't seen the devastation caused by
polio, diphtheria, meningitis, rubella, or measles, all of which
have been nearly eliminated by vaccines, some are wondering why
their children need certain shots and are focusing on the very
small risks of side effects that the vaccines carry.
</P>
<P>
   Parents like Deborah Bermudes of Massachusetts Citizens for
Vaccination Choice, whose mailing list includes 1,000 people, say
that as more vaccines become mandated, parents should have the
right to choose which ones they do and don't want their children to
have. Currently, parents must show proof that their children have
been vaccinated against certain diseases before the children can
enter public or private school. And the government is considering
adding a pneumococcal vaccine to those that infants already
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccination involves exposing the body to either a weakened or
killed virus to build immunity to a given disease. Although rare,
side effects do occur. For example, several of the vaccines carry a
small risk of anaphylactic shock, a serious allergic reaction that
causes blood pressure to drop and the heart to beat erratically.
And there are stories of children developing long-term neurological
damage from vaccines, such as autism or multiple sclerosis, but it
is not clear if vaccines were really the culprit. And although
exceedingly rare, a handful of children develop paralysis from the
polio vaccine each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bermudes believes that vaccinations, ``like all other
nonemergency medical procedures, should be subject to informed
consent.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest mandated vaccines in Massachusetts _ one for
hepatitis B in 1996 and for chicken pox (varicella) in 1998 _ have
caused controversy among parents because some believe that these
vaccines, in particular, are causing neurological problems, and
some refuse to get their children vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may see chicken pox as a mild disease, but a small
percentage of people infected with chicken pox develop severe
pneumonia or brain infections from the disease. Children with
chicken pox are also at greater risk of developing serious
``flesh-eating'' streptococcal infections, said Dr. Sean Palfrey,
director of the immunization initiative for the Massachusetts
chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a pediatrician at
Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 4 million people infected with chicken pox each year,
11,000 have to be hospitalized and 100 of them die. ``People forget
that when someone says `I want choice,' his child may be the 1 in
10 with bad chicken pox,'' Palfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall for the first time, Massachusetts children entering
kindergarten and seventh grade had to prove they had either been
vaccinated against chicken pox or had developed an immunity to it
from having the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Kretz wanted her two young children to get chicken pox
the natural way: from other kids. She was so adamant about it that
she joined a network of parents who hosted ``chicken pox parties;''
when one child got the disease, the parents invited other children
over to get exposed to it, since exposure confers lifelong
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 1 percent of children are given exemptions
from immunizations because of medical, religious, or philosophical
reasons. However, it was a religious exemption in Massachusetts
that led to the death of a four-year-old in 1994 who contracted
diphtheria, the only US case that year; it is not known how the
child contracted the disease. Still, Massachusetts, Maine, and
Vermont, where children can get some or all of exemptions, have
some of the highest vaccination compliance rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Samuel Katz, a pediatrician at Duke University, said he
understands parents' concerns about vaccines and frankly tells them
that everything has some risk _ from getting vaccines to taking
antibiotics. But Katz said that in the past 30 years, he has seen
only six children who had serious reactions to vaccines while he's
more commonly seen such reactions to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are struck by lightning than by vaccines,'' said
Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria and measles
still occur worldwide, so they are ``not further than a jet ride
away,'' Katz said. Every case of measles last year in the US was
traced to someone who had come from or had visited a foreign
country, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   And now diphtheria is only a jet ride away. While the United
States has had few to no cases of diphtheria for many years, Russia
saw 2,000 cases occur when diphtheria immunization dipped because
of the recent collapse of its public health infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The United States got a wake-up call between 1989 and 1991 when
measles inoculations lapsed among preschool children in some urban
areas. During those three years, 55,000 people got sick and 120
died, most of them children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent evidence of how a vaccination has wiped out a
serious disease is the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine first
introduced in the US in 1990. At the time, Hib was the most common
cause of bacterial meningitis, an inflammation of the covering of
the brain and spinal cord, accounting for more than 15,000 cases
and between 400 to 500 deaths a year. Since the vaccine's
development (it's now given routinely to all infants), Hib
meningitis has dropped to fewer than 50 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   Palfrey said that it's ``traumatic'' when a child who has been
healthy prior to a vaccine visit later becomes ill, but it doesn't
mean the illness and the vaccination are necessarily related; it is
sometimes the ``eclipse effect,'' he said, referring to a time when
people blamed solar eclipses for disease and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   But Denise Kretz, who wanted her children to get exposed to
chicken pox through ``chicken pox parties'' didn't get that
opportunity with her youngest son, Bobby, who is almost two. After
he received the chicken pox vaccine, he suffered seizures from the
inoculation, according to doctors at the New England Medical
Center's Floating Hospital for Children in Boston. A year later,
Bobby still loses his balance often, falls frequently, and cannot
talk, even though he could speak when he got the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wintheiser believes that his son Billy, now 10, became
autistic as a result of a measles/mumps/rubella shot he got when he
was 18 months old. At the time, Wintheiser was a nurse working for
Pennsylvania's health department and had given hundreds of
thousands of immunizations himself. Nine days after getting the
shot, Billy had a seizure and stopped breathing. Over the next few
months, he lost his ability to speak and was diagnosed as autistic.
``I am convinced that he is autistic because of the vaccine,''
Wintheiser said. ``We have gotten a number of doctors to say that
it could be related, which isn't the same as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was working at the public health department, Wintheiser
reported his child's and other childrens' side effects to a
national reporting system run jointly by the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Centers for Disease Control ane Prevention.
In 1986, a reporting system was set up for parents and doctors to
report vaccine-related injuries and an injury compensation fund for
families was begun.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System (VAERS) receives
about 1,000 reports a month. Gina Mootrey, CDC medical
epidemiologist and VAERS project officer, said that while only a
limited number of adverse events are mandated for reporting by
vaccine providers and manufacturers, ``we encourage the reporting
of any event felt to be clinically significant either by the parent
of the vaccinee or healthcare provider,'' Mootrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to tell physicians that they don't have to believe that
the vaccine caused the event for it to be reported,'' Mootrey said.
She said that the more reports they get, the easier it will be see
if real patterns emerge so that vaccines can be reevaluated if
necessary. ``If the reports never get sent in, we have no way of
knowing we need to look at them.'' For example, a parent reported
to a pediatrician that her child experienced hair loss after each
dose of the hepatitis vaccine. A search on the VAERS database found
45 cases of hair loss after hepatitis B vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point to the rotavirus vaccine when reassuring parents
about safety. A vaccine against rotavirus, the leading cause of
severe childhood diarrhea, was pulled off the market earlier this
year after it was determined that it carried the risk of causing a
rare but dangerous bowel obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and physicians say they are constantly looking at
ways to improve vaccines. One that has long been scrutinized and
considered to be problematic is the pertussis (whooping cough)
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Canadian study of the newest pertussis vaccine (DTaP)
showed the most disturbing side effects, such as seizures, have
declined sharply since the introduction of a new ``acellular''
version that includes only the ``safe'' parts of the germ
responsible for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The older ``whole-cell'' vaccine had been a catalyst for
immunization opponents; seizures and collapse occurred in one per
1,750 injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to parents is: `The bad vaccine is gone,' '' said
Dr. David Scheifele, study author and director of the Vaccine
Evaluation Center at Children's Hospital in British Columbia.

INJECTABLE POLIO VACCINE IS MAKING A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine-year-old David Salamone of Oakton, Va., has polio. But he
didn't catch it from someone, he got it from a vaccine. The last
natural US case of polio, which paralyzed hundreds of thousands of
Americans in the early part of the century, was in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Out of millions of children vaccinated for polio in the United
States each year, David was, unfortunately, one of a handful who
become paralyzed from the oral vaccine, which is made from a
weakened form of the live polio virus. About 1 out of 2.5 million
children becomes paralyzed from the oral vaccine each year, an
astronomically small number statistically speaking, but a
devastating one if it's your child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems ridiculous that the only polio cases are from the
vaccines designed to prevent it,'' said John Salamone, David's
father.
</P>
<P>
   And with polio on the verge of being eradicated worldwide,
public health officials apparently agree.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is calling for all polio vaccines to be given in the
older injected form, which is made from the killed virus, instead
of the oral form that has been used since the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   This week the American Academy of Pediatrics plans to release
its own new polio vaccine guidelines. Already, a phase-out plan has
been in place since last January: The first two doses have been
recommended to be the injected virus and the last two doses the
oral drops.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sean Palfrey, director of the immunization initiative for
the Massachusetts chapter of the AAP, said, ``The country has been
so concerned about the six to eight people who end up with
paralytic polio that we are making a change in policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the polio vaccine is one of medicine's greatest
triumphs. In the early part of the 20th century, no disease caused
greater terror than polio.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Jonas Salk developed the original polio
vaccine, made from an inactivated virus. By 1955, the incidence of
polio had fallen by 90 percent. By the early 1960s, an oral form of
the vaccine, pioneered by Albert Sabin, and made from an
attenuated, or weakened, live form of the virus, had supplanted the
Salk vaccine because it was more effective. Ironically, it is the
less successful Salk vaccine that the United States is now
returning to.
</P>
<P>
   As the world gets closer to eradicating polio, parents like John
Salamone want to see that other children use a safer alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anti-vaccine,'' said Salamone, who took his son
from doctor to doctor for nearly two years before one determined
that his son's paralysis was related to the vaccine, probably
because he was born with an immune deficiency that made him
susceptible to polio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son has paid a huge personal price for mass immunization,''
Salamone said.

HOW DO DOGS DETECT SCENTS SO WELL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How powerful is a dog's sense of smell?
</P>
<P>
   J.R., Newton, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There once was a dog that could tell
</P>
<P>
   The difference twixt Heaven and Hell
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't his heart
</P>
<P>
   That could tell them apart
</P>
<P>
   But his powerfully keen sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, maybe your Schnauzer's schnoz isn't that discerning,
but Dr. Larry Myers, of the Veterinary School at Auburn University,
says dogs are at the top of the animal kingdom (along with rats)
when it comes to their ability to smell.
</P>
<P>
   He says in one test, dogs were 1,000 times better at smelling a
test odor than humans. In another, dogs could smell one part of
hydrogen sulfide per quadrillion parts of air. Humans can only pick
it up at 100 parts per quadrillion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Myers cautions that canine olfactory power varies depending
on the smell, the breed, and the dog. Even the diet of the dog can
affect how well it can smell. He says all breeds do very well with
smell, not just the traditional tracking dogs like bloodhounds.
Short-haired breeds are generally better.
</P>
<P>
   Why do dogs smell so well? Their noses are lined with 20 times
more olfactory receptor cells than humans have. Dr. Myers says
those receptors may be loaded with extra chemicals that make them
more ready to fire a ``smell'' message to the brain. The nerves
carrying the smell message to the brain may integrate those signals
more efficiently. And the dog's olfactory bulbs, the parts of the
brain that receive and process the message from the nose, are
larger than in most animals, relative to brain size.
</P>
<P>
   He says dogs smell not only by sniffing, but by licking. Like
snakes, they grab molecules with their tongue and carry it to a
vomeronasal organ in the hard palate in the roof of the mouth,
which detects olfactory stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are trained to sniff for drugs, land mines, toxic waste,
petroleum distillates used to start a fire, brown tree snakes in
Hawaii, even cows in heat. Cows are in estrus for only about 12
hours. ``The dairy industry last year lost $300 million in missed
mating opportunities,'' Dr. Myers says. ``Bulls can only detect
about 70 percent of the females ready to mate. Dogs detect between
90 and 100 percent.''

BUSH'S TAX-CUT CLUNKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MANCHESTER, N.H. _ You can always tell when a Republican is
peddling snake oil about taxes, and George W. Bush dropped the
classic hint here last week during The Great Non-Debate.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old Goldilocks line about the porridge. Bush, through
his smug smile, said some have called his tax cut ideas too much;
some have called them too little; so, he grinned, this must mean
they are ``just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Does not. The truth is that the president-in-waiting has
committed such an irresponsible political and substantive act, one
so dangerous to a prosperous economy, that the yelps of left,
right, and center are all squarely on target. His fellow GOP
candidates have yet to lay a serious glove on him, but in terms of
the general election, the Democrats are already certain that Bush
has painted a huge bull's-eye on his back. That's no mean feat and
merits analysis.
</P>
<P>
   From the left and center _ everybody from Dick Gephardt and Al
Gore to John McCain _ the Bush scheme is a $1.1 trillion clunker
that is almost half again as huge over 10 years as the egg Congress
laid this year that President Clinton gleefully vetoed. It is also
almost double the tax turkey (15 percent across the board) that Bob
Dole half-heartedly pushed to an uninterested general electorate in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   It more than consumes the surplus outside the Social Security
system that is anticipated over the next decade, but is based on
the assumption not just of uninterrupted economic growth but also
of spending cuts that even this Congress has been unwilling to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just to make his ideas work on paper, Bush aides had to
inflate Congressional Budget Office economic projections, the first
appearance of that dangerous temptress from the irresponsible 1980s
_ Rosy Scenario. The fact is that pie-in-the-sky tax schemes that
bust the budget are most likely to produce the sharply higher
interest rates that can in turn create the recessions they claim to
prevent.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets worse. If you spend the entire anticipated surplus
on tax cuts, that means in the case of Bush that he hasn't paid for
the multiple add-ons he's promised to the military. And, if you
make no provision for additional investment in Medicare, just how
is this vital program supposed to survive the baby boom
generation's retirement if not via cutbacks in services and
benefits? For the poor, working poor, near-poor, and serious chunks
of the middle-class, the zero to handful of dollars a week in Bush
tax cuts would disappear in an avalanche of slashes in basic
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The other hint that a Republican is selling snake oil comes when
he stresses, as Bush has since unveiling his proposal last week,
percentage reductions in income tax rates. That's as in the biggest
percentage reduction in rates would be for low-income families via
dropping the lowest rate from 15 to 10 percent for these folks, who
would also benefit from a doubling of the refundable $500-per-child
tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   But income taxes are only a tiny fact of life for those with low
incomes, who are primarily hit via Social Security levies. More
than a third of the actual dollars would of course go to the top
one percent, with more than $300,000 in income. The top 10 percent,
starting at $90,000, would get 60 percent of the bucks; the bottom
60 percent of America, from $38,000 and change on down, would get
but 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If he were truly a compassionate conservative, Bush wouldn't
drop the top rate 6 points to 33 percent, he wouldn't end
inheritance taxes on the richest estates, and he wouldn't make the
child tax credit open to people with incomes up to $200,000. If he
hadn't done all that, Bush also wouldn't have busted the budget.
That's why, if I were John McCain, I'd call the guy what he is, a
pork barrel conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But our friends further on the right also have things to say
about taxes, even if Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes did a lousy job of
it here the other night. What Bush has proposed would be an
effective end to the flat-rate income tax long advocated by Ronald
Reagan's most committed supply-side disciples.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush proposal, the hated IRS would remain, the tax code
would get a few hundred more pages (if the special interests don't
get Congress to add even more, as happened under Reagan in 1981),
and complexity via regulations would achieve a permanent advantage
over simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch to the primary, Forbes will never have a better
chance than now to make the true believers' case with the
tub-thumping aid of the Manchester Union-Leader. But it's endgame
time.
</P>
<P>
   The best opportunity, though, is from the center. Al Gore is
already on the case. The question is what John McCain will do on
Gore's right. He didn't do much the other night. But he does have a
case for tax relief targeted more on working families, respectful
of the necessity of budget responsibility to keep prosperity alive,
and relentlessly opposed to special interest goodies that clutter
tax bills the way their cash corrupts campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has to make that case, and vigorously. A stirring
biography will get people's attention, but it won't get their
votes, especially on a kitchen table issue like taxes.

`BUDDY' REMEMBERS EARLY ROCK'S INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The recent TV miniseries, ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll,''
showed there's still interest in the roots of rock. Hence, it seems
like perfect timing to have ``Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story'' back
in town. A theatrical tribute to Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Holly,
the show is primed for a 60-week national run, starting Tuesday at
the Shubert Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed ``Buddy'' on its first go-round in Boston, seven
years ago, you missed a lively night that recalled rock's
pre-cynical age when innocence, not star-tripping, was king.
</P>
<P>
   Although Holly's death was considered rock's first great tragedy
_ dubbed ``the day the music died'' when he, Ritchie Valens, and
the Big Bopper (J. P. Richardson) perished in a 1959 plane crash in
a frozen Iowa cornfield _ the touring musical celebrates his life
without slipping into melodrama. It's based on a production that
has played for the past 11 years in London, where Holly in his '50s
heyday was even more popular than he was in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans wanted the glamour and the style of Elvis, where the
English mentality at the time was that we wanted the boy next door
_ somebody we could be like,'' says ``Buddy'' director Paul Mills.
``So the nerdy guy with glasses, we could all aspire to that.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest production is helmed by Mills and another
Englishman, Steve Gibb, the show's music director, who memorized
Holly guitar solos as a youth and can tell you that the first song
the Beatles cut on a demo tape was Holly's ``That'll Be the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing about Holly was that he was a guy writing his
own songs _ up until then most stars didn't _ and writing about
subjects that touched him and other kids,'' Gibb says of the
musician from Lubbock, Texas. ``He was terrific at fusing styles
together. His main influence was Hank Williams, but when he saw
Elvis, he stuck the two together.''
</P>
<P>
   While the British are behind the latest ``Buddy,'' most of the
cast is American, including the Atlanta-bred Van Zeiler, 27, who
stars as Holly. It's a long way from Zeiler's self-described
``frat-boy rock days'' at the University of Virginia, where he
admits to knowing much less about Holly than about Led Zeppelin. It
was his lack of awe toward Holly (``Van didn't come in and try to
impersonate him,'' says Gibb) that helped land him the job after he
struggled as an actor for two years in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew of Buddy Holly was `That'll Be the Day,' and I
don't think I even knew the full name of that song,'' says Zeiler.
``When I was cast in the role, I had to put the CD on repeat as I
went to sleep to try to learn the words to the song. It's been an
amazing journey ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeiler has played Holly for two years, starring in the London
production and, oddly enough, marrying in real life the British
woman who played Holly's wife, Maria Elena, in the production. The
actress is Victoria Stilwell, who says, ``I met Van on the first
day of rehearsals. I said, `Hi, I'm playing your wife.' And then a
couple of months into it, we started dating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is pretty phenomenal in how many lives it's
changed,'' says Zeiler. (Music director Gibb also met his wife,
Emily Wells, in the show: She's the assistant stage manager.)
</P>
<P>
   Holly's better-known songs, from ``Rave On'' to ``Peggy Sue''
and ``Not Fade Away,'' influenced everyone from the Beatles and
Bruce Springsteen to the Grateful Dead. But it's his ballads (such
as ``Rainin' in My Heart'') that Zeiler finds the most challenging
to sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rock songs, you can sing them while thinking of
Buddy's unashamed exuberance for music and life, but the ballads
have a sense of wisdom beyond his years,'' says Zeiler.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the success or failure of ``Buddy'' rests on re-creating
the innocence of those years before rock became big business. Holly
went from a teenage nobody in Texas to a worldwide star by age 22,
yet his songs, with few exceptions, remained a beacon of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is teach the cast to play with the same sort
of innocence,'' says Gibb. ``The music then was obviously brand
new. We're now playing this stuff with 40 years of music culture
behind us, so it's hard to imagine that we're playing it for the
first time that it's ever been heard. But that's what we try to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   What further distinguishes ``Buddy'' is the multidimensional
nature of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People write to me saying `I'd love to be a backup singer in
the show,' '' says Mills. ``And I write back and say, `Don't you
remember when you saw it that that backup singer actually was the
actress that also played his wife?' Everybody does everything _ and
they all get a great buzz from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy'' is a natural theatrical vehicle because it has the
built-in climax of the famed Surf Ballroom concert at Clear Lake,
Iowa, on Feb. 2, 1959, featuring Holly, Valens, and the Big Bopper.
While Holly played the show with a small combo, the theater
production features the entire cast during this finale, which can
drive audiences to a fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Some cast members have made the pilgrimage to the Surf Ballroom,
which still exists. ``You might think it's touristy, but then you
get down there and see everything as it was,'' says Mills. ``And
you can hear all the ghosts. It's quite extraordinary. You see that
stage and it's like, `Oh my God, this is where it all happened.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zeiler also made the trip to Clear Lake and found himself
humming ``Peggy Sue'' while sitting in the ballroom's empty seats.
It also made him wonder just what might have happened had Holly
lived past the tender age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy was always pushing to a different plane in everything he
did,'' says Zeiler. ``At the time of his death, he was into a
different thing than `That'll Be the Day,' `Oh Boy,' and his other
straight-ahead rock stuff. He was experimenting more with
instrumentation. That's what I try to keep in my mind as we go
through the show every night. I think of his opening of doors and
his moving into rockabilly, but also of his breaking the color
barrier by being the first white act to play at the Apollo Theatre
(in New York). In everything _ socially and musically _ he just
didn't care about what was normally done. He went a step further
and pushed it.''

RETROSPECTIVES FOR A POET AND A PAINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brazilian artist Cildo Meireles and the
Italian-born painter Francesco Clemente are contemporaries:
Meireles was born in 1948, Clemente in 1952. Although both are
citizens of the world, Meireles has remained based in Rio, which
was considered a contemporary-art backwater until the relatively
recent ``discovery'' of major artists working there, while Clemente
moved to New York in 1981. Geography has had something to do with
the trajectories of their respective careers. That, and several
other factors. Clemente paints; Meireles works in more unwieldy
materials, like talc by the ton or folding yardsticks by the
thousands. Clemente was categorized early on as an Expressionist
and one of the ``Three C's,'' as he and fellow Italians Sandro Chia
and Enzo Cucchi were famously dubbed. Meireles is more elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Both are the subjects of ambitious retrospectives now in New
York museums: Clemente's fills nearly all of the uptown Guggenheim;
Meireles's has taken over the New Museum in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   If Meireles is familiar to Bostonians, it's because of the
pioneering show of his work that Milena Kalinovska brought to the
Institute of Contemporary Art in 1997 when she was its director.
One of its highlights, ``Volatile,'' which requires the visitor to
slog through a room ankle-deep in talc, reappears in the New
Museum. Like Meireles's other large-scale pieces, this one alters
perception _ in this case, the basic experience of walking. The
talc slows you down, and the textureless substance creates strange
sensations as you push against it.
</P>
<P>
   The ICA show was organized in Spain and also appeared in
Portugal. The New Museum show will travel to Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo. Meireles is typecast as ``Latin,'' although there's little
or nothing in his art that fits the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   He's a poet with everyday materials, and with color. The big
installations that have made his the most ambitious show the New
Museum has mounted in its 23-year history tend to be monochromatic.
``Red Shift,'' for instance, is a vintage 1960s living room in
which everything _ the furniture, the knockoffs of paintings by
Pollock and Rothko, even the tropical fish _ is red. After a while,
your eyeballs throb. A red epoxy ``spill'' on the floor winds down
a corridor ending in a sink spouting red water. What would it be
like, you wonder, to live in a world where there was only one
color?
</P>
<P>
   The merging of colors is the point of ``Cinza,'' a pair of
canvas-walled roomlets, one carpeted in chalk, the other in ash.
Walking from one to the other, you carry and marry these opposites.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 ``Fontes'' is a golden yellow the artist borrowed from
van Gogh. The whole room is suffused with the shade, which is also
the dominant hue of the 6,000 wooden yardsticks dangling from the
ceiling in a giant spiral you walk through, the corridor becoming
ever narrower, so that no matter how skinny you are, you feel
gently squeezed. As you push aside the jungle of sticks, they
oblige with a delightful clackety sound that turns up in the
soundtrack, too. At the center of the spiral the sticks are too
dense to penetrate, so you retrace your steps. Doing so is
something of a disappointment, but also a chance to contemplate the
half million little black plastic numbers scattered on the floor,
as if all the order the yardsticks represented had disappeared.
Blanketing the walls are a thousand yellow clocks, set at different
times, all out of synch. Provocative, yes, but ``Fontes'' is
pleasurable, too. Like the van Gogh ``Wheat Field Under Threatening
Skies With Crows'' that inspired its color, ``Fontes'' suggests a
world gone awry, but it does so through beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In his sculpture, Meireles likes to thwart or tweak everyday
objects including Coca-Cola bottles and dollar bills, both symbols
of US capitalism. Sometimes the results are one-liners, as in the
1970 ``Blind Mirror,'' a white metal medicine chest whose mirror is
blocked out by gray goo. In another '70s piece, metal and paper
chains hang side by side, so you note the difference. This doesn't
take long. The 1976 ``Reason/Madness'' requires more time to
absorb. A pair of bamboo bows are held taut by padlocked chains.
The key to one lock dangles above its target; the key to the other
hangs below. Neither reason nor madness is the solution, Meireles
seems to say. Meanwhile, like those tense arcs, we exist in a state
of suspense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Francesco Clemente's world, man and woman can merge, the tail
of a brown mouse can intertwine with a long pink tail spinning out
of a distinctly human derriere, people can be spotted or striped
like leopards or tigers, and faces can appear within the eye and
mouth cavities of other faces. The body is infinitely plastic. Skin
is penetrable. All life forms mingle. All the forms of Clemente's
art mingle in the Guggenheim show, which includes more than 200 of
his oil and fresco paintings, watercolors, pastels, sculptures and
book illustrations, dating from the 1970s to now.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Naples to an ancient aristocratic family who had lost
their lands in the 19th century, Clemente studied architecture in
Rome in the '70s, in a climate of political unrest, demonstrations,
and strikes. Like others of his generation, he made long
pilgrimages to India in search of a different and more spiritual
aesthetic. While based in New York for nearly two decades now, he
is not an artist you can identify with any particular country. He
may be Italian by birth, but his painting has more of an affinity
with Northern European art. His splotchy, wayward watercolors are
reminiscent of Nolde's, and his mosaiclike patterning sometimes
resembles Klimt's. The Indian influence is apparent in the multiple
eyes or breasts his figures sprout, while his joining of human and
animal into a single creature goes back to Egyptian pharaohs
represented as sphinxes. In whatever medium he chooses to work, his
handling is plush and seductive; you want to roll around in his
voluptuous world.
</P>
<P>
   The show's curator, Lisa Dennison, has divided the exhibition
into eight thematic sections, starting with one called ``I.'' She
could have stopped there. Among the rather large category of
artists obsessed with themselves, no one tops Clemente. He presents
himself as sensual or sinister, a chameleon capable of more
metamorphoses than any Greek god. In the 1982 ``Alba and
Francesco,'' he presents his face and his wife's floating together,
overlapping but with their eyes and lips not quite matching up,
creating a woozy, drunken effect. Roses hover in the background,
free of gravity, a motif borrowed from Symbolist painting.
Weightlessness is common in Clemente's fantasy world. In the 1986
``Usary of Love,'' a man and woman float horizontally, joined in an
ecstatic kiss. Instead of embracing, their arms stretch over their
heads, as if they're flying. ``Usary of Love'' is huge _ Clemente
dreams large scale _ and, other than the figures, consists of a
nebulous atmosphere of cloudy white paint and the gold leaf of a
Renaissance altarpiece.
</P>
<P>
   In the macabre, Mapplethorpian pastel ``Self-Portrait With Black
Gloves'' Clemente is naked except for the gloves. He holds his
index fingers against his temples, like a child playing at shooting
himself. In addition to the implied violence in his work, there's
plenty of sex. The two figures in ``Memory'' take the form of
African sculptures, like early Picassos. A bottle levitates over
the crotch of the reclining male, who is pulling out its stopper,
as if to release the scent of some previous encounter.
Orifice-happy anyway, Clemente has a field day with in-your-face
vaginas: In the 1994-95 pastel ``Sky'' he confronts you with a
golden, mythic female figure throwing her head back and flaunting a
vagina in which a blue sky with white clouds appears. Here is
infinity in a single body.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente is the youngest artist ever to have a full-museum
retrospective at the Guggenheim. Does he deserve the star
treatment? The mode of painting he practices, Expressionist
figuration, is outmoded, according to artworld gurus. But the
Guggenheim show makes a surprisingly strong case for it _ and for
him.

REVEALING THE TRUE `GREED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erich von Stroheim is the cinema's mad genius.
</P>
<P>
   His movies were too long. He was uncompromising in an industry
based on collaboration. None of his films were ever released in a
form that pleased him. He carried a pistol to his sets and not many
on his staff believed he wouldn't use it. But he made what may be
the greatest of all silent films _ ``Greed'' (1924). While the
Vienna-born actor-director who started his career as an extra in
``Birth of a Nation'' (1915) also made a handful of other films,
nothing ever came close to the heart and soul of ``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Classic Movies is offering a restored version of
Stroheim's masterpiece, which debuts this week in a rather odd, but
ultimately wondrous, form.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Stroheim's film adaptation of Frank Norris's 1899
novel, ``McTeague,'' ran for more than nine hours. Only a handful
of friends saw that version of ``Greed'' in a special screening.
Then, in 1924, disaster struck. Goldwyn Studios, the studio behind
``Greed,'' merged with Metro Pictures, creating
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. And it placed Erich von Stroheim under the
watchful eye of his mortal enemy, MGM production chief, Irving
Thalberg. The director, under duress, cut the film to about four
hours. But that wasn't enough. Stroheim was disgusted and refused
to cut it any more and asked his colleague, Rex Ingram, to make
additional trims. That still wasn't enough. Thalberg went through
``Greed'' with a hatchet, replacing long, detailed, dramatic
sequences with title cards. Eventually, it was released at just
over two hours and the career of Erich von Stroheim was effectively
over. To make matters worse, the MGM executives melted down the
excised footage to save the silver content. No one will ever see
``Greed'' as Erich von Stroheim intended.
</P>
<P>
   The TCM version is as close as we'll likely get.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough story. McTeague (Gibson Gowland) is a dentist who
falls in love with Trina (ZaSu Pitts), fiancee of his best friend,
Marcus (Jean Hersholt). When Trina wins $5,000 in a lottery, Marcus
decides he was hasty in his selflessness and ignites a series of
events that spiral into inevitable tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Rick Schmidlin, who cut his filmmaking teeth on The
Doors' 1982 music video, ``Love Me Two Times'' and led the
acclaimed restoration on Orson Welles's ``Touch of Evil'' last
year, did a marvelous job on ``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much different than `Touch of Evil,''' he said, in an
interview from his home near Hollywood. ``There was no footage to
restore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidlin, using Stroheim's continuity script, Herman Weinberg's
exhaustive book on the film, and approximately 650 production
stills from the University of Southern California library,
re-worked many of the missing sequences. He added 145 minutes to
the 135-minute original release. At 4 1/2 hours, it's a long ride
for an audience conditioned by music videos and flashy commercials.
But it's worth every minute.
</P>
<P>
   The technique of animating still photographs, popularized by Ken
Burns in his television documentary, ``The Civil War,'' fits the
film very well.
</P>
<P>
   Through panning and other filmic devices, Schmidlin and his
associates, particularly historian Richard Koszarski, integrate the
production stills into the moving picture as inobtrusively as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The added images reinforce Stroheim's obsessive attention to
detail. There's an early sequence, set in a Gold Rush saloon, where
a fight results in cracked skulls and bloody flesh. The movies
wouldn't see as much realistic violence again until Sam Peckinpah's
``The Wild Bunch'' in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidlin wisely added sequences that were slashed from the
original theatrical release including a brutal scene of spousal
abuse by a junk dealer.
</P>
<P>
   During the climactic fight in ``Greed,'' where the two stars
battle temperatures averaging 125 degrees in the middle of Death
Valley, the pistol-waving director reportedly screamed, ``Fight,
fight. Try to hate each other as much as you hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Mayer, the Turner executive who green-lighted the project,
deserves a special commendation. Unlike some studio executives who
turned down the chance to redeem the industry's initial mishandling
of ``Greed,'' Mayer grabbed the chance to polish the industry's
tarnished image. It's unlikely that the restoration of a silent
movie would be greeted with great delight by stockholders, but it
will be hailed by film fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are film literate people at Turner,'' says Schmidlin.
``When you go into Roger Mayer's office, he doesn't have the latest
promotional items from his latest release. He's got history books
from the cinema. When you talk about the early days of film he
knows what you're talking about _ and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroheim received terrific notices and substantial box office
success with his next film, ``The Merry Widow'' (1925), an
adaptation of Franz Lehar's operetta with Mae Murray and John
Gilbert. But Stroheim was inconsolable. As he told reporters at the
time, ``When I saw how the censors mutilated `Greed,' which I did
really with my entire heart, I abandoned my ideals to create real
art pictures.. . . So I have quit realism entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '50s, when Billy Wilder was looking for someone to
play Norma Desmond's manservant in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' the
director chose Stroheim. Who better to play the butler to a
washed-up star than a washed-up silent film director? Wilder, in an
attempt to accommodate his legendary predecessor, exclaimed that
Stroheim was a decade ahead of his time. Stroheim reportedly
responded, ``20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that it's a 75-year-old silent film constructed of bits
and pieces, ``Greed'' is still ahead of its time.

GIFTS FOR LOVERS OF MYSTERY AND CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holidays are almost upon us, and it's time to think about
presents for friends and relatives who enjoy mystery fiction.
Nonreaders of the genre always feel inadequate when trying to find
something suitable in the field _ and with good reason: It's my
experience that the typical nonreader hasn't a clue to what
attracts fans to this kind of fiction. Just as Edmund Wilson, in
his day America's most distinguished literary critic, condemned
mystery fiction after having read all the wrong books, today's
devotee of Updike, Rushdie, and Morrison will choose badly no
matter how good the intentions. So here are some thoughts for the
befuddled and bemused.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford University Press has long had in production its
``Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing'' ($49.95), and the
volume proves to have been worth waiting for. Edited by Rosemary
Herbert, with a team of Anglo-American advisers, this compilation
is idiosyncratic, informative, and charming, and the beauty of it
is that the book will appeal to novices and experts alike. There is
something here at every level for anyone with even a slight
interest in the subject, so putting this into the (very large)
stocking of friend or relative can hardly go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are essays on writers, on characters, on settings, on
themes, with the last much the most original and valuable. A reader
can cavil at the selection of authors for examination _ 149 of
them, with even the author of the entry on G. D. H. and Margaret
Cole admitting that most of their work is mediocre _ and perhaps at
the characters (85 of them). But one can only be delighted by and
grateful for the multiplicity of entries with such titles as
``Academic Milieu,'' ``Accidental Sleuth,'' ``Addresses and Abodes,
Famous,'' and the like. Full and clever cross-referencing lead the
reader on, and while there is some overlap and duplication
(``Friendship'' and ``Sidekicks and Sleuthing Teams,'' for
example), the effort at comprehensiveness is welcome. This is the
book to buy for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Companion shows some signs of its gestation. The
entry under Colin Dexter does not reveal Inspector Morse's first
name, though the entry under ``Sidekicks'' does (it's Endeavour, in
case you missed it). For Morse fanatics, there is a bundle of good
reading at hand, though it will need to be ordered quickly and may
require some trans-Atlantic negotiating: The books are so far
available only in the UK (call the publishers for exact prices in
dollars). ``John Thaw: The Biography'' by Stafford Hildred and Tim
Ewbank, has appeared in paperback from Andre Deutsch in London (76
Dean St., London, W1Z 5HA; call 011 44 0171 316 4450; about $12).
It's lightweight stuff but readable, and it provides some insights
into why Thaw was chosen to play Morse in the excellent television
series. Then there is ``The Oxford of Inspector Morse'' by Antony
Richards and Philip Attwell (Irregular Special Press, 163 Marine
Parade, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, UK, about $5), which provides
background on all the Oxford scenes in both the novels and the
television films. ``The World of Inspector Morse'' by Christopher
Bird (Boxtree, a subsidiary of Macmillan; 25 Eccleston Place,
London SW 1W9 NF; call 011 44 0171 881 8000, about $20) is billed
as ``a complete A-Z reference for the Morse enthusiast.'' The
entries are intelligent and there are a number of attractive
illustrations. Wrap these up together with a membership in The
Inspector Morse Society (write to Antony Richards, 170 Woodland
Road, Sawston, Cambridge CB2 4DX), and if the recipient is a
Harvard graduate, mark Page 110 in ``The World'' with care. Sir
John Gielgud is speaking in his film role as Oxford's Chancellor,
Lord Hinksey, about honorary doctorates. A stuffy American tells
him he has two honorary degrees, and Lord Hinksey (actually the
name of a scruffy village just outside Oxford) responds, ``I've got
15 _ 16, if you count Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   My third idea for a gift is to combine Michael Connelly's
``Angels Flight'' (Little, Brown, $25) with Robert Crais's ``L.A.
Requiem'' (Doubleday, $23.95), both published earlier this year,
and give them to the true close reader among your friends. These
two tough, sprawling, yet tight crime thrillers _ Connelly's in
particular a mystery of the first order, with clues and red
herrings used with great intelligence _ speak to each other in
fascinating ways, and, read back to back, they are a bitter hymn of
love to the city of angels. As we near the end of the year, I do
not hesitate to vote Connelly's book the best of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you may just want to forget gifts, and the season,
and just read a good book yourself. I recommend ``Stone Quarry'' by
S. J. Rozan (St. Martin's, $23.95). This is Rozan's sixth book, yet
I had not read her before. She is a terrific writer who captures
small-town upstate New York to perfection. I very seldom do as the
reviewer's cliche has it and stay up all night to finish a book,
but this time I did, perhaps a little homesick for rural American
diction after all that hard Los Angeles talk and the calm tones of
donnish Oxford. I know what I want for Christmas: the first five
Rozan books.

   For the person who has everything, I suggest a subscription to
``Deadly Pleasures,'' recent winner of an Anthony Award, which will
set you back $14 a year for four issues (Refunding Makes Cents,
1718 South Ridge Point Drive, Bountiful, UT 84010). There are many
fanzines in this field, but this mystery magazine is one of the
best by my lights, and it has the interesting practice of
publishing several different reviews of the same book in the same
issue, which sounds repetitive, but is actually a lot of fun.

`INSPECTOR GADGET' JOINS `LIVE CARTOON' FAILURES

   NEW RELEASES: ``Inspector Gadget'' _ Ever since the success of
the live-action, big-screen ``George of the Jungle,'' producers
have tried to bring other cartoon characters to life. Leslie
Nielsen in ``Mr. Magoo'' bombed. Brendan Fraser in ``Dudley
Do-Right'' bombed. Now Matthew Broderick, in the least promising of
them all, bombs. The animated ``Inspector Gadget'' had one thing
going for it: Don Adams's voice. Adams, who played a live-action
``Gadget'' type on the vintage TV spy parody ``Get Smart,'' brought
that baggage with him to `Gadget.'' Broderick is left to fend for
himself, with too many gadgets and not enough script.

   NEW ON DVD: Distributors are releasing about 50 new titles a
week on DVD. One of the best is ``The Iron Giant'' _ an animated
science-fiction film that's designed more for adult fans of the
genre than for children. References to '50s films abound, and the
story is a paean to ``E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial.'' Also, check
out Jonathan Demme's Talking Heads concert documentary, ``Stop
Making Sense.'' The sound quality is extraordinary. There are
several songs added that were cut from the theatrical release, plus
commentary by Talking Head David Byrne and talking head Demme. . .
. The Christmas shopping surge has warmed the commercial hearts of
DVD manufacturers, with sales of DVD players at a rate more than
double last year's.

LIVES, MEMOIRS, JOURNEYS: A 1999 NONFICTION SAMPLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How casually we imagine that fiction is what is made up and
nonfiction what is true _ and how inaccurately. Each form borrows
from the other. The art of fiction discloses the most essential
truths in timeless ways: as Hamlet wrestles with his conscience
eternally and repeatedly, each time the play is acted. And a
nonfiction book, while it tells of facts that may be known by other
means (whereas Hamlet exists only in the play), is no less an
artifice, a thing of human hands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, as in every year, many worthy nonfiction books have
been published. In this corner of the annual holiday issue, we try
to contrive a list not necessarily of the absolute best that has
been published, but of books of originality and excellence,
reviewed in our pages, which have a fair claim to be on such a
list. Any of these books would make a fine gift for a fine reader.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-century painter Michelangelo Merisi, known as
Caravaggio, is endlessly fascinating and mysterious. His enormous
restored painting, ``The Beheading of John the Baptist,'' drew
crowds of hushed worshipers, one might say, when it was displayed
at the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence last spring.
Notable among many recent exhibits and books devoted to him is
Helen Langdon's ``Caravaggio: A Life'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$30). Of Langdon, the Globe's Christine Temin wrote, ``Her strong
points are two. One is her descriptions of the paintings, many of
which are reproduced in color. . . . The other is the elaborate
context she creates. . . . She explains the temper of the times.''
Another book that ably combines the almost palpable presentation of
paintings and the artist and world they came from is Simon Schama's
just-published ``Rembrandt's Eyes'' (Knopf, $50).
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease and its griefs have elicited many books,
especially about the experience of the loving caregiver. There will
probably never be one more shrewd or lyrical than John Bayley's
``Elegy for Iris'' (St. Martin's, $22.95), about his late wife,
novelist Iris Murdoch. The book is divided into ``Then'' and
``Now'' _ the first half recalls their courtship and
early-to-middle married life; the second describes Murdoch's
decline and Bayley's determination to care for her himself as long
as he could. The Globe's chief book critic, Gail Caldwell, wrote,
``He is with her on the voyage. Sometimes the seas are stormy and
terrifying; more often, they are known but endless, granting an
occasional sense of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are actual terrifying seas, brilliantly recounted in
``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition'' by
Caroline Alexander (Knopf, $29.95). Graced with many never-before
collected photographs by Frank Hurley, the book tells of the
1914-16 British epic of exploration in which a wise and brave
leader kept 27 stranded men alive for 20 months before they were
rescued. The Globe's book editor wrote of this story that while the
world was going mad with war and slaughter, ``Out on the
unforgiving, glittering ice, there was still sanity, romance, hope,
companionship, and tenacious life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scads of books about rock 'n' roll are published, usually shoddy
biographies of stars with empty offstage lives. But here is a book
for the intelligent fan: ``Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock
and Roll, 1947-1977'' by James Miller (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26).
Globe reviewer Joan Anderman wrote, ``Miller distills the cultural
essence, as much with exhaustive and ingenious synthesis of source
material as with plain old good storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides usually misspelling his name, most of us know little
more about the great landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted than
that he designed Central Park in New York and Boston's Emerald
Necklace. But there is much more to know, and much to learn from
``A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in
the Nineteenth Century'' by Witold Rybczynski (Scribner, $28).
Described by reviewer David Rollow as ``the first biography of
Olmsted for a general audience,'' the book maintains that Olmsted
``was a reformer, an improver, as well as an artist. He wanted to
civilize America. That is the `clearing in the distance' of the
book's title.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Listener: A Psychoanalyst Examines His Life'' by Allen
Wheelis (Norton, $25.95) is an almost indescribably strange,
appalling, and beautiful book. Wheelis, who is in his early 80s and
practices in San Francisco, does three things: recalls his
childhood and his parents' lives, presents and accounts for his own
profoundly pessimistic understanding of the human predicament, and
confesses a faith in the importance of love to a happy life. The
Globe book editor wrote, in his review, ``Some such pessimists are
driven to cruelty, rage, or indifference. Others, such as . . .
Allen Wheelis, never lose their tenderheartedness, their sense of
the pathetic beauty of the human desire for union and meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Raban last year won the National Book Critics Circle
award for his history of Montana settlement, ``Badland: An American
Romance.'' This year he has produced a very different and equally
remarkable book, ``Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings''
(Pantheon, $26.50). Raban, a British expat who lives in Seattle,
sailed his boat up the Inside Passage to Alaska, along the way
relating the stories of the native peoples and European explorers
of that region. Like Shackleton, Raban brought his crew (i.e.,
himself) back alive, but the crises and endings in his life on land
are the more poignant parts of the story. Reviewer David Barber
wrote, ``Chastening reckonings loom dead ahead for our castaway,
which a reviewer had better leave unremarked.''
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of overdoing biography (we admit to a weakness), we
offer one more: Judith Thurman's ``Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of
Colette'' (Knopf, $30). Sidonie Gabrielle Colette (1873-1954), the
great French writer and icon of feminine daring and romance, is the
perfect lens on the vibrant worlds of French culture and taste.
Reviewer Rachel Brownstein wrote, ``Thurman writes _ refreshingly,
without apology _ as an American of this fin de siecle, looking
back at the last one and the tumultuous half-century that followed
it. In sure, broad strokes, she sketches a complex, shifting
background: politics from the Dreyfus Affair to the Occupation,
theater from music halls to movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian-born man of letters Elias Canetti (1905-1994) is known
today, to those who know him at all, for his 1935 novel
``Auto-da-Fe.'' But Canetti, who spent much of his adult life in
Britain, was also an indefatigable memoirist whose acquaintances
among the intellectual elite were legion. His three memoirs, ``The
Tongue Set Free,'' ``The Torch in My Ear'' and ``The Play of the
Eyes,'' are collected in ``The Memoirs of Elias Canetti'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, $40). Reviewer George Scialabba wrote, ``It will
surely take its place . . . among the century's greatest
autobiographies.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a book as unusual and beguiling as Bayley's:
``Berryman's Shakespeare: Essays, Letters, and Other Writings by
John Berryman,'' edited by John Haffenden (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$35). The American poet John Berryman, who died in 1972, was a
great lover of the playwright, and wrote about and taught
Shakespeare vividly throughout his career. There have been
thousands of books about the poet of Avon, of course, and the
experts may not regard this one as essential. It is something of a
grab bag (it includes the parts of a never-finished biography);
still, in its treatments of various plays and of points of
scholarly controversy, it gives the double pleasure of encountering
a brilliant, passionate mind savoring the art of another brilliant
and passionate mind. In his Globe review, William Pritchard wrote
of ``this extraordinary volume'': It's the ``imaginative excess in
Berryman's criticism _ his refusal, like Shakespeare, to be a
`sensible' writer _ that gives this rich collection permanent
value.''

ISAAC STERN GETS READY FOR THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The life-loving violinist Isaac Stern has confidently entitled
his new autobiography ``My First 79 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was in town a couple of weeks ago to do some musical
coaching at Harvard, Stern came to lunch to talk about his book
(published by Knopf) and the life in music that it records. And he
made a joke about the title. ``My wife came up with the title we
used _ my own idea was `Have Mouth . . . Will Talk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For all of his cheerfulness, the book ends on a note of
uncertainty. Some of his playing in recent seasons has distressed
the violinist as much as it has troubled his admirers; the cause,
he explains, is arthritis in both hands and carpal-tunnel syndrome.
At the time of writing, he was planning a surgical intervention and
hoping for the regeneration of both musicles and nerves. ```Should
this happen, I will have regained the physical and musical control
with which I can live proudly, and will be able to continue playing
chamber music with friends and to give an occasional solo
performance. By the time this book appears, I should have the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Stern was tucking into his ostrich burger (this was
Cambridge), he could cheerfully report that the surgery had
successfully taken place. ``I am working every day and analyzing
myself _ it's fun, and I'm having a good time figuring out how I
did things I never had to think about. The hand and the bow arm are
coming back, and I am determined to be on the stage for a concert
in Beijing Nov. 19 that will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
filming of the documentary about my first trip to China, `From Mao
to Mozart.' I will play the Beethoven Triple Concerto with the
young cellist from the movie, who has grown up, and my son David
will conduct. Later in the season I will play chamber music
concerts in several cities with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The twice divorced Stern remarried in 1996, and seems a very
happy man today. The once portly Stern has lost a great deal of
weight, and attacks every conversational subject with vigor. His
book, written in collaboration with Chaim Potok, is entertaining,
informative, thoughtful, generous, and dignified; he didn't write
it to settle old scores, and its primary virtue is honesty.
Conductor George Szell once told Stern that if he hadn't spent so
much time doing other things and had just practiced more, he could
have been the greatest violinist in the world _ a remark reported,
as a matter-of-course, in Stern's book; a lesser man might have
omitted it.
</P>
<P>
   Stern says other people have wanted him to produce a book for
decades. He became interested himself a few years ago following
triple bypass surgery. ``I've been around young musicians for 40
years in what I like to call `encounters' rather than classes. And
over the years I've become exercised about what they don't know _
because nobody has bothered to tell them; for some young people,
history began six months ago. But without a knowledge of history,
you can't make sense of anything. You can't understand anything
about musical styles if you don't know why things happened _
without this knowledge you may be a good player, but you will not
be a musician. I wanted to write a book to tell where I came from
and how I got to be the kind of musician I am, and I do think I'm a
pretty good musician. I've been doing some radio shows to promote
this book, and the host usually interrupts the talking with music,
like the first recording I ever made, the C-Minor Sonata of
Beethoven, or the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto I recorded with
Eugene Ormandy. When I hear things like that, I think, `That guy
has talent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Potok came into the picture at the suggestion of Stern's editor
at Knopf, Robert Gottlieb. ``I wanted to work on this book with
somebody I clicked with. When Chaim Potok was suggested, I asked
for copies of some of his books. I read them, and in them you heard
the characters speaking, not Potok; he has an extraordinary ear. So
the book is in my voice, not his _ but the organizational ability
and professional logic are not mine! I sound like an awkward kid
who grew up to be a slightly sarcastic guy with a giggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The book traces Stern's life from his youth in San Francisco,
through the difficult launch of his career, the wartime concerts
for soldiers, the years of triumph and traveling, the efforts to
save Carnegie Hall from the wrecker's ball, his three marriages _
Stern discusses his former wives with reticence and respect. What
makes the book significant are the themes that emerge, reappear,
and interact _ the importance of playing chamber music; what it
takes to be a soloist (``Two things are necessary for a life in
music: a clear idea of what you want to be, and the arrogance to
pursue it. You can't walk onstage and say to the public, `Excuse
me, I'm here.' You must believe in yourself and make immediately
clear to everyone, `I'm going to play. Listen!' ''); his love for
his family (two of his sons are conductors, and his daughter is a
rabbi); his affection and respect for colleagues; the relationship
of the violinist to the violin and, above all, to music.
</P>
<P>
   Stern calls chamber music the bedrock of his musicianship.
``Everything music is about appears in chamber music, in a very
distilled way. You have to understand structure. You have to learn
to listen vertically, and not just horizontally. You have to listen
to what your colleagues are doing and learn to make a concerted
effort. It is possible to play your instrument well without playing
music well. If you can play chamber music, you can play any other
music of any period or style. Eventually you learn how one note
leads to another, and idea leads to feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important characters in Stern's book is his
beloved violin, the Ysaye Guarnarius that once belonged to the
great Belgian violinist Eugene Ysaye and which Stern has owned
since 1965. ``It has strength, excitement, songfulness, masculinity
_ a thrust that resonates in my inner ear,'' he writes. It turns
out that one of the owners of the violin between Ysaye and Stern
was former Boston Symphony music director Charles Munch. ``He was a
lovely, lovely man. He sold the violin for $25,000 to someone who
sold it for $50,000 six months later. I played it for the first
time when it was still in the hands of a dealer and I fell in love
with it; it glowed. I like to say you don't play a violin; you
marry it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many artists today have been criticized for their crossover
activities. Stern himself is no fan of the recent film ``The Red
Violin,'' but writes entertainingly about being the hands for actor
John Garfield in the movie ``Humoresque''; he played on the
soundtrack of the film ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and became a popular
guest of the violin-playing comedian Jack Benny. ``If Jack had
played any better than he did, it wouldn't have been funny. But his
love for the fiddle shone through. It was easy for me to be on the
show because he loved the instrument and he loved music and he
respected artists, and he never made fun of those things. He became
a good and a close friend _ and he was less critical than anybody
else I ever knew in Hollywood; I never heard him say a bad word
about anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Stern displays an affection for the lively and
characteristic anecdote _ one particularly amusing example concerns
his debut with the Boston Symphony under Serge Koussevitzky in
1948. ``(S)uddenly Koussevitzky screamed, `EET EES NOT
FANTASTICAL!!' I didn't know what he meant; no one in the orchestra
knew what he meant. But at the performance that evening _ with the
concentraion, the ineffable wonder of playing a concert _ it was
fantastical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the book is also serious to the core, as Stern is, despite
all his affability of manner. The violinist is as aware as anyone
of widespread concern about the state of musical culture today but
he remains optimistic. ``I don't believe that any great art form,
any part of the history of man's accomplishments and civilization,
is as discardable as a used tissue. Music has seen times as
difficult as this. Today we can be overwhelmed by the flow of
information scudding across the computer or the television screen _
but it is predigested information, controlled information. The
excitement of discovery, of finding out something for yourself, of
thinking and feeling is almost gone. Yet what makes us human is the
ability to think and ask the question `why?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stern warms to one of his favorite subjects, education. ``This
is a mantra, but who are we educating, about what, and how do you
do it. Teaching should be the highest paid and most honored
profession in the country, and it is not, yet the whole future of
this country lies in the minds of young people, who are the
greatest resource that we have. But we must realize and nurture
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Stern lives with his wife Linda Reynolds Stern in
Connecticut and maintains a pied-a-terre in New York, where he can
keep a watchful eye on Carnegie Hall. Reviewing that story, one
wishes again that someone like Stern _ but is there anyone like
him? _ had become interested in the fate of the old Boston Opera
House, which was torn down in 1958, the same year Carnegie Hall
almost became rubble. Stern is particularly excited at the latest
development in Carnegie Hall, the construction of a 650-seat
auditorium in the space formerly occupied by the Carnegie Hall
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   And it's clear that he can't wait until his return to the
concert platform, where he has spent some of the richest hours of
his life. ``I have a weakness, I have to confess _ I love music.
George Bernard Shaw once remarked that the greatest thing in life
is to die young _ but to delay it as long as possible.''

lead in New Hampshire. (Herman in Phoenix/Greenberger in Austin,

   MEXICO-KILLINGS _ CIUDAD JUAREZ, Chihuahua _ Francisco
Alcanter's eyes searched for tourists coming over the international
bridge from El Paso. ``Taxi?'' he asked, jockeying with other cab
drivers for business. Alcanter has seen the news about Mexican and
U.S. officials digging for bodies at two ranches near Juarez, where
they believe victims of the city's long-running drug war are
buried. The latest headlines bother Alcanter, who remains skeptical
of reports of mass graves. ``The publicity, unfortunately, hurts a
lot of families,'' he said. ``The tourists listen to the news, and
they're afraid to come here.'' In the past few years, Juarez, a
blue-collar factory city of almost 2 million people, has been the
scene of more than any city's share of bad news. More than 200
women have been slain in Juarez since 1993, many of them young
factory workers abducted as they returned home from jobs in one of
the city's 330 maquiladoras, the U.S.-owned plants where Mexican
workers assemble products for the American market. The string of
killings, which many Juarez residents suspect are the work of one
or more serial killers, ha-- attracted worldwide attention. (Austin
American-Statesman).

   Smashing space probes into celestial bodies is becoming
fashionable. In July, Lunar Prospector was crashed at a speed of
6,000 kph (about 4,000 mph) into a dark crater near the moon's
south pole in what proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to detect
water.
</P>
<P>
   And this was merely the precursor to several brutal encounters
that are due to take place between spacecraft and astronomical
objects over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the solar system is taking a violent turn. The
European Space Agency (ESA) plans to chase a comet and then skewer
it with a harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   America's space agency, NASA, intends to use a huge copper
projectile to blow a hole in another comet, to see what it looks
like inside.
</P>
<P>
   And on Dec. 3, two football-sized probes smashed into the
surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The two probes, known collectively as the Deep Space 2 mission,
were released from a probe called Mars Polar Lander ten minutes
before that also was scheduled to touch down near the planet's
south pole.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the lander itself, the probes have no parachutes or
rocket motors to slow their descent _ just a protective
``aeroshell,'' which acts as a heat shield. This makes the probes
small and light enough to piggyback on the lander. But they are
also, ideally, tough enough to survive an impact with the Martian
surface.
</P>
<P>
   This impact smashes their aeroshells to pieces and embeds the
probes in the soil. The impact is also designed to cause the center
of each probe _ a sensor linked to the rest of the device by an
umbilical cord _ to bury itself a meter or so into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The probe's main body is supposed to stay on the surface to
transmit its findings up to the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor
craft, which then retransmits the data back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of this violent approach is that slamming a probe
into the Martian soil is easier and cheaper than messing around
with a robot arm, and can penetrate further below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although the probes are designed to seek evidence of water in
the soil, and to take temperature and pressure readings, their main
purpose is as a technological demonstration. If they work, the
crash-landing technique could be used in subsequent missions to
prick the skins of other celestial objects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ESA is planning an attack on a comet. Its three-ton
Rosetta probe will be launched in 2003, and will end up in orbit
around comet 46 P/Wirtanen in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Since comets are leftovers from billions of years ago, they are
regarded as crucial to understanding the formation of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   This comet was chosen for investigation because it is relatively
inactive _ most of the volatile materials in its nucleus having
been exhausted. (An active nucleus, spewing out gas and dust, would
be more dangerous to approach.)
</P>
<P>
   Having mapped the surface of the nucleus, Rosetta will release a
small lander. As the lander is pulled in by the comet's weak
gravity, it will unfurl three spring-loaded legs to absorb the
energy of the impact, and will then fire a harpoon into the comet's
surface to ensure that it stays put.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with this gentle pinprick, however, the NASA
researchers behind the Deep Impact probe have planned a giant
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a look at the inside of another comet _ called
P/Tempel-1 _ they plan to smash a projectile weighing half a ton
into it at 36,000 kph. This will, they calculate, produce a crater
as big as a football field and deep enough to swallow a seven-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, which is planned for July 4, 2005, will be so
violent that it should be visible through small telescopes on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the planners, the mission will have ``huge public
appeal'' because such an explosion ``naturally attracts the public
and schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the resulting cloud of debris will provide
information about conditions in the primordial solar system. It
could also put the normal fireworks seen that day in the shade. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-LANDER (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Latest on efforts to
re-establish contact with the Mars Polar Lander. By John Noble
Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (San Francisco) _ Two gene therapy advances, in
the treatment of hemophilia and heart disease. By Lawrence M.
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLANCK-LENGTH (Undated) _ According to recent developments
in the quest to devise a so-called ``theory of everything,'' space
is not an infinitely divisible continuum. It is not smooth but
granular, and the Planck length gives the size of its smallest
possible grains. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCHIZOPHRENIA-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Researchers are
beginning, in a systematic way, to investigate the earliest stages
of schizophrenia, attempting to find signs that could predict its
onset. But some of that research has become controversial,
particularly the aspect of treating people with drugs for a
condition they do not yet have. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUBBLE-RESCUE (Undated) _ If all goes according to plan, the
Hubble Space Telescope, a window through which humans have viewed
the edges of space for almost a decade, will soon be reawakened by
the nudging, gloved hands of astronauts replacing and repairing the
failed inner works that forced it into hibernation. Next week, the
space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to blast off on a mission to
restore the observatory. By Warren E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ARCTIC-WARMING (Undated) _ Evidence continues to accumulate
that global warming is thawing the frozen world of the Arctic and
sub-Arctic, and the findings are spotlighting two increasingly
important questions: Can what is happening in the Great White North
touch off sudden shifts in climate that will transform weather and
disrupt life throughout the Northern Hemisphere? Is the Arctic a
key to the way in which global warming might be translated into
region-by-region climatic changes? By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRST-EMIGRANTS (Undated) _ Two genetic surveys of human
populations have brought new evidence to bear on a pivotal event in
prehistory, the first dispersal of modern humans from Africa. One
study, based on analysis of people in East Africa and India,
suggests the first emigration of modern humans was eastward, toward
Asia, and not northward through the eastern Mediterranean. A
second, drawing on DNA data from 50 ethnic groups around the world,
concludes that the ancestral population from which the first
emigrants came may have numbered as few as 2,000 people. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NOTHINGNESS-ESSAY (Undated) _ With physicists' identifying
nothingness as the central mystery of the origin and structure of
the universe, a battle of words has been ignited over the last
several years. The question is whether concepts in physics, biology
and the other hard sciences can shed any light on similar-sounding
concepts in the humanities. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-U.S.-LOST-LAND (Undated) _ U.S. finds wetlands, farmlands
and forest are being lost at an accelerating rate. By William K.
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIABETES-BRACELETS (Undated) _ In the near future, people
with diabetes may be wearing pain-free bracelets or even earrings
smart enough to sense and report glucose levels continuously to an
artificial pancreas: a surgically embedded pump that dispenses just
the right amount of insulin into the bloodstream. By Anne
Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIET-WEB-SITES (Undated) _ It was probably inevitable that
the World Wide Web would bloom with sites for dieters. But to the
surprise of professional dietitians, many of these sites have
turned out to be not only popular but effective. By David Rampe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Your science questions answered.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Short items on health and and
fitness.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Drawing on her training as a
therapist and her experiences in self-healing after the death of
her husband, Marta Felber wrote ``Grief Expressed: When a Mate
Dies'' (Life Words, 1997), which can serve as a road map to
recovery for the bereaved as well as a guide to those who wish to
express sympathy and offer comfort and support. By Jane E. Brody.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After nine years of pressure, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is
still firmly ensconced in power. Sanctions have failed to make any
impression on the dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we may have reached a crunch point where the sanctions
are abandoned in a tit-for-tat deal whereby United Nations weapons
inspectors are allowed back into the country. The deadline at the
U.N. for the latest offer-cum-threat runs out this week.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad is not happy. It describes the British-backed proposals
as ``abhorrent'' and ``malicious.'' In reality, the proposals at
last show some common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent has consistently opposed the sanctions that were
imposed on Iraq. They have only encouraged ordinary Iraqis to feel
solidarity with their embattled and otherwise loathed regime.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, sanctions have also allowed the leaders of a corrupt
administration to make themselves even richer than they already
were. Because power in Iraq is so centralized, Saddam's family has
been able to exploit its privileged access to otherwise unavailable
goods, by establishing a highly lucrative monopoly in their resale.
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of sanctions will be doubly welcome if it is
accompanied by the return of U.N. weapons inspectors who can
attempt to provide guarantees that Iraq does not breach the
promises that it made to the U.N. about its weapon stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, France refused even to attend the vote on the issue,
because of its unhappiness at the proposed approach; Russia and
China both abstained. Now, however, the French seem more amenable
to the idea. Certainly, that is what the Iraqis think; they are
bitter that the French have changed their line.
</P>
<P>
   The issue looks likely to come to a head on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks there have been two short-term extensions of the
oil-for-food deal. If the inspectors are not permitted, then even
that deal may conceivably lapse; until now, a series of six-month
extensions has made possible a form of rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the air war continues, almost forgotten by the rest
of the world and ignored by Saddam himself _ though not by the
civilians who have suffered so heavily in the raids.
</P>
<P>
   The existing policy of bombs, sanctions, and diplomacy has got
nowhere. Now, at least there is a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq could still refuse to cooperate. In practice, if France and
Russia are part of the package Baghdad may accept that this is the
best offer it is likely to get.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a long way from getting rid of Saddam Hussein. But
at least it would be a start. &QL;

   Sports stories from The New York Times News Service for Tuesday,
Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   SOC-WORLD-CUP (Tokyo) _ Mutual recriminations are flying among
the Japanese broadcast companies that have sought to buy rights to
soccer's World Cup 2002. From their descriptions of the way the
negotiations have been handled, as well as from documents obtained
by The New York Times, a picture emerges of possible conflicts of
interest, noncompetitive deal-making and deep suspicions all around
of secrecy and betrayal. By Howard French.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN-BASEBALL (New York) _ Hours before they were to go to
trial, ESPN and Major League Baseball reached a settlement over the
cable network's scheduling of Sunday night games. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-ARATON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Latrell Sprewell will meet up with
P.J. Carlesimo for the second time in recent weeks when Golden
State plays the Knicks at the Garden on Tuesday night. Maybe this
time, Sprewell should shake Carlesimo's hand. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-GIANTS-PAYTON (East Rutherford, N.J.) _ The Giants stunned
just about everyone with their rout of the Jets on Sunday. They are
now 6-6 and in the thick of both the NFC East race and the NFC
wild-card race. And a good deal of the credit for the victory goes
to the unheralded Sean Payton, the team's quarterbacks coach, who
took over play-calling responsibilities from Coach Jim Fassel. By
Bill Pennington.

 By RUPERT CORNWELL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Britain is at war, and has been so without a break for almost 12
months. Not against Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, nor the
Serbs in Kosovo, but in a little reported and largely unnoticed air
campaign against Iraq, in which _ by Baghdad's claim _ more than
200 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Operation Desert Fox, the last major allied bombing
onslaught against Iraq and triggered by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's failure to comply with U.N. disarmament demands, lasted
just four days before ending on Dec. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to diminish and degrade Saddam's military capacity
and we have done so,'' Tony Blair, the British prime minister,
claimed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In truth though, the fighting has never stopped, with British
and U.S. jets engaged in combat over Iraqi territory roughly once
every three days.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, American F-14 and F-18 jets carried out what
Baghdad said were 70 sorties over southern Iraq, blasting radar and
antiaircraft emplacements.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, the clashes arise from patrols by American
and British warplanes of no-fly-areas imposed in the north and
south of the country, to protect Iraqi Kurds and minority Shi'ites
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As such they are entirely separate from the debate over a new
U.N. inspections regime, coupled with a possible lifting of
sanctions, now reaching a climax in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Iraqi leader these interdictions, north of the 36th
parallel and south of the 32nd, have become a symbol of an illegal
curtailment of national sovereignty, and continuing Anglo-American
persecution of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Firing missiles (and very occasionally dispatching Iraqi planes)
against what the Baghdad press refers to as ``hostile crows,''
offers Saddam a convenient way of keeping Iraq's humanitarian
crisis in the headlines, and demonstrating that while the country
is down, it is still far from out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact however, the result has been mainly indifference. In
America, the media pay little attention. In Britain, the regular
combat action seen by the half dozen RAF Jaguars based in Incirlik
in eastern Turkey and the 18 Tornados operating out of Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia goes without mention for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, a newspaper runs a critical editorial, a
skeptical MP asks a question in the House of Commons, complaining
at the futility of it all. But otherwise the low-intensity conflict
is ignored, barring the odd incident like last summer, when a stray
allied bomb was alleged to have hit the reputed burial site of the
evangelist Matthew, 20 miles from the city of Mosul, well north of
the 36th parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, despite the more than 200 civilians said by Baghdad
to have been killed in ``collateral damage'' inflicted by allied
``precision'' bombs and missiles, the upsurge of sympathy in the
Arab world on which Baghdad was counting has failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, barring a radical change in the dynamics of the Iraqi
crisis, the stalemate in the ``secret war'' might continue for
months yet.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation against Saddam's ``provocations'' costs Britain an
estimated (pounds sterling)55 million a year in extra military
spending -- irritating certainly, but a relatively minor addition
to the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is any punishment the allies might inflict likely to
persuade Saddam to change his ways. Last December Blair and U.S.
President Bill Clinton boasted of the damage they had done to
Iraq's war machine, and the ``particularly serious damage'' caused
to the Republican Guard, that war machine's most dangerous part.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the strikes continue, to little visible military
effect. Saddam's grip on power meanwhile seems as firm as ever. If
anything, many experts conclude, the endless war of attrition has
increased his support among ordinary Iraqis. &QL;

<P>
   Britain is at war, and has been so without a break for almost 12
months. Not against Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, nor the
Serbs in Kosovo, but in a little reported and largely unnoticed air
campaign against Iraq, in which _ by Baghdad's claim _ more than
200 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Operation Desert Fox, the last major allied bombing
onslaught against Iraq and triggered by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's failure to comply with U.N. disarmament demands, lasted
just four days before ending on Dec. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to diminish and degrade Saddam's military capacity
and we have done so,'' Tony Blair, the British prime minister,
claimed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In truth though, the fighting has never stopped, with British
and U.S. jets engaged in combat over Iraqi territory roughly once
every three days.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, American F-14 and F-18 jets carried out what
Baghdad said were 70 sorties over southern Iraq, blasting radar and
antiaircraft emplacements.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, the clashes arise from patrols by American
and British warplanes of no-fly-areas imposed in the north and
south of the country, to protect Iraqi Kurds and minority Shi'ites
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As such they are entirely separate from the debate over a new
U.N. inspections regime, coupled with a possible lifting of
sanctions, now reaching a climax in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Iraqi leader these interdictions, north of the 36th
parallel and south of the 32nd, have become a symbol of an illegal
curtailment of national sovereignty, and continuing Anglo-American
persecution of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Firing missiles (and very occasionally dispatching Iraqi planes)
against what the Baghdad press refers to as ``hostile crows,''
offers Saddam a convenient way of keeping Iraq's humanitarian
crisis in the headlines, and demonstrating that while the country
is down, it is still far from out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact however, the result has been mainly indifference. In
America, the media pay little attention. In Britain, the regular
combat action seen by the half dozen RAF Jaguars based in Incirlik
in eastern Turkey and the 18 Tornados operating out of Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia goes without mention for weeks on end.

IS THERE A CHANGE IN STORE FOR THAT PESKY PENNY? NOT LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Is there anything more forsaken these days than
the one-cent piece? Clerks ignore them, customers leave them on
counters and almost nobody ever stoops down to pick one off the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penny'' candy costs as much as a nickel. Some places, such as
the Garden State Parkway toll road in New Jersey, won't even accept
the coin anymore.
</P>
<P>
   There are 114 billion pennies in circulation, yet last summer
the nation still managed to suffer one of the biggest penny
shortages in recent memory _ mainly because so many people kept
taking them home and dumping them in jars or giant water-cooler
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Is the penny is pooped as currency?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely annoying,'' said Annie Bogue of Albany, who was
on a shopping trip recently at a suburban shopping center. ``It
takes too much time, I have to dig for it and I'd rather they just
round it off.''
</P>
<P>
   The penny, a word that comes from the British pence, dates to
1793, when the U.S. government began to mint the nation's money.
Previously, Spanish gold and silver coins made from conquistador
plunder were used.
</P>
<P>
   The penny has changed a bit since then, going from a 100 percent
copper coin with an image of Lady Liberty to a coin today that is
made of 97.5 percent zinc bearing the image of Abraham Lincoln.
More than 300 billion pennies have been minted in the past 200
years. In 1999, 10 million were made at a cost of three-fourths of
a cent per coin.
</P>
<P>
   Coins have been done away with before. The halfpenny, for
instance, lasted only until 1857 before the government decided it
was pretty useless.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Benfield, a Washington lobbyist who in the past has
fought for longer daylight-saving time and the $1 coin being
released next year, took part in a Congressional Banking Committee
hearing on the penny in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It was the zinc industry that protested most, he said, afraid of
the business they would lose if the penny died out. Today, Benfield
still thinks the coin should be done away with, but in an election
year, he said, no politician would touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he still easily touts the benefits of getting rid
of the coin, such as the way it would speed up cash-register lines
and free up space in register tills for the new $1 coin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weller, a spokesman for the group Americans for Common
Cents in Washington, gets paid _ although not in pennies _ to
defend the coin. His lobbying organization is funded mostly by the
zinc industry, although others also have interest in the penny's
survival. For instance, fund-raising organizations say they get
some of their money by penny donations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is,'' Weller said, ``what's the
alternative?''
</P>
<P>
   Simple, say members of anti-penny factions. Just round purchases
off to the nearest nickel. That's what some retailers already have
started doing.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to consider that items could still be
priced, for instance, $19.99 instead of $20. It would only be the
final bill, not the price of each item, that would be rounded off.
And credit card or check purchases could still be made out down to
the nearest cent.
</P>
<P>
   Weller says there are other reasons to keep the penny around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the transactions under $10 are done in
cash,'' he said. ``You can't start with the assumption that
(rounding off) will just even out over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important reason the penny may be here to stay
is that history shows that the American people _ who soundly
rejected the metric system, the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin and
the $2 bill _ don't react well to change. Especially changing
change.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen, manager of Off Broadway Shoes, said his Albany store
rarely uses coins because most purchases are done by check or
charge. However, he still thinks the penny is vital, if not
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still got a place in the world,'' he said.

OLD DISCONTENT REACHES HIGH HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's Battle in Seattle may have surprised the World Trade
Organization and the high priests of US foreign policy, but the
demonstrations and violence that turned the Emerald City into an
armed camp reflect frustrations years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   For the last half decade, the discontent with America's trade
policy has been masked by a strong economy and a basic consensus
among major presidential aspirants about the overall value of free
and untrammeled trade.
</P>
<P>
   But as unions, progressives, and environmentalists have
witnessed an erosion of their prerogatives, power, and protection,
they have become convinced that the current trading regime hasn't
lived up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Although politically polyglot, the group is unified by its
opposition to value-neutral free trade, open markets, and an
unrestricted flow of capital. The key phrase, of course, is
value-neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Told that trade would lift most boats, those groups think what
globalization has actually wrought is an invidious race to the
bottom, pitting US workers and their sensibilities against
countries that repress labor and despoil the environment.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened against the backdrop of speculator-driven
currency crises that have thrown nations into panic, International
Monetary Fund strictures that have favored the preservation of
investment climates over stimulating employment, and a growing
backlash against the loss of cultural identity that has accompanied
globalization in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement has been building for the last 10 years,'' said
Robert Scott, an economist who works on trade issues for the
Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank based in
Washington, D.C. ``Now it has really reached the boiling point.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the anger bubbling over on the Seattle streets is
that those groups have had little effect on policy by working
inside the system.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bush and Clinton administrations, the mainstream policy
mantra in Washington has been simple: Unfettered trade will
naturally maximize wealth by focusing each country's economy on
what it does best. And if jobs are lost to foreign competitors, the
market will reallocate that displaced labor to a more productive
function. Or so goes free-trade theory, as developed by classical
economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly today's free-traders see the current economy as proof
that the theory is right. ``Here we are with the best economy we
have ever had, with unemployment at historically low levels, with
the Fed expected to raise interest rates because the economy is so
tight,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, chief trade negotiator for Asia
under President Reagan and now president of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington policy research group. ``There is just no
evidence that trading with these countries is having any (negative)
effect on us.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's hardly the way the skeptics see it. They started to
grow dubious in the 1970s, when a dramatic increase in trade
coincided with a stagnating economy and the start of a long decline
in income.
</P>
<P>
   In anything less than a full-employment economy, labor displaced
by trade wouldn't necessarily be put to a more productive use,
those skeptics said. Rather, experience taught that the more
probable effect was for unemployed workers to swell the labor pool,
increase supply, and thus drive down wages.
</P>
<P>
   What's notable about last week's huge protests, however, is that
they came at a time when record prosperity has driven joblessness
down to a level below what economists had theretofore regarded as
full employment.
</P>
<P>
   So why the discontent in a time of seeming economic plenty?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the different effects trade has on various sectors
of the economy. It's a bit of a generalization, yet basically
accurate, to say that the United States exports sophisticated,
high-value-added products while importing lower-end goods.
</P>
<P>
   Thus well-educated workers do well under a policy that maximizes
free trade. ``Highly skilled professionals seem to be largely
immune from trade and probably benefit because we have lower prices
for goods that we buy,'' says Barry Bluestone, a professor of
political economy at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for lesser-skilled workers, and particularly those in the
manufacturing sector, who have long borne the brunt of competition
with low-wage foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanding trade almost by definition means stiffer competition
at the lower end, and some of what working people are reacting to
is definitely connected to that,'' says James K. Galbraith, an
economist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In sectors where international competition is fierce, the
questions those workers are asking are good ones _ and the answers
they are getting are not.
</P>
<P>
   Take labor conditions. The cost of labor is key to the price of
a product. Is it fair that workers in the United States, where the
minimum wage sets a floor, are forced to compete with foreign
workers who earn only a fraction of US wages?
</P>
<P>
   A pure free-trader would say yes, since low wages are the
comparative advantage a developing country commands.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the low-wage country has suppressed unions, thereby
keeping wages artificially low, as, for example, is the case in
China? Or what if US factories are competing with goods produced by
child labor? Should that repression or exploitation of labor also
be considered part of a country's natural comparative advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Although the World Trade Organization is attuned to business
concerns such as subsidized exports or copyright violations, it
hasn't addressed workers' concerns with similar alacrity, said Thea
Lee, assistant director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, in an
interview from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, its response has been that those labor concerns are not
appropriate issues for its sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very resistant, and that is why we are out on the
streets,'' said Lee. ``We want the World Trade Organization to
address these issues with the same vigor and effectiveness with
which it currently addresses issues of concern to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns have driven the AFL-CIO to advocate the inclusion
of five basic labor standards _ freedom of association, the right
to organize and bargain collectively, and prohibitions on child
labor, forced labor, and discrimination in employment _ into the
WTO and world trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps the best crystallization of the tenets of the
growing fair-trade movement: Proper international trade policy
would lift working conditions in developing countries rather than
see competition erode US wages and working standards.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentally, the issues are different, but the underlying
concerns are the same: an erosion of US protections as a result of
competition with lower-standard countries.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental community cites a string of WTO decisions that
have essentially degraded US environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent is the October 1998 ruling that, though
recognizing the legitimacy of the statute's goal, nevertheless
undercut a US law banning the importation of shrimp from countries
that don't include ``turtle excluder'' devices on all shrimp nets.
The WTO said the law violated world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that they acknowledged that this kind of law was
legitimate, but we still lost a case we should have won,'' said
David Shorr, director of the World Wildlife Fund's sustainable
commerce program. ``The case reflects a consistent bias of WTO
rules against environmental priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem for free-trade skeptics is the lack of a plausible
candidate to carry their message nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Of this year's presidential hopefuls, only Pat Buchanan, former
Republican, current Reform Party member, has broken with the
free-trade establishment _ and his views on other issues are
sufficiently outside the mainstream that he is hardly credible.
Party founder Ross Perot, meanwhile, probably hurt the cause of
fair trade with his blunderbuss predictions of disaster if the
North American Free Trade Agreement passed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the skeptics fare much better in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton won on NAFTA in 1993 and on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994, he has since suffered a
string of defeats and frustrations as he has sought fast-track
negotiating authority and tried to expand NAFTA-like free trade to
Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, says
growing numbers of lawmakers think the old model must be changed to
include standards to protect workers and the environment. He
compares the effort to Franklin D. Roosevelt's determination to
take the rough edges off capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really the New Deal versus trickle-down, taken
internationally,'' Frank says. ``They are saying, `Just let capital
go where it can get the best return,' and we are saying, `No, that
is not enough, you have to look at the adverse economic effects.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sense, the protesters have scored an important
victory in Seattle. Their efforts made front-page news of arcane
issues often all but ignored by the mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton's speech on Wednesday championed their
cause, urging the WTO to address labor and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Frank thinks the issue could grow to be as important, powerful,
and divisive as the Vietnam War or civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   And though free-traders reflexively label any other system
protectionist, as if that term itself should deter debate, smart,
thoughtful people are reconsidering old verities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a wake-up call about the need to reexamine the
values underlying our international economic policy,'' says
Galbraith.

TAX CUTS NOT AT THE TOP OF VOTERS' PRIORITY LIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For most political candidates, especially
Republicans, proposing tax cuts ranks right up at the top of the
``must do'' list, on the same level as waving the flag and
endorsing motherhood and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   So it was inevitable that Republican presidential hopeful George
W. Bush was going to lay out a tax-cut plan of his own.
</P>
<P>
   And it should have been no surprise that he did so just before
his first nationally televised debate with the other GOP
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   With the race for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary
tightening up and a lot of public attention focused on whether
Bush's much-anticipated debate debut would boost or cripple his
frontrunner status, he tried to generate some positive, pre-debate
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor and other avowed tax-fighters may be
missing the boat with many voters.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would like to see their taxes reduced, to be sure,
but taxes apparently aren't as burning an issue with most voters as
they seemingly are with the candidates, at least not this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a national telephone poll conducted Nov. 19-23 for The
Associated Press, only about one out of 12 respondents said that
taxes were the most important issue facing the country today.
</P>
<P>
   Education, Social Security, Medicare, the economy, the nation's
moral values and health care _ which Bush and most other
presidential candidates also are attempting to address in one form
or another _ were identified as much more important to most people.
</P>
<P>
   Education, chosen by one of every four respondents, was clearly
the top concern.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy was chosen as an important issue by about
one of every six people surveyed, the AP concluded that Americans
have generally positive feelings about their own financial
situations. Forty percent of the respondents said they were better
off than they were four years ago, and about the same number said
their economic standing was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly positive feelings about the economy were the main
reason that taxes were such a low concern, the AP suggested, and
that is probably correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be other contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   One is a fear that tax cuts may jeopardize important public
services, such as education and Social Security, which were high on
Americans' priority lists.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible reason for tax-cut burnout among the voters is
a stream of unfulfilled tax-reduction promises by office-seekers.
Perhaps the most infamous in recent years was the broken
``read-my-lips'' anti-tax pledge that contributed to the 1992
re-election defeat of former President Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of thing that makes many people simply tune out
political promises.
</P>
<P>
   Still another possible explanation, which covers much of Gov.
Bush's tax record in Texas, involves tax reductions that are
enacted, as promised, but are virtually invisible to many
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign stops throughout the country, including the
nationally televised debate from New Hampshire, Bush has bragged
about signing the two largest tax cuts in Texas history _ about $3
billion worth, mostly targeted at school property taxes, during the
last two state budget periods.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did sign the tax relief bills, and many Texans did benefit
with lower taxes. But the effects have been uneven, and many other
Texans have actually seen their school taxes increase during Bush's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 law that raised the homestead exemption for school taxes
was more than eaten up in many school districts when local
officials raised tax rates and increased property appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, with Bush's backing, enacted two more
tax-relief bills this past spring. One provided for a number of
consumer and business tax cuts and credits that will be significant
for some taxpayers but worth only pocket change to many others.
</P>
<P>
   A second law last spring again produced school property tax cuts
in some districts but not in others. Almost 400 school districts
actually raised their tax rates this year. My school taxes in
Austin increased _ again _ because the local school board raised
the tax rate to help keep up with heavy enrollment growth.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to rising property values, many Houston-area residents
also are wondering what became of their much ballyhooed tax
``cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The local tax increases weren't Bush's fault, and the governor
can argue, with some validity, that school taxes would have gone up
even more without the tax relief that he and the Legislature
provided.
</P>
<P>
   But if many people don't get excited while Bush and the other
presidential candidates claw each other over who's the biggest
tax-cutter, who can blame them?

49ERS WIDE RECEIVER ISN'T CALLING IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Jerry Rice, the most prolific wide receiver in NFL
history, intends to return to the struggling San Francisco 49ers
next year for his 16th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming back next year no matter what,'' Rice, 37, said
Sunday after turning in his most productive game in more than a
year. ``I don't want to go out like this. ... We're going to turn
this around. This one game didn't make me make up my mind. I was
going to come back no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 44-30 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Rice caught nine
passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns, all season bests. It was
his first 100-yard receiving game of the year, helped along by a
55-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from two major operations on his left knee in
1997, Rice has struggled to regain his form. While the left knee
has healed and gives him no problem, Rice had been troubled for
more than a year by an injury to his right knee that cannot be
corrected by surgery. Only time can heal the injury to the
posterior part of the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rice has been an affable sort throughout what will be
his first losing season with the 49ers, he has chafed at what he
perceives as a reduced role with the team. The circumstances of
Sunday's game compelled the 49ers to pass, and Rice still has life
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win, that's the most important thing,'' he said. ``I don't
think I have to prove anything. I do enjoy opportunities, though. I
felt we had opportunities today but we didn't win. It looked pretty
good. We were very aggressive. What I liked about the situation is
we didn't panic. We came out, put some points on the board and made
it a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's turn-back-the-clock game by Rice, it appeared as
though he had lost that dynamic quality that separated him from his
peers. There was speculation that the game against Cincinnati would
be his final season with the 49ers. But if he completes the season
with more games like Sunday's, there is no reason he shouldn't be
back in 2000. Rice is signed through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's two touchdowns against the Bengals increased his ongoing
league-record total to 179 overall, 168 on receptions. It was the
65th 100-yard reception game of his career and his 36th
multiple-touchdown game.

IN DEFENSE OF HARRY POTTER AND POKEMON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to think about Destiny when you're worried about what
the construction on I-30 is going to do to your commute home. It's
impossible to ponder your ultimate fate when you're trying to find
wet towels for your child's sudden, inexplicable bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most of us don't contemplate Destiny on a
daily basis. We're too busy with the details of life _ pinballing
between relationships and work, from crisis to crisis. We live on
diversions. We live the unstudied life. This is the world of most
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not where kids live.
</P>
<P>
   Kids live in a world of big-picture possibilities and terrors,
where the question of the day, every day, is who or what will I
``be''? They live in a world that's part fantasy. And for that
world they need heroes and role models.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly why I love Harry Potter and Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a popular opinion _ at least among the over-12 set.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter (a kid-lit protagonist), and Pokemon (a multimedia
phenomenon) are taking a beating these days as they stand at the
very top of the heap of children's popular culture. Kids,
obviously, love them, but mobs of vocal adults question whether the
pop phenoms are actually, well, evil.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the cover of ``Time'' magazine bannered Pokemon
as an ``addiction'' for kids (Pokemon being the collective
Nintendo-spawned assortment of Game Boy games, TV shows, trading
cards, toys and feature films all centering on a boy named Ash and
his adventures in a world filled with magical pocket monsters). The
statement was followed by the rhetorical nail-biter: ``Is it bad
for them?'' A recent story in ``Slate,'' an e-mag, noted that
across the nation, Pokemon has also ``spawned the usual
fundamentalist protests: One Colorado preacher made kids in his
congregation watch as he torched Pokemon cards and chopped a
Pokemon toy with his sword.'' Sayonara, Ash. Goodbye, Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Harry Potter, the fictional 11-year-old apprentice
wizard who is the central character in J.K. Rowling's three
national bestsellers, who has taken the most recent public licking.
A story in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram last week reported that
Harry has been banned from several Tarrant County schools whose
educators question whether the books' references to wizardry and
witchcraft are appropriate for children. Teachers at Colleyville
Elementary School were told not to read the books in class or
recommend them for their students. An elementary library aide at
Fort Worth Christian, a private school in North Richland Hills
where the books are also banned, was strident in her Harry
harassment: ``We just don't have anything to do with that. You have
some children who are so prone to those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not sure exactly what she meant by ``those things.''
Perhaps the kids in North Richland Hills think Harry Potter is real
and they are _ to be like Harry _ riding around on Nimbus 2000
broomsticks and practicing Defense against the Dark Arts duels.
Maybe they're even throwing around Pokeballs from Toys R Us and
hoping little monsters will pop out and battle each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think so. I suspect kids in North Richland Hills and
elsewhere just want a good story.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a good story.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's 12 and he's scared.
</P>
<P>
   It's been two years since he learned his true identity _ that he
is a wizard and that his parents were magicians who were killed by
the evil wizard Lord Voldemort. Voldemort had tried to kill baby
Harry, too, but failed. The encounter left only a jagged scar on
Harry's forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harry is in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry. A series of harrowing adventures have led him to
understand that he, indeed, has great power. But he can't help but
wonder: Is it power for good _ or evil? What is his Destiny?
</P>
<P>
   The torturous soul-searching began when Harry arrived at
Hogwarts, and the Sorting Hat _ which places students into four
sort-of fraternities _ said Harry would do well in Slytherin, the
house founded by a once-great wizard who later turned to the Dark
Arts. It was the house Voldemort was in.
</P>
<P>
   Harry now brings his fears that he is Slytherin's rightful heir
to Dumbledore, the school headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Sorting Hat) only put me in Gryffindor,'' said Harry
in a defeated voice, ``because I asked not to go in Slytherin.
...''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Exactly,' '' said Dumbledore, beaming once more. `` `Which
makes you very ``different'' from Tom Riddle (aka Voldemort). It is
our choices, Harry, that show us what we truly are, far more than
our abilities.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very theological,'' says Ulrich Knopflmacher, a
professor of English at Princeton University, about the scene from
``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.'' Knopflmacher teaches
children's literature. He also has a 9-year-old son who devoured
the Harry Potter books and is a Pokemaniac.
</P>
<P>
   Knopflmacher, expounding on Destiny in children's literature,
begins with a little history lesson about fairy tales. The word
``fairy'' derives from the Latin ``fatum,'' which means that which
has been spoken, or fate. Fairies were once the equivalent to the
Greek fates who spun the destinies of people.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Embedded in the genre of fairy tales is the whole question of
destiny,'' Knopflmacher says. In many fairy tales, like ``Sleeping
Beauty,'' there's a christening of a child, which both the good
fairy and the bad fairy attend, each trying to affect the child's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Knopflmacher says the Texas educators who've banned Harry Potter
come from a long tradition. ``They're equating this modern version
of a fairy tale with witchcraft. That goes back to the Puritans.
The distrust of fairy tales as being pagan goes back a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of gnomes and sprites and other pagan spirits living in
Druid forests and affecting the futures of people apparently
repelled the leaders of Christian churches _ just as the idea of
Harry, and Ash and his magic monsters, are repelling groups of
grown-ups now _ because they seem anti-theological.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, Knopflmacher points out, is that the opposite is
true. He sees a parallel with George McDonald, an English clergyman
who wrote fantastic allegorical tales about animals, tales for
which he was defrocked. Later generations, though, were able to see
the tales as moral tales that could indeed serve ``a Christian
providential order.''
</P>
<P>
   Knopflmacher says it's a ``real sort of know-nothing attitude to
dismiss this'' (Harry Potter books).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now McDonald is sold in Christian bookstores,'' Knopflmacher
says. ``The same is going to happen with Harry Potter.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another story. My son Jack, who's 9, is watching Pokemon
on TV. Ash has entered the great Pokemon League tournament. In
front of a stadium packed with fans, including his mom and his
mentor, Professor Oak, Ash goes into battle against a kid named
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon battle is one of strength and courage. It's not
about destroying an enemy _ in fact, the pocket monsters that fight
cannot be killed. The relationship between a trainer and his or her
Pokemon is a symbiotic friendship. Only if the trainer and Pokemon
trust each other and teach each other can both evolve, or grow.
</P>
<P>
   Ash fights hard _ and loses.
</P>
<P>
   My son is in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Ash is in shock, too. He flees the tournament, hating Richard.
</P>
<P>
   But then Richard loses the next round of battles. To Ash's
surprise, Richard isn't bitter. He says losing has taught him some
lessons and will help him be a Pokemon master some day.
</P>
<P>
   The two kids promise each other they're going to train harder.
They will be Pokemon masters one day! The theme song cues up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was ... Pokemon,
It's you and me, I know it's my destiny, Pokemon, You're my best
friend, in a world we must defend, Pokemon, our hearts so true, our
courage will pull us through, You teach me and I'll teach you,
Pokemon. ...''
</P>
<P>
   I think it's kinda sweet, and I look at my son.
</P>
<P>
   He's crying.
</P>
<P>
   The good stories I've read lately _ about both Harry Potter and
Pokemon _ talk about the late, controversial child psychologist
Bruno Bettelheim. Bettelheim believed that children live with great
terrors and that it is the primal terror in fairy tales that
children relate to. It is through the tale's resolution that kids
learn to work out their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in fairy tales _ like Harry Potter and Pokemon _
children place themselves in the hero's shoes and find answers to
their own big picture _ questions such as Who or what will I
``be''?
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Ash and Harry, safe within their respective fantasy
worlds, our children are engaged in important, life-defining work.
They are confronting their Destiny.

POLICE IN MONACO SAY SAFRA'S NURSE ADMITS SETTING FATAL FIRE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be updated.) 
 (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ An American nurse employed by Edmond Safra admitted
Monday that he set the fire that killed the billionaire banker in
his luxury penthouse in Monte Carlo last Friday, Monaco's chief
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Daniel Serdet, said the nurse, Ted Maher, 41,
from Dutchess County, N.Y., had concocted the story that the
harbor-side apartment was under attack by two hooded men with
knives and then set fire to a wastebasket in an effort to draw
attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Maher was ``jealous'' of Safra's other seven nurses, one of whom
died with Safra in a bathroom where they had taken refuge,
believing there were intruders in the apartment, the prosecutor
said. By claiming to have fought off the attackers, Maher hoped to
win approval, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a hero,'' Serdet said.
</P>
<P>
   The confession ended days of speculation over the events that
took place in the pre-dawn hours atop one of the principality's
most secure buildings, home to three different bank offices.
</P>
<P>
   Safra's death had stunned the rarified world of international
investment he had been part of for decades and triggered numerous
theories about why he might have been a target for attack.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers around the world speculated that Safra, who without
formal education built an international banking empire, might have
been killed because of his many business dealings, including those
with Russian investors.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of his death was also particularly poignant. Safra,
who suffered from Parkinson's disease, was on the verge of
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to sell his businesses, including the Republic National
Bank of New York, which would have brought him about $2.65 billion,
is in its final stages.
</P>
<P>
   But French investigators say there was no complicated intrigue:
Maher acted alone inspired, in part, by a dispute with another
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the fire and slashing himself twice with his own
switchblade, once in the thigh, and once in the stomach, Maher went
downstairs to get the concierge to call the police and firefighters
to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Serdet said Maher had not expected to kill anyone. Indeed,
investigating officials said on Saturday that Safra and the nurse
who died with him, Vivienne Torrent, could have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   But Safra, terrified that assailants were after him, refused to
leave the bathroom even when police and firefighters arrived on the
scene and his wife, Lily, talking to him by cell phone, tried to
coax him out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Safra and Ms. Torrent, 52, died of asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   Serdet said Maher would face a charge of arson without intent to
kill, which could bring him a life sentence. But the prosecutor
also said that first, Maher would be examined by psychiatrists to
determine his competence to stand trial. He said Maher was
apparently highly agitated and taking medication at the time of the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was psychologically fragile and under the influence of
medication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maher's confession was announced on the day that Safra was
buried in Geneva.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first the authorities, basing their accounts on Maher's
initial testimony, said that two men wearing hoods and brandishing
knives had burst into an infirmary that had recently been built for
Safra on the penthouse level.
</P>
<P>
   The pink stucco building sits along one of Monaco's most
gracious avenues, with views of a yacht-filled harbor and the
Monaco royal family palace. Safra, who shunned publicity, had homes
in New York, Paris, Geneva and a villa nearby on the French Riviera
in Villefranche-sur-Mer.
</P>
<P>
   But he spent a lot of time in Monaco, which offers the very rich
a income-tax-free haven. He apparently felt so safe there that he
did not have his bodyguards stay the night with him when he slept
in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated questioning of Maher, who had been taken to Princess
Grace Hospital in Monaco to be treated for the wounds, produced
vague and conflicting accounts of the events, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday police officials said they had no evidence to
corroborate Maher's story. They continued to say they were unsure
how anyone could have gained access to the tightly secured
building.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Sunday night, the police formally put Maher under guard.
Serdet said that Maher confessed to setting the fire Monday
morning.

   A single genetically modified fish could turn Darwinian
evolution upside down and wipe out local populations of the species
if released into the wild, biologists warn. They add that other
organisms could face the same risk from transgenic relatives.
</P>
<P>
   William Muir and Richard Howard of Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Ind., made the discovery while modeling ecological risks
associated with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. They have
dubbed their idea the ``Trojan gene'' hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This resembles the Trojan horse,'' Muir says. ``It gets into
the population looking like something good, and it ends up
destroying the population.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied fish carrying the human growth hormone
gene hGH, which increases growth rate and final size. Biologists in
the United States and Britain are experimenting with salmon
engineered in a similar way, although no one has yet begun
commercial production.
</P>
<P>
   Muir and Howard included hGH in embryos of a fish called the
Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), a common aquarium fish that is
widely used in research. They found that modified individuals
became sexually mature faster than normal fish and produced more
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments using nonmodified fish also showed that larger
males attracted four times as many mates as their smaller rivals.
This effect is also known in salmon. Muir predicts that bigger,
engineered fish would enjoy the same advantages. So the hGH gene
would quickly spread through a fish population.
</P>
<P>
   But Muir and Howard also found that only two-thirds of
engineered medaka survived to reproductive age compared with wild
medakas. So the spread of the growth hormone gene could make
populations dwindle and eventually become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   To quantify this, the researchers plugged their results into a
computer model to find out what would happen if 60 transgenic
individuals joined a wild population of 60,000 fish. The population
became extinct within just 40 generations. Even a single transgenic
animal could have the same effect, they found, although extinction
would take longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the very strange situation where the least fit
individual in the population is getting all the matings _ this is
the reverse of Darwin's model,'' Muir says. ``The sexual selection
drives the gene into the population and the reduced viability
drives the population to extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say their results are the first evidence that
GMOs could have catastrophic consequences on their own species.
</P>
<P>
   David Penman, a fish geneticist at the University of Stirling,
welcomes the discovery. But he says there is evidence that some
transgenic fish modified with growth hormone have reduced sperm
production and mating success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If large males tend to mate with large females, this would
often result in matings between transgenics,'' he adds. This would
decrease rather than increase the spread of the gene.
</P>
<P>
   But John Beringer of Bristol University, a former chairman of
the British committee that advises the government on GMOs, says the
research is a warning. ``It would make it very difficult for anyone
at the moment to approve the release of GM fish carrying growth
hormone,'' he says. ``I would have to give a great deal of
consideration about whether that's an intelligent route to go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Muir says that the model may prove an invaluable tool in
assessing the dangers of GMOs. He hopes to test its predictions in
tightly controlled fish farm ponds. &QL;

   Acupuncture works. So say German scientists who have put the
therapy to the test using a ``placebo'' needle.
</P>
<P>
   Rather like a theatrical dagger, the placebo has a blunt needle
that retracts into the handle when pressed onto the skin. The
patient feels a pinprick and ``sees'' the needle being inserted,
but there is no real acupuncture going on.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad Streitberger, an anesthetist at the University of
Heidelberg who invented the placebo needle, believes it can inject
rigor into acupuncture research. ``It helps differentiate the
physiological effects of the needle from psychological effects,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Streitberger's team used the needle on patients with rotator
cuff tendinitis, a painful shoulder problem. Of 52 patients, 25
were given acupuncture and the rest received the placebo. After
eight sessions, the first group showed much bigger improvements.
Streitberger hopes to confirm the effect in trials with patients
suffering from other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kaptchuk of the Center for Alternative Medicine Research and
Education at Harvard Medical School describes the needle as a
``creative step forward.'' But he would like to see a double-blind
trial, in which neither the patient nor the doctor knows who is
getting the placebo. Doctors need to know the identity of
Streitberger's needle to manipulate it properly. &QL;

   If you're planning a bank heist, it might be a good idea to
start practicing silly walks. A new security system being developed
in Britain can identify individuals by the unique way in which they
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike faces and irises, someone's gait can be spotted from a
great distance with low-resolution cameras and so be observed from
just about any angle. It is also very difficult to mask, says Mark
Nixon, a computer scientist at London's Southampton University's
Image, Speech and Intelligent Systems group.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people rob banks they tend to wear motorbike helmets or
some form of disguise,'' he explains. But you can't disguise your
walk without drawing attention to yourself or impeding your escape.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by highly publicized crimes where the suspects were
caught on video but there were no clear shots of their faces, Nixon
decided to find out whether a person's gait could be just as
telling as a mugshot. He and his colleagues have so far adopted two
approaches to the problem, with promising results from both.
</P>
<P>
   The first analyzes the pendulumlike motion of the leg joints,
after extracting a person's silhouette from an image sequence. It
then measures the deviation of each joint movement from this simple
harmonic motion. According to Nixon, this works because people tend
to deviate in their own very characteristic ways.
</P>
<P>
   The second approach, published this month, uses a data-based
technique. This extracts particular features of a person's gait,
such as the shape and angular velocity of a limb, or the length of
a joint.
</P>
<P>
   At present, both techniques have their drawbacks. The pendulum
approach is not as effective as the data-based technique, but the
latter is poor at ignoring flapping clothing, such as skirts, when
analyzing a gait. Funding permitting, the Southampton team say it
would take them six months to develop an analysis system that draws
on the strengths of both systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial trials involved just 10 subjects, Nixon
says the system proved accurate, and he is confident that they are
on the right track. Another use, Nixon says, could be to spot
female shoplifters who pretend to be pregnant and walk out with a
bellyful of merchandise. By using gait recognition, he says, you
could spot a genuinely pregnant woman easily, as the fetus's head
pushing down on their pelvis affects the way they walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Southampton project has already attracted the interest of
high street retailer Marks &AMP; Spencer.

   I went into a movie theater called Pacific Place on a Seattle
main street to see ``Pokemon: The First Movie.'' It was shortly
after 3 p.m. on a weekday and the only other person in the audience
was an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered reading that when the movie was released on the
U.S. mainland two weeks ago, it raked in $32 million during that
weekend alone, making it a smash hit. The empty theater threw me
off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Pikachu, the leading Pokemon character, was cute. The way all
the characters exhibit fine teamwork reminded me of ``Doraemon,''
another popular Japanese animation series. Pokemon is unmistakably
Japanese, I kept saying in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Battles over power and identity between Pokemons and humans,
Pokemon originals and clones and clones and humans develop on the
screen. It occurred to me that Pokemon is a product of the age of
genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   I heard that some Americans are saying the movie stimulates an
impulse to destroy and fight. Ironically, that sounds like the kind
of foreign criticism that is usually targeted at Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   When I left the theater, I found myself one block away from the
Washington State Convention and Trade Center, the venue for the
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   I was immediately surrounded by demonstrators chanting ``Save
the dolphin, save the giant turtle.'' Under current fishing
methods, dolphins and turtles get caught in fishing nets and die,
the demonstrators said, and they criticized the WTO for doing
nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conserve forests, cut down WTO''...``Wash down
technology''...``Trade must be clean, green and fair''...``Cultural
diversity is needed.'' These were some of the slogans I saw on the
placards carried by the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signs showed a skull and crossbones under the words
genetic engineering. The criticism was targeted at the WTO's ruling
against a European Union decision to ban imports of U.S. beef from
cattle raised with growth hormones.

   Although biotechnology has advanced rapidly, not all the

   Seattle is also home to Microsoft Corp., which has become a

</P>
<P>
   The company is running a campaign to abolish tariffs on
electronic commerce, but I saw no signs of protest against
Microsoft. Even the nongovernmental organizations that protested in
Seattle cannot do away with e-mail. The globalization of
information has become part of everyday life and is to the benefit
of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced globalization leads to stronger calls for diversity in
cultures. It has led to wariness among the economically weak that
they might be forced to become clones of the economically strong.
Globalization raises uncertainty about cultural identity and unease
about external forces that are beyond the control of citizens.

making culture a part of trade. They assert that culture, like
agriculture, which some nations are arguing is a cultural and
social asset as well as having economic value, serves many

<P>
   I remembered the time I went to Punta del Este in Uruguay to
cover the Uruguay round of WTO talks, which started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the hotel where I stayed did not have a fax
machine. It did not have English-language newspapers, either. There
were no demonstrators. Microsoft and e-commerce were unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Uruguay round got off the ground, many Asian and Latin
American countries have enjoyed the benefits of world trade and
have taken off economically one after another. However, there are
still countless people around the world that have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   WTO director-general Mike Moore pleaded with the participants to

 TITLE: ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War: 
 The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel''  
 Text by Richard H. Minear  (The New Press, $25)
 &HT;     By DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

   Geeks growing bored with Sony's robotic dogs could one day
replace their motorized mutts with another high-tech toy: a robotic
snake that moves just like the real thing. The technology could
also be used to create robots capable of handling the toughest
terrain _ perhaps even on other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Miller, an animator in Palo Alto, Calif., has built the
most lifelike robotic snakes yet created, in his garage. He has
managed to reproduce both the slithering and the sidewinding
motions used by the reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts to make robotic snakes have usually involved
copying the way a caterpillar inches along by arching its body
upward, rather than a snake's slither. ``This is by far the most
realistic and sophisticated `robotic' snake that I have seen,''
says Gary Haith, a robotics engineer at NASA's Ames Research
Center, who is designing ways to explore rough extraterrestrial
terrains.
</P>
<P>
   Miller originally started trying to reproduce snakes' movements
for an animated film. Having developed an algorithm that worked in
the virtual world, he decided to see if it would work in the real
world, too. Eventually, he says, he would like to build a robot
snake capable of climbing trees.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hopes to sell his design to toy makers. He believes he
has cracked the problem that has kept toy makers away: the cost.
His new design could sell for only a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just about toys. Biomimetics, as copying ideas from
nature is called, could push the boundaries of robotics. ``The hope
is if we have biologically inspired robots, they would be able to
go over a wide variety of terrain,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a wheel under each segment of Miller's snakes,
much like those on a Rollerblade, they are not motorized, says
Miller. Instead they are free running and merely reduce friction
with the ground. Haith says it's much harder to make snakes move
naturally without wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's latest model, a 15-pound polycarbonate and brass beast,
has over 30 segments. The segments are connected by a central
spine, and each has a pair of electrical servomotors. These push
the connecting rods that make the snake's segments bend.
</P>
<P>
   A motion starts at the robot's head. When the servos are
activated, neighboring segments bend in relation to each other, and
a sideways force is exerted on the wheels. ``These lateral forces
on the wheels cause it to move along,'' Miller explains. The motors
in the next segment are then activated, and then the next, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   The snakes are controlled with two joysticks much like a
radio-controlled aircraft. ``They needed to be simple to drive,''
he says. One is for steering and speed. The other controls the
sidewinding movement as well as lift. &QL;

PERSONAL HEALTH: MOURNING, A TIME WHEN WORDS OFTEN FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (First of two columns on bereavement. Next week: How to be of
help.) 
 (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grown-ups say the darnedest things when trying to comfort the
bereaved. Consider the following, compiled from books on mourning
and from personal experience:
</P>
<P>
   To a 60-year-old recent widow: ``Don't worry. You're young and
attractive; you'll find someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   To a woman whose husband died of lung cancer: ``You have to meet
this man. His wife also died of lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man whose 26-year-old daughter died of AIDS: ``If she
hadn't been that way, God wouldn't have struck her dead with AIDS''
and ``It was just a purification thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To a woman who suffered a miscarriage: ``It is probably for the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   To a woman whose 25-year-old son was killed by a drunken driver:
``At least you have four other children.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man whose elderly mother died: ``Oh, well, 79.''
</P>
<P>
   To a young man whose 19-year-old brother died of cancer: ``I
know how you must feel losing a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the boy's mother: ``I know it's not the same, but I
really empathize because I lost my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   To a woman whose husband committed suicide: ``Are you going to
get a dog now?''
</P>
<P>
   To Marta Felber, a counselor whose husband died of cancer:
``Remember, it could be worse. He could have lingered longer.''
And, ``Joe is waiting for you over there. Some day you will be with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on her training as a therapist and her experiences in
self-healing after the death of her husband, Ms. Felber wrote
``Grief Expressed: When a Mate Dies'' (Life Words, 1997), which can
serve as a road map to recovery for the bereaved as well as a guide
to those who wish to express sympathy and offer comfort and
support. (The book is available for $19.95 by calling the publisher
toll free at 1-800-798-0100.) Her advice to the bereaved is to try
to look beyond what people say and think instead about what they
really mean.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, people are uncomfortable and insecure in talking
to the bereaved and say things that come out sounding
unsympathetic, like ``Don't worry, you'll have another baby'' to
the mother of stillborn twins. Bob Buffington of Aurora, Colo.,
whose parents both died of strokes in their mid-70s, put it this
way: ``People say things without thinking. You forgive them, but
you never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most well-meaning people sometimes say things that are
hurtful, like criticizing the family's funeral arrangements, and
leave the bereaved upset and angry instead of comforted. And then
there are the people who are really thinking mostly of themselves,
like those who asked Lianne Enderton, of Alberta in Canada, for her
dead brother's golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The latter inspired the title for an extraordinarily helpful
little book by Lynn Kelly, a mother of three who was widowed at age
34: ``Don't Ask for the Dead Man's Golf Clubs: Advice for Friends
When Someone Dies'' (Kelly Communications; available for $12.95 by
calling (888)401-6602 or (303)740-8278).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly interviewed survivors ages 17 to 90 throughout the
United States and Canada who had lost husbands, wives, children,
fathers, brothers, sisters, grandmothers and grandfathers, asking
them what did and did not prove helpful during their mourning. From
these interviews, she derived many useful suggestions, among them
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't judge the way people grieve. Those who don't cry can be
just as devastated as those who can't stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume the death was for the best, even if the person
was old, deformed or very ill. ``It's no blessing,'' said Jane
Wisniewski of Scottsbluff, Neb. ``Nor did it matter if he was
healthy or sick. He was my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume that because there are other children, the pain
is any less. ``If I lost a leg, I would still miss that leg,'' said
Gary Massaro of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't say ``I know how you feel.'' There is no knowing how a
newly bereaved person feels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't make parallels with animals, as if the person could
replace a lost spouse with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't say, ``Don't worry, you'll get married again'' or
``You'll have another baby'' or ``It's God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most universally appreciated expression of sympathy
is a hug and three words: ``I'm so sorry.'' Ms. Felber said that in
the beginning, when her greatest need was to talk, she was always
grateful to find a good listener, someone not in a hurry who held
her hand, did not interrupt or give advice and seemed comfortable
when she said nothing or just cried.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the dead helps to keep them alive in the memories
of the bereaved. Carole Crewdson of Brooklyn, whose husband, Frank,
died last year, said, ``Some people were afraid to mention Frank
because they thought it would upset me.'' But what she most
appreciated were the people ``who told little stories, little
personal connections about themselves and Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the people who brought pictures,'' she added. ``They made
me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Marge Druckman of Potomac, Md., echoed these sentiments. ``It's
great to hear stories about the person who died,'' she said, ``and
to have friends let you know how much they liked and appreciated
your loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget that children also need to talk about the person
who died. ``It was the most help when people talked to us about
her,'' said Sarah Minifie of Cambridge, Mass., whose mother died at
42. ``It was less scary to think we would forget her because we
were so young.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who did not know the deceased very well or at all,
there is always ``I'm sorry for your pain.'' Or these: ``I'm here
to help you in any way I can.'' ``I'm told he was a dear man. I'm
sure you're going to miss him.'' ``No matter what the
circumstances, when you lose a parent you loved, it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Ms. Kelly suggested: ``Be honest. If you don't know what
to say, don't be afraid to say so.'' Ms. Enderton of Alberta put it
this way: ``If you are not comfortable, tell the person: `I've
never experienced this before, and I don't know what to say. Tell
me what to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   If you can say nothing, that's all right too. Your very presence
is an expression of sympathy. ``I don't think it makes any
difference what people say,'' said Diane Redmond of Memphis. ``It
is just the idea that they are there and you know they care.''  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidence continues to accumulate that the frozen world of the
Arctic and sub-Arctic is thawing, and the findings are spotlighting
two increasingly important questions:
</P>
<P>
   Can what is happening in the Great White North touch off sudden
shifts in climate that will transform weather and disrupt life
throughout the Northern Hemisphere? Is the Arctic a key to the way
in which global warming might be translated into region-by-region
climatic changes?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh
water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting
Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere
precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind this view holds that the climate of the North
Atlantic region, including Europe and eastern North America, is
controlled by great ocean currents that transport heat northward
from the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   This oceanic conveyor belt is set in motion when saltier, and
therefore heavier, surface water sinks to the deep ocean in the
vicinity of southern Greenland. It is replaced by warm water from
the tropics that warms the North Atlantic region. Without it, the
relatively mild climate of England, for instance, might be as cold
as that of northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that a great influx of fresh water from the thawing
Arctic might dilute the salty current and so either halt or weaken
the heat-bearing conveyor belt. This could result in a sudden,
long-term drop in the North Atlantic region's temperature, a
climatic disruption that would probably reverberate around the
hemisphere by altering large-scale atmospheric circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, scientists reported that the current did indeed
weaken or stop at least twice in the past, plunging the region,
which each time had been warming, into cold comparable to that of
an ice age.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers, focusing on the present, last week produced
the latest in a lengthening string of studies documenting the
thawing of the vast sheet of ice that covers the far northern seas,
a potential source of fresh water that, once it melts, could help
weaken the heat conveyor.
</P>
<P>
   A third research group, using computerized simulations of the
ocean-atmosphere system, concluded that the present-day thawing of
Northern Hemisphere sea ice could not be explained by natural
causes. The most obvious possible cause, they said, is global
warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like
carbon dioxide, which result from the burning of fossil fuels like
coal, oil and natural gas. And they said the rate of sea-ice
melting was likely to increase in the decades ahead if emissions of
the heat-trapping gases continued at today's rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden influxes of fresh water from the Arctic appear to have
shut down or weakened the oceanic heat conveyor twice in the
relatively recent geological past, according to a study reported in
the current issue of Nature by Dr. Carsten Ruhlemann of the
University of Bremen, Germany, and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   By examining chemical clues in ocean sediments, they determined
that in each case, the western tropical North Atlantic was
relatively warm while waters farther north were relatively cold _
as would be expected if the conveyor stopped or weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shutdowns occurred as the world was coming out of
the last ice age. The North Atlantic region's rebound was twice
interrupted by sudden reversions to glacial conditions, once around
15,000 years ago and again around 12,000 years ago, before settling
into the relative warmth that has prevailed for the last 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   The first reversion to glacial cold coincided with an invasion
of the North Atlantic by vast quantities of fresh water in the form
of icebergs, which were released from North America as temperatures
warmed.
</P>
<P>
   Another influx is believed to have touched off the second
reversion to cold, called the Younger Dryas event. That event set
off far-flung reverberations. The climate of the Middle East dried
out so much that food became scarce, forcing the invention of
agriculture, many scientists believe. The New York region became so
chilly that cold-weather trees like spruce took over the landscape
from species like oak.
</P>
<P>
   Could an influx of fresh water brought about by global warming
make that happen again? Recent studies lend the question new
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In one, reported in the December issue of the journal
Geophysical Research Letters, scientists analyzed data collected by
sonar aboard nuclear submarines and found that the floating ice
cover of the Arctic Ocean has become about 40 percent thinner than
it was two to four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In another, reported in the current issue of the journal
Science, researchers led by Dr. Ola M. Johannessen of the Nansen
Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway, used
satellite data to measure the area of the Arctic ice sheet. They
found that the perennial ice cover had shrunk by 14 percent over
the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The third study, by nine researchers headed by Dr. Konstantin Y.
Vinnikov of the University of Maryland, analyzed data from five
different sources and found that sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere
as a whole had decreased by about 7 percent in the last 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   Computer models of the ocean-atmosphere system reconstructed
this trend accurately, said Dr. Alan Robock of Rutgers University,
a member of the research team. The model simulations also
determined that the trend was much larger than what would be
expected to result from the climate system's natural variability.
This assumes that the models can reproduce natural variability with
some accuracy, an assumption that many experts question.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Robock said, the study provides ``strong support
for the theory that humans are causing the climate to change.''
</P>
<P>
   If the climate is indeed warming because of human activity, many
scientists say, the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic
could increase. Melting ice in the Arctic is not the only potential
contributor. Water from melting glaciers in Greenland and other
Arctic and sub-arctic islands could also contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, scientists reported that the southern half of the
Greenland ice cap was melting back by about two cubic miles a year,
enough to cover Maryland with a sheet 1 foot thick.
</P>
<P>
   (Runoff from melting glaciers contributes to a rising global sea
level. Melting sea ice does not; like an ice cube in a glass of
water, its change in state does not raise the water level.)
</P>
<P>
   A third contributor to an influx of fresh water could be
increased precipitation. A warmer atmosphere causes more water to
evaporate from the oceans, and some scientists believe that some of
this increased atmospheric moisture would be transported to the far
north, where it would produce a heavier runoff of fresh water into
the North Atlantic. This alone, some computer models indicate,
would be enough to weaken the North Atlantic heat conveyor
drastically in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   How much fresh water might be necessary to halt, slow or weaken
the conveyor is a crucial question that scientists cannot yet
answer. Nor do they know how close the world might be to an abrupt
change in the conveyor's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any accurate assessment out there that
would tell us,'' said Dr. Peter Schlosser, a geochemist at the
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   If a warming atmosphere pumped enough fresh water into the ocean
to shut down the conveyor, what would it mean? Schlosser and others
say the magnitude of the resulting climate change might be
different from those observed in the last glacial cycle. But, he
said, ``It might put the system into a state that might be a
precondition for further change.''
</P>
<P>
   What might such a change entail?
</P>
<P>
   Temperature and precipitation patterns could be drastically
altered, much as El Nino alters them, and Schlosser says the
alteration's effects would probably be felt throughout the Northern
Hemisphere. But exactly how the patterns would change and therefore
what their down-to-earth effects would be, he said, is an open
question.

INNOVATIVE BEATING-HEART SURGERY GIVES MAN NEW LEASE ON LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dr. Manucher Nazarian had performed the
still-uncommon form of bypass surgery more than 400 times, but this
patient made him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin Knudson, alert despite two heart attacks, was 92 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Nazarian refused to do the surgery. The ethics committee
at Harris Methodist Fort Worth hospital also discussed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Knudson's cardiologist, however, pushed for the procedure _
informally dubbed ``beating-heart'' surgery _ arguing that it
offered the Fort Worth man his best chance at quality life in his
final years.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, which does not use a heart-lung machine, is
relatively new and not without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that if he was going to die, he would rather die in
combat for his life,'' said the cardiologist, Dr. Georgina
Sehapayak.
</P>
<P>
   Once other medical options had been exhausted, Nazarian agreed;
he performed the double bypass Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Knudson left All Saints Medical Center with his
85-year-old wife, Scharlene, and returned to their home on the
city's east side. His mobility is still limited, but he hopes to
return soon to the thick garden of mums that he planted several
months before he collapsed Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   If the surgery ``bought a few more good years,'' that would be
enough, Knudson said, a twinkle in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Given Knudson's age, Nazarian said he would not have attempted a
traditional bypass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of a stroke for him would have been exceedingly
high,'' Nazarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, bypass surgery requires stopping the heart so that
the organ's beating doesn't disrupt the delicate sewing necessary
to graft the new blood vessels in place. Meanwhile, the patient's
blood is pumped through a heart-lung machine so that it receives
sufficient oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   In beating-heart surgery, no heart-lung machine is required
because only a small area of the heart is stabilized while the new
vessel is grafted.
</P>
<P>
   Some heart surgeons haven't tried the new procedure, saying more
time and research are needed to determine its benefits. It's still
unclear, for example, how long bypasses sewn on in beating-heart
surgery will hold up.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association has not taken a formal position
on the procedure pending more study.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians, including Nazarian, say beating-heart surgery
shows potential to reduce problems with lung function, brain
function and with other difficulties that sometimes follow use of a
heart-lung machine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Carter, a Euless, Texas-based heart surgeon who
estimates he uses the beating-heart procedure in 40 percent of his
bypass surgeries, said patients also appear to recover faster if
they haven't been exposed to the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, Carter said, can make ``the patient feel like
they've had the flu for the next six to eight weeks, just because
of the trauma to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits may be more significant for patients who, because
of age or other organ damage, may be poor candidates for the
traditional bypass, said Fort Worth heart surgeon Al Yurvati,
president of the heart association's Fort Worth division.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, an estimated 600,000 Americans undergo bypass
surgery, which is designed to reroute blood around clogged arteries
by grafting on new ones to improve blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarian, considered to be a pioneer of the procedure in Fort
Worth, said better technology has made the beating-heart approach
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The device he uses, one of several on the market, resembles a
two-pronged fork.
</P>
<P>
   The prongs press down around the artery, immobilizing an area
about the size of a silver dollar. That area beats minimally,
Nazarian said, while the rest of the heart continues to thump
normally.
</P>
<P>
   At a medical conference earlier this year, Nazarian presented
the results of bypass surgery on 324 patients, half of whom had
undergone beating-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two approaches resulted in death 6 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   But the beating-heart approach reduced the need for blood
transfusions from 25 percent to 10 percent, according to Nazarian's
data. And fewer patients spent extended post-surgical time on the
ventilator; 12 percent of the traditional bypass patients spent at
least four days, compared with 2 percent of the beating-heart
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Until he collapsed in October, Knudson had gone years without
seeing a doctor. He didn't swallow anything stronger than a
multivitamin each morning.
</P>
<P>
   He was raking leaves under a large pecan tree in his back yard
when the heart attack occurred. His wife became concerned when he
didn't come in, as was his habit, to watch ``The Price Is Right,''
and then she saw a neighbor sprinting down the street for help.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics arrived within minutes and took Knudson to Harris
Methodist Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor on duty in the emergency room scared the daylights
out of me,'' Scharlene Knudson said. ``He said he was very critical
and he probably wouldn't leave there alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Knudson and his family, as well as two of his doctors, talked
candidly. The hospital's ethicist got involved, and at one point,
the case was taken before the ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   Harris officials, citing confidentiality, wouldn't say why the
case was sent to the ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarian said he initially had concerns about doing such an
aggressive procedure on someone of Knudson's advanced age, without
first exploring other options.
</P>
<P>
   But without the surgery, Knudson probably would not have been
able to leave the hospital, Sehapayak said. When a second heart
attack occurred a couple of days after the first, it became clear
that Knudson was vulnerable to additional attacks if he wasn't kept
on strong intravenous medication, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on the beating-heart surgery, Nazarian discussed
it with Knudson and his extended family, grandson Craig Lehew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we said he's lived an active life all of his
life,'' said Lehew, 28. ``We wanted him to be able to go back home
and go back into his garden again.''
</P>
<P>
   So Knudson was transferred for surgery to All Saints, where
Nazarian has done the bulk of his beating-heart cases.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days before the operation, the couple had celebrated
their 62nd wedding anniversary with a cake, courtesy of the nurses
at Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery took less than an hour and a half, Scharlene Knudson
said, still beaming weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `The Good Lord wasn't through with you.' ''

2 GENETIC STUDIES FINDS MODERN HUMANS CAME FROM EAST AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two genetic surveys of human populations bring new evidence to
bear on a pivotal event in prehistory, the first dispersal of
modern humans from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One study, based on analysis of people in East Africa and India,
suggests that the first emigration of modern humans was eastward,
toward Asia, and not northward through the eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   A second, drawing on DNA data from 50 ethnic groups around the
world, concludes that the ancestral population from which the first
emigrants came may have numbered as few as 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies point to the most recent common ancestor of the
emigrants as having lived around 60,000 to 40,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Previous genetic studies have suggested 100,000 years or so for
the most recent common ancestor, and about 10,000 for the ancestral
population size.
</P>
<P>
   The younger date of around 50,000 years seems to tally much
better with an emerging synthesis of the archaeological data
relating to human origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A combination of fossil and genetic evidence locates the
ancestral population in Africa, and archaeological discoveries
imply an initial dispersal out of Africa about 50 ky years ago,''
writes Dr. Richard G. Klein of Stanford University in the latest
edition of his book ``The Human Career.'' The term 50 ky means
50,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Klein believes an important distinction can be discerned in the
archaeological record between what he calls anatomically modern
humans and behaviorally modern humans. Though the fossil remains of
each type look the same, a more advanced set of stone tools appears
with human remains dating back to 50,000 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Modern human sites older than this have a more primitive set of
stone implements, similar to those used by archaic humans like the
Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   Klein and others believe that some major genetically-based
neurological change, such as the development of language, occurred
around 50,000 years ago. This transformation, he infers, was the
spur that led behaviorally modern humans to innovate their
characteristic suite of more advanced stone implements, develop the
first forms of art, and spread throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Remains of modern humans dating to about 100,000 years ago have
been found at a well known archaeological site called Skhul in
Israel. The finding has been interpreted as evidence of the first
human migration out of Africa, and it fitted with the old genetic
data of a modern human origin at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Neanderthals occupied Europe and the eastern coast of
the Mediterranean at this time, and they or the cold climate may
have blocked any further advance in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's data suggests that the humans of 100,000 years ago,
anatomically modern but not like modern people in their behavior,
did not in fact spread out of Africa at this time.
</P>
<P>
   A new genetic study, by Dr. Silvana Santachiara-Benerecetti of
the University of Pavia and colleagues, confirms the view that the
first dispersal of modern humans was not until about 50,000 years
ago, and that the direction was eastward toward Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in Nature Genetics last week, is based on
mitochondrial DNA, the genetic material of the small
energy-producing organelles inside every cell. Because mitochondria
are inherited with the egg, from the mother alone, their DNA
escapes the shuffling that occurs in sexual reproduction, and any
changes reflect the occasional random mutation in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of these mutations, biologists can construct a
family tree of mitochondrial lineages and, by estimating the
mutation rate, figure out the time that has elapsed since the
mutation at the root of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Santachiara-Benerecetti and her colleagues studied a particular
pattern of mitochondrial DNA which is well known in India. They
found an earlier form of the pattern among people in Ethiopia,
suggesting that East Africa was its place of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the pattern also exist among many people in Saudi
Arabia, but not among inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean.
This provides the first genetic evidence, the Italian biologists
say, that the human migration route out of Africa was from eastern
Africa along the coast toward Southeast Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another new genetic study, by Dr. Marcus Feldman of Stanford
University and others, makes an interesting counterpart to the
Italian study because it is based on a different kind of DNA but
reaches similar conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman and his colleagues looked at segments of the Y
chromosome, another part of the human genome which escapes the
usual shuffling of the reproductive process. Studying Y chromosomes
from around the world, they conclude that the most recent common
ancestor of all these Ys was carried by a man who lived only 40,000
years or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though all Y chromosomes can be traced back to a single
individual, this does not mean a single Adam was the species' only
male representative. The founding population from which the world's
present population is derived consisted of about 2,000 individuals,
according to the new data, Feldman said. One Y chromosome in such a
population will eventually dominate in the descendants after all
the other Y lineages are brought to a halt, whether because their
owners have no children or beget only daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000 year date, which has a large range of uncertainty, is
much more recent than others, in part because these earlier
estimates were forced to assume, quite unrealistically, that the
size of the human population has remained constant throughout
prehistory. Feldman assumed an exponentially expanding population,
which yields a more recent date of origin. His study is published
in the current issue of the journal Molecular Biology and
Evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The two new studies represent a convergence of the genetic and
archaeological data bearing on modern human origins, said Dr. Luca
Cavalli-Sforza, a leading population geneticist at Stanford
University. The two independent lines of evidence support the idea
that behaviorally modern humans arose in Africa around 50,000 years
ago from their anatomically modern forebears.
</P>
<P>
   These behaviorally modern humans ``had three big improvements in
culture _ language, boats or rafts, and Aurignacian technology,''
Cavalli-Sforza said, referring to the more sophisticated stone
implements.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they had acquired these innovations, they burst
forth to inhabit the rest of the globe. The Neanderthals who may
have blocked the human advance out of Africa 100,000 years ago were
now rapidly displaced in Europe, presumably by behaviorally modern
people invading Europe from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   There are convincing dates, Cavalli-Sforza said, that humans
reached Europe by 40,000 years ago and Oceania and New Guinea by
40,000 to 50,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although no boats from this period have yet been recovered, such
craft would have been essential transport for the early people who
reached Australia, and Cavalli-Sforza said he was convinced that
``the people who went from Africa to Asia know how to use some
simple navigational means.''

<P>
   Q. The number system with a base of 10 is so common that I
wonder why so many societies developed it independently. And where
did some of the other systems come from, like the one based on 60?
</P>
<P>
   A. Historians of science find the obvious explanation for the
base-10 system at the fingertips of human beings, all 10 of them.
Not so coincidentally, the word digit comes from digitus, the Latin
word for finger or toe.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on the fingers (base 10) or the fingers and toes (base
20) is the apparent root of many ancient written number systems, as
discussed in Georges Ifrah's book ``From One to Zero: A Universal
History of Numbers'' (Viking 1985).
</P>
<P>
   The French language retains traces of a base-20 system, based on
multiples of 20, like quatre-vingt, or four 20s, for 80. The Mayas
also developed a base-20 system 1,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Babylonian-Sumerian base-60 system survives in the
measurement of time, angles and geographical position; some
scientists suspect this was also derived from finger counting. But
others think it might have arisen because of trade with some other
people with a system of weights based on a different, larger unit,
resulting in the need to find a common way to express fractional
weights, as Robert Kaplan discusses in ``The Nothing That Is: A
Natural History of Zero'' (Oxford, 1999).

LOSING POUNDS BY SURFING, ON THE WEB

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was probably inevitable that the World Wide Web would bloom
with sites for dieters. But to the surprise of professional
dietitians, many of these sites have turned out to be not only
popular but effective.
</P>
<P>
   From fee-based ventures like eDiets.com to free ones like
Cyberdiet.com, a cornucopia of sites has sprung up in the last year
or two to provide nutrition and diet advice. Many offer services
that are otherwise found through private dietitians or diet
companies like Weight Watchers, including personalized feedback and
support from a group of fellow dieters.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first studies of the effectiveness of online
dieting, preliminary research at Brown University suggests that
``the Internet seems to be a great vehicle for what has proven
successful in face-to-face programs,'' in the words of the
principal researcher, Deborah Tate, a graduate student completing
her doctorate in clinical psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be completed early next year, compared two groups
of overweight people. Members of the first group, who were given
Web-based information about dieting, lost an average of 3 pounds in
the first 12 weeks of the program. But members of another group
that interacted on the Internet _ who reported on their meals and
exercise, had questions answered, got e-mail from professionals and
posted messages on bulletin boards _ lost 9 pounds in the 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional information alone, while helpful, doesn't appear to
be enough,'' Ms. Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Busch, a dietitian in St. Paul, Minn., who is a
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, an 82-year-old
organization of food and nutrition professionals, says online
dieting offers easy access to information and support from the
privacy of the dieter's home or office.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Dodd, a former president of the association, is on an
advisory committee that helps rate about 200 online nutrition sites
for the Tufts University School of Nutrition. The service, itself
on the Web at www.navigator.tufts.edu, gives high marks to a number
of dieting sites. For example, it calls Cyberdiet.com ``an oasis of
sane, fun and well-presented nutrition information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch and Ms. Dodd say that in some cases there is no
substitute for an individual counselor, who can give personalized
recommendations and take a more exact diet history than might be
possible on the Web, and who may be covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A dieter with special needs ``may be flirting with danger
online,'' Ms. Dodd said. Still, she added, Tufts' high-ranked sites
``are a really good starting point'' and provide quick answers to
dieting questions.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to online information and advice comes at a time when
Americans are heavier than ever. ``People are driving 10 minutes to
find a spot in front of the health club so they don't have to walk
too far,'' Ms. Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most aggressive commercial sites, eDiets.com, has
offered nutrition, exercise and motivation advice for two years. It
is fairly typical of the online diets.
</P>
<P>
   New users, who sign up for $70, are asked to fill out a simple
profile, on topics like binge eating, desired weight loss and
amount of exercise they get. That results in a computer-generated
schedule for weight loss: a 12-week plan, with meal plans and
shopping lists, that is adjusted to reflect the diet's progress,
reported weekly.
</P>
<P>
   EDiets, based in Florida, has had about 50,000 paying customers
in two years, the company says. Its chairman, David Humble, said he
turned to the Net when he discovered that it offered an opportunity
``to change lifestyle as opposed to a quick diet that inevitably
doesn't work in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has a dozen employees, including dietitians and
psychologists, and sends out free newsletters by e-mail to 700,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   EDiets offers ``the general supervision of the dietitian, but
not the one-on-one with a dietitian,'' Humble said, adding: ``But
also not the costs associated with that. Three months of
supervision online costs less probably than a single visit to a
dietitian off line.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says active participants report losing 1.8 pounds a
week; at that rate, members should reach a goal of losing 20 pounds
in three months, a period that dietitians say is long enough for
behavior changes to become ingrained, and for people to determine
why they had a problem in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Women from 25 to about 50 make up the largest group of users of
the site, but eDiets is also trying to develop special areas for
men, vegetarians and people with specialized diets. The company
says it tries to screen people whose health makes online dieting
unwise, including those with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberdiet.com, based in California, insists that it is not
primarily a diet program, because that ``means you are either on
something or off something,'' said Timi Gustafson, a co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in diets,'' he said. ``I believe in helping
people adopt a healthy lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyberdiet offers eight-week weight-loss programs, free, with
special menus, in four calorie ranges, modulated for diets those
who need to restrict their intakes of sodium, cholesterol, dairy or
other foods, and for people with problems like diabetes,
hypertension and heart disease. It also has a 12-week exercise
program, and workout drills.
</P>
<P>
   The free site was started by Ms. Gustafson, a registered
dietitian, and Cynthia Fink as something of a public service, and
was acquired this year by Mediconsult.com, which provides
information online for people affected directly or indirectly by
chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   The site has lively message boards. One, for people trying to
lose 100 pounds or more, attracts 1,500 messages a week. It is so
popular that 40 of the dieters met in Chicago this summer to make
friends in person with people they had met online.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, eFit.com, offers 30-second video demonstrations of
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   For now, established weight-loss companies like Jenny Craig and
Weight Watchers are not jumping into the online market. Both
companies have Web sites, but they are mainly informational, used
to draw dieters to their established programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of their online competitors clearly has their
attention. Les Koll, senior vice president of marketing at Jenny
Craig, said of eDiets, ``We are watching them very closely.''

LOSING POUNDS BY SURFING, ON THE WEB

<P>
   It was probably inevitable that the World Wide Web would bloom
with sites for dieters. But to the surprise of professional
dietitians, many of these sites have turned out to be not only
popular but effective.
</P>
<P>
   From fee-based ventures like eDiets.com to free ones like
Cyberdiet.com, a cornucopia of sites has sprung up in the last year
or two to provide nutrition and diet advice. Many offer services
that are otherwise found through private dietitians or diet
companies like Weight Watchers, including personalized feedback and
support from a group of fellow dieters.

   &UR; Vegetarian Dinosaurs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It may not do much for their reputations, but new research shows
that some dinosaurs may have had something in common with chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the United States, China, Mongolia and Japan,
examining the fossilized remains of 12 relatively small dinosaurs
from China, have discovered masses of mineral grains inside their
rib cages. The grains, the researchers write in the journal Nature,
may be the remnants of gizzards, which the creatures may have used
to grind up plant matter much as poultry and other plant-eating
birds do today.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs, which date to the Upper Cretaceous period, about
70 million years ago, resemble ostriches, with long legs, small
heads and toothless beaks. While they have some birdlike features,
they are considered nonavian; they are called ornithomimids, or
bird mimickers, and belong to the large group of two-legged
dinosaurs known as theropods (the most famous member of which is T.
rex).
</P>
<P>
   Just what ornithomimids ate has long been a subject of debate.
The presence of a gizzard and lack of teeth both point to this
variety, at least, as eating plants, not meat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Good News on a Pollutant &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain brought on by sulfur emissions from industrial
smokestacks has been a cause of much concern in the Northeast, and
rightly so. But a new analysis of sulfur emissions worldwide shows
that the United States, along with parts of Europe and Russia, has
generally stabilized its emissions over the last two decades. A
growing problem, however, exists in China, which now leads the
world in the amount of sulfur put into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by a professor at Washington University in St. Louis
and published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, analyzed oil
and coal consumption and metal smelting activity, all contributors
to sulfur emissions, from 1850 to 1990. The results show emissions
in the United States declining since the 1970s, when new pollution
laws took effect and many factories and power plants were forced to
switch from burning high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal, oil or
gas. Industries in the former Soviet Union and some European
countries have also switched to natural gas from coal.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, which has abundant supplies of high-sulfur coal
feeding a rapidly growing industrial economy, sulfur emissions have
increased markedly. In 1990, China emitted 22 million metric tons
of sulfur, compared with 15 million by the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the increase in emissions has come an increase in
complaints about acid rain from China's Asian neighbors, similar to
the complaints of Northeastern states about sulfur pollution from
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Genetically Altered Soil &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Genetically engineered corn has become very popular among
American farmers. About 20 percent of last year's crop was of the
modified variety, which exudes a toxin in the leaves and pollen
that kills caterpillars and other pests that attack the plant above
ground. But what, if anything, happens in the soil?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at New York University have discovered that the
toxin, known as Bt because the genes that produce it come from a
bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, is exuded from the roots of the
corn plant, too. In fact, the researchers found, about the same
amount of Bt toxin enters the soil through the roots as is
introduced from pollen that comes off during tasseling and from the
residue of stalks and leaves left behind after harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in Nature, note that the toxin
apparently binds with soil and thus persists for long periods of
time _ at least 234 days, the longest time studied. As to whether
the presence of all that pesticide in the soil is good or bad, the
scientists were noncommitting further research is needed to
show whether it helps control harmful pest populations or wipes out
beneficial insects.

   &UR; TIMING: On Their Toes Can Be Risky &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No parent shells out the money for ballet class so a child can
turn out a flat-footed dancer, but keeping dancers off their toes
may not be such a bad thing, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   A new study suggests that going on point may lead to arthritis
of the ankle in ballet dancers. The research was presented last
week at a conference of the Radiological Society of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers who go on point dance on the tips of their toes with the
aid of a special shoe. They often begin as young as 11 or 12. The
problem, said Dr. David C. Salonen, the Toronto radiologist who
conducted the study, is that the position puts great pressure on
the talonavicular joint, one of the three major joints to make up
the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
ankles of 11 female dancers with the National Ballet of Canada,
they found that all were stable and had full range of motion. But
arthritis was detected in many joints, including 18 percent of the
talonavicular ones.
</P>
<P>
   The findings should not deter children from studying dance, said
Salonen, whose own two young daughters study ballet. The message,
he said, is not ``Look out, moms: don't let your kids dance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the findings suggest that parents should hold off allowing
their children to go on point until later in their studies, he
said, and that students and professional dancers should consider
resting longer between performances _ much the way baseball
pitchers are used in rotation. ``There has to be a happy medium,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAFETY: Allaying Health Workers' Worst Fear &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The physical sensation is fleeting, but the emotional trauma can
linger for months. And in the worst cases, the physical harm can be
lifelong, or even fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Health care workers call it the needle stick, and for many it is
their greatest fear on the job, because one small slip could infect
them with HIV, hepatitis or similar causes of disease. Each year,
federal authorities estimate, there are 600,000 to 800,000 such
mistakes among the nation's 8 million health care workers, although
most do not result in infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrible ordeal,'' said Dr. Linda Rosenstock, director
of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   For medical workers, the greatest risk comes if they stick
themselves with a needle used on a patient with hepatitis B; the
chance of infection is as high as 30 percent. It is believed to be
much more difficult to acquire infections of AIDS or other forms of
hepatitis through needle sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Now the agency, part of the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, has issued guidelines meant to reduce the risk of
needle-stick injuries to health workers. Officials say they hope to
extend the success some institutions have already had in reducing
the incidents _ in some cases as much as 88 percent _ in medical
offices across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although many devices already exist to reduce the risk,
Rosenstock said, they are not in widespread use. Only about 15
percent of hospitals, for example, are reported to use needles with
safety attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is recommending that needles be eliminated
whenever possible. For intravenous treatment, for example, they can
be replaced with connectors that attach to each other with blunt or
valved connectors. When needles cannot be avoided, the agency
recommends using equipment with safety features, like shields.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are available online, at www.cdc.gov/niosh.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIAGNOSIS: Better Gauge for Carpal Tunnel Problems &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, federal officials said the Clinton administration
might soon issue sweeping new rules for the workplace that could
help protect millions of Americans from repetitive strain injuries,
often associated with the heavy use of computers. Under the new
rules, employers with even a few cases of RSI will be required to
carry out full-scale ergonomic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study raises questions about the best way to diagnose
one of the best-known RSI diseases, carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in a recent issue of the journal Muscle and
Nerve, found that variations in the results of the nerve-conduction
studies often used to make a finding of carpal tunnel are so
significant that there should be changes in how they are
interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Salerno, who conducted the study as an occupational
health student at the University of Michigan, says doctors now use
the nerve tests to give a yes or no answer to whether a patient has
carpal tunnel. It would be more useful, she said, for doctors to
use a system of categories like normal, equivocal, mild or definite
abnormality.
</P>
<P>
   In the conduction tests, doctors give a small jolt of
electricity to nerves in a patient's arm, then measure how long it
takes to reach the muscle. The problem, Salerno said, is that
several factors _ from skin temperature to the placement of the
electrodes that deliver the shock _ can affect the results.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDE EFFECTS: Better Sex, After the Hysterectomy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For many women who need to undergo hysterectomies, the anxiety
they feel is not just over the surgery to remove the uterus but
over a widespread belief about the procedure's aftermath: that
their sex lives will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a study of 1,300 women by the University of Maryland
medical school may put that fear to rest. It reports that most
women said their sex lives were better, not worse, after the
operation, which is performed on 600,000 women in America each
year, mainly those who suffer the benign but painful uterine tumors
called fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't know what to expect,'' said Dr. Kristen
Kjerulff, a professor of epidemiology at the medical school who was
the study's principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of the women studied over a two-year period did
report problems with sex after the operation, including pain and
loss of desire. (Some of these problems, Kjerulff said, can be
addressed through medication.) But many of the rest reported
substantial improvements in their sex lives, including increased
desire and stronger, more frequent orgasms.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the improvement may result from the fact that,
their medical conditions having been treated, the women simply feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREVENTION: Fighting Pneumonia, as Easy as Sitting &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the solutions to the most serious medical problems do
not have to be high tech.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a study recently published in The Lancet, the British
medical journal. It suggests that to reduce pneumonia in
intensive-care wards, all doctors need to do is to have the
patients sit up.
</P>
<P>
   The current practice of having patients lie on their backs
appears to contribute to the development of pneumonia, the most
common hospital-acquired infection, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Spain studied 86 patients on respirators and had
39 of them moved into semi-recumbent positions. Three of the 39
developed pneumonia, compared with 16 of the 47 who were lying
down.

   MONACO-SAFRA (Paris) _ An American nurse who had worked for
Edmond Safra for the last five months has admitted to setting the
fire that killed the billionaire banker as he took refuge in a
bathroom in his luxury penthouse in Monte Carlo last Friday,
according to Monaco's chief prosecutor. The prosecutor said the
nurse, Ted Maher, 41, from Stormville, N.Y., had concocted his
story that the harbor-side apartment was under attack by two-hooded
men with knives and then set fire to a waste paper basket in an
effort to draw attention to himself. By Suzanne Daley.

   NIGERIA-RELIGION (Gusau, Nigeria) _ Zamfara, the North Dakota of
Nigeria, has suddenly become this West African nation's most famous
state, as well as the biggest challenge to Nigeria's fragile
national unity. In October, the state government announced it would
introduce Sharia, the Islamic social and penal code, raising near

   CHECHNYA-RUSSIA (Dolinsky, Russia) _ Russian planes dropped
leaflets on Chechnya's besieged capital on Monday, warning
residents and rebels to flee by Saturday before federal forces
launch a massive attack to smash the city, Grozny, into submission.
The Russian military has been raining bombs and artillery on the
city for weeks but has been hesitant to risk storming it, for fear
that street battles would cause the kind of heavy casualties that
Russia suffered in Grozny in the 1994-96 war. (Developing; summary

   SWISS-BANKS-HOLOCAUST (Undated) _ A three-year search of Swiss
banks accused of hiding accounts held by Holocaust victims ended on
Monday with a commission of independent auditors announcing it had
found 54,000 accounts that were probably linked to victims of Nazi
persecution, and describing in detail how some of the banks had
issued ``deliberately misleading statements'' for decades to Jews
who had come looking for their family's assets. By David E. Sanger.

   BRAZIL-TRADE (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ As a developing nation
grappling with the social turmoil caused by the economic forces of
globalization, Brazil tends to grow testy when it feels its
problems are misrepresented by an all-powerful United States intent
on handing out lessons. Like other developing states, Brazil had
much to gain from success in Seattle. The liberalization of world
agricultural trade alone could bring an additional $11 billion in
annual export revenue. So its reaction to some of Clinton's remarks
in Seattle was swift and angry. By Roger Cohen.

   SCOTUS-MIRANDA (Washington) _ The Supreme Court's deeply
familiar, much disputed Miranda decision is headed for its most
important test, as the justices announced Monday that they would
decide whether Congress had effectively overruled the 33-year-old
decision with a law that was enacted for that purpose in 1968 and
ignored almost ever since. The question for the court, in an appeal
by an indicted bank robber who made self-incriminating statements
without having first received his Miranda warnings, is whether
Miranda vs. Arizona itself established a rule of constitutional law
or whether it merely expressed the Warren Court's preferred method
of enforcing the constitutional right against compelled
self-incrimination. By Linda Greenhouse.

   SOCSEC-BENEFITS (Washington) _ The Social Security
Administration is not being optimistic enough about how long
Americans will live in the 21st Century and, as a result, is
underestimating how much it will have to pay out to them, according
to a federal advisory panel's report on the solvency of the Social
Security system. The advisory panel said on Monday that the Clinton
administration had underestimated the financial problems of the
Social Security program because it had understated likely
improvements in the life expectancy of Americans, who will collect

people haunt the city: hiding in doorways, pushing overloaded
shopping carts, standing on corners announcing their troubles on
cardboard signs (``Veteran, homeless and hungry''). But San
Francisco is far from alone. At the richest time in the nation's
history, housing that the poor can afford is at an all-time low,
fueling an increase in homelessness, according to the United States
Conference of Mayors. And with complaints about beggars and bag

   INTERFAITH-DECORATIONS (Undated) _ The December holidays have
long been a source of angst for many duel-faith couples, and the
tug is particularly acute for Christians and Jews whose seasonal
celebrations collide head on with Christmas and Hanukkah. Couples
have often decided to forgo one holiday or simply display the
paraphernalia of both side by side. But many families are now
synthesizing two customs. The commercial marketplace is starting to
respond to this pluralistic view of the holidays by producing what
was once taboo: decorations that merge the symbols of two

different stage of his life. But his decision to retire as chairman

stunned shareholders and the business world. By Constance L. Hays.

<P>
   One day soon, perhaps as soon as a few years, many diabetics may
forever throw away the lancets they use to prick their fingers for
blood sugar tests and the needles they use to inject themselves
with insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they may be wearing bracelets or even earrings smart
enough to sense and report glucose levels continuously to an
artificial pancreas: a surgically embedded pump that dispenses just
the right amount of insulin into their bloodstreams.
</P>
<P>
   Recent inventions, as well as refinements of older ones, have
made such a prosthetic pancreas, once a distant dream, more and
more plausible, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing this year is more information to the
diabetic patient delivered in a less painful manner,'' said Dr.
Mark A. Arnold, a professor of chemistry at the University of Iowa,
who is developing a noninvasive blood glucose detector. ``We
haven't closed the loop yet _ we don't have an automatic system
that both detects blood sugar levels and signals a pump to add the
right amount of insulin _ but we are getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   An artificial pancreas that successfully mimics a natural one
must combine a continuous, real-time measurement of glucose levels
with an insulin reservoir that instantly responds to these
measurements, dispensing the correct amount of insulin just as the
natural pancreas does.
</P>
<P>
   The pancreas does other things besides dispensing insulin, the
hormone that keeps the quantity of sugar dissolved in blood at a
constant level. But research has focused on that function because
of the growing prevalence of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 16 million diabetics in the United States. Of
these about 1 million have juvenile, or Type 1, diabetes, in which
they produce no insulin; the others _ adult-onset, or Type 2,
diabetics _ produce insulin but tend to have a condition called
insulin resistance, in which their bodies cannot use it properly.
This second type of diabetes has been rising at an alarming rate in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics who can maintain normal or close-to-normal levels of
blood sugar, or glucose, reduce the risk of grave complications
like amputation, blindness, nerve damage, heart disease and kidney
failure. A continuous glucose sensor _ even one that is not yet
connected to an automatic insulin dispenser _ might help to reduce
these risks.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be a valuable alarm clock when blood sugar drops,
when that happens, people sometimes lose consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who work with diabetics have been watching the progress
toward an artificial pancreas with growing interest. ``Right now we
are doing pancreatic transplants that are fairly successful, but
would like to replace these with a machine,'' said Dr. George L.
Siegel, a clinical endocrinologist who practices in Manhattan.
``The idea of an artificial pancreas is marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel pointed out that the technology still had many challenges
to overcome. ``We have one arm of it, the insulin pump,'' he said.
``When a reliable, miniaturized sensor is in place to monitor
glucose constantly, the artificial pancreas will be far closer to
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of the new generation of glucose sensors looks a lot
like a wristwatch. Developed by researchers at Cygnus Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif., the monitor slips on the wrist and then uses
a tiny electrical current to pull a bit of fluid through the skin
to gel pads that measure glucose levels three times an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current is very low; all you feel when you slip on the
device is a mild sort of tingle that soon goes away,'' said Dr.
Russell O. Potts, vice president of research at Cygnus and senior
author of a paper reporting on the monitor, which appeared in The
Journal of the American Medical Association on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Cygnus has submitted its monitor to the Food and Drug
Administration for approval; a panel considering the device is
expected to give its recommendation this month.
</P>
<P>
   Another continuous glucose monitor has already been approved by
the agency for use by doctors. This monitor, sold by MiniMed Inc.
of Sylmar, Calif., has a sensor that the doctor inserts, usually
just below the skin of the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   A wire from the sensor goes to a small computer that can be
clipped to a belt loop. The monitor reads glucose values every five
minutes for 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cygnus device, the MiniMed sensor measures the glucose
in tissue rather than in blood, and then extrapolates from this
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to add hypo- and hyperglycemic alarms to the system to
let patients know when their blood sugar levels are too high or too
low,'' said Robert Murtfeldt, director of business development for
MiniMed. He expects the next phase of the monitor to be a consumer
version in which continuous glucose readings are transmitted
wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, at the University of Iowa, is taking a different
approach. He and a collaborator, Dr. Gary W. Small, a chemist at
Ohio University, are working to build a noninvasive sensor. They
shine a beam of near-infrared light through tissue packed with
small blood vessels _ an earlobe, a fingertip, the webbing between
the thumb and forefinger, or even the tongue. The scientists
extrapolate from the data to get the concentration of glucose in
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   If the artificial pancreas becomes a reality, it will be partly
because of an inventor, Dr. Robert E. Fischell, who did the
original work in the field nearly 20 years ago. In 1980, Fischell,
then at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory,
invented and supervised the development of a programmable,
implantable pump that administered a steady flow of insulin to
patients night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``By now it has been put in about 1,000 people,'' said Fischell,
who now works out of his home in Dayton, Md.
</P>
<P>
   With Fischell's pump, implanted in the abdomen just beneath the
skin, patients measure their blood sugar regularly during the day
and use the measurements to adjust the flow of insulin. He is not
involved in the monitoring research, but says he is delighted to
see it happening.
</P>
<P>
   An implanted glucose monitor, he said, would finally close the
loop, doing all the blood-stabilizing work that is now done by a
normal pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing the loop automatically,'' he went on, ``will be a
major, major breakthrough for the diabetic. At last.''

AND NOW, A NEW GAME: WHO WANTS TO RUIN TV?
</HEADLINE>

By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things are shaping up rather nicely for ABC and its game show,
the one that invites ordinary peons like us to be millionaires.
It's a certified ratings phenomenon, a surprise, a shocker, one of
those pieces of mud that networks sling at the wall, hoping
something sticks. This one did, which is terrific because, well,
that's all it takes. One. One hit, and you're off to the races and
everyone is freaking out, inside your corridors, in your
competitors' corridors, in the suites of advertisers and the ad
agencies that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Now ABC has figured out how to use its new loaded weapon (can't
just keep these things lying around the house, you know), and its
salivating competitors have their faces smashed up against the
window, all disfigured and green with envy, outsiders begging
entry.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 11, we'll get ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
three times a week: Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. Don't look
surprised by the trifecta, or what will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Every network and producer and parking attendant with
connections is coming up with game show ideas, from the lame to the
really lame to the really, really lame. Even ABC will try to
duplicate its own British duplication because ``there is room for
more,'' as ABC entertainment co-chairman Lloyd Braun so gleefully
put it in a conference call. After all, television audiences are
demanding yet fickle, and if something sticks, if it's a hit, if it
draws 22 million viewers, as ``Millionaire'' has, you're not an
idiot but idolized.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But didn't a parent ever lecture you about being careful
with weapons? They can be deadly to the innocent who want no part
of this but will be in the range of fire anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the average television viewer.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference the other day to discuss the just-concluded
sweeps ratings period, NBC officials announced intentions to scale
back big-budget miniseries and specials during future sweeps, to
better safeguard their high-dollar investments.
</P>
<P>
   This is a revelation, as networks, particularly NBC, have
increasingly found ratings success in flashy movies like ``Merlin''
and ``Cinderella,'' developed specifically to attract an optimal
number of viewers at the optimal time. But the way NBC, CBS and Fox
see it, going up against ``Millionaire'' is economic suicide. Why
air your ``best stuff'' when it won't be seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' has changed the economic landscape for the
betterment of ABC and those with Disney stock. But it's also
threatening to unravel the viewing opportunities for the rest of
us, those who don't very much care for game shows of any stripe and
couldn't care less whether ``Millionaire'' returns as a Sunday,
Tuesday and Thursday fixture or a Saturday morning cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bigger problem: When networks start running scared,
which they are, it results in conservatism and bonehead choices and
series with mush for brains, of which we have plenty already.
There's little incentive to be unique and daring. Good ideas are
left at the door, shaking like rabbits in a lion's den.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we'll have a schedule full of game shows, much the way
we had (and still have, to a point) multiple newsmagazines. And
what a shame, because those costly dramas just now getting off the
endangered list will again be pre-empted for programming that costs
less to produce and therefore has higher returns and smaller risks.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley is reportedly miffed about his ``Snoops''
getting a cancellation notice to make room for ``Millionaire'' _
OK, it wasn't great, and it had only so-so ratings. But if ABC is
willing to tick off its golden-child producer, is there no end to
this game-show cockiness?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we can hope for at this point _ and it's bound to
happen _ is that game shows dilute the market and lose steam. How
could it not? I believe that cream rises to the top. But airing
three days a week and with other game shows cluttering the
landscape, how long can even ``Millionaire'' keep luring such
sizable audiences?
</P>
<P>
   We're going to have to wait this one out. For the time being,
though, imagine a game show airing every night of the week. I'm all
for variety on television, but game shows over dramas merely dumbs
down TV even more.
</P>
<P>
   TV is about to be turned upside down. And it's all because we
want to be millionaires, to see ordinary people win big money.
</P>
<P>
   I have a better idea. Buy a lottery ticket. The odds are the
same, and you're not dragging the rest of us down with you.

   NEW YORK _ The scene begins in a dance studio, after gawky,
untalented students and a lecherous instructor have just learned a
routine to ``Disco Duck'' and gone home. Young stud Tony spots
wispy Stephanie on the other side of the floor. Earlier, he had
been eying her at the hot nightclub, 2001 Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Sure of himself, he struts over to ask her to be his dance
partner in an upcoming competition. Considering herself more
sophisticated than Tony, Stephanie can't be bothered by his
brashness. Still, she shows faint signs of attraction.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens next. You know she will act on that
attraction. You know she will dance lustily with Tony, break up
with him, and come running back in the end so she and Tony can
dance like it's 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Even never having seen the movie of the same name, you know all
this will happen because ``Saturday Night Fever'' is a big-budget
Broadway musical that needs to appeal to the masses so it can make
lots of money and find worldwide success. And you know it will do
just that, because even if the material is merely skin-deep, it is
accessible, it is fun, it has a beat so you can dance to it. It is
a musical, and, despite critical panning, it is one of numerous
such shows that are continuing the late-'90s Broadway revival.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much discussion during the past few years about
the supposed decline of the American musical. Critics cry out for
the tunes of Stephen Sondheim and the dance steps of Bob Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   The public, however, is unfazed. The musicals of today still
sing to theatergoers who continue to pack houses. The 1998-1999
season was Broadway's biggest moneymaker. Now, halfway into the
1999-2000 season, the League of American Theatres and Producers has
announced a record Thanksgiving-week box office in New York _ $14.3
million _ and predicts that this season's box-office take will top
last year's.
</P>
<P>
   These reports reflect a nationwide boom in performing arts
attendance, which has as much to do with a healthy economy as
anything else. Still, Broadway must be doing something right if
it's seeing record audiences. Folks are still flocking to the Great
White Way to catch staple hits such as ``Phantom of the Opera,''
``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Les Miserables,'' as well as
significant revivals, such as ``Cabaret'' and ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' (and you can add the recently opened ``Kiss Me Kate'' to this
list).
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the musical still fails to garner respect. Much
of what Broadway has seen in the way of new musicals the last half
of this decade has been adapted from movies, some ill-conceived
(''Footloose,'' ``Big'') and others well-received (''The Lion
King'').
</P>
<P>
   The works that have received mixed reactions from critics and
audiences have been by rising musical composers Jason Robert Brown
(''Parade''), Adam Guettel (''Floyd Collins'') and Michael John
LaChiusa (''Hello Again''). All suffered short runs because of
stark staging and dark themes, and music that is infinitely more
interesting but less accessible than, say, something by Frank
Wildhorn (''Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''). LaChiusa's
current musical, the sometimes brilliant ``Marie Christine,'' set
in late-1800s New Orleans and Chicago and based on ``Medea,'' will
likely see a quick demise as well. The only piece in this dark mold
that has met with unanimous success is ``Rent,'' which will likely
go down as the musical of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, audiences want their musical theater full of
spectacle and multimillion-dollar sets. Indeed, if anything is
wrong with the state of the modern musical, it is just ``that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understand why (producers) spend that much money on a
musical,'' said actor Judd Hirsch, recently in town for the touring
production of the hit play ``Art.'' ``The only real thing on that
stage is the people. When I see a car or an airplane onstage, I
just laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   One young team that has had moderate success is Stephen Flaherty
and Lynn Ahrens, whose ``Ragtime'' will soon close after a
three-year run.
</P>
<P>
   E.L. Doctorow's story was ``an almost impossible book and notion
to put on stage,'' said composer Harvey Schmidt, who with partner
Tom Jones has given us ``The Fantasticks'' and ``100 in the
Shade.'' ``Ragtime'' ``was very accessible, but interesting at the
same time. It was very bold and not ordinary. It had density and
humanity, which is necessary. (Ahrens and Flaherty's) first
musical, `Lucky Stiff,' was good, too. It wasn't ordinary music,
but they did it right. They made every single minute count.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahrens and Flaherty are working on ``The Seussical,'' based on
the books of Dr. Seuss, but that's one of the few bright spots on
the musicals horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more revivals _ ``Finian's Rainbow,''
``Oklahoma!,'' ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``The Music Man'' _
2000 will see new works by the kings of Broadway box office: Andrew
Lloyd Webber (''Whistle Down the Wind''), Claude-Michel Schonberg
and Alain Boublil (''Martin Guerre'') and Wildhorn (''Havana'').
Not to mention more adaptations of works that wouldn't seem to be
good musical fodder in the first place, such as ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' ``Blade Runner'' and, believe it or not, ``Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   Pow!
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Broadway is breaking records, why mess with the
formula? It won't stop the dedicated from trying new things.
``There has never been more interest among young people fascinated
with trying to write musicals,'' said Schmidt. ``Sooner or later,
someone's going to break through with a new way of doing them. It
has got to happen to stir things up.''

``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Les Miserables,'' as well as
significant revivals, such as ``Cabaret'' and ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' (and you can add the recently opened ``Kiss Me Kate'' to this
list).
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the musical still fails to garner respect. Much
of what Broadway has seen in the way of new musicals the last half
of this decade has been adapted from movies, some ill-conceived
(''Footloose,'' ``Big'') and others well-received (''The Lion
King'').
</P>
<P>
   The works that have received mixed reactions from critics and
audiences have been by rising musical composers Jason Robert Brown
(''Parade''), Adam Guettel (''Floyd Collins'') and Michael John
LaChiusa (''Hello Again''). All suffered short runs because of
stark staging and dark themes, and music that is infinitely more
interesting but less accessible than, say, something by Frank
Wildhorn (''Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''). LaChiusa's
current musical, the sometimes brilliant ``Marie Christine,'' set
in late-1800s New Orleans and Chicago and based on ``Medea,'' will
likely see a quick demise as well. The only piece in this dark mold
that has met with unanimous success is ``Rent,'' which will likely
go down as the musical of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, audiences want their musical theater full of
spectacle and multimillion-dollar sets. Indeed, if anything is
wrong with the state of the modern musical, it is just ``that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understand why (producers) spend that much money on a
musical,'' said actor Judd Hirsch, recently in town for the touring
production of the hit play ``Art.'' ``The only real thing on that
stage is the people. When I see a car or an airplane onstage, I
just laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   One young team that has had moderate success is Stephen Flaherty
and Lynn Ahrens, whose ``Ragtime'' will soon close after a
three-year run.
</P>
<P>
   E.L. Doctorow's story was ``an almost impossible book and notion
to put on stage,'' said composer Harvey Schmidt, who with partner
Tom Jones has given us ``The Fantasticks'' and ``100 in the
Shade.'' ``Ragtime'' ``was very accessible, but interesting at the
same time. It was very bold and not ordinary. It had density and
humanity, which is necessary. (Ahrens and Flaherty's) first
musical, `Lucky Stiff,' was good, too. It wasn't ordinary music,
but they did it right. They made every single minute count.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahrens and Flaherty are working on ``The Seussical,'' based on
the books of Dr. Seuss, but that's one of the few bright spots on
the musicals horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more revivals _ ``Finian's Rainbow,''
``Oklahoma!,'' ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``The Music Man'' _
2000 will see new works by the kings of Broadway box office: Andrew
Lloyd Webber (''Whistle Down the Wind''), Claude-Michel Schonberg
and Alain Boublil (''Martin Guerre'') and Wildhorn (''Havana'').
Not to mention more adaptations of works that wouldn't seem to be
good musical fodder in the first place, such as ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' ``Blade Runner'' and, believe it or not, ``Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   Pow!
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Broadway is breaking records, why mess with the
formula? It won't stop the dedicated from trying new things.
``There has never been more interest among young people fascinated
with trying to write musicals,'' said Schmidt. ``Sooner or later,
someone's going to break through with a new way of doing them. It
has got to happen to stir things up.''

<P>
   By the time most psychiatrists encounter schizophrenia, its
symptoms are already in full flower. But scientists have long
surmised that the illness starts much earlier, the demons beginning
to nibble at the edges of young people's lives well before the most
flagrant psychosis appears.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers are beginning, in a systematic way, to
investigate the earliest stages of schizophrenia, attempting to
find signs that could predict its onset.
</P>
<P>
   Two research groups are adopting a much bolder strategy: They
are identifying young people at risk and treating them with low
doses of anti-psychotic drugs, even though they do not exhibit the
full-blown symptoms of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing those who take the drugs with other high-risk
subjects who do not, the researchers, at the Yale School of
Medicine and the University of Melbourne in Australia, hope to find
out if such early intervention can keep the illness at bay, and to
learn more about the factors that predict vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are using the newest anti-psychotic drugs,
medications much less likely to produce serious side effects than
their predecessors. Still, the studies are controversial and have
found no shortage of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas H. McGlashan, the director of the Yale study, said he
decided to begin his prevention trial when he became convinced,
after many years of working with patients suffering from
schizophrenia, that ``80 percent if not more of the damage is done
before the disorder appears.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan cited the findings of as many as a dozen studies
suggesting that the earlier schizophrenia was treated, the better a
patient's prospects were for recovery. After visiting the site of
the Australian trial, he said, ``I began to think that there might
be a way of preventing chronicity with the treatments we already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Treating people with drugs for a condition they do not yet have
is a highly unusual approach in psychiatry, though it has precedent
in other areas of medicine _ the trial of tamoxifen as a
prophylactic treatment for women at high risk for breast cancer is
one example _ and is being explored for Alzheimer's and some other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders are so
devastating that few people would object to the eventual goal of
preventive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees, however, that the time is right to attempt
something so ambitious, in large part because, despite researchers'
continuing efforts, there is still no set of indicators that can
predict future illness with any reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody yet knows what the early symptoms are,'' said Dr.
Barbara Cornblatt, director of the division of high-risk studies at
Hillside Hospital, part of Long Island Jewish Medical Center. With
the exception of a family history of schizophrenia, she said, ``We
don't even clearly know what the level of risk is; we don't know if
5 percent or 40 percent who are identified with suspected risk
factors are going to become ill.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, critics argue, some of the subjects in prevention
studies will receive treatment unnecessarily, or be treated for
what turns out to be the wrong problem. Behaviors used in the
studies to determine risk, they point out, can also be signs of
normal adolescent crisis, or of other psychiatric problems like
depression that do not require anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists also question how researchers will know whether
the drugs are effective in individual cases. ``If people without
convincing symptoms are treated and never develop the illness,
under what circumstances would it be ethical for you to discontinue
the medication?'' asked Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the
National Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say they are concerned about the possible stigma
attached to being labeled at high risk for psychosis, and about the
potential side effects of even the newest anti-psychotic
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go slowly and cautiously,'' said Dr. Laura Lee
Hall, director of research for the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, an association of family members and some consumers.
``On the one hand, I think it's extremely important for us to
experimentally determine if we can prevent the most disabling
consequences of schizophrenia and bipolar illness. On the other
hand, I certainly have concerns that we not needlessly medicate
children that may not become sick.''
</P>
<P>
   One alternative, Hall suggested, might be to monitor patients
deemed at high risk but provide treatment only as necessary, as is
done in studies conducted by Cornblatt's clinic at Hillside.
Another might be to offer preventive measures that are less
intensive than drugs, like dietary changes or supportive therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Cornblatt were among a group of medical ethicists,
representatives of advocacy organizations and psychiatric
researchers _ including McGlashan and Dr. Patrick D. McGorry,
director of the Australian trial _ who met on Nov. 19 and 20 at a
conference in Washington sponsored by George Washington University,
to discuss the ethical and scientific issues raised by
early-intervention studies in psychiatry. Among the issues
discussed were informed consent, confidentiality and the impact of
anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are pressing, mental health experts say, and not
only because of the studies already under way. In the
not-too-distant future, researchers may finally identify genes that
predispose people to disorders like schizophrenia and manic
depression, opening the way for genetic testing, like that
available for Huntington's disease or breast cancer. Advances in
psychopharmacology are likely to yield a new generation of
anti-psychotic drugs that are more effective and safer than those
now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   These developments will make it easier to determine and quantify
risk, and will offer new opportunities for early treatment. But
ethicists and researchers say they will also raise even more
complicated choices for patients, family members, scientists and
clinicians, who must weigh the costs and benefits in a society
whose attitude toward mental illness and those who suffer from it
is far from neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks in some sense are different for early intervention
in psychiatry than they are in breast cancer, or other illnesses,''
said Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, chairman of the department of
psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in
Worcester. ``One needs to raise the question of what the
consequences of labeling a person as preschizophrenic are.''
</P>
<P>
   Those consequences, Appelbaum pointed out, can include negative
reactions from employers, health insurers, schools ``and anyone who
has to decide whether or not to take a chance on a person,'' as
well as from friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the knowledge that one is at high risk for
schizophrenia or another severe mental illness can drastically
affect self-image, particularly in adolescents. A teenager given
such a label, Appelbaum said, might wonder: ``Do I decide that I
shouldn't get married? That I shouldn't go to college? That I
should downgrade my expectations for myself?''
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan, however, said he believed strongly that people had
the right to know if they were vulnerable to schizophrenia or other
severe disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose civil liberties are you talking about?'' he asked. ``If
it is the person who is at risk, it seems they ought to know the
information. They can choose to deny it if they want, but at least
they should be given the opportunity to deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the question of informed consent, researchers are equally
divided. The issue of whether subjects in prevention trials are
fully aware of the consequences of accepting treatment is
particularly sensitive, critics say, in studies involving teenagers
or very young children, where parents are the ones who must provide
the consent.
</P>
<P>
   McGorry, the director of the Australian study, said he had no
doubt that the subjects in his study _ the youngest of whom are in
their mid-teens, the oldest in their 30s _ were fully able to give
informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the situation where you have a psychotic patient
incompetent to consent to treatment,'' said McGorry said. ``These
patients are very much in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   McGorry, who is the co-author of ``The Recognition and
Management of Early Psychosis'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999),
said his study had aroused little controversy in Australia, perhaps
because that country has a more developed community network for
treating mental illness in adolescents, and because the social
consequences of a diagnosis of mental disorder are not as severe
there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both he and McGlashan are well aware of the difficult
questions their studies raise, and they have both gone to some
lengths to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning the prevention trial, the Australian
researchers conducted a preliminary study to test the criteria they
were using to determine high risk. Monitoring patients who met the
criteria, they found that 40 percent went on to develop a psychotic
illness _ a high enough percentage, they felt, to warrant
attempting to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   All the subjects in the study, McGorry said, had come to his
clinic requesting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study began in 1996, he added, 4 of the 31 subjects
who for six months received low doses of the anti-psychotic drug
Risperdal and a specially tailored form of psychotherapy developed
psychosis in the six months after they were taken off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In the control group, those who received only psychotherapy, 10
of 28 subjects became psychotic. McGorry said that the difference
between the groups was significant, both clinically and
statistically, but he added that the study was small and more
research needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the participants in the Australian trial, neither
subjects nor researchers in the Yale study know which participants
are on medication _ in this case the anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa _
and which are getting dummy pills. Subjects receive the medication
for a year, then are monitored for another year. The study has
enrolled 22 subjects between the ages of 12 and 45, but the
researchers hope eventually to include 80 participants.
</P>
<P>
   All the subjects, McGlashan said, had been experiencing some
symptoms before they enrolled, including social withdrawal, trouble
concentrating, changes in personality, deterioration of personal
hygiene, decline in academic performance and perceptual oddities,
like seeing lights or shapes that are not there or hearing strange
noises.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale study is financed in part by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., which
makes Zyprexa, and by grants from the National Institute of Mental
Health and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan said that when he told colleagues about his research,
their reactions were divided. ``Some say `How can you put these
people on placebo?' and some say `How can you put them on drugs?'''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he remained convinced that trying to do something to
prevent schizophrenia was better than doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychosis,'' McGlashan said, ``is not a benign state of
mind.''

RECONCILING NOTHINGNESS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Wash., Ill.)   (Science Times)  
 (Eds: Poetry at end of story may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothingness is fashionable again. When we last heard from the
notion, Jean-Paul Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher,
was writing that ``nothingness lies coiled in the heart of being''
in his decidedly something-sized tome, ``Being and Nothingness''
(first published in 1943).
</P>
<P>
   Now the notion has cropped up outside of philosophical tracts,
as physicists have identified nothingness to be the central mystery
of the origin and structure of the universe. This development has
added fuel to a battle of words raging with remarkable intensity
over the last several years. The question is whether concepts in
physics, biology and the other hard sciences can shed any light on
similar-sounding concepts in the humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, physicists are talking about a rather specific kind
of nothingness. They want to know why the vast tracts of apparently
empty space between the galaxies emerged with a strange sort of
weight from the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe. Recent
astronomical measurements have suggested that this ``weight,''
which has a negative gravitational effect, is pushing the galaxies
apart and accelerating the expansion of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But since the intergalactic vacuum is, in effect, the deepest
hole that nature can dig in material existence, it counts as
nothingness if anything does.
</P>
<P>
   Those observations beg a question: Does a philosopher's zilch
have anything to do with a physicist's? And what of other words
that turn up in both forms of discourse?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fire in this debate has been drawn by a group of
French postmodern thinkers, including Jacques Derrida and Jacques
Lacan, who have a penchant for using the language of the hard
sciences in ways that prominent physicists have said is mostly
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Derrida, referring to Einstein's theory of
relativity, wrote in a 1970 scholarly article:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Einsteinian constant is not a constant, is not a center.
It is the very concept of variability. In other words, it is not
the concept of some &UR; thing  &LR; _ of a center starting from which an
observer could master the field _ but the very concept of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Weinberg, the physics Nobelist, cited the passage in
an essay in The New York Review of Books several years ago, saying,
``I have no idea what this is intended to mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passage by two different philosophers, cited in a parody
of postmodernist writing by Dr. Alan Sokal, a physicist at New York
University, defines the highly mathematical concept of chaos as ``a
void that is not a nothingness but a  &UR; virtual &LR; , containing all
possible particles and drawing out all possible forms, which spring
up only to disappear immediately, without consistency or reference,
without consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the October issue of the journal Physics Today, Dr.
Jonathan Katz, a physicist at Washington University, declared,
``The only reasonable conclusion is that postmodernism is nothing
more than a scheme to obtain cushy university jobs for its
practitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   As clear as those arguments seem to many scientists, they lost
some of their force recently when Dr. Mara Beller, a professor of
the history and philosophy of science at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, pointed out that many hallowed figures of 20th-century
physics, like Niels Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli, published their own
apparent gibberish on politics and philosophy using the terminology
of physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet physicists relate to Derrida's and Bohr's obscurities in
fundamentally different ways,'' Beller wrote in Physics Today: ``to
Derrida's with contempt, to Bohr's with awe.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Dr. Ullica Segerstrale, a social scientist at the
Illinois Institute of Technology who has a background in physical
chemistry, scientists constantly turn philosophical with their own
language when they are seeking inspiration or trying to explain the
meaning of their often abstract findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met more metaphysical people than physicists,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And the unhappiness over linguistic borrowings cuts both ways,
said Dr. Segerstrale, whose new book, ``Defenders of the Truth: The
Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond,'' will be
published by Oxford University Press in March.
</P>
<P>
   During interviews conducted for the book, Segerstrale said, she
discovered that some moral philosophers were outraged by
sociobiology's adoption of the word ``altruism'' as a technical
term. In that usage, it refers to an organism's sacrifice of itself
to ensure that elements of its genome will be propagated by
relatives _ hardly the version of Good Samaritanism that the word
evokes for most people.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of all these conflicts may simply be the assumption
that different areas of human culture can be sealed off from one
another, since ``nobody can be policing these terms,'' Segerstrale
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothingness is certainly a case in point. And an acceptance that
abstract ideas cross boundaries can lead to some startling
possibilities, perhaps disproving King Lear's dark prediction that
``nothing will come of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein first noticed that according to his theory of
relativity, any weight of nothingness in space could push galaxies
apart from one another, the effect that astronomers have recently
observed.
</P>
<P>
   Could this have been what Ira Gershwin had in mind when he wrote
``I've got plenty o' nuttin'' in the 1930s, just as Einstein was
struggling to unify relativity with the rest of physics? Was
``Seinfeld,'' a show about nothing, really a sly allegory dealing
with four theoretical physicists in New York?
</P>
<P>
   And what of the depths of nihilistic meditation of Ernest
Hemingway's character in ``A Clean, Well-Lighted Place'': ``Some
lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was nada y pues
nada y nada y pues nada.''
</P>
<P>
   From this point of view, humanistic writers sometimes seem
eerily close to interpreting the results of science before they are
found, as the poet W.S. Merwin did in 1967, long before astronomers
saw those galaxies being pushed apart by emptiness:
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is nothing the matter with the stars
</P>
<P>
   It is my emptiness among them
</P>
<P>
   While they drift farther away in the invisible morning.

AGE-RESTRICTED TEXAS COMMUNITY TELLS WIDOW, 52, TO MOVE OUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Linda Bell's husband had been dead two months and
seven days when she got the letter.
</P>
<P>
   It said, in effect, move out of your house within six months or
face legal action.
</P>
<P>
   At Country Place, an age-restricted community in neighboring
Brazoria County near Pearland, just south of Houston, if you're
younger than 55 and your spouse dies, there's a distinct
possibility that you can be thrown out of your house.
</P>
<P>
   That's the position the Country Place board of directors has
taken against Bell and two other women.
</P>
<P>
   After Bell lost her 60-year-old husband to Lou Gehrig's disease
in August, she was told she no longer could claim an exemption to
the minimum age required for homeowners in the master-planned
community of 1,300 people who have left the big-city rat race for
the quieter confines of age-restricted living.
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, Bell is considered too young.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a secretary to oilman Bud Adams _ owner of the National
Football League's Tennessee Titans _ is fighting mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband lived in my house, he died in my house and they're
telling me I have to leave my house. And they're telling me in a
rude letter before he's even been dead three months. That is
wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other women _ one age 54 and the other 51 _ who lost their
husbands in recent years also have received notice they will face
legal action unless they comply with the community's age
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it is not necessary for you to relocate your
residence in order to comply with the age restriction provisions,''
said their letters from property manager Dawn Crawford of
Association Management Inc. ``However, if you do not have any other
alternatives, please promptly take steps in this direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Country Place is buzzing over the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Lampman, president of the Country Place Master
Community Association, makes no apologies for the treatment of the
women.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants, conditions and restrictions of the community, he
said, require that homeowners under 55 have a spouse above that age
living with them.
</P>
<P>
   The widows, he said, either have to leave or have someone 55 or
older move in with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to enforce what your covenants are. You might feel
it's heartless, I might feel it's heartless, but the covenants are
the covenants,'' said Lampman, 59, a retired General Motors
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the American way,'' Lampman added. ``You abide by the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Country Place's conditions, covenants and restrictions, however,
say nothing about evicting residents younger than 55 after they
lose their spouses. Neither do they specify how long someone
younger than 55 may remain after losing an older spouse.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer committee is reviewing the rules to suggest changes.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of that committee, Jack Banowsky, said he senses
the retirement community favors an exception being written into the
rules that would allow residents under 55 to stay after their older
spouses die.
</P>
<P>
   Any changes, though, will require an approval vote by 75 percent
of the residents.
</P>
<P>
   And any changes could lead to another set of problems, said
Banowsky, a 70-year-old retired engineer.
</P>
<P>
   What if an under-age resident remarries someone even younger?
</P>
<P>
   What if stepchildren are involved?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you begin to erode the whole concept of a senior
community,'' Banowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Another restriction prohibits residents under 18. If teen-agers
or pre-teens want to visit relatives, they must limit their stay to
a total of 30 days per year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such restrictions, life in Country Place has a genuine
appeal that reminds some of the 1950s, when everyone on the block
knew each other, fear of crime was an afterthought and boom boxes
had not been invented.
</P>
<P>
   The security of Country Place is invariably cited as a major
plus by residents, who say they are unafraid to take a nighttime
stroll, thanks to security guards posted at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are dozens of organized groups and activities in
which to participate.
</P>
<P>
   If golfing, swimming or playing bridge don't appeal, there's a
choral group, a 40-member band and a drama troupe that stages such
productions as ``Arsenic and Old Lace`` and ``Harvey.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, is an atmosphere in which neighbors
help neighbors, especially when illness strikes.
</P>
<P>
   When cancer spread into the spinal cord of Candy Gillespie's
husband, Wally, their neighbors took care of virtually all the
couple's needs, from grocery shopping to the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   After Gillespie's husband died in 1997 at age 77, she didn't
hear a word from the Country Place board for two years _ until
October.
</P>
<P>
   The letter she received from Association Management Inc. was the
same one Linda Bell had received, threatening that lawyers will be
hired unless she complies with the age rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once an attorney becomes involved, we will seek reimbursement
from you for all attorney fees and cost incurred by Country Place
as a result of your noncompliance,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is, `We don't care if you own the house,
we just don't want you living in it,''' said Gillespie, a
54-year-old bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The third woman who has been told to comply with Country Place's
age restrictions is Myrlene Cox Muddiman, whose first husband died
in June 1994. A month later, she received a letter from the board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Two more letters arrived in the ensuing months before the matter
was dropped after she contacted a lawyer for help.
</P>
<P>
   In October, though, she received a fourth letter _ identical to
the ones sent to Gillespie and Bell _ even though she remarried a
57-year-old Country Place resident last March.
</P>
<P>
   Since Muddiman has been through this before in 1994, she
expressed concern more for Gillespie and Bell than for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the grief this caused me after my first husband
died,'' said Muddiman, a 51-year-old nurse practitioner ``I feel
great anger (that) they have to go through what I went through _
because you have enough to go through after you lose your spouse
without being threatened with being kicked out of your home. This
needs to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie and Bell haven't sought legal help from an attorney,
but they have asked Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, to find out from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development whether kicking them
out is a violation of the Fair Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
   The department is reviewing the age policy of Country Place at
the request of DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly interested in the question,'' said George
Rodriguez, a HUD senior community builder in the agency's Houston
office.
</P>
<P>
   HUD normally investigates apartment complexes and rental housing
rather than owner-occupied single-family dwellings like Country
Place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something completely new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The management company for Country Place has cited the need to
comply with federal legislation called the Housing for Older
Persons Act as the reason the community's age restriction rule must
be enforced against the women.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that law allows a senior community to have up to 20
percent of its residents younger than 55.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has inflamed the passions of some residents, including
Virginia Ling.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Country Place resident, Ling said her husband had to
grab her by the arm at a restaurant when she became angry with a
woman dinner companion who voiced support for evicting under-age
widows in the senior community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to punch her lights out,'' said Ling. ``I looked
at her _ and this woman's a widow _ and I said to her, `What about
compassion? Are you crazy?' They don't have an answer for that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The people who were opposed to that,'' President Clinton said
of his police subsidy, ``they practically  &UR; swole &LR;  up and died when
it was passed.'' In another gibe at Republican budgeteers, he said
they had ``totally  &UR; bumfuzzled &LR; '' American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for followers of Clintonian syntax and vocabulary,
this winter's Christmas book list for word mavens has entries that
help explicate the president's remarks. ( &UR; Explicate &LR;  has a learned
connotation, meaning ``to analyze in detail'';  &UR; elucidate &LR;  means
``to illuminate, especially by an illustration''; the more general
term, which I should have used, is  &UR; explain &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   ``Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language,'' by Steven
Pinker (Basic Books, $26), offers a deliciously erudite, if
somewhat grainy, glass of Metamucil for the legion of English
speakers troubled by irregular verbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Pinker's world, our brains hold irregular verbs in memory.
The past tense of  &UR; eat &LR;  is not  &UR; eated &LR;  but  &UR; ate &LR; . Gotta remember
that. But all the other past and other tenses we form from regular
verbs ( &UR; walk-walked &LR; ,  &UR; elucidate-elucidated &LR; ) abide by rules of
syntax hard-wired in our heads. From this he constructs a theory of
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irregular forms like  &UR; break-broke &LR;  are memorized,'' he tells
me; ``regular forms like  &UR; smash-smashed &LR;  are generated on the fly
by a rule.'' So here am I, with my swelled head, wondering where
Clinton came up with  &UR; swole &LR;  instead of the regular past tense,
 &UR; swelled &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Swole &LR;  used to be the past tense of  &UR; swell &LR; ,'' Pinker
explains. ``Many Southern U.S. dialects preserve obsolete irregular
forms like  &UR; drag-drug &LR;  and  &UR; help-holp &LR; .'' But as most other
children forget the memorized irregularities, the verb turns
regular _ and the past tense of  &UR; drag &LR;  is no longer  &UR; drug &LR;  but
 &UR; dragged &LR; , of  &UR; help &LR;  no longer  &UR; holp &LR;  but  &UR; helped &LR;  and of  &UR; swell &LR; 
no longer  &UR; swole &LR;  but  &UR; swelled &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Swole &LR;  is interesting for another reason,'' Pinker says.
``The stem has survived in Standard English in the participle and
adjective form  &UR; swollen &LR; .'' Curious: As the irregular  &UR; swell &LR;  wore
down to regular, thanks to generations of forgetful children, the
past-tense form lost the vowel change from  &UR; e &LR;  to  &UR; o &LR;  while the
past participle has preserved it ( &UR; swell, swelled, swollen &LR; ). This
insight gets a linguist all puffed up.
</P>
<P>
   For a little help on the presidential  &UR; bumfuzzled &LR; , we turn to
another author: Allan Metcalf, in ``The World in So Many Words''
(Houghton Mifflin, $19). One of the words he explicates is the
related  &UR; bamboozle &LR; , which first appeared on the London stage in
Colley Cibber's 1702 hit, ``She Wou'd, and She Wou'd Not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cibber's character worries about ``Sham proofs, that they
propos'd to  &UR; bamboozle &LR;  me with.'' As Metcalf notes, Jonathan Swift
in The Tatler No. 230 complains about ``certain words invented by
some pretty fellows ... some of which are now struggling for the
vogue,'' like  &UR; phizz &LR;  for physiognomy or face,  &UR; sham &LR; ,  &UR; bubble &LR; ,
 &UR; bully &LR; ,  &UR; banter &LR;  and  &UR; bamboozle &LR; , the last meaning ``to trick, to
confuse.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bumfuzzle &LR;  and its variant  &UR; bumfuddle &LR;  (influenced by
 &UR; befuddle &LR; ) mean the same: ``to confuse deliberately.'' The
Dictionary of American Regional English tracked it to a 1905 Ozarks
usage, which is home country for Clinton; the Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang makes the leap to the year
before, in ``The Villagers,'' by Oliver B. Limerick: ``Hezekiah
tumbled to the fact that he had been  &UR; bumfuzzled &LR; .'' Despite Dean
Swift's disapproval, the variant of Cibber's slang term lives on in
today's White House.
</P>
<P>
   Other books that make gifts of gab this holiday season:
</P>
<P>
   Not a language book, but mightily bethumped with words, is
``Shakespeare in Charge: The Bard's Guide to Leading and Succeeding
on the Business Stage,'' by Norman Augustine and Kenneth Adelman
(Talk Miramax Books, which sounds more like an exhortation than the
name of a publisher, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   This guide to corporate clambering-up draws on the greatest
plays for instruction _ ``None will sweat but for promotion,'' says
Orlando in ``As You Like It'' _ and time spent on a book that
brings executives to iambic pentameter is not out of joint.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Memories of the Great and the Good'' (Pavilion, $24.95),
Alistair Cooke, the literate and impeccably grammatical voice of
America to Britain for the past 50 years, uses a word in his
introduction that exemplifies his prose: ``There is another
prejudice, or  &UR; postjudice &LR;  rather, that may have conditioned my
choice of heroes and heroines.''
</P>
<P>
   This word for the rejection of ``the urge to pry into the
sexuality, preferably kinky,'' of Cooke's subjects was coined by
the critic John Ruskin in 1886. A generation later, G.K. Chesterton
defined  &UR; postjudice &LR;  as ``not the bias before the fair trial, but
the bias that remains after.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be learned in reading Cooke's fluid
recollections of the famous people he has covered, from George
Bernard Shaw to Erma Bombeck _ not the least that it is worth the
effort to make one's prose appear effortless.
</P>

<P>
   Nuke 'Em
</P>
<P>
   In a generally upbeat review of George W. Bush's maiden
interview on ``Meet the Press,'' I zinged him on his pronunciation
of the word  &UR; nuclear &LR; . A half-dozen times he said
``NU-ky(SCHWA)-ler'' rather than the correct NU-klee-er or
NYOO-klee-er.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he can't pronounce  &UR; nuclear &LR; ,'' writes Joseph Friend
from cyberspace, ``he is a shoe-in in as much as neither can Carter
and Clinton. Must be a requirement of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographers have noticed this phenomenon. ``Though
disapproved of by many,'' goes a usage note in Merriam-Webster's
10th Collegiate ($24.95), ``pronunciations ending in -ky(SCHWA)-ler
have been found in widespread use among educated speakers including
scientists, lawyers, professors ... and at least one U.S. president
((Eisenhower, Carter)) and vice president ((Mondale, Quayle)).''
Scholarly elucidations of the cause of this mispronunciation will
be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Friend's ``shoe-in,'' by the way, is properly spelled  &UR; shoo-in &LR; .
The colloquial verb  &UR; to shoo &LR;  means ``to gently urge in a desired
direction.'' The racetrack term  &UR; shoo-in &LR; , meaning ``certain
winner,'' is rooted in a fraudulent practice of corrupt jockeys:
They agree to bet on one long shot, holding back their own mounts,
and chase in or  &UR; shoo in &LR;  the horse they picked to win.
</P>
<P>
   To mix political racing metaphors:  &UR; Dark horses &LR;  dispute that
the  &UR; front-runner &LR;  is a  &UR; shoo-in &LR; , no matter how he pronounces
 &UR; nuclear &LR; .

AFTER 70 YEARS, A SMOOTHER TRIP TO THE SOUTH POLE  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventy years ago last week, Adm. Richard E. Byrd became the
first person to fly over the South Pole, in a Ford tri-motor
aircraft that had a cruising speed of about 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd had to navigate by sighting the sun, because the effects of
the magnetic pole made his compasses useless.
</P>
<P>
   And because his plane could not land at the pole, he simply
dropped an American flag to prove he had made it to 90 degrees
south latitude.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary of Byrd's flight, a crew from the New York
Air National Guard flew a ski-equipped LC-130 aircraft on a supply
mission to the pole. The New York Guard is the only military
organization that flies ski-equipped aircraft. But its planes can
fly at 250 mph, 26,000 feet up, and carry computers, satellite
links, radar and a gyroscope.
</P>
<P>
   When the crew members landed, they could stay in the buildings
of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole base, where the galley has won
renown for having ``the best food on the continent.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adrift above the Earth, the eye to the universe is
closed. But if all goes according to plan, the Hubble Space
Telescope, a window through which humans have viewed the edges of
space for almost a decade, will soon be reawakened by the nudging,
gloved hands of astronauts replacing and repairing the failed inner
works that forced it into hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as NASA still struggles to understand the silence
from Mars where the Mars Polar Lander was scheduled to touch down
on Friday, the space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to blast off on
a mission to restore the observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope has been shut down since Nov. 13, when its
precision pointing system failed and the observatory went dormant.
</P>
<P>
   During the mission, scheduled to last almost 10 days, Discovery
is to dock with Hubble 300 miles above Earth. Astronauts then
expect to move the telescope into the cargo bay where repairs are
to be made during four six-and-a-half-hour spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is to replace all six gyroscopes, rapidly spinning
devices that use their momentum to stabilize the spacecraft and
help it aim at distant targets. Since February, Hubble had been
getting by on just three gyroscopes, which is the minimum, until
this month, when another failed.
</P>
<P>
   With only two working gyroscopes, the telescope went into a
``safe mode'' to await repairs. It closed its aperture door to
protect its optics and instruments and aligned its solar panels to
the Sun to assure adequate power.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble, which cost $2 billion, was launched in 1990 and,
despite problems with a defective main mirror, has become one of
the most important telescopes in history.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into space from above the obscuring effects of the
Earth's atmosphere, the 12.5-ton observatory has given astronomers
an unprecedented look at colliding galaxies, star formation and the
remnants of events that occurred early in the history of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has spent $1 billion maintaining and operating Hubble since
it was launched, including developing corrective optics for its
flawed mirror, making second-generation instruments to replace
older ones and sending space shuttles to maintain and repair the
observatory in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A third service mission had been scheduled for June 2000, but
NASA decided in March that it would move up some of the maintenance
because of the deteriorating gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Weiler, associate administrator for space science at
NASA, said the agency decided to schedule an earlier mission to
minimize the loss of observation time with Hubble, which has a
backlog of assignments.
</P>
<P>
   If repairs by the Discovery crew succeed, officials said, Hubble
will lose about a month of observation time compared with at least
seven months if the agency had stayed with the original schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To complete all of the maintenance that had been planned for the
flight in June, NASA has scheduled a mission for May 2001, which
will include major upgrades of Hubble's instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's flight was originally scheduled for mid-October, but
the mission had been delayed because of assorted problems. A series
of electrical wiring problems required extensive inspection and
repairs, and shuttle managers decided to replace one of Discovery's
three main engines because of an accident while the craft ws being
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program director, said the agency
has set Dec. 14 as the last date to launch the mission this year.
NASA does not want to be flying on New Year's Day because of the
threat of any possible computer problems caused by the Year 2000
date change. While the agency has tested its computers and
software, Dittemore said, ``It is prudent not to fly if we don't
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew members said delays in the launching have provided
additional time to train. Keith Johnson, who is in charge of
spacewalk training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the
astronauts were able to complete 10 hours of training in an
underwater tank for each hour the job takes in space.
</P>
<P>
   The mission commander, Lt. Col. Curtis Brown, a veteran of five
shuttle flights, said approaching and grabbing Hubble might be more
difficult now that it has been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after launching, Brown and Lt. Cmdr. Scott Kelly, the
mission pilot making his first shuttle flight, will guide Discovery
up to Hubble from below.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the astronauts would not know how the observatory was
positioned until they saw it. If Hubble is drifting, he said,
Discovery may approach the observatory from the wrong end or from
the side, requiring the pilots to maneuver more than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes Scott's and my job a little more interesting because
we get to do some more flying around,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Discovery is in position, Jean-Francois Clervoy of France,
a veteran of two previous flights, would use a 50-foot robotic arm
to grab the observatory and lower it into a docking module in
Discovery's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   Clervoy, who is the chief robot arm operator, would then assist
repair teams from inside the shuttle as well as control the release
of Hubble when the mission was completed.
</P>
<P>
   If Discovery takes off as planned on Saturday at 12:13 a.m. ET,
the shuttle should grab Hubble early Monday and lock it in the
cargo bay. The spacewalks are scheduled to begin at about 7 p.m. on
four successive days, beginning that Monday evening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first spacewalk is to be done by Steven Smith, a veteran of
two previous flights, including the 1997 mission to work on Hubble,
and John Grunsfeld, also a veteran of two missions. The team plans
to replace three Rate Sensor Units, each of which contains two of
the crucial gyroscopes. It also plans to install
voltage/temperature improvement kits to protect Hubble's six
batteries from overcharging and overheating when the observatory is
in safe mode and not using much power.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Foale, a veteran of five shuttle flights and of a
four-month stay on the Russian space station, Mir, in 1997, and
Claude Nicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut who flew on the
first Hubble service mission in 1993 and on two other shuttle
flights, expect to conduct the second walk. This team plans to
replace the telescope's central computer with one that is 20 times
as fast and has six times as much memory. The astronauts also
expect to swap one of Hubble's three Fine Guidance Sensors for an
improved version that should enhance the observatory's pointing and
measurement capability.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld are scheduled for the third walk during
which they are to replace a radio transmitter and swap a tape
recorder that stores data on reels for a faster, solid-state model
that stores information on computer chips. The astronauts also are
to upgrade other electronics and begin reinforcing the telescope's
thermal covering.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth spacewalk, Foale and Nicollier plan to do more
work on Hubble's outer insulation and coverings, found during the
1997 mission to be damaged and deteriorating because of exposure to
sunlight and to small amounts of atomic oxygen. The astronauts are
to attach stainless steel sheets covered with a thermal coating
over existing insulation on Hubble's exterior surface.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ham, the flight director for the mission at the Johnson
Space Center, said the effort would be considered a success if the
crew completed all the tasks of the first two spacewalks, including
leaving a complete set of working gyroscopes. The work of the last
two spacewalks would be a bonus, Ms. Ham said, and would relieve
the workload on the next service flight.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said the mission would cost about $205 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Leckrone, senior project scientist for Hubble, said
the telescope should be back in action within three weeks to a
month after the mission. ``We can't wait to get it back online,''
he said.

 &HT;    SHE'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS _ BUT WHICH ONE?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ 'Tis the season for conflicting roles.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton held the first lady's traditional press
preview Monday of a White House bedecked for Christmas, but Topic A
was her untraditional campaign for a New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were less interested in Mrs. Clinton's descriptions of
this year's holiday gingerbread houses than when she move into her
new $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   (As always, though, the journalistic horde seemed most
interested in the White House buffet tables laden with shrimp, baby
lamb chops, crab cakes, sushi, fruitcake, cookies, pastries and
potent egg nog.)
</P>
<P>
   The annual tour by the first lady opens a season of almost
continuous holiday activities at the White House, but this year
promises to be different.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mrs. Clinton will miss Wednesday's ceremony to
light the national Christmas tree so that she can attend a New York
event sponsored by an Irish-American magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the first lady
said she is already ``pulling things out of storage'' for her new
house at 15 Old School Lane an affluent New York suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to begin moving things in later this month,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mostly trying to use what I have'' rather than getting new
furniture, she said. ``I may have to buy some things, but I'm
trying to be really clear about what I do have and get those in the
best possible shape.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said the Clintons will ``certainly'' spend
Christmas in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our favorite time of the year,'' she said. ``There isn't
any more wonderful place to celebrate the holidays than here at the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's White House decoration theme is ``Holiday
Treasures,'' which has a double meaning, said Mrs. Clinton. First,
the nostalgic ornaments, wreaths, mantelpieces and decorated trees
harken back to the nation's cultural and historic legacy. Second,
they highlight a White House millennium project to save and restore
``enduring symbols of American tradition that define us as a
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``American Treasure'' decorative pieces, for example,

 &HT;    SHE'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS _ BUT WHICH ONE?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ 'Tis the season for conflicting roles.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton held the first lady's traditional press
preview Monday of a White House bedecked for Christmas, but Topic A
was her untraditional campaign for a New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were less interested in Mrs. Clinton's descriptions of
this year's holiday gingerbread houses than when she move into her
new $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   (As always, though, the journalistic horde seemed most
interested in the White House buffet tables laden with shrimp, baby
lamb chops, crab cakes, sushi, fruitcake, cookies, pastries and
potent egg nog.)
</P>
<P>
   The annual tour by the first lady opens a season of almost
continuous holiday activities at the White House, but this year
promises to be different.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mrs. Clinton will miss Wednesday's ceremony to
light the national Christmas tree so that she can attend a New York
event sponsored by an Irish-American magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the first lady
said she is already ``pulling things out of storage'' for her new
house at 15 Old School Lane an affluent New York suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to begin moving things in later this month,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mostly trying to use what I have'' rather than getting new
furniture, she said. ``I may have to buy some things, but I'm
trying to be really clear about what I do have and get those in the
best possible shape.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said the Clintons will ``certainly'' spend
Christmas in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our favorite time of the year,'' she said. ``There isn't
any more wonderful place to celebrate the holidays than here at the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's White House decoration theme is ``Holiday
Treasures,'' which has a double meaning, said Mrs. Clinton. First,
the nostalgic ornaments, wreaths, mantelpieces and decorated trees
harken back to the nation's cultural and historic legacy. Second,
they highlight a White House millennium project to save and restore
``enduring symbols of American tradition that define us as a
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``American Treasure'' decorative pieces, for example,
are replicas of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and the 1973
Bartow County Courthouse in Cartersville, Ga. A model of the 1905
Wright Flyer III from Dayton, Ohio, is another of these treasures.
</P>
<P>
   This year's gingerbread creation is a ``confectionery tribute''

ADVANCE OF SPRAWL IS QUICKENING, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite some progress in conservation, the nation's privately
held cropland, forests, soil and wetlands continue to give way to
development and erosion, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is
reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking findings of the agency's natural
resources inventory, a statistical snapshot produced at 5-year
intervals starting in 1982, is that the rate at which farmland and
forests are being lost to urban, suburban and small-town
development is quickening.
</P>
<P>
   More land was developed between 1992 and 1997 than in the entire
decade from 1982 to 1992 _ 16 million acres compared with 13.9
million _ according to the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being released at a one-day meeting on
conservation of private lands being held in Ames, Iowa, by
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Private property accounts for about 75 percent of the nation's
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Land was converted to development at a rate of a little over 3
million acres a year from 1992 to 1997, more than double the rate
from 1982 to 1992. And while development is usually thought of in
connection with suburban sprawl, officials said it was now a
prominent feature in small and medium-sized cities. ``It is as
significant an issue in Des Moines (Iowa) as it is in the New York
metropolitan area,'' said James Lyons, the undersecretary of
agriculture for natural resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
   Built-up areas accounted, overall, for 7 percent of total
private lands in 1997, up from 5 percent in 1982. The biggest
impact of development is on forests, Lyons said in a telephone
interview, with more than 6 million acres of forest cleared for
development between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lyons said, established metropolitan areas are losing
their trees even as the urban fringe surges outward. About 37
percent of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, for instance,
was covered by trees in 1973, according to a separate study, but
only 13 percent were covered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing those trends elsewhere,'' said Lyons. ``If you
combine rapid expansion with deforestation of these urban and
suburban areas, the quality of life we've come to appreciate is
changing dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside built-up areas, the picture on forests is more
encouraging. Overall, according to the national inventory, private
forestland increased somewhat from 1982 to 1997, by 800,000 acres,
continuing a long-term reforestation trend in some parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But cropland declined by 13 million acres, pastureland by 14
million acres and rangeland by 12 million acres. Cropland in 1997
accounted for 25 percent of the 1.5 billion acres of private land,
forests and rangeland for 27 percent each and pastureland for 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial gains have been made in restoring or creating
wetlands on agricultural lands, according to the inventory, with
30,000 acres a year added from 1992 to 1997, compared with only
4,000 acres a year from 1982 to 1992. But at the same time, wetland
losses on farmland increased to about 54,000 acres a year,
continuing a long-term net loss. About a third of the loss resulted
from development of farmland, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Soil erosion on farmland has been reduced by about 38 percent
since 1982, according to the survey, but the reduction has leveled
off since 1995. Almost 2 billion tons of soil is lost to erosion,
according to the inventory. Thirty percent of the nation's farmland
was reported to be eroding excessively.
</P>
<P>
   For the panoply of renewable natural resources as a whole, said
Lyons, ``while we've made tremendous strides in conservation, we
are at the point where we are figuratively and literally losing
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In another trend identified by the inventory, agricultural
irrigation has declined in the West, where a drier climate has
historically made it more prevalent, but has grown in the East.
Irrigated land has declined by about 1.5 million acres in the West
and expanded by about a million acres in the East in the last 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, said Lyons, ``we're setting ourselves up for a
potential fight over water not unlike what is thought of as the war
in the West over water.''

ROME PREPARES FOR ITS JUBILEE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 12) 
(jt) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ With its traffic-clogged ancient lanes, Rome is never,
even under the best of circumstances, an easy place to maneuver,
except perhaps on foot.
</P>
<P>
   But the coming Jubilee year _ when Rome and the Vatican expect
millions of visitors to celebrate the start of Christianity's third
millennium _ promises to make mobility even more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge confronts not only Rome but other parts of Italy
as well. Many of the expected visitors will flow in by bus, car,
train and plane from around Europe, straining highways, airports
and rail systems. The new airport at Malpensa serving Milan,
northern Italy's commercial and business center, continues to
suffer teething problems. An investment program to expand the
capacity of Fiumicino airport in Rome, though well under way, will
not be complete by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is lingering highway disruption. Though the
Tauern Tunnel in Austria, on a major north-south route linking
southern Germany and northern Austria with Italy, reopened in
August after extensive repairs made necessary by a tunnel fire in
May, the even more crucial Mont Blanc Tunnel between France and
Italy has been closed since March after dozens of people died in a
fire. It is not expected to reopen before early 2001. That will
force drivers from France and parts of Switzerland to seek
alternative routes, such as the Alpine passes in northern Italy,
which can be impassable in winter. Yet attractive choices exist for
those who come by train, including new high-speed Swiss Cisalpino
trains linking Geneva and Zurich to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the transportation challenge as great as in Rome
itself. In 1996, the Italian government allocated $1.7 billion,
partly to beautify the city, but mainly to improve public
transport. Some projects, like doubling the size of a tunnel under
the Janiculum Hill, are designed to improve car and bus traffic.
But much of the spending has been aimed at reducing the number of
vehicles in the historic center and increasing public options.
Rome's mayor, Francesco Rutelli, estimated recently that by Jan. 1
roughly 90 percent of the improvements will be complete. Some will
mean little for many visitors. The city vaunts several new cycling
routes for those brave or foolish enough to challenge Rome's
traffic on two wheels, including one near the Villa Borghese. Along
the Via Appia, the ancient Roman road leading out of the city to
the south, the beltway circling Rome known as the Raccordo Anulare,
which once severed the Via Appia like a knife a salami into two
sections, has been put underground in a two-mile tunnel, enabling
hikers along the route to enjoy its antiquities both within and
outside the beltway.
</P>
<P>
   For getting around Rome, there are numerous improvements. The
train line that connects Fiumicino airport with city subway
stations and the main rail terminal at Termini is being beefed up
by the addition of double-decker train cars and more frequent
departures. For motorists, 24 new parking lots marked ``Parcheggi
di Scambio,'' a kind of park-and-ride arrangement, have been built
to enable drivers to switch to public transport. In the center,
several bus lines now feature express as well as local buses that
are marked with a prominent E. On 25 different routes, buses
designated by small owls perched atop the bus-stop signs are being
added that will run, although at less frequent intervals, through
the night. In the historic center, three lines with small electric
buses ferry passengers through some of the narrowest streets.
</P>
<P>
   For easier access to the Vatican museums, travelers can now take
the subway's A Line, which passes Termini station and stops at such
central locations as Piazza Barberini and the Spanish Steps, to
continue on to a new station at the Via Cipro, a five-minute walk
from the museums. One of the most useful offerings is a bus line
called La Linea delle Basiliche, or the Major Basilicas Tour, that
will start at the end of this year. When fully operational, silver
buses marked Major Basilicas Tour will link four important
basilicas _ Santa Maria degli Angeli, or St. Mary of the Angels,
St. John Lateran, St. Peter's and St. Paul Outside the Walls _ that
the church requires Holy Year pilgrims to visit to obtain special
Jubilee indulgences. The buses will make 80 stops along the way,
and the 75-minute trip will cost about $8, at 1,860 lire to $1.
There will be a 20-minute stop at St. John's, St. Peter's and St.
Paul's, and riders will be able to get on and off the bus as often
as they wish within the day.
</P>
<P>
   Among the easiest ways to obtain information on getting around
Rome is to ask at hotels or drop by one of the new dark-green
octagonal information booths sprouting up in town. An
English-language Web site, www.atac.roma.it/trasroma/indexuk.htm,
is now available from Rome's municipal transport authority. It
offers extensive information, including a search feature for
plotting trips anywhere in the city.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The front that brought rain to areas near the Atlantic seaboard
Monday will shift offshore Tuesday. Rain will gradually end in
northern and eastern Maine during the midday and afternoon. The
precipitation may change to snow before ending in extreme northern
Maine as increasing winds from the north import colder air. In the
wake of the front, most of the East Coast states will be dry and
cooler as high pressure arrives from the Middle West. Clouds will
linger near the northern Appalachians, while areas farther south
have plentiful sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and mild weather will cover the Plains and Mississippi
Valley. Onshore breezes will promote some clouds near the western
Gulf of Mexico while most of the central and southern Plains have
abundant sunshine. Farther north across the Plains and Great Lakes,
sunshine will be dimmed by clouds as the returning mild air is
forced to rise over cooler air in place over these regions.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will spread over the Northwest as a cold front moves
into the interior. Moist winds from over the Pacific will continue
to ascend west-facing mountain slopes, resulting in intermittent
snow from the southern Cascades and northern Sierra to the northern
Rockies. Showers will linger near the coast, but clouds will break
across parts of eastern Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a potent jet stream disturbance will begin to
energize low pressure over southern Utah. As a result, locally
heavy mountain snow will spread from Utah Tuesday to northern
Arizona and western Colorado Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: White Danger
</P>
<P>
   There was a high risk of avalanches above 6,000 feet in the
Cascades Monday. During the weekend, snow that fell in the upper
slopes had relatively low density owing to the chilly conditions
that prevailed. Early Monday, as increasing Pacific winds carried
mild ocean air inland, snow became wetter and mixed with rain in
some areas. The added weight of rain and wet snow put stress on
lighter, underlying snow, heightening the risk that the snow would
give way and slide down the mountains. The danger should ebb
Tuesday as winds abate and colder air returns to the region.

</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY
</P>
<P>
   ``SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER''
</P>
<P>
   A stage version of the quintessential disco movie sounds like a
bad idea. In many respects, it is. The singing and acting leave
little to recommend. But disco was about dancing, shaking one's
groove thang, and the exciting choreography almost makes up for the
show's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. With all these songs to fit in, the story doesn't
examine relationships between characters as fully as the movie,
especially the one between Tony Manero (James Carpinello) and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Carpinello was obviously cast because he wowed the auditioners
with his deadpan impersonation of John Travolta, but he never makes
the character his own. The standout performance is by Orfeh as
Annette, the girl in love with Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members were digging the show, though, probably because
it hits a nostalgia button. The Bee Gees' music actually translates
well to being sung by a chorus. If you want great theater, don't
see ``Saturday Night Fever.'' But if you think ``You Should Be
Dancing,'' go. Its biggest strength is that it doesn't pretend to
be anything more than fun.
</P>
<P>
   (Indefinite run at the Minskoff Theatre, 200 W. 45th St.
$30-$80. Ticketmaster.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``MARIE CHRISTINE''
</P>
<P>
   Michael John LaChiusa's musical about a Creole woman in 1894 who
plays with voodoo and whose passion leads her to unthinkable acts
is one of the best shows playing. Unfortunately, it won't last.
</P>
<P>
   Freely adapted from ``Medea,'' ``Marie'' is dark in almost every
respect. The music is spare and sad, most of the costumes are
black, and the spectacle-free set is bare-bones: a raked area on
one side, bleachers on the other. In an interesting staging
decision, most of the cast members (chorus and minor players) sit
still in the bleachers and watch the action in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Tony winner Audra McDonald beautifully captures the
drama and pathos of the title character. Her personal chorus is a
trio of women who, when not on stage, sit in the first row of the
audience. Although all the performances are first rate, Mary Testa
gets a chance to scene-steal as Magdalena. But like ``Parade'' and
other beautifully staged but gloomy works, ``Marie Christine'' is
not going to find itself a hit with audiences who come to New York
looking to be wowed by helicopters or falling chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   (Indefinite run at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theatre, 150
W. 65th St. $40-$75. Telecharge.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``KISS ME, KATE''
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about the plethora of musical revivals is that
producers have been picking from the best and giving them
big-budget star treatment. For proof, see the previous two Tony
winners for best musical revival, ``Cabaret'' and ``Annie Get Your
Gun.'' Both are still thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' has not been
produced on Broadway since its 1948 opening. There is much to laud
about the staging and performances in this show, based on
Shakespeare's ``Taming of the Shrew,'' in which actors are actually
performing a musical production of ``Shrew.'' Leads Brian Stokes
Mitchell (Fred/Petruchio) and Marin Mazzie (Lili/Katharine) achieve
intense chemistry. Mazzie's extraordinary vocal talents mirror the
immense range she gives to her character. She's vulnerable in ``So
in Love'' and brilliantly comedic in ``I Hate Men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also fine performances from supporting cast members
Amy Spranger as the ditzy Lois Lane/Bianca and Michael Berresse as
Bill/Hortensio. The dance numbers are arresting, especially the Act
2 opener, ``Too Darn Hot.'' Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   (Indefinite run at the Martin Beck Theatre, 302 W. 45th St.
$20-$85. Telecharge.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``PUTTING IT TOGETHER''
</P>
<P>
   A revival of sorts, this Stephen Sondheim review played
off-Broadway in 1994. But the first production didn't have Carol
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   (Notice it's spelled review, not revue, because, as player
Bronson Pinchot explains at the onset: ``Sondheim wants you to
think. If you don't want to think, go see `Cats.' '')
</P>
<P>
   The premise here is that five guests, the Wife (Burnett), the
Husband (George Hearn), the Younger Man (John Barrowman), the
Younger Woman (Ruthie Henshall) and the Observer (Pinchot), are at
a cocktail party. Through 31 Sondheim tunes _ from ``Everyday a
Little Death'' from ``A Little Night Music,'' to ``Sooner or
Later'' from ``Dick Tracy'' _ the characters fight, fall in love,
reminisce and find catharsis. You couldn't have this much drama if
you strung together nothing but ``showstopper'' tunes, a la Andrew
Lloyd Webber.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Laugh In''-esque set is playful, and Burnett is a terrific
entertainer, but with the exception of Henshall, the cast rarely
matches the brilliance, darkness or rich layers of Sondheim's
music. Pinchot finally comes through with a rousing ``Buddy's
Blues'' (from ``Follies''), and the company hits a high note with
``The Ladies Who Lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   See ``Together'' for Burnett's inimitable stage presence, but
skip it if you idolize Sondheim enough to know all the ways it
could be better put together.
</P>
<P>
   (Indefinite run at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, 243 W. 47th St.
$30-$85. Telecharge.)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``KAT AND THE KINGS''
</P>
<P>
   Here's an odd one: a musical transplant from Cape Town, South
Africa. David Kramer and Taliep Petersen's show is about a singing
and dancing group that, against an apartheid backdrop, thirsts for
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hector plays Kat Diamond, now retired from the biz and
narrating as he looks back at his younger self (played by Jody J.
Abrahams) and his partners, three male and one female. Set in the
1950s, the original music is a mirror of American rock 'n' roll,
with the troupe performing routines that echo Ritchie Valens, The
Platters and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   The performers distinguish themselves as dancers and singers,
but the acting will come across as over-the-top and sometimes
melodramatic to American audiences. You'll likely walk away feeling
thoroughly entertained, but not moved.
</P>
<P>
   (Indefinite run at the Cort Theatre, 138 W. 48th St. $45-$75.
Telecharge.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RAINMAKER''
</P>
<P>
   Musicals aren't the only stage shows that are revived. Broadway
mounted Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' and Arthur Miller's
``Death of a Salesman'' this year; Miller's ``The Price'' is
currently running. Coming soon are revisits to Peter Shaffer's
``Amadeus,'' Anton Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' and O'Neill's ``A Moon
for the Misbegotten.''
</P>

   ``The Rainmaker'' is N. Richard Nash's 1954 play about a scam
artist (Woody Harrelson, in his first starring role on Broadway)
who comes to a drought-stricken Midwestern town in 1936. Director
Scott Ellis gets fine turns from the actors, especially Jayne
Atkinson as the woman who thinks she will never marry because she
is plain-looking. The weak spot is, sadly, Harrelson. There's a
good reason he's a screen actor _ he doesn't have much stage
presence. And yes, his character, Bill Starbuck, initially promises
what he knows he can't provide _ rain _ but Harrelson doesn't give
him much heart. Throughout, he's too much like a snake-oil
salesman, never reaching the necessary catharsis of Nash's script.

   (Through Feb. 6 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, 256 W. 47th St.
$40-$65. Ticketmaster.)

<P>
   ``DAME EDNA: THE ROYAL TOUR''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Barry Humphries brings his longtime alter ego, Dame
Edna Everage, for her first appearance on Broadway. Go see this for
nonstop laughs, but if you're sitting within her eyesight (meaning
the first 15 or so rows), beware. This partially improvised,
hilarious show is constructed around picking on audience members.
She remembers not only the names of all those she has singled out
and where they are sitting, but also the names of their children,
baby sitters, spouses, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Among her/his pranks: bringing a couple on stage to eat a meal
of pasta while she continues talking to the audience, and putting
in a surprise phone call to someone a theatergoer knows. At our
performance, she called the 19-year-old baby sitter of a mother in
attendance.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT''
</P>
<P>
   Writer and monologuist Spalding Gray's career has been almost as
colorful as Dame Edna's. In previous performance pieces such as
``It's a Slippery Slope,'' ``Monster in a Box,'' ``Swimming to
Cambodia'' and ``Gray's Anatomy,'' he exposed every aspect of his
often-untamed lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he has settled down a bit. Married again and with a
young child _ his third _ he has moved the family from Manhattan to
a Victorian house in a bucolic Long Island town. Gray fans might be
a little disappointed in his newfound love of family life, but his
razor-sharp wit and knack for storytelling have not waned.
</P>
<P>
   (Through Jan. 10 at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theatre,
150 W. 65th St. $25-$45. Runs Sunday and Monday nights only.

<P>
   ``GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER, DO!''
</P>
<P>
   Another trend in New York theater has been the frequent staging
of acclaimed new plays by Irish playwrights such as Martin
McDonough (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') and Conor McPherson
(''The Weir,'' ``The Lime-Tree Bower'').
</P>
<P>
   Brian Friel has been around for a while, penning strong scripts
such as ``Translations,'' ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' and
``Philadelphia, Here I Come.'' His latest, ``Give Me Your Answer,
Do!,'' just might be his best.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great playwrights, Friel leans toward in-depth
character study over plot or environment. ``Answer'' concerns an
acclaimed writer whose archives of early work, memoirs and letters
are sought after by a special collection of Irish writers at a
Texas university. In the midst of dealing with this, he has to
worry about money problems and a teen-age daughter who has been
hospitalized with an unnamed illness since childhood. His life
parallels that of a peer _ another writer who will end up in the
collection _ and his father-in-law, a retired blues musician.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this production is first-rate, and boosted by a
dream cast that includes the brilliant Kate Burton (''The Beauty
Queen of Leenane'') John Glover (Tony-winner for his role as twin
brothers in Terrence McNally's ``Love! Valour! Compassion!''), and
multiple Tony-winner Joel Grey (''Cabaret,'' ``Chicago'').
</P>
<P>
   The local theater company that gets rights to this first _ and
it will happen soon _ will have a major coup on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   (Through Jan. 2 at the Gramercy Theatre, 127 E. 23rd St. $55.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Marsha Norman ('''Night,

screenwriting _ she penned the recent TV movie ``Audrey Hepburn.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her playwriting return comes with ``Trudy Blue,'' a noble effort
that might be compared to ``The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.''
Polly Draper (the TV show ``thirtysomething'') plays novelist
Ginger, who seeks refuge from her lung cancer and marital problems
through the heroine of her writings, Trudy Blue (Sarah Knowlton).
The performances are mostly vigorous, but several elements of the
production need to be fine-tuned. (Norman's nonlinear script, for
one.) &QL;

   This show was the most intriguing seen this trip. Shelagh
Stephenson's tight script is reminiscent of Tom Stoppard's

1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The title comes from Joseph Wright's 1797 painting ``An
Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump,'' which depicts a scientist
trying to prove that life cannot exist in a vacuum. He places a
bird in a glass air pump, slowly withdrawing the air and then, when
the bird is near death, revives it by reinserting air. This
symbolizes several themes dealt with in the play, including the
predominant one, science vs. human emotion. Well-acted and nicely
staged, ``Air Pump'' is worth the admission price. &QL;

   This new play by Arlene Hutton has nothing new to say, but it's
endearing nonetheless. Raleigh (Benim Foster) is a young writer
leaving his military duties in the Midwest in 1940. On a train, he
meets May (Alexandra Geis), a naive but sweet girl. During this and
the subsequent two scenes, they fall in love and plan marriage. It
offers a typical feel-good ending, laudable performances and a
minimal set. But not much more. &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT EVADED ANTITRUST LAWS, GOVERNMENT CONTENDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government, responding to a federal judge's
findings in a landmark antirust lawsuit, Monday called Microsoft
Corp. a ``classical example'' of a rogue monopolist that should be
punished under the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Justice Department prosecutors
continued to meet with the software giant's legal team in Chicago
in an all-out drive to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found Nov. 5
that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power, causing harm to
consumers, competitors and other companies. Monday's filing by the
government argued that these ``findings of fact'' could lead to no
other conclusion than that the company committed wholesale
violations of the nation's 110-year-old antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson concurs with the government view, as seems likely,
and if no settlement is reached, then a new phase of the trial
would deal with specific remedies to be imposed, including the
possible breakup of the world's most highly valued company.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Jackson has named Richard Posner, the chief judge of
the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit, as
a private mediator. In a series of meetings at Chicago's plush
Standard Club since Nov. 30, Posner has been searching for ways for
the parties to reach an accord, so far to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended Monday that Jackson's findings
established beyond a doubt that Microsoft committed ``multiple
violations'' of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   The 1890 law, the brief noted, ``prohibits a firm with monopoly
power from maintaining that monopoly power through means that go
beyond competition on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   As the government put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Under those settled principles of monopolization law,
Microsoft's multiple actions to repel promising efforts to lower
the critical barrier to entry into its monopoly market constitute
unlawful maintenance of a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of a case in which a defendant's
possession of substantial market power, combined with his
exclusionary or anticompetitive behavior, threatens to defeat or
forestall the corrective forces of competition and thereby sustain
or extend the defendant's agglomeration of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the schedule set by Jackson, Microsoft is due to file its
written reply to the government brief on Jan. 17. After two further
written rebuttal exchanges, on Jan. 24 and Jan. 31, Jackson will
hear oral arguments on Feb. 22.

   CoxNet will move the following Atlanta Journal-Constitution
stories on the unexpected retirement of Douglas Ivester, chairman
of Coca-Cola
</P>
<P>
   COKE-IVESTER _ ATLANTA _ Douglas Ivester retires unexpectedly as
chairman of Coca-Cola. In a recent interview with The
Journal-Constitition,vester was upbeat about Coca-Cola's prospects.
Earnings, which have been in the tank, were expected to see a
turnaround for the fourth quarter and Ivester expected the company
to double its business in the next eight to 12 months. He recently
restructured his management lineup to streamline decision making.
And the stock was back on its way up after a dismal performance
this year. Given the outlook, it came as a shock to many when he
announced his planned retirement in April 2000, especially since
the 52-year-old would be shy of retirement age, which is 56 at the
company. A look at what may have prompted the decision, including
Ivester's style of management. (Unger, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/COKE_BOARD _ ATLANTA _ All along Coca-Cola's board, including
James Williams and Warren Buffett, have expressed confidence that
Doug Ivester was the man to lead take the company forward. Was
there a concerted effort to get him to change his mind and stay, or
did the board simply thank him his service. A look at board
reaction to the resignation. (Saporta, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COKE-DAFT _ ATLANTA _ While Douglas Daft may not be a name
familiar to many outside Coca-Cola, the native Australian has been
with the company for 30 years. He will be chosen by the Coke board
to replace Ivester as chairman and chief executive officer. In the
interim he will be president and chief operating officer. Ivester
says Daft is ``perfectly suited to lead this company in its
continuing efforts to build value for all its share owners.'' A
look at Daft's background and what may, or may not, make him suited
for the job. (Kempner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COKE-WALLSTREET _Coca-Cola's stock, which had reached a low of
$47 in recent months but had climbed into the high 60s recently,
took a hit after Ivester's announcement. The stock remained down at
midday, and at least one analyst downgraded the stock from ``buy''
to ``neutral.'' A look at Wall Street's reaction to the
announcement. (Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

WAY UP NORTH IN FLORIDA

  (For release Wednesday, Dec. 8)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first so-called ``cold'' front of the season moved through
Southwest Florida recently, setting off the kind of panic one
normally associates with soccer riots or a 2-point dip in the
Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   The local TV stations, dedicated as they are to responsible
journalism, did everything they could to fuel the hysteria. One
forecaster warned viewers that the area was about to be ``gripped''
by the worst cold weather of the year, making it sound as though we
were embarking upon a new Ice Age and woolly mammoths would soon be
seen strolling down Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Another forecaster, whose somber expression reminded me of
Walter Cronkite at the peak of the Cuban missile crisis, warned
viewers that temperatures would ``plummet'' during the night,
leading some of the more easily frightened citizens to conclude
that they would wake up to a world that more closely resembled the
dark side of Pluto than the semitropics.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the forecaster got around to saying that daytime
highs would only ``inch up'' into the mid-60s, most viewers were
ready to chop up their furniture for firewood and strap snow-chains
onto their tires.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that this is a highly competitive business and that
ratings would probably suffer if the forecasters avoided words like
``gripped,'' ``plummet'' and ``frosty'' to describe weather
conditions that most people could compensate for with a light
sweater and a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   (The same philosophy, of course, spills over onto the
blood-splattered news coverage that makes our retirement
communities and mobile-home parks seem as dangerous as East Timor.
Ratings would undoubtedly suffer if the lead story consisted of a
shuffleboard outbreak in Golf Lakes Estates.)
</P>
<P>
   People who visit our area from ``Up North,'' which means any
place north of Tallahassee, think we're nuts, and understandably
so. I moved here 23 years ago from Baltimore County, which is north
of Tallahassee but still not exactly polar-bear country. All it
took was an inch of snow to close schools and most of the major
roads, which was definitely a wise move given the snow-driving
skills of your average Baltimorean.
</P>
<P>
   But even a borderline Northerner like myself was unprepared for
the panic that sets in here during the two or three weeks of the
year that are not bathing-suit weather. For the first few years I
was here, it was all I could do not to shake people by the lapels
and yell, ``It's not that cold! I've gone skinny-dipping in the
ocean in colder weather than this! Of course, I came down with a
terrible respiratory ailment! And a 104-degree fever! Which
eventually deteriorated into pneumonia and landed me in the
hospital! But at least I wasn't a pathetic whiner like you are!
Because I was knocked out on sedatives the whole time! So buck up,
will ya!''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this tactic did little to dissuade my new
neighbors and colleagues from acting like big babies every time the
mercury dipped below 60.
</P>
<P>
   But it's OK now, because over the course of 23 years, you learn
to adjust to these things.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me: The temperature is supposed to plummet into
the mid-50s tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Better check the fuel in the emergency generator and dig out the
thermal underwear.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a frosty one.

   NEW YORK _ The name of the playwright John Guare is nowhere to
be found in the program for the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' which
returned last month, to critical fireworks, for its first
full-scale Broadway production in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Guare, author of ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' played an
important role in revising parts of the musical's book, updating
the character of Harrison Howell, adding a song for the leading
lady in the second act and writing banter at the top of the show.
</P>

   Before reaching the stage, these changes had to be approved by
Lois and Arthur Elias. The couple, who live in Manhattan, were
entrusted with ``Kiss Me, Kate'' by their close friend Bella
Spewack, who wrote the musical's book with her husband, Sam, in
1948 and died at 90 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade the Eliases have been fiercely protective
of this Cole Porter musical based on Shakespeare's ``Taming of the
Shrew,'' insisting that hardly a word be changed and that no writer
_ not even Wendy Wasserstein or Christopher Durang _ take any
credit for the script away from the Spewacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fought for years about the script _ everybody wanted to
rewrite it completely _ and we felt, not only out of loyalty to
Bella and Sam but because it's a good script, that it shouldn't be
rewritten,'' Ms. Elias said. ``I can't tell you how many producers
and writers we have dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it has taken all this time for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' _
which originally opened on Dec. 30, 1948 _ to make its way back to
Broadway as the first major hit of this season.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when revivals are all the rage, the story of the
musical's hesitant return raises the curtain on an obscure, insular
world of rights organizations, estates and family members, all
jealously holding the keys to some of the musical theater's most
valuable treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these holders of rights are widows like Jo Sullivan
Loesser, whose husband, Frank Loesser, wrote ``Guys and Dolls,''
and Rosemary Willson, who guards ``The Music Man,'' which is by her
husband, Meredith Willson, and is due to be revived on Broadway
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Some are appointed executors, like Harry Kraut for the Leonard
Bernstein estate and Robert Montgomery for Porter's. The work of
Rodgers and Hammerstein and Irving Berlin is overseen by the
Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization. The licensing of many theater
properties is handled by Music Theater International, while
Tams-Whitmark Music Library is the agent for several estates,
including the Spewacks'.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to granting the rights to ``first-class''
productions _ meaning shows in large, established theaters _ these
rights holders say they are diligent in making sure the work lands
in safe hands.
</P>
<P>
   And while they cannot see every stock and amateur production _
in churches, summer camps or community theaters _ these
organizations say they find out when licenses have been abused.
Like the time an Atlanta troupe set ``Oklahoma!'' in a 1941
rehearsal room and added scenes about Pearl Harbor. Or the time an
off-Broadway production set ``South Pacific'' in a rehabilitation
ward for Vietnam veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's three performances in a high school or six weeks
in a dinner theater,'' said Bert Fink, a spokesman for the Rodgers
and Hammerstein Organization, ``we take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Several noted that ``Kiss Me, Kate'' was being celebrated for
having been revived largely intact, unlike new interpretations such
as Sam Mendes' gritty ``Cabaret'' or Nicholas Hytner's dark
``Carousel.'' In choreographing the current ``Kate,'' Kathleen
Marshall said she drew on her experience as the artistic director
of the Encores series, which presents concert versions of classic
musicals at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to trust the material,'' Ms. Marshall said. ``To
first say, `Let's use what was there and deviate when necessary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bella Spewack willed all of her intellectual property to Arthur
Elias, now 74, a painter, and Ms. Elias, 73, whom the Spewacks met
on a trip to France in 1961. ``Bella had no children,'' Ms. Elias
said. ``For many, many years, we were her children.''
</P>
<P>
   For the current ``Kate,'' Ms. Elias, who used to work in public
relations, regularly sat in on rehearsals, comparing the original
book with what she saw coming to life onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the cast and the creative team say they wondered
what she was thinking, whether she approved. ``It always made me a
little nervous,'' said Lee Wilkof, who plays one of the gangsters
in the revival. ``I wanted a little reassurance from her, because
she was so familiar with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elias had reason to be initially watchful. She and her
husband had rejected several proposals in the past, feeling they
went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Elias said that one writer whom he would not name rewrote
the book so much that the two gangsters _ whose portrayal received
rave reviews earlier this month _ were taken out. ``We would not
sign a contract where major modifications were made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurned ``Kate'' writers have included Ms. Wasserstein, Durang
and James Lapine, who in addition to revising the book would have
directed the musical, to have been produced by Fran and Barry
Weissler. Lapine said his production fell apart because he couldn't
find a cast before the rights ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein said her proposal some years ago _ which also
had Michael Blakemore, who staged the current revival, attached as
director _ broke down because of the Eliases. ``They were concerned
that I would take credit,'' Ms. Wasserstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Had she moved ahead, Ms. Wasserstein said, one issue she would
have addressed is why the leading lady, Lilli Vanessi, returns in
the end to Fred Graham, the leading man and her former husband,
having left to marry Harrison Howell.
</P>
<P>
   Durang was brought in to work on the script in 1994 by the New
York Shakespeare Festival, which planned to revive the show in
Central Park and then on Broadway, featuring Kevin Kline and Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
</P>
<P>
   The project unraveled, Durang said, because the timing was too
rushed and the Eliases did not feel they had the assurances they
needed. Had he moved forward, Durang said, he planned in part to
flesh out what happened to the production's show within the show
when Lilli quits before intermission. Did she have an understudy,
for example? ``I was sorry our version didn't come together,''
Durang said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eliases said they were not trying to be obstructionist,
merely responsible. ``We had great difficulty over this business of
saying no, because if you say no, there is no production,'' Ms.
Elias said. ``But it has to be the right team.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While revivals are often stymied by casting problems _ the
character of Fred in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' is considered particularly
tough to fill _ rights holders say the book generally proves to be
the greatest stumbling block, particularly with those star-driven
productions of the 1920s and '30s, before the plot-driven musical
defined by ``Oklahoma!'' in 1943 had fully evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Several rights holders talked about producers who have proposed
wholesale changes that make old chestnuts seem downright
avant-garde. ``Sometimes I think we should encourage them to write
their own shows,'' said Kraut of the Bernstein estate.
</P>
<P>
   When a Japanese producer wanted to set ``West Side Story'' in
Tokyo and make the conflict between Koreans and Japanese, Kraut
said, he asked what the producer intended to do with the song
``America.'' ``I never heard back from him,'' Kraut said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kim Kowalke, president of the Kurt Weill
Foundation for Music, said he was practically begging producers to
rethink that German composer's work in contemporary terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had the problem of producers' coming with creative
ideas,'' Kowalke said. One should not attempt to duplicate Weill's
work, he added, ``because you've got a whole different culture
outside the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacle to reviving Weill, Kowalke said, is not only that
his musicals tended to be centered on issues specific to the 1940s
but that audiences today are likely to find Weill strange. ``In the
'40s Broadway was big enough to accommodate about four or five
different strands,'' Kowalke said. ``Nowadays Broadway's much more
homogenized, and it doesn't seem to have those different
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was noted mostly for its updated approach to
American Indians, Peter Stone's revision of Irving Berlin's ``Annie
Get Your Gun'' for Broadway last year also included several
significant structural changes.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is currently revising ``Finian's Rainbow'' and said he
found himself having to ratchet up the story's racial tensions to
make them as shocking as they were when the show was first produced
in 1947. Stone called it ``politically incorrecting something.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should playwrights like Guare, Stone or Durang get involved
in a revival at all? ``The fact of having a musical to play with
was an irresistible joy,'' Guare said. ``There's always that
fantasy of saying, `I know how to fix that show.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Roger Berlind, the producer who initiated the
project, Guare said he was direct with the Eliases about the things
in ``Kate'' that he felt had to be addressed. But Guare also
declined credit and told them he did not want to mess with a good
thing. ``All we wanted to do was let the piece speak for itself,''
he said, ``just invigorating it, not rethinking it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Eliases those were the magic words. ``Arthur and I felt
when we met with him that this was a writer who really valued
another writer's work,'' Ms. Elias said. ``He had no need to
promote himself.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Guare got the green light and, with Blakemore, went to
work. Their main contribution was to enliven the character of
Harrison Howell, Lilli's fiance, changing him from a dull senator
originally modeled on the presidential adviser Bernard Baruch to a
blustery Gen. MacArthur type. The collaborators also added Porter's
song ``From This Moment On,'' for Harrison and Lilli, which was
part of the 1953 MGM movie version of ``Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   They also had to wrestle with the sexism in the play, given that
Kate gets spanked and ends the show with the song ``I Am Ashamed
That Women Are So Simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we say that in 1999 without having every woman in the
audience rise up?'' Guare asked. In adjusting it, he said, he and
Blakemore structured the musical's final moments as a ``coming to
sanity, not a giving up of her being.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most significantly, they added a crucial stage
direction: Lilli winks. ``We wanted to make it a very fair battle
between two lovers,'' Guare said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eliases said their main directive was that Lilli and Fred
clearly adore each other. ``They can't get enough of one another,''
Ms. Elias said. ``If you don't have that, you don't have `Kiss Me,
Kate.''' Her husband added, ``They're both humbled and equalized by
love.''
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, after watching a Harrison Howell scene, Ms.
Elias said she turned to Guare, seated a few rows back, and gave
him a thumbs-up. (Guare said she blew him a kiss.)
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in their tranquil living room a few days later, the
Eliases had nothing but praise for Guare and Blakemore, saying they
could not be happier with how the whole experience turned out. The
show's prospects as a blockbuster seemed almost irrelevant to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been a big success but it was wrong in terms of what
Bella and Sam Spewack wrote,'' Ms. Elias said, ``we would feel as
though we had not been good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how Guare feels about being the invisible hand behind the
hit, he said he had been enjoying his rapidly diminishing
anonymity. He particularly gets a kick when friends rave to him
about the revival, completely unaware of his association with it.
``They say, `We saw the best show last night,''' Guare said. ```You
must see it.'''

 &HT;    GRAHAM: COLOMBIA'S ECONOMIC, DRUG PROBLEMS THREAT TO REGION'S
STABILITY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Colombia, the oldest democracy in South America, is
facing a dual crisis of rising violence and a declining economy,
Sen. Bob Graham warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in violence comes from a new alliance between the
entrenched guerrilla movements and a restructured narcotics
industry, Graham said in a telephone conference with reporters
after a four-day trip that included stops in Haiti, Colombia and
Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The three-term Florida Democrat said illicit drug money pumped
into the guerrilla movements has allowed them to stockpile
armaments and beef up communications making them more deadly than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the once-flourishing Colombian economy has fallen
into a depression with unemployment around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The result: A surge in the number of Colombians seeking to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Bogota told Graham that the number of
Colombians expected to come to the United States this year could be
as high as 350,000, compared to 200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the cooperation between Colombia's drug cartels and
guerrillas has also spurred the country's military to become
involved in fighting narco-traffickers, Graham said. That job
previously had been left primarily to the undermanned Colombian
police forces.
</P>
<P>
   And Colombian President Andres Pastrana has proposed a $7.5
billion economic redevelopment plan for his country. Half of that
money would come from the international community, including $1.5
billion from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Pastrana told him during a breakfast last week that
he has been assured President Clinton would place the aid request
before Congress early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding Colombia is in the United States' vital interest, Graham
said, noting that ``its destabilization has the potential of
affecting the other countries around it,'' particularly Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to visiting Colombia, Graham spent a day in Haiti, which
he described as ``a nation in limbo politically and economically.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of parliamentary elections early next year, Graham
predicted, ``will determine whether it begins to move forward ...
or continues the slide that it has experienced in the last two or
three years.''

 &HT;    Another look at Nat Turner's rebellion
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Horwitz, whose award-winning book ``Confederates in the
Attic'' examined the lingering obsession with the Civil War,
revisits the controversy surrounding Nat Turner and his slave
rebellion in a compelling article in this week's New Yorker ($3).
</P>
<P>
   Turner's rebellion in 1831 in Southampton County, Va., was one
of the bloodiest in history. Armed with broadaxes and other farm
tools, Turner and 60 other slaves slaughtered 57 men, women and
children. Dismissed as a God-crazed madman by some historians,
Turner was the subject of ``The Confessions of Nat Turner,'' a
fiercely debated 1967 novel by William Styron.
</P>
<P>
   Published at the height of the black power movement, Styron's
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was attacked by black leaders. Now,
Horwitz writes, the mood has changed, and Spike Lee is interested
in filming the book to show a more complete portrait of Turner.
Some of the violence, however, may be hard to stomach, Lee notes.
``We're not going to have Nat Turner Happy Meals at McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Images of a generation: In an impressive 256-page issue,
Rolling Stone ($4.95) presents a fascinating collection of some of
the greatest images of music and culture from the past
half-century. Many photographs will be familiar, but others have
never been published. Among the most memorable pictures are Barron
Wolman's 1967 shot of the Grateful Dead on the front porch of its
Ashbury Street residence in San Francisco after a drug raid; Janis
Joplin slumped on a couch with a bottle of Southern Comfort
backstage at Winterland in San Francisco; B.B. King, John Lee
Hooker and the late Willie Dixon relaxing at the pool at the Sunset
Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles in 1991; and Annie Leibovitz's 1972
shot of Tom Wolfe _ before he began wearing his traditional white
suit _ posing at Cape Kennedy while researching ``The Right
Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best list: In a special year-end issue, Spin ($2.99) names
Atlanta rap group TLC's ``No Scrubs'' as single of the year. Album
of the year goes to Nine Inch Nails for ``The Fragile,'' and Rage
Against the Machine takes top honors as band of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wireless wonders: According to a U.S. News &AMP; World Report
($3.50) poll, many Americans are frustrated with their computers.
Millions of PCs apparently are stashed away in closets or in dusty
corners because their owners consider them too complicated. What
consumers are looking for, the magazine reports, are easier ways to
tap into the Internet and communicate with each other. This trend
is already evident in Finland, where technology guru Mato Valtonen
(former lead singer of the Leningrad Cowboys) has developed WapIT,
a new system that allows mobile phones to tap into the Internet.
Users can check sports results and the latest musical releases and
even download the joke of the day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Battle of Seattle: Newsweek ($3.50) reflects on the protests
in Seattle over the World Trade Organization meeting and predicts
more demonstrations from this odd coalition of environmentalists,
labor activists and '60s liberals, all organized via the Internet.
Weighing in on the issue in Time ($3.50), columnist Charles
Krauthammer criticizes the protesters as kooks. These are some of
the same people who opposed military intervention in El Salvador
and Nicaragua because they insisted the problem was one of poverty.
``Well,'' Krauthammer writes, ``it turns out that the best cure for
the poverty the left so agonized about then is precisely what the
left is demonstrating against today _ capitalism and trade.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Media notes: Atlanta-based Jezebel magazine has joined forces
with radio executives Lew and John Dickey in a new media venture
that is yet to be named. Jezebel founders Joshua Goodhart and Adam
Capes said the new company will be a platform for additional
publishing ventures in Atlanta and throughout the country. Jezebel,
a celebrity- and fashion-oriented magazine, was launched three
years ago and has a circulation of 50,000, Goodhart said. The
Dickeys, officers in Cumulus Media, own Kiss 104.7 (WALR-FM),
WCNN-AM (680) and WFOM-AM (1230) in Atlanta and other stations in
Nashville.

THE END IS NEAR: KORBEL SAYS IT'S ALL OUT OF CHAMPAGNE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PEG MELNIK   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Korbel Champagne Cellars, trademarked ``The
Official Champagne of the Millennium,'' has a Y2K complication:
It's out of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said Gary Heck, president and chairman of the
Russian River winery. ``We're sold out. We could not sell one more
bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Korbel has lots of champagne for future years. But Heck sold his
last available bottle of champagne on Nov. 15, running through 1.59
million cases. While plenty of Korbel bottles remain on store
shelves, the winery has no more bottles to sell to distributors and
retailers this year, Heck said.
</P>
<P>
   With less than four weeks to go until the century's last New
Year's Eve, the much-hyped champagne shortage appears to be part
fact, part fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may have trouble buying high-end French Champagnes and
small-lot California sparkling wines for the millennium, according
to a survey of local vintners and sommeliers. Aside from that,
there will be plenty to uncork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out at the winery. We believe it will be in the
retailers. What we can't guarantee is the price,'' said Kristie
Nackord, spokeswoman for Domaine Chandon, a sparkling wine producer
in Yountville.
</P>
<P>
   While its reserve wines were snapped up long ago, Domaine
Chandon's mass market brands are in ample supply, Nackord said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves in Sonoma still has wine left to
sell in its tasting room, but has allocated all of its dwindling
inventory in the warehouse to distributors, spokeswoman Eva Bertran
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all wanted more, but we just couldn't supply it,''
Bertran said. ``It's pretty crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although distributors still have some Korbel products, it is
unclear whether they have enough champagne to keep store shelves
stocked through the year's end, said Ryan Barella, a Northern
California marketing manager with Brown-Forman, Korbel's marketing
and sales partner.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel and other champagne producers sell 70 percent of their
product in November and December. However, most typically have some
inventory left after New Year's Day to carry them until the new
vintage is released.
</P>
<P>
   Distributors in some states are running short on Korbel product
and requesting more, Heck said, citing sales reports from
Brown-Forman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Korbel has promoted itself as the official champagne of
the millennium, Heck said he wasn't embarrassed by a potential
shortage. ``We produced 30 percent more champagne than we ever had
in the history of Korbel and we produced as much as we possibly
could with our facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel produced 350,000 more cases than it did in 1998 in
anticipation of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of champagne is good news and bad news for Korbel.
Like all businesses, wineries try to sell everything they make. But
if Korbel sells out too soon, it faces an agonizing decision:
Should it delve into next year's supply of bubbly to meet demand or
allow retailers to run out of champagne and risk losing shelf space
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to lose shelf space,'' Heck said. ``It's a
difficult task to regain, but hopefully that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Korbel could see its territory on store shelves filled by
cheaper champagnes that can be produced in 30 days, Heck said.
Korbel champagnes require 18 months to produce because they are
made in the traditional French process called methode champenoise.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel, which spent about $25 million in promotions this year,
has tried to tightly associate its 11 styles of champagne with the
upcoming millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel is the first official worldwide sponsor of the Times
Square 2000 celebration in New York City. In 1997, Korbel signed a
10-year sponsorship with The Times Square Business Improvement
District, which stages the New Year's Eve party watched around the
world on TV. Korbel paid ``in the millions'' for this agreement,
spokeswoman Margie Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel also has trademarked ``The Official Champagne of the
Millennium'' for use in packaging, advertising and promotion.

   Seventy years ago last week, Adm. Richard E. Byrd became the
first person to fly over the South Pole, in a Ford tri-motor
aircraft that had a cruising speed of about 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd had to navigate by sighting the sun, because the effects of
the magnetic pole made his compasses useless.
</P>
<P>
   And because his plane could not land at the pole, he simply
dropped an American flag to prove he had made it to 90 degrees
south latitude.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary of Byrd's flight, a crew from the New York
Air National Guard flew a ski-equipped LC-130 aircraft on a supply
mission to the pole. The New York Guard is the only military
organization that flies ski-equipped aircraft. But its planes can
fly at 250 mph, 26,000 feet up, and carry computers, satellite
links, radar and a gyroscope.
</P>
<P>
   When the crew members landed, they could stay in the buildings
of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole base, where the galley has won
renown for having ``the best food on the continent.''

   IVESTER RETIRES
</P>
<P>
   COKE-IVESTER _ ATLANTA _ Douglas Ivester retires unexpectedly as
chairman of Coca-Cola. In a recent interview with The
Journal-Constitition, Ivester was upbeat about Coca-Cola's
prospects. Earnings, which have been in the tank, were expected to
see a turnaround for the fourth quarter and Ivester expected the
company to double its business in the next eight to 12 months. He
recently restructured his management lineup to streamline
decisionmaking. And the stock was back on its way up after a dismal
performance this year. Given the outlook, it came as a shock to
many when he announced his planned retirement in April 2000,
especially since the 52-year-old would be shy of retirement age,
which is 56 at the company. A look at what may have prompted the
decision, including Ivester's style of management. (Unger, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/COKE_BOARD _ ATLANTA _ All along Coca-Cola's board, including
James Williams and Warren Buffett, have expressed confidence that
Doug Ivester was the man to lead take the company forward. Was
there a concerted effort to get him to change his mind and stay, or
did the board simply thank him his service. A look at board
reaction to the resignation. (Saporta, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COKE-DAFT _ ATLANTA _ While Douglas Daft may not be a name
familiar to many outside Coca-Cola, the native Australian has been
with the company for 30 years. He will be chosen by the Coke board
to replace Ivester as chairman and chief executive officer. In the
interim he will be president and chief operating officer. Ivester
says Daft is ``perfectly suited to lead this company in its
continuing efforts to build value for all its share owners.'' A
look at Daft's background and what may, or may not, make him suited
for the job. (Kempner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COKE-WALLSTREET _Coca-Cola's stock, which had reached a low of
$47 in recent months but had climbed into the high 60s recently,
took a hit after Ivester's announcement. The stock remained down at
midday, and at least one analyst downgraded the stock from ``buy''
to ``neutral.'' A look at Wall Street's reaction to the
announcement. (Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ATT-BELLSOUTH _ Almost two decades after its phone monopoly was
broken, AT&AMP;T appears to be ready to shake its massive head and
assume a leadership role in the lucrative world of

BellSouth and other competitors. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   HDEPOT-CANADA _ Home Depot's Canadian competition is heating up
as the retailer extends its national reach. Revy Home Centres, the
second-largest home improvement retailer in Canada, plans a major

plans by Atlanta-based Home Depot in those markets. (Bond, Atlanta

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slightly smaller than what Americans quaintly insist on calling
half an inch, a centimeter (one-hundredth of a meter) is easy
enough to see. Divide this small length into 10 equal slices and
you are looking, or probably squinting, at a millimeter
(one-thousandth, or 10 to the minus 3 meters).
</P>
<P>
   By the time you divide one of these tiny units into a thousand
minuscule micrometers, you have far exceeded the limits of the
finest bifocals.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mind's eye, let the cutting continue, chopping the
micrometer into a thousand nanometers and the nanometers into a
thousand picometers, and those in steps of a thousandfold into
femtometers, attometers, zeptometers, and yoctometers.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, 10 to the minus 24 meters, about one-billionth
the radius of a proton, the roster of convenient Greek names runs
out. But go ahead and keep dividing, again and again until you
reach a length only a hundred-billionth as large as that tiny
amount: 10 to the minus 35 meters, or a decimal point followed by
34 zeroes and then a one.
</P>
<P>
   You have finally hit rock bottom: a span called the Planck
length, the shortest anything can get. According to recent
developments in the quest to devise a so-called ``theory of
everything,'' space is not an infinitely divisible continuum. It is
not smooth but granular, and the Planck length gives the size of
its smallest possible grains.
</P>
<P>
   The time it takes for a light beam to zip across this
ridiculously tiny distance (about 10 to the minus 43 seconds) is
called the Planck time, the shortest possible tick of an imaginary
clock. Combine these two ideas and the implication is that space
and time have a structure. What is commonly thought of as the
featureless void is built from tiny units, or quanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've long suspected that space-time had to be quantized,''
said Dr. Steven B. Giddings, a theorist at the University of
California at Santa Barbara. ``Recent developments have led to some
exciting new proposals about how to make these ideas more
concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   The hints of graininess come from attempts to unify general
relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, with quantum mechanics,
which describes the workings of the three other forces:
electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear interactions. The
result would be a single framework _ sometimes called quantum
gravity _ that explains all the universe's particles and forces.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of these unification efforts, superstring
theory, and a lesser-known approach called loop quantum gravity,
both strongly suggest that space-time has a minute architecture.
But just what the void might look like has physicists straining
their imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. John Baez, a theorist at the University of California at
Riverside put it: ``There's a lot we don't know about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of ancient Greece, some philosophers have
insisted that reality must be perfectly smooth like the continuum
of real numbers: Pick any two points, no matter how close together,
and there is an infinity of gradations in between. Others have
argued that, on the smallest scale, everything is surely divided
into irreducible units like the so-called natural or counting
numbers, with nothing between, say, three and four.
</P>
<P>
   The development of modern atomic theory, in the 19th century,
pushed science toward viewing the universe as lumpy instead of
smooth. At the beginning of this century, sentiments swung further
in that direction when Max Planck found that even light was emitted
in packets. From that unexpected discovery emerged quantum field
theory, in which all the forces are carried by tiny particles, or
quanta _ all, that is, except gravity.
</P>
<P>
   This force continues to be explained, in entirely different
terms, by general relativity: as the warping of a perfectly smooth
continuum called space-time. A planet bends the surrounding
space-time fabric causing other objects to move toward it like
marbles rolling down a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long assumed that unification would reveal that
gravity, like the other forces, is also quantum in nature, carried
by messenger particles called gravitons. But while the other forces
can be thought of as acting within an arena of space and time,
gravity  &UR; is &LR;  space-time. Quantizing one is tantamount to quantizing
the other.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that space-time graininess has gone
unnoticed here in the macroscopic realm. Even the tiny quarks that
make up protons, neutrons and other particles are too big to feel
the bumps that may exist on the Planck scale.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, though, physicists have suggested that quarks and
everything else are made of far tinier objects: superstrings
vibrating in 10 dimensions. At the Planck level, the weave of
space-time would be as apparent as when the finest Egyptian cotton
is viewed under a magnifying glass, exposing the warp and woof.
</P>
<P>
   It was Planck himself who first had an inkling of a smallest
possible size. He noticed that he could start with three
fundamental parameters of the universe _ the gravitational constant
(which measures the strength of gravity), the speed of light, and
his own Planck's constant (a gauge of quantum graininess) _ and
combine them in such a way that the units canceled one another to
yield a length. He was not sure about the meaning of this Planck
length, as it came to be called, but he felt that it must be
something very basic.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the physicist John Wheeler suggested that the
Planck length marked the boundary where the random roil of quantum
mechanics scrambled space and time so violently that ordinary
notions of measurement stopped making sense. He called the result
``quantum foam.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``So great would be the fluctuations that there would literally
be no left and right, no before and no after,'' Wheeler recently
wrote in his memoir, ``Geons, Black Holes and Quantum Foam''
(Norton, 1998). ``Ordinary ideas of length would disappear.
Ordinary ideas of time would evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, physicists are still trying to work out
the bizarre implications of a minimum length. In superstring
theory, a mathematical relationship called T duality suggests that
one can shrink a circle only so far. As the radius contracts, the
circle gets smaller and smaller and then bottoms out, suddenly
acting as though it is getting bigger and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This behavior implies that there is a minimum `true size' to
the circle,'' Giddings said. Many believe this will turn out to be
roughly comparable to the Planck scale.
</P>
<P>
   There are other indications of graininess. According to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, certain pairs of quantities are
``noncommutative'': You cannot simultaneously measure a particle's
position and momentum, for example, or its energy and life span.
The more precisely you know one, the fuzzier your knowledge of the
other becomes.
</P>
<P>
   In string theory, the very geometry of space may turn out to be
noncommutative, making it impossible to measure simultaneously the
horizontal and vertical position of a particle to perfect
precision. The graininess of space itself would get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the unification business is a string theorist.
Coming from an entirely different direction, researchers in a
discipline called loop quantum gravity have devised a theory in
which space is constructed from abstract mathematical objects
called spin nets.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a tiny particle spinning like a top on its axis. Now
send it on a roundtrip journey, a loop through space. Depending on
the Einsteinian shape of the space the particle traverses, it will
return home with its axis tilted in a different direction. This
change then provides a clue about how the space is curved.
</P>
<P>
   Using particles with various spins, theorists can probe space in
more detail. The different trajectories can then be combined into a
web, called a spin network, that captures everything you need to
know about how the space is curved _ what physicists call its
geometry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our space in which we live is just this enormously complicated
spin network,'' said Dr. Carlo Rovelli of the University of
Pittsburgh. He and Dr. Lee Smolin of the Center for Gravitational
Physics and Geometry at Pennsylvania State University have figured
out how to use spin nets to calculate area and volume _ all this
information is encoded within the weblike structure.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you are sitting at a table. To calculate its area you
would add up the spins of all the links of the spin net that are
passing through it, and multiply by the square of the Planck
length. A table with an area of about one square meter would be
impinged by some 10 to the 65th of these trajectories. The
implication is that the very idea of a surface is an illusion
generated by the spin network.
</P>
<P>
   The picture gets even weirder. In quantum mechanics, an electron
orbiting an atomic nucleus is thought of as a cloud of probability:
a ``superposition'' in which all the electron's possible locations
hover together. In the view of Rovelli, Smolin and their
colleagues, the universe itself is a superposition of every
conceivable spin net _ all the possible ways that it can be curved.
</P>
<P>
   Where does time fit into the picture? A spin net provides a
snapshot of the geometry of three-dimensional space at a particular
instant. To describe space-time, Baez and other theorists have
stretched spin nets into the fourth dimension, devising what they
call spin foam. Slice it and each infinitely thin cross section is
a spin net.
</P>
<P>
   Most perplexing of all, spin nets and spin foam cannot be
thought of as existing in space and time. They reside on a more
fundamental level, as a deep structure that underlies and gives
rise to space-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the core of the matter,'' Rovelli said. ``They don't
 &UR; live &LR;  somewhere. They  &UR; are &LR;  the quantum space-time.''
</P>
<P>
   The universe, in this view, is conjured up from pure
mathematics. And the old idea of space and time as the stage on
which everything happens no longer seems to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe what we really have discovered about the world
with quantum mechanics and general relativity, then the  &UR; stage &LR; 
fiction has to be abandoned,'' Rovelli said, ``and we have to learn
to do physics and to think about the world in a profoundly new way.
Our notions of what are space and time are completely altered. In
fact, in a sense, we have to learn to think without them.''

   4-hour version of silent film a winner
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Eyman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When director Erich von Stroheim was a
newly arrived immigrant to America, one of the first books he read
was Frank Norris' fascinating 1899 novel ``McTeague.'' It's the
story of an amiable lug from Placer County, Calif., who becomes a
dentist in turn-of-the-century San Francisco, then begins a long,
slow slide into lethargy and degradation that culminates in him
murdering his miserly wife and dying a hunted fugitive in Death
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not a laugh riot. But it is a virtuoso piece of
naturalism, a shock to the system of the then-prevalent Victorian
style, and a book that can still be read with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   As his directorial career heated up in the early '20s, Stroheim
was determined to make ``McTeague'' his dream project _ a literal,
exhaustively detailed adaptation of Norris' novel, shot in the
actual locations described in the book, including Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Stroheim started shooting, he had a movie _ a
very long movie. Stroheim's initial cut was eight hours, which he
knew was out of the question. He was trying to get it down to four
hours _ still basically out of the question _ when he was trampled
by stampeding events.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldwyn company, which had originally financed the movie,
merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, headed by Irving Thalberg, who had
already fired Stroheim once, from Universal's ``Foolish Wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Under Thalberg's supervision, ``Greed'' _ the movie's new title
_ was edited down to slightly more than two hours in a respectable
job. Stroheim's uncut version, shown just once for an invited
preview audience, has been the cinema's Holy Grail for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schmidlin, fresh from his restoration of Orson Welles'
Touch of Evil, has embarked on a similar project for Stroheim's
masterpiece. Schmidlin's version premiered on the invaluable Turner
Classic Movies.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidlin didn't have any more actual film footage to work with,
but he did have over 600 stills from the complete cut of the film,
and he intersperses those with the pre-existing version of
Stroheim's film.
</P>
<P>
   He has also taken the trouble to color a number of images that
Stroheim indicated were to be tinted, usually gold _ coins, a large
gold tooth that McTeague hangs outside his office on Polk Street
(the building is still there, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   Using stills to paper over missing footage has never worked well
in the past. In the restored versions of films such as ``Lost
Horizon'' or the 1954 ``A Star is Born,'' there's a palpable
disequilibrium. The soundtrack grinds on while you suddenly shift
from watching a movie to watching a photo album.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the stills don't get in the way with a silent
film nearly as much as with a talkie. Mostly, I would guess this is
because of the more abstract, dream-like nature of silent films.
They're inherently unrealistic anyway _ physically, the art form
they most resemble is ballet, but with the emotions of opera.
</P>
<P>
   What Schmidlin has wrought is a four-hour version of the film,
something approaching Stroheim's intentions, with a new,
serviceable musical score composed by Robert Israel.
</P>
<P>
   What is gained? A strong sense of Stroheim's vast, over-arching
composition: Zola-esque, determinist, class-oriented (Norris was
clearly close to Jack London's brand of socialism), a beautifully
detailed panoply of life's underachievers undone by a malevolent
fate and their own bubbling anger.
</P>
<P>
   What is lost? Mostly, dramatic compression. When the time came
to cut the film down, MGM excised all of Norris' subplots to
concentrate on McTeague and his wife Trina. A story about an
obsessive junk dealer and his doomed wife, which MGM cut almost
completely, plays as slightly redundant; it's essentially the same
story as Mac and Trina, with different faces.
</P>
<P>
   Another story, about an elderly couple who gently court each
other in the same boarding house, seems like a pleasant but
inessential appendage, calculated relief from the rest of the grim
goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   What leaps out at you in the new version is Stroheim's audacity;
nothing like ``Greed'' had ever been attempted, and nothing like it
would be for another 40 years, until movies like ``Rocco and his
Brothers,'' or, later, ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the
Spring.'' Needless to say, those were all European in origin.
</P>
<P>
   Stroheim's style was classical and quite beautiful; the camera
rarely moves, is invariably in the right place, and he uses some
startlingly innovative deep-focus shots, years before cameraman
Gregg Toland and Orson Welles nabbed the credit by shooting all of
``Citizen Kane'' in that style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' has always been a must-see for buffs, but Schmidlin
has placed it in its proper dramatic context. This year, Christmas
comes early.

   Medical mistakes: A prescription for danger
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Lore
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sabrina Gibbs picked baby animals for her nursery's
theme, painting the walls a light lavender and building a wooden
palm tree for tiny stuffed monkeys to swing.
</P>
<P>
   At night, she would sit in the nursery, more than eight months
pregnant, and sing:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Norman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   You are my first born, brand-new
</P>
<P>
   Oh Norman, we love you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gibbs also had gestational diabetes. And she needed a weekly
test to make sure neither she nor her fetus were in distress.
Unknown to her and her physician, however, the medical assistant
failed to schedule the test as ordered. And then failed to notify
anyone she hadn't done it.
</P>
<P>
   That cascaded into a series of medical miscommunications. A
second doctor assumed the test had been done because of the first
doctor's orders. So he didn't ask Gibbs about it and didn't
re-order the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a Sunday, she stopped feeling the baby move. That
morning, she assumed it was because the baby was just sleeping. But
that night, she and her husband, Norman, rushed to the emergency
room. There they learned Norman Jr. was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simply devastating,'' said Gibbs, who last year won a
$1.5 million jury verdict against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of
Georgia Inc., which contracted the practice for services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do everything you can _ I was giving myself insulin
injections three times a day _ and then you learn you lost your
baby because of something that was totally preventable,'' she said.
``You can't fathom the pain of it .''
</P>
<P>
   A new report issued by the National Academy of Sciences finds
medical mistakes like the one that claimed Gibbs' son occur far too
frequently, killing between 44,000 and 98,000 patients a year. And
although more than half of the mistakes don't result in serious
complications, experts say the study's findings emphasize that
consumers must check and re-check the care they receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still this myth of perfection,'' said Dr. Richard
Kaine, director of Quality Management Resources Limited in Buford,
a national consulting firm that evaluates hospitals' operations and
quality. ``People in health care are typically very dedicated, very
bright and very competent. But that's resulted in a system that
always assumes they'll get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, health care workers are still mere mortals. And
when coupled with increased scientific complexity and financial
pressure to do more with less, there's more opportunity to get it
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription errors top the list for medical mistakes. More than
2.5 billion prescriptions are written each year, solving everything
from anxiety to impotence. And each month, the average hospital
fills more than 15,000 doses a month.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 patients died in 1993 from errors related to
prescriptions, according to the academy's report. And experts say
that figure is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three things that happen with prescriptions: You get
the wrong medication, you get the wrong dosage of medication or you
take the medication at the wrong time,'' said Charles Inlander,
executive director of the People's Medical Society, a non-profit
health care consumer group in Allentown, Penn. ``In any case, it's
not going to help you get well.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is consumers can protect themselves by taking
several simple steps. When the doctor orders a prescription, a
patient should not rely on the handwritten prescription. Instead,
consumers should ask for the name of the drug, and what it is
supposed to do. The physician should print the prescription, if the
order is not being filed electronically.
</P>
<P>
   When at a hospital, the patient or a family member should
double-check the basics with the nurse _ the patient's name, the
type of medicine and the dosage _ every time a pill or I.V.
medication is given. And if you're picking up a prescription at a
drug store, take two minutes to verify the medication with the
pharmacist. That's especially important in today's drug stores
where some pharmacists are filling more than 400 orders a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to trust health care professionals. But we are
nowhere near perfect and mistakes can be made,'' said William W.
Smith, a pharmacist at Kings' Drugs on Peachtree Road.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, mistakes are not dramatic - the removal of the
wrong leg or organ of a patient - but are the result of obvious
breaches of good common sense or failure to pay attention to
details. ``Most often, it is a case of a patient simply falling
through the cracks,'' said Tom Sampson, an Atlanta medical
malpractice attorney with Thomas Kennedy, Sampson and Patterson.
``It's a case of someone not doing the follow-up that's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   And experts say medical mistakes occur more frequently than the
figures reported because so much of the medical system operates
outside the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get more information about the CIA than about
hospitals,'' Inlander said. ``The medical system really is the last
bastion of non-consumerism.'' Consumers can compare the energy
rating of refrigerators, but can't compare the infection rates of
Atlanta hospitals. He or she can check the Internet to see how a
car performs, but not how his or her heart surgeon performs.
</P>
<P>
   And if a hospital worker makes a mistake, the description of the
error is not recorded in the patient chart, but in a separate
incident report. The premise is that hospitals should have the
right to correct problems without constant fear of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates say these practices are outdated and
sometimes used as a way to dodge accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the number of medical mistakes, some facilities are
taking steps to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   At Emory Hospitals, for example, an automated robotic dispensing
system is now used to administer prescriptions, eliminating the
possibility of human error, said spokeswoman Rashel Stephenson. And
nationwide, hospitals are instituting programs that allow doctors
to enter their orders through computer systems, narrowing the
possibility that orders for tests and drugs fall through the
cracks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many medical facilities are instituting best
practice guidelines, which provide a standard directive for care in
certain situations - something experts say will reduce errors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a airline pilot is required to run through a check
list every time he flies . It's not that he doesn't know how to fly
the plane, Kaine said, but because it's one final chance to make
sure everything is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons, on the other hand, have no such checklists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I bet if they had to hop on the table next to you, they
sure would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, 35, is convinced such consistency is the reason that her
two other pregnancies in the past five years went smoothly.
Although she had gestational diabetes with both children, now 4 and
2 years old, her new doctor kept everything on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like night and day,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, experts say consumers need to take matters into
their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of putting all your trust in Marcus Welby are long
over,'' said Sampson. ``Because even though a lot of people in
medicine are well-intentioned, no one cares about your health like
you do. Be proactive and protect it.''

`A WALK THROUGH HARLEM': A STIMULATING TRIP WITHOUT TAKING THE A
TRAIN

<P>
   Harlem _ its history and its personalities, its buildings and
its neighborhoods _ is on vibrant display in ``A Walk Through
Harlem.'' If you don't mind the occasional burst of effusiveness,
Tuesday night's guide, the architecture historian Barry Lewis,
makes as informed a companion as anyone could wish. He is assisted
by David Hartman, who helps to keep the conversation moving along
with the camera, and by an array of Harlemites with stories to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   These 100 minutes start with bucolic photographs, taken in the
middle of the 19th century, of what was then, when New York City
did not extend much north of Greenwich Village, a suburb for
well-to-do whites. The animated Lewis, who concentrates on North
and West Harlem, gives us a look into an elegant house, circa 1880,
complete with Tiffany window, mahogany mantelpiece and tile floors.
The coming of the first subway incited a building boom that brought
in what Lewis calls ``two groups that the respectable didn't want
to be around,'' blacks and Eastern European Jews. A brisk history
of the ever changing neighborhoods introduces luminaries of the
Harlem that developed over the years as a cultural center for black
America.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Dr. Walter Turnbull, who started the Boys Choir of Harlem
in the 1960s and the girls choir the following decade; Arthur
Mitchell, who started Dance Theater of Harlem; the jazz pianist
Billy Taylor, who recalls the great jam sessions; the widow of
James VanDerZee, the noted photographer, examples of whose work
enhance the program; and Marcus Garvey Jr., whose father generated
the back-to-Africa movement of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   And there are tributes to Arthur Alfonso Schomburg, founder of
the invaluable Schomburg Library, and eminences of the Harlem
Renaissance like Langston Hughes, Claude McKay and Zora Neale
Hurston, not to forget Madame C.J. Walker, who made a fortune with
her formula for growing hair. ``Hope in a jar,'' Lewis calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Churches and newspapers, theaters and dance palaces (in which
black customers were not always welcome) flourished when Seventh
Avenue, as Lewis exults, was ``the great black way.'' He calls
Micheaux's Bookstore ``a mecca for black intellectuals,'' and he
reports that when the Hotel Theresa opened its rooms to blacks in
1940, it became the ``Waldorf Astoria for Harlem.'' The Apollo
Theater was swinging away on 125th Street, of course, and elegant
apartment houses along Edgecombe Avenue in Sugar Hill attracted an
elite that included Roy Wilkins and Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bountiful excursion, full of scenes of beauty and energy.
No, you will not see much of the less appealing neighborhoods. But
given the attention often attracted by bad news, there is something
to be said for an upbeat tour.

 &HT;    Skimming the surface: JetFoil struts its stuff
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with TRAVEL-FREEPORT, TRAVEL-FREESHOP.)
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Last month, I flew over to the Bahamas. But
without the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   I took the SeaJet Kara, a 250-passenger Boeing JetFoil, one of
only two operating in U.S. waters. The SeaJet, a hydrofoil, flew
from West Palm Beach, Fla., to Freeport going 50 mph and riding 14
to 16 feet above the water.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is 80 percent aviation and 20 percent maritime,
says SeaJet CEO George Bradley. ``We say it's a vessel that
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat left the Port of Palm Beach with its hull in the water,
but once we were past the inlet, it rose out of the ocean on two
18-foot-long struts. On the end of the front strut is a small
airplane-type wing with flaps that help steer, and on the wide
strut on the back is a long airplane-type wing.
</P>
<P>
   There are no propellers. The boat's water-propulsion system is
powered by two 8,200-hp Allison gas turbines, pushing 48,000
gallons per minute.
</P>
<P>
   It took 99 minutes of flying time and two hours dock to dock to
get to Freeport. Fishermen, freighter crews and tourists at both
harbors snapped photos of this weird jet-boat as it flew across the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The SeaJets were designed by Boeing and built in Seattle in
1982. Kara and a sister SeaJet, Kristen, which also offers service
between West Palm Beach and Freeport, both operated in the English
Channel before that company went out of business when the English
Channel Tunnel was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 40 Boeing SeaJets working worldwide, all owned by
German businessman Sven Paulsen, operate in Hong Kong and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kara's interior resembles a very wide-bodied jet, with fold-down
tray tables on the seat backs. Complimentary coffee, soft drinks
and cookies were handed out by flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The motion of the boat was similar to the slight side-to-side
swaying of a train. On the flight out, unusually high seas made it
difficult to drink out of a coffee cup as we crossed the Gulf
Stream, but it wasn't the rolling motion that causes seasickness.
On the return trip, the movement was as smooth as a new Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers should count on three hours or so of travel, including
time to get through Customs at both ends.
</P>
<P>
   For those who hate to fly the small planes to Freeport and who
don't want to ride the waves to get there, the SeaJet might be the
perfect alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are $99 round-trip from West Palm Beach, Fla., for adults;
$49, kids ages 3 to 16. There's also a $25 arrival/departure tax.
Ask about hotel-SeaJet packages. Call (561) 844-3383 or visit
www.SeaJets.com. The SeaJet leaves from the Port of Palm Beach
twice daily, at 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Thursday through Monday.

 &HT;    Life after ``Rhoda'' good for Harper
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What could a man-hungry, anxiety-riddled
sitcom sidekick from the Bronx and a Nobel Prize-winning
missionary's daughter who opened our eyes to China through her
novels and human rights activism possibly have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Fictional Rhoda Morgenstern and the very real Pearl S. Buck are
separated by only one degree through Valerie Harper, the former
Broadway hoofer turned television icon who is back onstage at the
Royal Poinciana Playhouse beginning Tuesday with her one-woman show
about Buck, ``All Under Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long she portrays the author of ``The Good Earth''
and some 70 other books _ and the 59-year-old Harper hopes it's
long after the gray wig she dons nightly is superfluous _ she will
always be linked in the public's mind with Morgenstern. After all,
she played her from 1970-74 on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and
another four years on the spinoff series ``Rhoda,'' walking off
with a quartet of Emmys for her brassy, kvetchy comic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when she prepared to face audiences as Buck last year
off-Broadway, Harper worried that they were really looking for
glimpses of Rhoda. ``It had been a fear before we started, but the
audience is just darling in their willingness to suspend
disbelief,'' she says, without a trace of Morgenstern's telltale
New Yawk accent. ``We didn't know whether it would work. Not only
the disbelief that it's Valerie, but that it's not Rhoda and that
it is Pearl, a woman that's going to be 80 and has cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper was acclaimed in New York for her recreation of Buck,
even impressing critics who considered her a mere television
actress. ``Yeah, they lie in wait. It's just that if you come from
television, any television person has to prove herself,'' she
concedes. ``I did too, even though I spent most of my life in
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet just when Harper has proven there is life and career after
Rhoda, she is heading back to the comfort of her most familiar
role. Prior to coming to South Florida for a mini-road tour of
``All Under Heaven,'' she filmed a made-for-TV movie called ``Mary
and Rhoda.'' Scheduled to air on ABC at the end of February's
ratings sweeps month, it showcases Rhoda and Mary Richards 20 years
later, as they deal with the comic challenges of being single
mothers of college-age daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reunion show, in that it's all about going
forward,'' Harper is quick to explain. ``The whole point of the
movie (is) where have they been, where are they now and where are
they going.'' If it pulls in the viewers she and producer-husband
Tony Cacciotti hope for, chances are it could become a weekly
series.
</P>
<P>
   Harper no longer frets over being associated with Rhoda, as if
that were possible. ``I don't know how more saturated we could
be,'' she says, noting the continued exposure of ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' and ``Rhoda'' in syndication. ``I used to be worried
about it, but I feel like I owe the fans big time. So I got my
Bronx accent out again, polished it up. It was great. Mary and I,
we're like an old vaudeville team that knows each other so well.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, however, this vaudevillian is performing solo.
For years, she and Cacciotti had talked about creating a stage show
for her _ a ``Mark Twain Tonight!'' _ something to take on tour
between television and film projects. If they could find the right
historical subject, she says, ``we knew that we would make money on
the road, that we would have it for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the choice of Buck is a tribute to Harper's mother.
``My mother loved her,'' she says. ``She had her books around the
house forever.'' And an assist goes to Dom DeLuise's wife, Carol,
who sent Harper a Christmas card each year. In it would be a note
that a donation had been made in her name to the Pearl S. Buck
Foundation, which works worldwide on behalf of needy children,
particularly those of American servicemen and Asian mothers. It was
enough to pique Harper's curiosity, so she hit the books, working
her way through the Buck canon, and now proudly announces that she
is up to 68 of the author's works.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took three-and-a-half years before Harper had a play
ready to open in New York, having first gone through a couple of
directors, a writer and a completely different script. Eventually,
Harper cowrote ``All Under Heaven'' with Oakland playwright Dyke
Garrison, piecing together a portrait of Buck at 79 _ a year before
her death in 1973 _ seen in her Vermont farmhouse, preparing to
return to China, now under a Communist rule that she had been so
critical of.
</P>
<P>
   Using her background in Second City improvisational comedy and
an offshoot called Story Theatre, they fashioned a play in which
Harper becomes some 18 characters from Buck's past, ranging from
Buck's impersonation of Richard Nixon to a Chinese dowager queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what I really worked hard on,'' she says. ``Every
time an Asian character enters the play, making them each a
particular figure. I mean we all remember Mickey Rooney, God love
his soul, in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' I remember at the time
thinking, `What's he doing with the buck teeth and the accent?' So
that was the furthest thing from what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her achievements, Buck was able to give the world a more
accurate view of Asia, counteracting the Hollywood stereotypes.
``She wrote of Asians as human beings,'' says Harper. ``We thought
that they were so mysterious, unknowable. The inscrutable East, the
Dragon Lady with long fingernails. Pearl opened up China and she
wrote with Chinese eyes. She did more than anyone for race
relations and opening up the global village.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of ``All Under Heaven'' will be new information
about Buck for most audiences, Harper and Cacciotti were determined
that it not come across as academic. ``He kept saying, 'Valerie, we
do not want a history lesson. The theater is not about lessoning.
It's about moving people to laughter, to tears, to thoughts. It's
got to be emotional,' '' Harper recalls. ``And just her point of
view, sometimes her archness, is cause for comedy. Sometimes you're
laughing with her, sometimes you're laughing at her, but that's
good theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater is where Suffern, N.Y.-born, Hunter College-educated
Harper began, first in the Radio City Music Hall corps de ballet at
the age of 16, followed by the chorus of such Broadway shows as
``Li'l Abner'' and ``Wildcat.'' Soon after her five years with
Second City, she was discovered by television and became nationally
known on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
</P>
<P>
   After her fast-track ascent, the '80s and '90s have been rockier
for Harper. In 1986, a series called ``Valerie'' was built around
her, but it led to a contentious contract dispute with NBC and
producer Lorimar. It was settled out-of-court, but Harper gained a
reputation as a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did two short-lived series this decade _ ``City'' and ``The
Office'' _ do much for her career. She has her theories about why
they didn't work, centering on network incompetence, yet Harper
remains philosophical. ``I guess I was lucky in my life to get five
shows on the air. Period,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is evident that she would love another shot at
television success. In May, Harper shot a pilot for a sitcom with
Ron Leibman about a mixed marriage (``I'm Jewish, he's Italian'')
of empty nesters whose grown children return home. She thought it
was ``hilarious,'' but the networks must have disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   She is juggling several other projects, including a new show for
Broadway and a line of green tea-based skin care products being
hawked on the Home Shopping Network. According to Cacciotti, public
and cable television executives are flying in to see ``All Under
Heaven'' in Palm Beach, Fla., for a potential two-hour special of
it, to be shot in China.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this could be put on hold if ``Mary and Rhoda''
clicks. ``We might get great numbers, through the ceiling, and they
might say, `Great movie,' and that's it,'' says Harper. ``It may
fall flat, reviewers may not like it. I don't know. But as Mary
said to me, `Val, we're going to kick ourselves if we don't try.'
''

 &HT;    Sound enhancer fails test
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The SoundScience Universal Audio Dynamic Sound
Improvement Processor promises to ``enhance reproduction for
fuller, cleaner, undiluted sound with sharp mid-tones, crisp
trebles and powerful base'' from your CD player, television,
computer, DVD player, radio, cassette player, satellite receiver
and video game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is what does ``enhance'' mean? The
promotional material the company provided was a little vague, so
the Dayton Daily News asked for a sample unit to see for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   I tried out the unit on my middle-of-the-road quality home
stereo to get the layman's opinion and turned it over to Dayton
Daily News audio columnist Don Loose for a professional
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Both of us came to the same conclusion: The SoundScience device,
called by its initials DSIP, seems to boost base and treble tones
dramatically, but the results sounded distorted. It might be a good
product to attach to an inexpensive stereo or boombox to jack up
the bass response, but it's probably not for true high fidelity
sound lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The DSIP is a silver plastic box about six inches across powered
by an AC adapter. It came with RCA-type plugs to connect it to
stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   To test the DSIP, Loose said he placed it in the tape loop of a
hi-fi system known for its transparency. He played two CDs with
which he was very familiar. The first was a Holly Cole CD featuring
female vocal, acoustic bass, acoustic piano, and a string section.
The second was the recently released Columbus Jazz Orchestra 25th
anniversary CD, Band At Work, which he recorded and engineered
himself in live concert settings.
</P>
<P>
   Loose didn't care for the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, in one Holly Cole take, the string bass plays in
unison with low piano notes, and you can clearly hear the two
timbres in unison,'' Loose said. ``The DSIP obliterates the
separate timbres into a single muddy bass line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treble fared no better. The first thing to jump out were
distorted sibilants in Holly's voice which weren't there when the
DSIP was out of the system. The Columbus Jazz Orchestra sounded
really tinny _ not like the sound of real brass or woodwinds.''
</P>
<P>
   I connected the DSIP to my video recorder and played a battle
scene passage from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn. The first thing
I noticed was an immediate increase in rumbling bass tones
associated with explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But I also noticed an unpleasant buzzy, tinny undertone as
characters spoke. And high-pitched laser blasts had an effect like
scraping fingernails across a chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   SoundScience sells the Universal Audio DSIP for $90 online at
its Web site at www.soundscience.com. You can also order by phone
by calling (201) 767-3297.
</P>
<P>
   Other products in the SoundScience's line include less expensive
units for travel and for television only.

 &HT;    New musicals carve their territories on Broadway
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the end of a century in which Broadway became
synonymous with commercial theater, its prime indigenous product _
the stage musical _ is busy looking nostalgically backward and
warily ahead. The former is represented by a vibrant, tuneful
revival of ``Kiss Me Kate,'' while the latter can be seen in a
dramatically powerful, but melodically stingy new work called
``Marie Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are loosely based on classic plays, ``Kiss Me Kate''
puckishly springing from Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew''
and ``Marie Christine'' rooted in Euripides' tragic ``Medea.'' Both
productions contain juicy, larger-than-life leading roles, expertly
performed by stars likely to dominate Broadway for years to come.
But once you get beyond those superficial similarities, the two
shows are as different as possible, representing opposite extremes
of the musical theater spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me Kate,'' which hails from 1948, is both a musical
``Shrew'' and the comic tempests of a pair of divorced theater
legends trying to get through the show's out-of-town opening night.
Along the way, they discover they are still in love with each
other. Fifty-one years ago, it was a recognizable send-up of the
famously egotistical Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, but the show
has outlived its satirical targets.
</P>
<P>
   The icing on the ``Kate'' cake is certainly the Cole Porter
score, as urbane, romantic and whimsical as any he ever wrote. Both
within and outside the play-within-a-play there are such lovely
ballads as ``So In Love'' and ``Were Thine That Special Face.'' And
when Porter starts punning on play titles in ``Brush Up Your
Shakespeare'' (''If she says your behavior is heinous/Kick her
right in the Coriolanus''), it is enough to make a grown man groan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other hit shows of that era (''Annie Get Your Gun,''
``Finian's Rainbow'') being revived with wholesale script
adjustments, Kate has a quite playable book by Sam and Bella
Spewack. It cleverly interweaves its plots with Elizabethan
resonances, plus the added comic peril of bookie's goons who
mistakenly lean on lothario and director Fred Graham (Brian Stokes
Mitchell) and, to keep close tabs, end up onstage mid-Shrew.
</P>
<P>
   Minor tinkering, including the insertion of the previously cut
``From This Moment On'' and the invention of a MacArthur-like
suitor (Ron Holgate) for diva Lili Vanessi (Marin Mazzie), was
reportedly done by an uncredited John Guare. Attempts at revision
in the name of political correctness _ which ``Taming of the
Shrew'' may never qualify for _ have wisely been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   If the reason Kiss Me Kate had never returned to Broadway
previously is a lack of lead performers who could do justice to
both the Shakespearean verse and the Porter score, that has
certainly been solved by Mitchell and Mazzie. It comes as no
surprise that these stars of ``Ragtime'' know their way around a
love song, but it is their broad comic abilities in frequent
nose-to-nose confrontations that make them so winning.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shakespeare, Porter and the Spewacks wrote a secondary
romance for Kate's sister Bianca and her suitor Lucentio, to be
played by nightclub cutie Lois Lane (Amy Spanger) and Broadway
hoofer Bill Calhoun (Michael Berresse). She vamps her way
alluringly through ``Always True to You (In My Fashion)'' and he
climbs athletically over Robin Wagner's three-level backstage set
while warbling ``Bianca.'' Choreographer Kathleen Marshall comes up
with some smashing steamy steps, but never better than the second
act opener for the ensemble, ``Too Darn Hot.'' Michael Blakemore
(''City of Angels'') directs it all with a deft farcical touch and
an evident affection for show business lore.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it is noted that they don't write 'em like they used
to, ``Kiss Me Kate'' is the sort of hit-song-stocked show referred
to. ``Marie Christine'' is the prototypical modern show that, alas,
prompts the remark. High-minded and serious, as you might expect a
version of ``Medea'' to be, it tells its story largely through a
rarefied score of art songs by Michael John La Chuisa which lean
toward contemporary opera.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say there aren't some beautiful, dramatically
charged numbers here. Marie's aria of feminist philosophy, ``Way
Back to Paradise,'' and her duet with her corrupt, duplicitious
lover Dante, ``We're Gonna Go to Chicago,'' remain vivid after an
initial hearing. But unlike Porter's easy way with a melody, La
Chuisa's structural complexities require work on the audience's
part and ultimately turn this gut-wrenching tale into a cerebral
head trip, which could not have been the goal.
</P>
<P>
   What La Chuisa has managed is to transpose the story of a
spurned sorceress who takes revenge by murdering her sons to that
of a black woman with voodoo powers in 1899 New Orleans and
Chicago. As she becomes involved with charismatic sea captain and
political climber Dante (intense Anthony Crivello), who pushes her
aside for the daughter of a ward boss, we begin to see a believable
situation for Marie to commit the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly what La Chuisa and director-choreographer Graciela
Daniele have done is create a stunning showcase for Audra McDonald,
the three-time Tony Award winner (after only three Broadway
appearances). Her classically trained soprano gets a workout
negotiating through the music's treacherous rises and falls, yet
she handles its demands with power and control. The result is a
``Medea'' that is all-too-rational and, thus, all the more
frightening. If she does not win a fourth Tony, it will be because
the show fails to find an audience, not for any fault in her
towering performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine'' is an admirable attempt to push the musical
theater forward, one that is clearly linked to Lincoln Center
Theatre's effort last season, ``Parade,'' which was so worthy yet
so critically and popularly dismissed. For those who believe that
the musical can be more than easy, instantly accessible
entertainment, ``Marie Christine'' is likely to intrigue. But do
they exist in sufficient numbers? Fortunately, star power has
always driven the Broadway theater, and in McDonald this demanding,
yet rewarding production has a gleaming, genuine star.
</P>
<P>
   KISS ME, KATE
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Martin Beck Theatre, 302 W. 45th St., New York
</P>
<P>
   _ When: Continuing indefinitely
</P>
<P>
   _ Tickets: $25-$80. Call: (800) 432-7250.
</P>
<P>
   _ The verdict: A merry, knockabout revival with a pair of
buoyant stars, a great, tuneful Porter score and dance worth
kicking your heels over.
</P>
<P>
   MARIE CHRISTINE
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Vivian Beaumont Theatre, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th
St., New York
</P>
<P>
   _ When: Through Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tickets: $40-$75. Call: (212) 239-6200.
</P>
<P>
   _ The verdict: Serious music fans are the target audience for
this contemporary operatic Medea, but everyone should see the
towering performance of McDonald in the title role.

DRIVING YOURSELF TO DISTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 12) 
(jt) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opinions about cell phones in cars are running high these days.
Sales people, investors and soccer parents say they cannot manage
without their electronic links. But the safety of talking on the
phone in the flow of traffic is coming under question.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known on National Public Radio as Click
and Clack, the Car Talkers, are so adamantly against the
``scourge'' of chatting drivers that they are giving away bumper
stickers saying, ``Drive Now Talk Later.'' In two months, according
to Douglas Berman, their producer, 60,000 have been requested.
Apparently independent of this campaign, elected officials began
stirring in two places last month, in one case as a result of a
fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of cellular phones in 1983, their use has
been one of the fastest-moving and most visible changes in the
country; the government estimates that by next year, there will be
80 million cell phone users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA has been watching cell-phone legislation since 1992, but
despite outcries that there ought to be a law, no state or province
has so far outlawed wireless conversation while the driver's foot
is on the accelerator. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association has likewise seen no looming state law.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an alderman in Chicago offered an ordinance that
would outlaw drivers' use of hand-held cell phones when the car was
moving on the road. In Pennsylvania on Nov. 3, a 2-year-old died of
injuries after her mother's car was struck by another whose driver
said he did not see a stop sign while dialing. This caused State
Sen. Joe Conti to press again for a bill he introduced in the
legislature to outlaw drivers' use of handheld phones.
</P>
<P>
   The little town of Brooklyn, Ohio (population 11,000), adjoining
Cleveland, is the only place on record as having enacted an
ordinance. Mayor John M. Coyne says that in 1966, Brooklyn adopted
what he calls the country's first mandatory seat belt law. The
mayor, who is leaving office on Jan. 1 after 52 years as an elected
official, is proud of the new step.
</P>
<P>
   Except for emergencies, the rule bans driver use of a cell phone
held in the hand while the car is in motion. It does not forbid use
of no-hands devices or use while the car is parked.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance took effect in March. Up to Sept. 1, the mayor
said, 150 warnings were issued, and since then, the police
department has issued 70 summonses, payable without a court
appearance. A fine of up to $100 and court costs of $45 are
provided for, but Mayor Coyne said that fines of only $2 are being
issued now.
</P>
<P>
   The council acted after the police chief ``saw a guy using a
cell phone strike a senior citizen,'' Coyne said. ``Fortunately, no
one was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderman Burton F. Natarus of Chicago introduced his legislation
Nov. 17. It, too, exempts emergency calls and does not rule out
conversation if both of the driver's hands are on the wheel or the
car is parked. The fine would be $25, or $100 if an accident is
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cell phones are part of our lives,'' Natarus said. ``However,
we must adhere to the rules of safety when driving an automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Every driver has personal experience of drivers acting unwisely
while holding a cell phone. But it is more difficult to notice
those behaving similarly who have both hands on the wheel, using a
no-hands model.
</P>
<P>
   Two major bodies of research on this topic exist. On Feb. 13,
1997, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study, made
in Toronto, of links between collisions and car-phone use. The
authors studied 699 drivers who owned cell phones and had been
involved in collisions resulting in substantial property damage.
The authors analyzed calls on the day of the collision and for the
week before, using billing records. The risk of collision was found
to be four times higher during a call.
</P>
<P>
   The study found it made no difference whether a driver used a
hand-held or no-hands model, concluding it is the distraction that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   The other major assessment, published by the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration in 1998, rounds up data, from
state police reports to scientific studies. It said 85 percent of
cell phone users made calls at least occasionally while on the
road, and 27 percent used them on at least half their trips. The
study concluded in a general way that cellular phone use while
driving increased crash risk. ``What remains unknown is the
relative contribution of cellular phone use, per se, and
characteristics of the involved drivers,'' the summary said, citing
the possibilities of ``greater propensity for risk-taking,''
fatigue and inability to divide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the safety agency, said that as a
general rule, ``distraction causes fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The summary and study are on the agency's web site,
www.nhtsa.dot.gov. (Search for ``wireless.'')
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of having a cell phone in the car are undeniable.
Like thousands, I pay a monthly bill and almost never dial anyone,
just to have the instrument when driving alone, or on a long trip.
Charles F. Richmond, a troubleshooter for the Connecticut
Department of Transportation, speaks for many when he says, ``The
cell phone has saved more lives than the ambulances.''
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone industry association presses its motto, ``Safety
is the most important call you will ever make.'' Its safety rules
emphasize a focus on the task of driving. Leaflets and the like are
available from (888) 901-7233 or www.wow-com.com.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA, in its annual ``Digest of Motor Laws,'' provides the
safety ideas given in the adjoining box.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows distraction _ not holding a phone _ is the
villain. If you have to argue with someone, either on the phone or
in person, get off the road.

 &HT;    READ OF THE WEEK: PILL BOOKS
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim and M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you tried an over-the-counter allergy or cold medication
lately? Do you have a new prescription for an antibiotic?
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're taking an over-the-counter or prescription drug,
you should be aware of what you're taking and of any possible side
effects or drug interactions it might have.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable ``Physicians' Desk Reference'' (Medical Economics
Data, 1998, $79.95 hardback), now in its 53rd edition, is the most
inclusive and exhaustive drug reference, but neither the handiest
nor the simplest to understand. Most people probably will get more
out of a pill book geared toward laypersons, such as one of these:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Pill Book'' (Bantam, 1998, $6.99 paper-back)
</P>
<P>
   This guide covers the most frequently prescribed prescription
drugs and has a companion volume, ``The Pill Book Guide to
Over-the-Counter Medications.'' Both have easy-to-use indexes and
color illustrations of the most common pills _ extremely useful if
you're trying to identify a mystery pill in your medicine cabinet.
The guides list warnings, possible side effects and food and drug
interactions for each medicine. They also alert pregnant or
breast-feeding women and elderly people to special concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Complete Drug Reference,'' 2000 (Consumer Reports, 1999,
$44.95 hard-
</P>
<P>
   back)
</P>
<P>
   Dictionary-sized, but worth the extra weight. It comes with
color illustrations of the most common pills and extremely detailed
information. The entry for aspirin, for example, is more than four
pages long. Like Consumer Reports magazine itself, this reference
is easy to read and jargon-free.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Worst Pills, Best Pills'' (Pocket Books, 1999, $16
paperback)
</P>
<P>
   The first page of this book cuts right to the chase with a list
of 14 pairs of drugs that, if taken together, can cause possibly
fatal reactions. The inside cover lists 10 rules for safer drug
use. (Rule 4 is ``Make sure drug therapy is really needed for your
medical condition.'') The book warns strongly against numerous
drugs but includes the sensible warning that people should talk to
their doctor before stopping any medication.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Complete Guide to Prescription and Nonprescription
Drugs'' (Perigee, 1999, $16.95 paperback)
</P>
<P>
   This guide provides basic information in an at-a-glance format.
The lack of illustrations is a drawback, especially considering the
price, but the book includes useful features such as a glossary of
terms.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET SITE OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem with health information on the Internet: It's
hard to know the motives behind the creation of the site you're
looking at, and without that knowledge, it's hard to trust the data
the site presents. Sites may have an ulterior motive, they may be
disguised advertising, or they may, as several studies have
recently documented, simply be getting the facts wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A completely trustworthy health site _ with the added benefits
of excellent design, simple navigation and a nonjudgmental tone _
is Go Ask Alice! (www.goaskalice.columbia.edu). Run by the health
education program at Columbia University in New York, Alice!
accepts questions about health and sexuality through an anonymous
server, answers them frankly and archives the answers for easy
access.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been running since 1993 and gets about 1,000
questions a week. According to the site administrators, survey
responses show that the questioners are parents and teachers as
well as college and high school students. Common questions include
``Can I ask my girlfriend not to drink at college?'', ``My
13-year-old brother has severe depression and my parents won't
listen to me about it'' and ``Can HIV be passed by kissing?''
</P>
<P>
   (Despite its name, the site has no connection to the 1970s
anti-drug book ``Go Ask Alice,'' written by ``Anonymous.'')
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU AWARE ...

Month. For information, contact Mothers Against Drunk Driving at

 &HT;    Surprises to be had in Freeport
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Late-season Hurricane Lenny churned in the
Caribbean, forcing two huge cruise ships to dock in Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers groaned about the unexpected change in course to a
backwater port no one knew anything about. But once on land, they
were far from irate. They roamed the duty-free shops of the
International Bazaar and Lucayan Market, found their own private
spots on more than 120 miles of white sand beaches, and gambled at
the Moroccan-style Princess Resort.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise was the high style of the new Lucayan
Reef Village Hotel. These day guests were awed by the wild shapes
of the Alice-in-Wonderland furniture _ sofas with backs high enough
to accommodate Shaquille O'Neal, club chairs sporting exaggerated
curves and wind-surfer sails attached to the ceiling _ and a
two-story restaurant with chairs and wall paintings in colliding
tropical colors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it was just as impressive _ a replica of aqueduct ruins
running the length of three pools and a sugar mill surrounded by
water.
</P>
<P>
   The most common refrain as the cruise passengers filed through
the lobby: ``This looks like South Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A fashionable couple from New York compared the interior design
and furniture to Miami Beach's chicest hotel, the Delano. High
praise for an island known more for day-trip gamblers wearing gold
chains and polyester than for sophisticated visitors who know an
artistic achievement when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   And this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucayan Reef Village, which opened April 1, is the first
phase of a $300 million resort that, by the end of next year, will
include two more hotels, Lighthouse Pointe and Breakers Cay. The
sprawling resort will have 1,350 rooms and suites, 14 restaurants
and bars, a championship 18-hole golf course designed by Robert
Trent Jones and another 18-hole course that is open, a tennis
complex, spa and fitness center, a movie theater, marine
educational program and casino.
</P>
<P>
   The complex will be called The Lucayan, and guests at all three
hotels will register at the Manor House, a new building in the
center of the complex that will also house a convention center and
fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone familiar with the old Freeport won't recognize the Port
Lucaya area. The Lucayan Reef Village used to be the Radisson
Hotel, which had well-worn public rooms and faded decor.
</P>
<P>
   Next door was the Clarion, which was bulldozed, and farther down
the beach was the Lucayan, which is being transformed into luxury
villas.
</P>
<P>
   The new hotels face a gorgeous white beach and are across the
street from Port Lucaya, which has 85 duty-free stores and 28 bars
and restaurants, including the Illusions Jazz and Comedy Club, all
next to the scenic Bell Channel Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lucayan is not the only hotel on this quiet island known
more for its natural beauty and tacky day tourists than man-made
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark Bahamas Princess Resort includes the Moroccan-style
Princess Tower and the Princess Country Club, which has two 18-hole
championship golf courses, six tennis courts and seven restaurants.
This is the place for gamblers and shoppers. The Tower has a casino
and is next door to the International Bazaar, a labyrinth of shady
lanes with more than 100 duty-free and other shops, and 14
restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the 3-year-old Pelican Bay, a 48-room inn that
looks like a collection of colorful Bahamian houses. The balconies
of the rooms overlook the channel and Port Lucaya market. And next
to the market and channel is the Port Lucaya Resort and Yacht Club,
a small resort with pool, Jacuzzi and marina. This is the place to
stay if you bring your yacht. The beach is just across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Old Bahama Bay, a luxury beach resort, is expected to open this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Bahama Island, only 50 miles from West Palm Beach, is
undergoing a renaissance on the order of Atlantis on Paradise
Island. The owner of the Lucayan resort development is Harbour
Plaza Hotel Management Limited, a Hong Kong-based company that
operates four hotels in Hong Kong and mainland China, including the
Harbour Plaza Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   This sleepy island appears to be waking up.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   _ HOTELS: Room rates at The Lucayan are $115 until Dec. 23,
single or double occupancy. Call a travel agent or (800) 582-2926
or (242) 373-1333 for reservations. Camp Lucaya is open for kids up
to 12 years old. Camp costs $20 a day per child.
</P>
<P>
   _ INFORMATION: For more information about Grand Bahama Island
and the Bahamas, call (800) 4-Bahama (800-422-4262).

WHAT YOUR SURGEON HUMS WHEN YOU'RE NOT LISTENING 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent issue, The Harvard Medical Alumni Bulletin asked
graduates what music they listened to when they operated. Some
answers follow.
</P>
<P>
   At my hospital, classical music tends to predominate, although
the gynecologists seem to like soft rock. One surgeon likes to play
the Grateful Dead during operations in the middle of the night; the
best I can say about that music is that it helps keep me awake.
</P>
<P>
   I think music in the O.R. should be soothing. My taste runs to
classical pieces by Mozart and Haydn, as well as operas by Verdi,
Bizet, Mozart and Rossini.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite operas range from Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' to
Dvorak's ``Rusalka'' to many of Verdi's operas. ``Aida,'' ``La
Traviata'' and ``Rigoletto'' are all solid beauty throughout.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolyn Aldredge, Class of '64, staff anesthesiologist, Mount
Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   I play relaxing music for patients undergoing local anesthesia,
and I allow them to choose the music, hoping they won't pick
country.
</P>
<P>
   When patients are anesthetized in the main O.R., we tend to have
no background music for the tense parts of the case, classical
music for periods of concentration, and rock 'n' roll for opening
and closing.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am occasionally sleep-deprived as a trauma surgeon, I
will sometimes use the music to quiz medical students and residents
about rock 'n' roll trivia. I once had to reassure a student that
this wouldn't affect her grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher C. Baker, '74, head of the trauma section,
department of surgery, University of North Carolina
</P>
<P>
   I was trained in classical violin and percussion. ... Despite my
love of music, I find it distracting in the operating room.
Anesthesiologists are trained to filter out conversation and alarms
and focus on the patient. I have often compared anesthesiologists
with percussionists. Casual observers may think both seem idle and
clueless, but actually they're aware of what everyone else is
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when things go well, no one pays attention, but when a
mistake occurs, everyone notices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edward Chen, '89, assistant in anesthesia, Massachusetts
General Hospital, Boston
</P>
<P>
   I'm a resident. I listen to whatever the attendings damn well
want. Actually, that's not quite true. It's whatever the attendings
want but the nurses don't veto.
</P>
<P>
   One time I got to pick, though. I brought in Violent Femmes.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move. It lasted about three minutes before someone switched
it. No one has let me pick since.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atul Gawande, '94, surgical resident, Brigham and Women's
Hospital, Boston
</P>
<P>
   This is my eighth year of residency, so I'm subjected to
whatever music other people want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   If I had a choice, I'd listen to mostly classical pieces by
Mozart, Beethoven and Vivaldi, because I think most other works are
too distracting. Jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman also is wonderful
in the O.R.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, in stressful moments, I'll ask that the music be
turned off.
</P>
<P>
   During closing, when our work becomes more automatic, popular
music is fine. We'll listen to anything from Pearl Jam to Natalie
Merchant to Barenaked Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Theresa Quinn, '92, surgical resident, University of
California, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   I'm not particularly fond of music in the O.R., but if there is
music, I prefer it to be classical _ especially the symphonies of
Beethoven and Brahms _ and reasonably sedate. There's a rhythm to
operating, and it shouldn't be broken by anything that has a
different rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   _ John M. Head, '50, emeritus professor of surgery, Dartmouth
Medical School, Hanover, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   I like to listen to everything from Vivaldi to the Rolling
Stones. I enjoy the Beatles, Dire Straits, old country tunes _
anything with a good tempo. (If you play the slower baroque music,
you can get bogged down.) I also enjoy Mozart and, depending on how
bold I'm feeling, Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   During induction of the patient, we surgeons defer to the
anesthesiologists, and when things get exciting or require
concentration, we turn the music down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cedric Kavena, '84, staff general surgeon, Phoenix Indian
Medical Center
</P>
<P>
   My first impulse is to answer ``absolute quiet.'' The operating
room should be a silent place of concentration on the welfare of
others, preferably with good air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   I would not object to a few kind words, if not sweet words, from
the members of my team, especially my scrub nurse. But I would not
like to hear any distractions such as grunts or shifting of the
feet by medical students who object to hanging on to a retractor.
</P>
<P>
   As for music, I do answer ``absolutely none.'' If the music is
that of Haydn, Mozart, Bach or Beethoven _ or even if it's good
modern jazz _ it's worth listening to.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't do that and operate at the same time. A little
Gershwin or Cole Porter might be a bit more acceptable. But why
should I listen to some beginner hack his way through ``Rhapsody in
Blue'' when he doesn't even know the proper tempo for the E major
slow movement?
</P>
<P>
   And as for Cole Porter, few modern musicians understand how to
maintain the basic dance rhythm in his wonderful slower pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Music has been too much a part of my life to try to listen to it
with one ear while digging out a liver tumor with both eyes and the
other ear. I am reminded of the time Brahms' ``Variations on a
Theme by Haydn'' was being played while David Hume _ at that time,
a resident at Brigham Hospital _ was operating. Hume muttered, ``I
wish they'd take that third variation a little slower.'''

Alcanter's eyes searched for tourists coming over the international
bridge from El Paso. ``Taxi?'' he asked, jockeying with other cab
drivers for business. Alcanter has seen the news about Mexican and
U.S. officials digging for bodies at two ranches near Juarez, where
they believe victims of the city's long-running drug war are
buried. The latest headlines bother Alcanter, who remains skeptical
of reports of mass graves. ``The publicity, unfortunately, hurts a
lot of families,'' he said. ``The tourists listen to the news, and
they're afraid to come here.'' In the past few years, Juarez, a
blue-collar factory city of almost 2 million people, has been the
scene of more than any city's share of bad news. More than 200
women have been slain in Juarez since 1993, many of them young
factory workers abducted as they returned home from jobs in one of
the city's 330 maquiladoras, the U.S.-owned plants where Mexican
workers assemble products for the American market. The string of
killings, which many Juarez residents suspect are the work of one
or more serial killers, ha-- attracted worldwide attention. (Austin

`HILLARY'S CHOICE': AS SHEEHY SEES IT, HILLARY IS ADDICTED TO THE
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her new book, ``Hillary's Choice,'' Gail Sheehy puts the
first lady on the shrink's couch. In the course of the book Ms.
Sheehy ends up sounding a lot like Dr. Joyce Brothers while her
subject comes across as an Oprah guest: a woman who loves too much
and plays Wendy to her husband's Peter Pan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheehy's assessment: that Hillary Rodham Clinton is addicted
to her husband, Bill, that ``he is her only rebellion, the one
thing she can't logically explain,'' that she sought in him the
approval her withholding father never gave her but found herself
``living out the same dynamic'' with another ``emotionally
unavailable'' man. ``When her accomplishments overshadowed
Clinton's,'' the author of ``Passages'' writes, ``he would punish
her in his own way _ by philandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, however, steadfastly stood by her man because, Ms.
Sheehy contends, she was practiced in the art of denial and had
decided long ago to hold on to her ``life strategy in service of a
larger agenda.'' That strategy, in Ms. Sheehy's words, was ``to
take the raw material of this brilliant, emotionally battered child
with a good heart and a desperate ambition and shape him into a
political star to which she could hitch her wagon full of dreams
for changing the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a Hillary to raise a president,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from such pseudo-psychoanalytic musings and some new
tidbits of gossip (an interview with a college boyfriend who
implies that the young Miss Rodham might have smoked marijuana; the
suggestion that in 1989 Bill Clinton had ``fallen in love'' with a
tall blonde named Marilyn Jo Denton Jenkins), ``Hillary's Choice''
simply rehashes the now familiar story of the Clintons' marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Sheehy did more than 400 interviews for this book,
relying particularly heavily, it would seem, on the consultant Dick
Morris and a former Clinton aide, Betsey Wright, her narrative
remains deeply indebted to earlier studies of the Clintons and the
Clinton presidency, most notably, George Stephanopoulos' ``All Too
Human,'' and David Maraniss' two books, ``First in His Class'' and
``The Clinton Enigma.'' Many of the firsthand observations of Mrs.
Clinton in this book come from interviews Ms. Sheehy conducted with
her for a 1992 profile in Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's Choice'' paints a now familiar portrait of an
administration riven by internal conflict, a narcissistic president
unable to control his impulsive behavior, and a first lady given to
stonewalling and an us-vs.-them mentality. Mrs. Clinton, we are
told once again, is smart, tough, ambitious and self-righteous, a
perfectionist who would rather fight than compromise. Her husband,
we are reminded, is a conciliator who takes a relativistic approach
to policy and the truth and likes to play the role of victim.
</P>
<P>
   She is the cerebral, analytic strategist; he is the charming
retail politician. She is an absolutist; he is `` Situational
Ethics.'' He is ``the eternal boy,'' stuck ``in an adolescent
orientation toward life''; she is the ``den mother'' and chief
``enabler,'' ``the Valkyrie who was always ready to lift her
wounded barefoot boy from the battlefield and fly him to
Valhalla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that Hillary the Wife suffered but steeled
herself when Bill betrayed her,'' Ms. Sheehy writes. ``She had to
put on her Hillary the Partner hat to defend and deny and sweep up
behind him; she was a high-status abused wife. But it became
increasingly apparent in their White House years that when Bill
misbehaved sexually, it could be a win-win situation for both
Hillary the Wife and Hillary the Partner. She is elevated to the
iconic status of a secular saint and Bill looks like the
troublemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Sheehy's telling, Hillary the Wife gets an added bonus
whenever her husband is in trouble: ``Every time he gets caught,''
she writes, ``Clinton concentrates his sexual magnetism on his wife
for a change. Still insecure about her feminine attraction, she is
once again courted and seduced. He promises (lies) whatever is
necessary to get out of the doghouse. Whatever the exact words and
body language he uses, they give credibility to her fantasy that
everything will be different in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Sheehy's opinion that Clinton did not come clean to
his wife about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky until
days before his grand jury testimony and that for months he had
sent Hillary ``out into the world to lie for him, to risk her own
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond conventional explanations of the president's
ability to ``compartmentalize'' his life, Ms. Sheehy quotes an
anonymous ``mental health professional'' who suggests that the
president may suffer from ``dissociative identities,'' a disorder
also known as ``multiple personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   In another passage that appears to be pure speculation,
buttressed with no supporting quotes or sourcing, Ms. Sheehy adds:
``Hillary was wretched. She could no longer reconcile her view of
herself as a devout Christian with her complicity in this debauched
marriage. Something would have to change. Drastically. For all
Clinton's protestations of repentance, she could not count on him
to change: she had heard it all before. No, this time the change
would have to be in her.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, 1999, the day the Senate voted on the impeachment
charges, Mrs. Clinton met with her husband's former political
strategist, Harold M. Ickes, to discuss her possible run for a U.S.
Senate seat from New York. Ms. Sheehy quotes Ickes as saying,
``This is a race for redemption''; winning the seat would ``permit
her supporters to say there was a lot more here than anybody
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a Senate seat would help erase memories of
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Mrs. Clinton's failed health care
initiative and her anti-feminist role as a long-suffering wife in
the Lewinsky melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Sheehy, Hillary Clinton's decision to step out from
behind her husband's shadow fits perfectly into a ``Passages''
paradigm: It meant she had ``come through the little death of
midlife'' and ``stood up against shame and scorn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons were also entering a new and natural
developmental stage in the lives of couples _ what I call the
`Couple Crossover' at middle life,'' Ms. Sheehy writes. ``As women
age, they become more independent, aggressive and political. It is
natural for couples to experience a switch of polarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the reader quickly wearies of Ms. Sheehy's penchant for
perky psychobabble jargon, it somehow seems fitting that the
Clintons with their protean identities should be the politicians
subjected to her armchair psychoanalysis. Bill Clinton, after all,
once remarked that character ``is a journey, not a destination''
and he has repeatedly bailed himself out of trouble by invoking the
recovery movement belief that mistakes and transgressions are pit
stops on the road to redemption.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for Hillary Rodham Clinton, she has tried on and discarded
personas almost as frequently as she has changed hairdos, shedding
and retrieving her maiden name and trying on the roles of health
care maven, Vogue cover girl, non-cookie-baking policy wonk,
cuckolded martyr and now, would-be senator with varying degrees of
aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   In college, Ms. Sheehy reports, Hillary Rodham similarly toyed
with a variety of identities: ``educational and social reformer,
alienated academic, involved pseudo-hippie,'' and ``compassionate
misanthrope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder who is me,'' she wrote a friend in 1968. ``I wonder
if I'll ever meet her. If I did, I think we'd get along famously.''

`CENSORED!' IS SUITABLE FOR BLUENOSES, FANCY PANTS, BREWERS,
WHATEVER 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for evidence that vintage sex and violence along with
scenes of whiskey and drug binges and assorted naughtiness used to
be a lot more fun than much of what is cluttering the screen these
days? Look no further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censored!'' on American Movie Classics is an hour's worth of
drug fiends and vamps (that's Theda Bara writhing seductively on
the floor), pratfalls and barroom brawls and batterings, belly
dances and smoochings from the silent-movie era. Anybody this side
of Gary Bauer ought to get a laugh out of them.
</P>
<P>
   The clips, which incited protests from the censoriously inclined
circa 1898 to 1922, have turned into treasures for movie buffs.
Unfortunately, sound is added Tuesday night in the form of a
narration that for no discernible reason uses two commentators _
the director Oliver Stone and the actor William Baldwin _ who
deliver the same simple message in much the same way: Censorship is
bad.
</P>
<P>
   That is an easy message to agree with, but the script doesn't
dig very strenuously into the conflicting pressures over a tough
issue. It settles in part for a jejune Marxism, as the narrators (I
couldn't tell one from the other) argue that censorship has been a
tool of the exploiting class to shield the moviegoing public from
unpleasant realities of American life, war, political finaglings,
labor relations and sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There is some truth here; bluenoses have often tried to keep the
masses from the crude pleasures and rude truths of popular
entertainments. And yes, agitation over movies about drug and
alcohol addiction did tend to focus on the underclass _ immigrants,
blacks and slum dwellers in general _ while upper-class addiction
was ignored. Still, brewers came to the defense of the less
privileged boozers by protesting that the portrayal of drunks in
movies (there's Charlie Chaplin flopping gracefully around) were
giving saloons a bad name. Who were the true exploiters, the saloon
keepers or the Prohibitionists?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, America's main exercise in movie censorship, the Hays
Code, a k a the Breen Office, which began in the 1930s and lasted
for a couple of decades, originated not in corporate boardrooms but
among Roman Catholic parishioners obedient to their hierarchy's
call for a boycott of disapproved material. If we are searching for
class categories, this was a remarkably successful populist
insurrection against the Hollywood moguls.
</P>
<P>
   The anticensorship forces have, over time, won most of the legal
wars. But in a society that puts a high premium on unfettered
expression yet is chronically concerned over the impact of what is
expressed, this running controversy cannot be readily reduced to a
class struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful have been known to use their powers to suppress
their enemies when they can get away with it, but matters like
changing standards, divergent tastes, commercial interests and the
unsettled, perhaps unsettleable relationship between mass
entertainment and personal behavior go beyond class. Silent-screen
movie villains, after all, were often takeoffs on the fancy-pants
set; see the way they twirled their mustaches. (Speaking of the
impact on personal behavior, one of the perils of the early movies,
some reformers held, was the ``movie masher,'' the fellow who took
the opportunity in the darkened theater to emulate what was
happening on the screen.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Censored!'' is on strongest ground in dealing with official
restrictions on news coverage in World War I and the apparent ban
on the spread of information about birth control among poor women
that kept Margaret Sanger's ideas off the screen for a half
century. (A Pennsylvania official opined that it ``would be
criminal to undeceive kids who believed in storks.'') But changes
stirred by the women's movement and by movie fashions cut across
class lines. Upper-class women were prominent in promoting birth
control among the less privileged, and moviegoers of all ilks
seemed willing to settle for ``Traffic in Souls,'' a hit when white
slavery was a popular topic.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Censored!'' reaches ``The Birth of a Nation'' (1915), its
class compass is of no use at all. Here is an acknowledged
masterpiece that is also an acknowledged exercise in anti-black
propaganda. It may be the most banned movie in history. So how are
the producers of ``Censored,'' opposed equally to racism and to
censorship, to handle it?
</P>
<P>
   The program settles for the line that Stone has used as a refuge
from criticisms of some of his own work. Having been pummeled for
distorting or inventing history in ``J.F.K.,'' his fantasy about
the John F. Kennedy assassination, he uses ``art'' as his defense.
Given D.W. Griffith's status in movie history, the artistic
argument for ``The Birth of a Nation'' is more forceful than
anything Stone can advance on his own behalf as a propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   The art defense, popular though it understandably is among
enemies of censorship, might be more useful for opening a
discussion than for censoring one before it fairly gets started. If
a connection can be made, say, between crime and certain movies or
between fatherless children and certain music, must society just
bear it? Does artistic expression or aspiration or pretension trump
every social calamity?
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion offered Tuesday tonight, that art, if great
enough, needs no excuses or that art, of the right sort, can
inspire the right kind of change, or that Griffith's epic
``Intolerance'' somehow compensates for ``The Birth of a Nation,''
or any implication that a Stone can shelter under the genius of a
Griffith seems merely evasive.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Censored!'' finally gives up on justification by art and
settles for the easy conclusion that ``We create the marketplace''
and ``If you really don't want it, don't buy it!'' Choosing allies
when it comes to censorship can be uncomfortable, and this sounds
like a copout by the masters and minions of Hollywood.

FRIST SAYS CONGRESS WILL FIND WAYS TO FINANCE MEDICAL TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By JUDY HOLLAND   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Bill Frist, the only physician in the Senate
and a key force in crafting health-care policy for Republicans,
predicted Monday that Congress will find new ways to pay for
training medical residents at U.S. teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in Medicare funding have squeezed federal reimbursements to
the nation's 400 teaching hospitals at the same time that managed
health-care plans have cut back their payments to the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, a Republican from Tennessee and a transplant surgeon
before he became active in politics, said senators are looking for
new ways to help struggling teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reaching out to establish a much broader payment
source,'' Frist said, speaking at a Capitol Hill forum on who
should pay for educating physicians. The panel was sponsored by the
Alliance for Health Reform, a nonpartisan education group. Frist is
vice chairman and Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D.W-Va., is chairman of
the group. The Commonwealth Fund, a philanthropy that focuses on
health issues, also underwrote the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, who chairs the public health panel of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said many members of
Congress believe the hospitals may need funding beyond the $7
billion a year they receive in Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration last month approved a
federal budget that will restore about $1 billion in Medicare money
to teaching hospitals. Congress cut that funding in 1997 when it
balanced the federal budget. Teaching hospitals hailed the
``give-back'' as a major victory, which would bolster their
institutions for two years, but said they need more funding to
survive beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has introduced legislation
that would create a trust fund to finance medical residents'
training through a fee on health insurance premiums of managed care
providers, private insurers and large employers. Such a fund would
also include existing Medicare and Medicaid money earmarked to pay
for resident training.
</P>
<P>
   Frist indicated he preferred a different approach under which
Congress would vote specific appropriations for teaching hospitals
for several years at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Helms, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute,
a conservative Washington think tank, said the federal government
shouldn't have a permanent entitlement fund to pay for the training
of physicians, ``who turn out to be some of the wealthiest members
of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Helms said, the institutions should have to go to
battle every year in the appropriations process in which Congress
decides which programs should get federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be appropriate to return this to an appropriations
process,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Blumenthal, a Harvard Medical School professor, said
the country's resident training system is ``becoming unglued''
because of funding problems.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal told the panel that it costs about 30 percent more to
care for a patient in a teaching hospital than it does elsewhere
because of extra costs related to training medical residents,
conducting clinical research and caring for a larger load of sicker
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the extra services offered at teaching hospitals
``are public goods that have value but aren't marketable,'' adding
that a ``reliable and predictable'' source of money is needed to
keep them afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Ross, executive director of the Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission, a nonpartisan agency that advises Congress on Medicare
issues, said teaching hospitals need special financial help to pay
for the extra quality they provide.
</P>
<P>
   Ross expressed concern that the current system of federal
reimbursement is based on the number of residents per hospital with
the result that teaching hospitals train more residents than they
need, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to get the payment formula away from the number
of residents,'' he said.

   CAMPAIGN-COST _ WASHINGTON _ As Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton pursue their political travels, taxpayers are footing most
of the bill. Just paying for their military airplanes costs more
than $4,000 an hour for her and $10,000 an hour for him. Campaign
reimbursements don't come close to the real cost and have ``always
been frankly ridiculous,'' said the head of one private watchdog
group. One escape: candidates using corporate jets, which also
brings controversy. And in the case of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, it's the increased cost of security that's raising
questions. (Malone).

Well, the Israeli police commander has forbidden his officers from

deported foreigners believed to be a little too fervent about the
end of time. Also, the head of a Jerusalem mental ward expects

safety efforts have focused on the infamous 0157:H7 strain that
killed two children in the Jack-In-The-Box outbreak in 1993, its
toxic cousins _ strains once found only overseas _ have begun
appearing here. ``I've been screaming about the non-0157 strains

control of a strategic Virginia ridge overlooking the Potomac

government's own records also found that in some parts of the
country over 20 percent of the scheduled federal inspections are
never done because of manpower shortages. (Montgomery and Jaspin).

   MIDEAST-TRAVEL-$ADV18 _ A review of what's going on at the

orthodox Christians believe Christ was crucified, the five
bickering denominations in charge are trying to agree on where to
place an exit door _ the first change in the church in years. In
Bethlehem, the Palestinians have rebuilt the plaza and torn down
the ugly old British jail next to the church. (Kaplow).
</P>
<P>
   With MIDEAST-TRAVELAGENTS-$ADV18 _ JERUSALEM _ It took the
millennium to make it happen, but for the first time Israelis and
Palestinians have formed a travel agency together. They hope to
cash in on a boom of tourists that has so far prompted mostly
bitter and unproductive competition between the two sides.
Generally, Israelis are trying to steer tourists to their Christian
sites and hotels, and the Palestinians are trying to do the same.

   CHINA-MACAU-$ADV19_ MACAU - The checkered history of this
indolent old Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are
weeping as the China prepares to take over. Four hundred years ago
Macau was far richer. Portuguese traders dined on plates of gold
because for a century Portugal had a world monopoly on trade in
silk, gold, porcelain and silver with Japan and China. Twelve years
ago, China and Portugal had no trouble agreeing that the Portuguese
should end their occupation just before the millennium. Both sides
have stuck to this pact with little friction. And so on the evening
of December 19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau and China are due
to gather here just before midnight to toast the end of nearly 450
years of Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau
cathedral strikes 12 times, Portugal will lower its flag on the
last and oldest Western enclave in Asia. (Kunstel/Albright).

to kick up a new round of debate among worried conservatives.
Critics have never been comfortable with the deal brokered 23 years
ago by then U.S. President Jimmy Carter, fearing the Panamanians
will overcharge ships using the canal and possibly hamstring the
U.S. military. Lately, they've been outraged at a deal cut by the
Panamanians to let a Hong Kong company run the busy ports at either
end of the 50-mile-long canal, saying the company is a front for
the Chinese military. Meanwhile Panamanians plan elaborate
ceremonies for an event they believe will showcase their emergence
on the world stage and symbolize their autonomy after decades of
U.S. domination. Worried that the millennium will overshadow their
moment of glory, the government will hold ceremonies Dec. 13 and
14. It isn't yet clear who will represent the U.S., as Pres.
Clinton seems shy of showing up for a giveaway that might hamper Al
Gore's campaign. (Williams).
</P>
<P>
   With CANAL-SIDE-$ADV26 _ PANAMA CITY _ How vital is the canal to
the United States, and does the hand-over harm us militarily or
economicallly? (Williams).
</P>
<P>
   (Tentative). With CANAL-CARTER-$ADV26 _ A sidebar on Jimmy
Carter, who negotiated the canal's return to Panama. How will
history treat the controversial treaty? Is it the sign of a world
power secure enough in its position to give up control of a vital
trade link, or does it symbolize a waning of U.S. dominance?
(Williams).
</P>
<P>
   CANAL-IMPACT-$ADV26 _ PANAMA CITY _ What does the turn-over mean
to average Panamanians? Thousands who have lived and worked for
decades in the canal zone at U.S. military bases have lost their
jobs as the bases have closed, while dozens of businesses with
contracts to provide services at the bases now have no employer.
Bars and restaurants that once catered to free-spending G.I.'s will
have to find new customers, while the Panamanian government must
find uses for several large tracts of land once occupied by the
U.S. While the
</P>
<P>
   turnover is a point of national pride for Panama, many average
citizens may regret the U.S. pull-out. (Williams).

   GORE-ODD _ WASHINGTON - Adviser Naomi Wolf suggested that Vice
President Al Gore let his ``oddness'' shine through his formal
nature. She explained that Gore was the kind of visionary person
who could see around corners. But Gore has always been viewed as a
little too New Age-ish, from the ``shuttle method'' for choosing
the sex of children to relying on get-in-touch-with-your-feelings
facilitators. Is Al Gore just too weird to be president? (Shepard).

 &HT;    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TO REPLACE BAD SOFTWARE
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The flawed computer software that lost track of
billions of dollars at the Education Department will be replaced by
2001, department officials told Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Procedures and personnel changes already adopted within the
department will also help avoid a repetition of the fiscal fiasco
revealed last month by the department's outside auditors, said
Marshall Smith, acting deputy secretary of education. It is even
possible that the next audit will show the books are accurate, he
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the glass as one-half full, but I see it as
three-fourths empty,'' responded Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich.,
chairman of the House subcommittee for education investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Hoekstra said the proposed fixes will have to be implemented by
a department that has a ``pretty sorry'' record. Among other
things, fiscal experts testified that the department spent more
than $5 million on accounting software that doesn't work, failed to
reconcile its balances until the end of the year and either failed
to supply or was months late in applying information to its outside
auditors.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour hearing , Smith had one consolation: All
the fiscal experts who testified said they hadn't found any signs
that the bookkeeping mess was caused by stealing or illegal misuse
of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they found that the department had a ``competency
challenge,'' said Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., who accepted
Smith's explanations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Bob Schaffer, R-Colo., said he remained convinced
that some of the discrepancies uncovered by the outside auditors
must have been due to ``waste, fraud or abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, more than eight months after its audit report for
the 1998 fiscal year was due, the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young
announced it would not express any opinion at all on the accuracy
of the department's books.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the report in which Ernst &AMP; Young
justified its decision:
</P>
<P>
   _ Department officials never could explain one $6 billion
discrepancy between two of its internal accounting systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ After a great deal of effort, the department finally learned
that a $1 billion difference between its records and those in the
Treasury Department came about when a transfer of half a billion
dollars was entered backwards by the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than one-fifth of the more than $500 million in one
account should have been kept in a separate account. The department
couldn't explain the source or purposes of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lax security procedures and features left the department's
centralized accounting records open to interference by insiders or
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lampley, the partner who directed the Ernst &AMP; Young
audit team, said most of the problems seemed to be caused by the
bad software, loss of experienced workers in the department's
financial office, and the department's attempts to cope with two
new government-wide reporting requirements while repairing the
flawed software.
</P>
<P>
   When the company that made the software was sold to another firm
that wasn't interested in that kind of business, it became hard to
get help with the software's problems, several witnesses said.

 &HT;    Giving credit where credit's due: MindSpring outlasts
competition
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T, which was one of the world's biggest monopolies
until its breakup in 1984, seemed to be headed that way anew.
</P>
<P>
   By buying about half the cable franchises, serving 27 percent of
the subscribers, AT&AMP;T seemed poised to dominate a huge sector of
the communications market, using high-speed Internet access as a
major lure.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders, from mayors to county commissioners, joined
hands with consumer groups to protest that the communications giant
was about to acquire a choke hold on the hottest and fastest
growing area of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was especially acute in Atlanta because AT&AMP;T is on the
verge of acquiring MediaOne, a national player that happens to be
Atlanta's major cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   By offering its customers a package of communications services
at an attractive price, AT&AMP;T seemed poised to grab a huge share of
the market with a combination of video, Internet access, and
several phone lines to each house _ not to speak of a nice
long-distance tie-in. At the same time it would exclude individual
businesses like MindSpring from offering a competitive option or
having any share of that business through that broad, high-speed
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was about to become Ma Bell all over again, or so it
seemed.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend AT&AMP;T changed course. And adopted a new
theme song. The company said it might be better off, really, by
allowing MindSpring and other service providers to drum up
business, boost marketing and bring their own customers to the AT&AMP;T
cable party.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened _ did AT&AMP;T revisit economics? Or did management
read the history books on how AT&AMP;T bought like blazes in the 1970's
to keep other companies off their telephone network only to lose in
the end with the breakup of the company?
</P>
<P>
   The latter possibility seems more persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, including Chairman
William E. Kennard, has endorsed the principle of competition but
have said they expect the marketplace to work out the terms. As it
happens, the commission and the Justice Department are reviewing
the bid by AT&AMP;T to acquire MediaOne to see if it is
anti-competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Localities like Portland, Oregon, have taken on AT&AMP;T's cable
operations, suing for open access. Portland won a decision favoring
open access, but it is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, BellSouth and other telephone companies are
proceeding with their own appealing solution to high speed Internet
access, called Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL. The quickened pace
of DSL development looms as a considerable competitor with cable
technology, especially since phone companies have more live direct
connections to homes than the cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is so concerned about that logistical advantage that it now
plans to develop high-speed wireless Internet systems to businesses
and homes, to cover places they may not reach with their cable
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   And so now, for whatever reason, AT&AMP;T says it will allow all
Internet service providers to come in and work out deals to offer
their service by way of cable.
</P>
<P>
   This all bears watching, however. The devil is in the details _
and competition will come only if AT&AMP;T offers workable and
acceptable terms for opening its pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that AT&AMP;T stands to benefit from a smoother,
faster transition into its new business as a cable company and
telecommunications company all rolled into one. Hitting the ground
running appears to be a higher priority now than fighting for a
protected preserve.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring, which stayed at the bargaining table with AT&AMP;T when
others lost the faith or doubted the outcome, is due plenty of
credit for successfully arguing the case for open access.

differently, Wayne Zimmerman would have been waiting expectantly
and nervously for the Mars Polar Lander's mechanical arm to start
digging in the planet's cold ground, searching for evidence of
water ice. He was the lead engineer for electronics on the team
that developed and tested the 6.5-foot arm.
</P>
<P>
   As the grim reality of the lander's apparent loss settled in on
Monday, Zimmerman paid a visit to the ``Mars yard'' here at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. There, on a bed of simulated red Mars soil,
stood a mock-up of the vehicle that has been assembled to head out
in 2001 for the next landing attempt. Its robot arm was almost
identical to the one on the ill-starred polar lander.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was an occasion for mourning and reflection and also
worry that the $165-million mission's failure could prompt public
and congressional criticism of the entire Mars exploration program,
including possible calls for severe cutbacks. The gloom was doubly
thick because in September the lander's companion craft, Mars
Climate Orbiter, was lost as it approached the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just crestfallen,'' Zimmerman said. ``Man, it's
tough when you put that much work for years into designing,
building and testing, it's hard to lose it all. Not to have an
opportunity to do that science is pretty depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with each passing hour, little hope remained that flight
controllers would somehow establish radio contact with the missing
polar lander. A listening opportunity early Monday morning, the
sixth since the spacecraft's landing attempt on Friday, again
produced nothing but silence. Another effort, perhaps the last on
which controllers are pinning much hope, would be made early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nearing the point where we've used up our final silver
bullets,'' Richard Cook, the project manager, said after the latest
attempt to pick up radio signals from the polar lander.
</P>
<P>
   Mission officials said that they had also abandoned much hope of
receiving any transmissions from the two small probes that were
supposed to penetrate the Martian ground at about the same time of
the lander's arrival. They were designed to examine the subsurface
for signs of water ice.
</P>
<P>
   The search for water by both the probes and the lander was an
effort to answer the consuming question about Mars: Could life have
arisen there in the past? Water is considered essential for life,
and other research has shown that some water ice and vapor exist on
Mars and may have been more abundant and in liquid form at an
earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's apparent failure has been acutely painful for
others, like Zimmerman, who have invested years, sometimes decades
of their careers, on Mars exploration. Dr. Richard Zurek, the chief
scientist for the project, found himself a three-time loser. He was
also chief scientist for the lost climate orbiter and an
investigator on the $1-billion Mars Observer, which disappeared
mysteriously in 1993 as it arrived at the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Paige, one of the leading mission scientists from the
University of California at Los Angeles, had now lost years of work
and millions of dollars in instruments on three separate failed
missions to Mars over the last decade. He had been hoping to follow
in the footsteps of his father as a polar explorer. David Paige
Sr., the scientist son said, was an artist who accompanied Adm.
Richard Byrd to Antarctica in 1933. The lander was making the first
attempt to reach the polar region of another world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Murray, a planetary geologist at the California
Institute of Technology, felt time running out on him. Nearly three
decades ago, he predicted that volumes of water were probably
frozen in the Martian polar regions and beneath the surface. This
was his first chance, at the age of 68, to learn more about the
abundance and behavior of water on Mars, now and possibly in the
past. And there is no follow-up polar mission in future plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very special time,'' Murray had said the day before
the polar lander's scheduled arrival, meaning for science and for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mission officials have so far deflected questions about the
implications of the lander's failure for future Mars exploration as
premature. But Zimmerman, standing in the Mars yard, said he feared
a public reaction that might cripple the program. ``People must
understand how difficult these things are,'' he said. ``It's like a
contact sport and your playing field is the whole solar system and
its full of hazards and unknowns.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy developed last year, NASA laid plans for two
missions to Mars at each launching opportunity, which comes every
26 months, for the net decade. The 2001 missions are to be an
orbiter and lander similar in design and capabilities to the failed
missions this fall. But the next lander would set down near the
equator and would carry a roving vehicle much like the one on Mars
Pathfinder in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Following that, in 2003, will be the beginning of missions aimed
at returning soil and rock samples from Mars, conducted with the
help of European space agencies. A rover dispatched that year would
collect samples and rocket them into a Mars orbit. Two years later,
another rover would gather more samples into a container and send
them into orbit. An American-French spacecraft in 2005 would
retrieve the two sample containers and bring them to Earth by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Unspoken by the polar lander mission officials so far, but on
the minds of their colleagues, is the question about an underlying
premise of this exploration strategy. To reduce costs and risks of
a single failure undermining the whole effort, Daniel Goldin, the
NASA administrator, instituted a ``faster, cheaper, better'' policy
for planetary exploration. The question is whether the policy has
forced engineers to sacrifice reliability by cutting corners to
stay within tight budgets.
</P>
<P>
   As Zimmerman reflected on the loss of a mission and spoke of
these concerns for the future, he switched on power to the
mechanical arm designed for the next planned landing on Mars. He
commanded the arm to scoop up soil and lift it to the top of the
spacecraft mockup. He was back being an engineer worrying about an
exploring machine, not the politics of planetary exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I have another chance,'' he said. ``I'm working on a
rover and this robot arm for Mars '01.''

 &HT;    Excite At Home prepared for competition
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even for Excite At Home, an Internet start-up
accustomed to the pirouette of the online industry, Monday was a
wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   First the company announced it had hit a milestone, signing up 1
million customers for its online service. It is one of two networks
that use digital cable TV networks rather than telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time AT&AMP;T, its largest shareholder, announced it
would permit online competitor MindSpring to use its lines to offer
high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, this isn't important to Excite At Home,''
says Bruce Leichtman, a media analyst at industry consultant Yankee
Group. ``But long term it means a new competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite At Home is no stranger to competition. The Silicon
Valley-based company has waged an uphill battle to persuade online
users to try its service during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Excite At Home and Road Runner, the second major network of that
kind, offer online access through digital cable networks. These
networks provide a connection up to 100 times faster than is
possible with conventional telephone lines. That enables
lightning-fast viewing and downloading of such things as movie
clips and songs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this advantage, Excite At Home and Road Runner have
had a hard time signing up customers. One reason is that only a
small percentage of all cable networks have been rebuilt with the
fiber-optic lines necessary to carry digital traffic such as
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts are predicting, at best, a total of 2 million
cable TV Internet customers by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   While an underdog compared with online giant America Online,
Excite At Home has been gaining momentum. Today the service is in
more than 100 markets. Its largest markets include much of New
Jersey, Baltimore, Dallas-Forth Worth, San Diego, the San Francisco
Bay area and Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Excite At Home typically enters a market through an exclusive
contract with one of three big cable TV operators: Atlanta-based
Cox Communications, Comcast and AT&AMP;T, which bought cable operator
Tele-Communications Inc. last year.
</P>
<P>
   These cable operators initially invested in Excite At Home to
help its online technology become the country's standard for
Internet connections in the future. Cox Communications and Comcast
each own 12 percent of Excite At Home while AT&AMP;T owns 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has differed with Cox Communications and Comcast about the
future of Excite At Home. It wants the online service to be a dumb
pipeline and not a provider of content. AT&AMP;T has also said it will
not renew its exclusive contract, which expires in 2002, with
Excite At Home.
</P>
<P>
   That has freed AT&AMP;T to sign up other services such as MindSpring
to use the company's digital networks to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Excite At Home executives could not be reached for
comment, observers of the company don't believe the MindSpring deal
will hurt Excite At Home.
</P>
<P>
   Says Leichtman, ``What counts long term is that Excite At Home
establishes itself as a competitor, and it should be strong enough
to stand on its own by 2002.''

PYSCHE (Washington) - More than a dozen psychiatric evaluations of
Arizona Sen. John McCain reveal a driven man. He was driven to
escape the shadow of his father, a Navy admiral, and when he was
released from his Vietnam captivity, he was determined to overcome
his problems without the aid of psychiatric counseling, even though
he had twice made feeble attempts to kill himself while he was a
prisoner. He has an `overdeveloped super-ego,'' according a
psychological assessment and an `unrealistically high need for
achievement.'' ''He may tend to expect too much of himself, and
take it hard when/if things don't go as planned,'' said one MD in a
psychological assessment. In self-evaluations, when asked what
others may not like about him, McCain wrote, `Quick temper.'' By
JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The reporter from Atlanta wanted to know
what the problem was between Arizona Sen. John McCain and ``The

I were them, I'd say the same thing. It's like this: Every reporter

 MINNIE WARD, 114, EX-TEACHER; BELIEVED OLDEST BOSTON RESIDENT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ Minnie B. (Smith) Ward, a former teacher who was
reputed to be the oldest resident of Boston, died Thursday in
Sherrill House in Boston. She was 114.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ward was born on her father's farm in Brownsville, Texas,
on Nov. 19, 1885, the year of President Ulysses S. Grant's death.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Roger Williams College in Nashville, Tenn.,
in 1903, the year Wilbur and Orville Wright built their first
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Early in life she was a teacher of English history and
dressmaking in the schoolhouse her father founded in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   She married the Rev. Cassius Ward in 1911, when she was 26 years
old. At the time a Model T Ford cost $850 and the first skyscraper,
the 47-story Singer building, had just been built in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their wedding, her husband was assigned to
Ebenezer Baptist Church in Boston. ``It was very different for
me,'' Mrs. Ward said in a story published in the Globe on Jan. 15,
1998, ``because my hometown was a small town and Boston, of course,
was not. Back home people were still using horses and buggies, and
riding on horseback. It was quite a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, she and her family moved to Pittsburgh, where Ward had
taken a pastorate. They lived there for nine years. After her
husband died of a heart problem in 1937, Mrs. Ward and her children
moved back to Boston, and she took a job as a cook at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   After her retirement from Boston University she became involved
in affairs for the elderly, and was a founding member of the Boston
Council of Elders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she was honored by Mayor Thomas M. Menino as the city's
oldest resident at a ceremony held in her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep on keepin' on. I feel quite present. It's hard to think
of it all sometimes. It's been such a long, long time,'' said Mrs.
Ward in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a daughter, Hertha W. Taylor of Indianapolis; two
sons, Cassius A. of Detroit and John A. of Boston; 15
grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.

ZIFF-DAVIS SELLS MAJOR PUBLICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trade publishing giant Ziff-Davis continues to disassemble its
media empire, selling off major publications including PC Week in
an effort to salvage its sagging stock price, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, the private investment firm Willis Stein &AMP; Partners
agreed to pay $780 million in cash for Ziff-Davis' widely acclaimed
publishing unit _ which includes PC Magazine, the world's No. 1
computer trade magazine, and PC Computing, the nation's No. 2
computer consumer monthly. It also includes Interactive Week, an
Internet weekly magazine, and Yahoo! Internet Life, a popular
Internet consumer magazine title.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines have been considered bibles for computer buyers
everywhere, although ad sales have languished some in recent years
as the high-tech frontier has shifted from personal computers to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason for the sale, company executives said
Monday, was Ziff-Davis' depressed stock price, which had been
weighed down by staggering corporate debt and a ``balance sheet
that didn't make sense to anybody on Wall Street,'' a company
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis last summer hired Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to help
find ways to get its stock price up. And in August, the company
sold ZD Market Intelligence, its market research unit, to direct
marketing company Harte-Hanks Inc. for $106 million. The company
expects to close the sale of its ZD Education and its interest in
ZDTV before the end of the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step toward our goal of unlocking value for
our shareholders,'' Eric Hippeau, Ziff-Davis chairman and chief
executive, said of Monday's sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis said it would retain the publications Computer
Shopper and its ownership interest in Red Herring, a Silicon Valley
venture capital magazine. It will also keep its Internet
properties, traded under the separate tracking stock of ZDNet. The
deal includes an arrangement in which ZDNet will pay royalties to
use Ziff-Davis Publishing content on line for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ziff-Davis fell 1 3/16 to 17 1/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange. ZDNet shares fell 1 1/2 to 21 3/8, also on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   PC Week _ a highly successful news and buying guide for
corporate computer administrators published in Medford, Mass. _
isn't expected to be immediately effected by the sale.
</P>
<P>
   A business plan to ``grow'' the magazine over the next five to
seven years, presented to magazine editors by Willis Stein &AMP;
Partners in a conference call was well received, an editor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed enthusiastic and have a good plan in mind,'' the
editor said.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Stein said it named James Dunning Jr. as chairman and
chief executive of the publishing group. Dunning formerly ran
Petersen, the largest US publisher of special interest magazines.
He was executive vice president at Ziff-Davis predecessor Ziff
Communications, from 1984 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing unit transaction is expected to close in the
first quarter of 2000 and is subject to financing and other
conditions, the company said.

COURT TO REVIEW MIRANDA WARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By MARK HELM   c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
federal agents are required to read criminal suspects the so-called
Miranda warning telling them that they have a right to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   The warning has become familiar through movies and television:
You have a right to remain silent and to have a lawyer even if you
can't afford one, and anything you say may be held against you in
court.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a case involving a Maryland man who made
self-incriminating statements to the FBI, the justices agreed to
decide if the comments can be used as evidence in his bank-robbery
trial even if the agents did not first read him the warning.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are more than three decades of court precedent aimed at
overcoming police abuses and coerced admissions that courts over
the years said violated a fundamental tenet the Constitution's the
right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is being asked to agree with a lower court that
said the 1966 Miranda vs. Arizona ruling that led to the warning
has been invalidated in federal cases by a 1968 law passed by
Congress. If the justices agree, then states presumably could
decide to abolish the warnings in state and local police cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Ernesto
Miranda, 23 and a poor, eighth-grade dropout who was found guilty
after confessing that he had raped an 18-year-old woman. The court
said he should be have been told of his rights to remain silent and
consult an attorney before he talked to the police.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., ruled in February 1998 that the Miranda decision had
been superseded by Section 3501 of Congress' 1968 crime bill _
passed at a time of urban riots and high street crime.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, that section has been largely ignored until the
circuit court's surprising ruling last year.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's decision stemmed from a $876 bank robbery in
Alexandria, Va., on Jan. 24, 1997. During the robbery, a witness
took down the license plate number of the getaway car, a white
Oldsmobile. Three days later, FBI agents showed up at the Takoma
Park, Md., apartment of the car's registered owner, an unemployed
man named Charles Dickerson. The Oldsmobile was out front.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson says the agents busted in; they say he opened the
door. Nevertheless, he agreed to accompany them to an FBI office.
He refused, however, to let them search his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agent Christopher Lawlor later testified that he had noticed
a wad of cash on the bed as Dickerson picked up his coat. During
Dickerson's questioning at the FBI office, Lawlor left the room,
called a magistrate and got permission to search the suspect's
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor returned to the interview room and told Dickerson he had
obtained a search warrant. Dickerson then confessed to driving his
car in a series of robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's lawyers sought to suppress the evidence, claiming
their client was not given Miranda warnings before confessing. The
FBI denied the claim, but a U.S. District Court accepted
Dickerson's contention and threw out the confession and the
evidence found in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Circuit court, citing Section 3501 of the 1968 crime
law, said mere ``technical violations'' of Miranda should no longer
negate all confessions.
</P>
<P>
   By an 8-5 vote, the appeals court said that 3501 means that
failing to issue Miranda warnings is just one of several factors
courts should consider in deciding whether statements to police
were made voluntarily. The law says judges may look at whether any
warnings were given, at the time that elapsed between a suspect's
being taken into custody and confessing, and at whether the
defendant knew for sure that he could remain silent or request an
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit judges quoted a recent comment of Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia, who said failure to use Section 3501 ``may
have produced ... the non-prosecution of many dangerous felons.''
The judges said Dickerson ``is just such a case.''
</P>
<P>
   In a friend-of-the-court brief to the Fourth Circuit court,
University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell, who will defend
Section 3501 before the Supreme Court, argued that the 1968 law
allowed use of Dickerson's statements regardless of any Miranda
violation. Cassell, who represents the conservative Washington
Legal Foundation, contended that Miranda has had a ``devastating
effect on law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court agreed, saying Miranda warnings were created
simply to safeguard the Fifth Amendment's right to silence. In
addition, it said, the Miranda decision invited states and Congress
to ``develop their own safeguards.'' If the states are free to
initiate their own rules, the Fourth Circuit said, then the Miranda
warnings cannot possibly be a constitutional standard.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief supporting the Miranda rule, Attorney General Janet
Reno argued that the 1968 law cannot be enforced because the
Miranda decision ``is of constitutional dimension'' and ``cannot be
superseded merely by legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   She urged the court to overrule the Dickerson decision and
predicted serious repercussions otherwise. Miranda ``has come to
play a unique and important role in the nation's conception of our
criminal justice system,'' the brief said. ``It promotes public
confidence that the criminal justice system is fair.''

AT&AMP;T OPEN-ACCESS PLAN CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advocates of open access to fast Internet cable modems slammed
AT&AMP;T Monday for overhyping an agreement in principle to make its
services available to the nation's second-biggest Internet
provider, calling the deal too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of smoke; it's a lot of mirrors, and when you find
your way through it there is not much there,'' said Stephen Allen,
spokesman for a group organizing a November 2000 Massachusetts
ballot question demanding open access statewide. ``Our campaign is
still very much on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Federal Communications chairman William E.
Kennard, cosigned by AT&AMP;T and MindSpring, the country's number two
Internet service provider, the phone giant said it will allow cable
modem customers to choose any ISP they want once AT&AMP;T's exclusive
contract with Excite AtHome expires in mid-2002 and once
unspecified ``technical issues are addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, people who subscribe to high-speed cable modems from
AT&AMP;T or MediaOne go to the home page of affiliated ISPs such as
Excite AtHome and RoadRunner, unless they pay more and reconfigure
their computer to go to a different ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Rival ISPs contend that as a public monopoly, cable franchises
should be required to sell them wholesale access to the cable lines
so they can enroll subscribers offering the same high-speed access
that Excite AtHome and RoadRunner can offer.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T supporters called the MindSpring pact _ essentially, an
agreement to negotiate access terms _ a landmark deal that proves
that government action is unnecessary to open access through fast
cable modems to ISPs, and that such moves should be left to
business-to-business negotiations in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AT&AMP;T/MindSpring agreement strongly reinforces our view
that private sector negotiations are much more likely to produce
benefits to consumers than any set of government-imposed
regulations,'' said Robert Sachs, president of the National Cable
Television Association.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard called the agreement a ``good first step toward
providing consumers with a choice of Internet service providers
without paying twice,'' adding that he continues to think imposing
government regulations mandating such access ``would only slow down
broadband deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   But open access advocates said in several ways, there was far
less to the AT&AMP;T-MindSpring pact than the companies claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact that it covers only one of the hundreds of
ISPs, it would not take effect until June 2002 at the soonest, when
the deal expires under which AT&AMP;T makes Excite AtHome the exclusive
affiliated home page with its cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the letter to the FCC is little more than a plan spelling
out a version of open access AT&AMP;T would support and a promise to
negotiate terms with MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   Even a top MindSpring executive, David N. Baker, said, ``We
applaud AT&AMP;T for moving in the right direction . . . (but) there
are still major issues to be resolved. We see no reason for them to
have to wait around for another 2 1/2 years.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it will continue to lobby for a nationwide
open access policy, calling the MindSpring deal nothing more than a
good start.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's group, the Massachusetts Coalition for Consumer Choice
and Competition on the Internet, last week filed 70,000 voter
signatures as a first step toward a proposed November 2000 ballot
question requiring MediaOne and other cable franchises to open
access on their systems to all ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an illusion, it's not the solution,'' Allen said. By
offering the possibility of MindSpring as an equal-cost, same-speed
alternative to Excite AtHome, Allen said, ``They're saying you can
have either A or B, but we want to offer you the choice from A to
Z.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T general counsel Jim Cicconi said the company ``has already
begun negotiations with a number of ISPs'' in hopes of reaching
agreements similar to the MindSpring pact. However, company
officials said they see no way to back out of the exclusive
contract with Excite AtHome, in which AT&AMP;T holds a controlling
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Excite AtHome chief technology officer Milo Medin warned
that providing shared access with MindSpring could require two
years to develop and install technical changes. ``The technology to
do what we're talking about in that letter doesn't exist today,''
he said.

   Among the most popular seasonal cards this year on
bluemountain.com is an animated interfaith electronic greeting. As
two Santas pass each other, one doffs his fur-trimmed cap and says,
``Merry Christmas!'' The other Santa responds by removing his cap
to reveal a yarmulke, the Jewish head covering, and saying:
``Shalom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluemountain.com, the most visited greeting card site on the
Web, said it decided to blend the symbols of two religions for the
first time this year after requests from customers. Still, it has
been surprised by the greetings' popularity. Among the 10 million
holiday cards sent from its site this year, ``about a million of
the cards sent will be interfaith,'' said Jared Schutz, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The December holidays have long been a source of angst for many
dual-faith couples, and the tug is particularly acute for
Christians and Jews whose seasonal celebrations collide head on
with Christmas and Hanukkah. Couples have often decided to forgo
one holiday or simply display the paraphernalia of both side by
side. But many families are now synthesizing two sets of customs.
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace is starting to respond to this pluralistic view
of the holidays by producing what was once taboo: decorations that
merge the symbols of two observances. Available this season are
Christmas tree ornaments painted with menorahs or Kwanzaa lights;
wreaths made of cloth printed with dreidels (the spinning toys used
in a Hanukkah game); angels with wings, halos, and dreidel-print
dresses; and Christmas lights that have individual Stars of David.
</P>
<P>
   Such seasonal syncretism in religious symbols causes dismay
among the devout. ``While empathetic to the families trying to
blend the two traditions, ultimately my position would be that it
is mistaken and misguided to synthesize the distinct symbols of our
two traditions,'' said Dr. Christopher Leighton, executive director
of the Institute for Christian and Jewish Studies in Baltimore.
``It is an American vision that tries to advance tolerance by
pretending that the differences don't matter that much. It is a
watering down and a distortion of what religious alliance
entails.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Abrams, the author of ``Faith or Fear: How Jews Can
Survive in a Christian America'' (Free Press; 1997), put it even
more bluntly. ``It is a terrible sign of intellectual and religious
confusion,'' he said. ``These are separate religions, and if
Judaism is to survive it will be by marking these separations
emphatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by such arguments, many two-religion couples find joint
symbols of faith and heritage reassuring. For Doug Giles and
Natalie Green Giles, Christmas was a touchy issue when they first
set up house together in 1994. Giles, who is an Episcopalian,
wanted a tree to celebrate the holiday. Ms. Green, who is Jewish,
felt she was giving up a piece of her identity. While walking in
Greenwich Village one day, they came across a store that sold a
tree ornament in the shape of a dreidel. The blue felt object was
hardly high art, but the gilded Hebrew letters gave Ms. Green
comfort. ``For me it neutralized the Christian symbolism of the
tree,'' she said recently.
</P>
<P>
   No one tracks who is buying mixed-religious ornamentation, and
it is hard to say why interest is cropping up now. Some, like
Abrams, theorize that the collectors are well-meaning Christians
looking to be inclusive. Other possible buyers are secular
institutions and businesses aiming to relate to as many employees
or visitors as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious audience for such decorations, though, is interfaith
couples, and the rate of interfaith marriage is increasing in
America. Roughly one third of the 3.2 million American households
with Jewish adults have an Interfaith marriage, according to Egon
Mayer, director of the Jewish Outreach Institute. That number is
increasing as some 50 percent of Jews now marry people of other
faiths. Thirty years ago fewer than 10 percent of Jews married
someone outside the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holiday cards and ornaments recognize what is already
fact, that we are an increasingly multicultural society,'' Mayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the number of people participating in two-faith
marriages, there seems to be an increased belief among young people
that they do not have to ignore one faith to make a marriage more
peaceable. ``Young couples are more determined to hang on to the
tradition they grew up with,'' said Mary Helene Rosenbaum, the
director of the Dovetail Institute for Interfaith Family Resources
in Kentucky. Ms. Rosenbaum describes herself as a practicing
Catholic and her husband of 30 years an observant Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, merchants are recording a definite increase
in interest in religion-blending items. Christopher Radko designs
pricey glass tree ornaments that are sold in Bloomingdale's and
Neiman Marcus, among other stores. Three years ago he added tree
ornaments with Jewish symbols, including menorahs, Stars of David,
dreidels and the Ten Commandments. They were so popular that this
year he has added new pieces that speak to people of other groups.
Among the additions are a Buddha, a Yin-Yang symbol and an
African-American man celebrating Kwanzaa, the cultural festival
that begins on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love them,'' Radko says. ``For me, the spirit of
Christmas is not limited to one group of people, it is inclusive of
everyone willing to keep their hearts open.''
</P>
<P>
   Corner Crafters, a handcrafts company in Spring Lake, N.J., is
offering a Hanukkah wreath, replete with lace and a blue-and-white
bow, and several Hanukkah Angels, clothed in dreidel-print dresses.
``We had a lot of people ask for it,'' said Patty Carty, the owner.
``And this year people are starting to request this kind of stuff
for Kwanzaa, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Many big companies avoid melding symbols in part because the
potential sales are considered too small to risk offending the
devout of either faith. Among the 2,000 different cards made for
this holiday season by Hallmark Cards, the nation's largest
greeting card company, only two have symbols from both Hanukkah and
Christmas, and even then, they appear on separate sides of the
paper. Similarly, Williams-Sonoma Inc., owner of Pottery Barn,
which has holiday decorating items that range from cookie cutters
to wrapping paper, offers no blended holiday options.
</P>
<P>
   But to Susan Greenberg, a Jew who is raising two children in
Chatham, N.J., the trend toward offering melded iconography is a
welcome one. This year, she will continue a three-year-old
tradition of giving her husband a Jewish Christmas tree ornament
for Hanukkah. Her husband, Bill Burger, who was raised as
Christian, completely supports the idea and scouts for such items
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes having a Christmas tree easier for me to stomach, and
it does not make me feel so alienated and excluded from Christmas
when my kids are enjoying it,'' Ms. Greenberg said. ``It is our way
of carving out our own particular family tradition.''

SUCCESSFUL GENE THERAPY ON HEMOPHILIA AND HEART CELLS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors have successfully used gene therapy to treat a form of
hemophilia, they reported on Monday, injecting patients with a gene
that produced a blood-clotting protein without adverse side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   And in a more preliminary but likewise promising study,
researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital are reporting Tuesday
that they have used gene therapy to revive failing heart cells.
</P>
<P>
   The blood-clotting research involves hemophilia B, which
afflicts about 5,000 Americans, or 20 percent of all hemophiliacs
in the United States. The patients, who lack a protein called
Factor IX, are subject to spontaneous bleeding, arthritis and, in
some cases, severe disability or death from bleeding into the
central nervous system. Typically, they must undergo intravenous
infusions of Factor IX protein concentrates, which provide
temporary relief but last only a few days in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Avigen Inc., a biotechnology company based in
Alameda, Calif., and from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
and Stanford University Medical Center injected three patients with
a genetically engineered virus used as a carrier, or vector, for
the gene that prompts cells to produce the Factor IX protein.
</P>
<P>
   Although this was primarily a safety trial, using low doses, the
three patients began producing Factor IX within eight weeks and
have continued to do so for six months, researchers said Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said this was a combination of the first two of
the three phases required by the Food and Drug Administration for
approval of a new drug. The first phase, in a small number of
patients, is to establish safety; the second is to show efficacy;
and the third, in a larger group, to confirm efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   Because hemophilia treatments yield unambiguous results _ the
patient's blood either clots or does not _ they can be approved on
the basis of small trials. Avigen says it plans to test an
increased dose in three additional patients, and conclude with a
further increased dose in three more patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have observed is that the gene has been successfully
delivered and is producing biologically active Factor IX,'' said
John Monahan, Avigen's president and chief executive. ``Over the
last several months, we were pleased to observe that the increase
in Factor IX protein activity correlated with a significant
reduction of Factor IX concentrate usage by these patients. This is
a result we would not have anticipated at this dose level.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial has been closely watched by hemophilia patients and by
scientists pursuing gene therapy, who have had a barrage of
negative publicity in recent months prompted by the death of a
patient in a trial at the University of Pennsylvania and by
disappointing outcomes in other studies.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy commonly uses viruses as vectors to carry DNA into
cells, and a vector called adenovirus was implicated in the
Pennsylvania death. The vector used by Avigen in its hemophilia
research was adeno-associated virus, which despite its name is not
related to adenovirus. Adeno-associated virus, though ubiquitous in
humans, has no health consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular virus is not capable of replicating by itself,
so when it enters a cell it doesn't do a thing,'' said Dr. Savio
Woo, president of the American Society for Gene Therapy. Regarding
the positive results announced Monday, he added, ``This is the kind
of trial that the community has been waiting for anxiously, so that
we can portray to the public that not all gene therapy trials are
risky, or kill people, or do no good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the adeno-associated virus is small, so it apparently cannot
carry large genes, like the one for Factor VIII, whose absence
causes the much more common hemophilia A.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Avigen is doing research on delivering the Factor
VIII gene with the adeno-associated virus, and expects to seek
permission from the FDA to begin a clinical trial in hemophilia A
next year. The Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company based in
Emeryville, Calif., has treated eight hemophilia A patients with a
gene therapy using a retrovirus as a vector, and plans to release
its first data by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeanne Lusher, chairwoman of the National Hemophilia
Foundation's Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee, called
Monday's announcement ``very exciting and encouraging, even though
it's a Phase 1 study,'' and added that gene therapy was ``a very
promising approach and may lead to a cure for people with
hemophilia B.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the study on heart cells is at a far earlier stage,
researchers said it was exciting because it showed the potential
for gene therapy to treat heart failure. In the study, which
appears in Tuesday's issue of the journal Circulation, the
researchers report delivering additional copies of a gene called
Serca2a to muscle cells from failing human hearts. Cells that
incorporated the gene began to function in a normal fashion,
contracting more quickly and more powerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ability to modify the contraction of failing human
cardiac cells represents an important step toward gene therapy for
heart failure,'' said Dr. Roger Hajjar of the Massachusetts General
Hospital Cardiovascular Research Center, who led the study, along
with collaborators from Boston University Medical Center and
Imperial College in London.
</P>
<P>
   Although this study used an adenovirus vector, Hajjar said he
believed one of the new vectors in development would yield
long-lasting results. ``These results in isolated cardiac cells
need to be validated in the whole human heart, but we're optimistic
that this goal will be accomplished,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (States News Service) - Possible back-to-back
Mars mission failures cost NASA more in prestige than in taxpayer
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The $120 million Mars Polar Lander, feared lost this week, could
join the failed $85 million Mars Climate Orbiter in NASA's hall of
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a combined total of $235 million, including the $30
million Deep Space probes that were attached to the MPL but are
also unaccounted for, the two successive failures would be just 1.7
percent of NASA's $13.6 billion budget for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back losses are meager compared to the failure of
the $1 billion 1992 Mars Observer (in that year's dollars). The
Mars Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander make up just 23.5 percent of
that mission, which NASA scientists lost contact with in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the recent losses costly compared to the $400 million on
average that NASA shells out for every space shuttle mission. Most
years see at least six shuttle missions, though 1999 had only two.
</P>
<P>
   Other less flashy NASA missions can cost far more than MPL,
which garnered national media attention last week. For instance,
NASA's Terra satellite, to be launched Dec. 16, costs $1.3 billion,
a full $1 billion over the cost of the two-mission Mars Surveyor in
1998. Terra will look at the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War space race with the Soviet Union, NASA
enjoyed unlimited costs for early Mars exploration efforts, with
vastly more personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Soffen was project scientist for Viking missions to
Mars 1968 to 1979, said during the first Viking landing on Mars,
JPL had ``1,000 people involved in the actual landing,'' from
mission trajectory experts to spacecraft engineers. ``It was a mob
of people.'' But now, ``you simply don't have as many people,''
which he said made things worse for recent Mars missions.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, cooperation with former enemies has proven more
costly than competition. The International Space Station, with
delays and cost-overruns in part attributed to problems with
Russian and European space agencies, will cost about 250 times what
the lost Mars missions have cost - that's $60 billion.

THE REAL ANDY KAUFMAN
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heads rarely turned in the quiet streets of San Francisco's Noe
Valley neighborhood, except on laundry day, when prankster-comedian
Andy Kaufman would indulge in a little street theater usually
reserved for an audience of one _ girlfriend Lynne Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1983, Kaufman and Margulies were sharing a small
apartment there as a respite from Hollywood and the fame brought by
Kaufman's portrayal of bashful foreign mechanic Latka Gravas on
TV's ``Taxi.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just fame. Audiences had gotten so tired of
Kaufman's shtick that they'd voted him off ``Saturday Night Live''
after 14 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The comic, who would soon be diagnosed with the rare form of
lung cancer that killed him, was also taking a breather from his
highly publicized foray into professional wrestling and the
grand-scale hoaxes featuring foulmouthed alter-ego Tony Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally during those overcast days on 24th Street,
Kaufman longed for the familiar look of shock in the eyes of
innocent bystanders. What better place than the local laundermat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hunch my shoulders like a bag lady and walk in, and Andy
would be sitting there all by himself, waiting for his clothes to
dry,'' Margulies recalls. ``I'd come shuffling in and start taking
his stuff out of the machine. And he'd say, `Excuse me, those are
my clothes.' And it would go on like that, getting increasingly
louder and more outrageous. It was a bit Andy orchestrated for
whoever happened to be in the laundermat at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was just as important as being on TV for Andy. It had
equal value.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates of the late Kaufman tell similar tales of
being called upon as sometimes unwilling co-conspirators in pranks
devised by the frequently ingenious entertainer. Kaufman, subject
of Milos Forman's forthcoming ``Man on the Moon,'' starring Jim
Carrey as Kaufman, Courtney Love as Margulies, Danny DeVito and
Paul Giamatti, died 15 years ago at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took things from his life and exploited them on stage,''
says Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's writer and close friend of a dozen years.
``Like, when `Taxi' went off the air, the first thing Andy did was
get on the phone to David Letterman and insist he be booked on the
show immediately. So, Andy grew a two-day beard, put Vaseline under
his nose to look like he'd been crying and sniffling, and told the
audience he'd never work again because the wrestling had ruined his
career. And people believed it, too. Letterman himself sometimes
didn't know what Andy was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda, creator of HBO's ``Comic Relief'' telecasts and
co-executive producer of ``Man on the Moon'' (which opens Dec. 22),
tells behind-the-scenes stories of Kaufman's various confrontations
both on and off the air in the memoir ``Andy Kaufman Revealed! Best
Friend Tells All'' (Little, Brown; $24).
</P>
<P>
   ``When Andy lay dying, he asked me to do three things: write a
book about him, do a movie about him and keep the legacy of Tony
Clifton alive,'' said Zmuda, who sometimes played the Clifton role
in Kaufman's pranks. ``When the movie happened, I had the writers,
the director and Carrey downloading my memories of what really came
down. While we were shooting, I was writing the book. I'd literally
walk off the set, go back to my trailer and write.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who knew Kaufman well said he was a complex but
misunderstood loner who walked a tightrope between genius and
madness while setting the stage for the acceptance of new, radical
types of humor. Among the now-mainstream entertainers who cite
Kaufman as an influence are Robin Williams, Carrey (who shares the
same birth date as Kaufman _ Jan. 17), Letterman, Lily Tomlin and
Richard Belzer.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most comics then and now, Kaufman didn't aim for
laughs, instead going for some kind of psychological netherland
where you weren't sure which character was the real Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a comic,'' Kaufman himself once said. ``I just want
to play with their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   When performing stand-up in comedy clubs as the bumbling Foreign
Man persona later used for the role of Latka in ``Taxi,'' Kaufman
would tell awful jokes, offer notoriously inept impersonations, or
read entire chapters from ``The Great Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, as re-created in a memorable scene from
``Man on the Moon,'' Foreign Man would suddenly launch into a
note-perfect Elvis Presley, again confounding the audience by
mumbling ``denk you veddy much'' afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first you felt sorry for this guy from some foreign
country,'' said George Shapiro, the film's co-executive producer,
who was Kaufman's manager before becoming a producer of TV's smash
``Seinfeld'' series. ``Then you saw this drop-dead Elvis, and you
began to think the whole thing could be a put-on. Then he'd confuse
you again by reverting back to this immigrant personality. When I
first met Andy, I said he'd never have to worry about anyone
stealing his act. It was that unique.''
</P>
<P>
   However, journalist Bill Zehme, author of ``Lost in the
Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman'' (Delacorte, $25.95),
takes a somewhat different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaufman was a hardheaded guy who refused to bend,'' he said.
``He had extended his entire bag of tricks by 1977, and that's what
drove him to wrestling. He would just wreak havoc on any show that
would have him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about human response testing. Why do it? I don't
know. The bits were often performed for an audience of two _ Andy
and Zmuda. But if he had survived, I'm convinced he would have
reinvented himself.''
</P>
<P>
   More behavioral scientist than comedian, Kaufman turned his
obsession with wrestling into one of the strangest career
crossovers in celebrity history. Eventually, Kaufman's baiting of
professional wrestlers turned ugly, and he was hospitalized for a
life-threatening neck injury. A notorious confrontation between the
comic and wrestling champ Jerry Lawler on the Letterman show sent
security guards scurrying onto the set to separate the two.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ``Taxi'' reruns and until the buzz surrounding the
Carrey movie began two years ago, Kaufman's image was rarely evoked
in the years since he died. The exception came in 1993, when the
rock band R.E.M. scored a hit with ``Man on the Moon,'' a touching
tribute to the comedian. Zmuda says the song helped convince
producers to consider a Kaufman biopic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaufman was easily 15 years ahead of the curve in terms of
what he was presenting and where he was going with his comedy,''
says R.E.M. singer-lyricist Michael Stipe. ``He really moved things
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the movie, a forthcoming segment of cable channel
A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' will be devoted to Kaufman. Also, the Museum of
Television &AMP; Radio in Beverly Hills is screening ``The Comedy of
Andy Kaufman,'' a presentation running through Jan. 30 that
includes the rarely seen TV special, ``Andy's Funhouse: The Andy
Kaufman Special,'' along with selected clips of TV talk show
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a documentary is being assembled on the making of
``Man on the Moon.'' Financed by Carrey and filmed by Margulies
during the 85-day shoot, the documentary shows the star of ``The
Truman Show'' taking his dual roles as Kaufman and Clifton very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim lost his mind for real playing this role,'' said Zmuda,
perhaps reprising the P.T. Barnum role he played in Kaufman's
career. ``Jim got totally into the character. In 85 days of
filming, Jim Carrey was never there _ it was either Andy or
Clifton. He was channeling Andy. We ended up with 121 hours of
Carrey losing his mind. It's kind of like `the unmaking of ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda expects the behind-the-scenes documentary to be cut down
to about two hours and released around the time ``Man on the Moon''
is issued on video.
</P>
<P>
   Had he lived, most agree Kaufman would probably be a fixture on
cable TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might've been a wrestler,'' said Margulies, who first met
Kaufman in 1982 during the filming of ``My Breakfast With
Blassie,'' a parody of ``My Dinner With Andre'' in which Andy and
pro wrestler Freddie Blassie sat in a restaurant and simply talked.
``Or he might've hosted a cable TV show where he could do whatever
he wanted. He'd probably be going on all the talk shows playing the
part of a washed-up Hollywood has-been. He might've given up
performing altogether. He could've made millions on radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Margulies, who says one of Kaufman's most endearing qualities
was his loyalty to friends and family, said the making of ``Man on
the Moon'' was cathartic, helping to bring her out of what she
described as a 15-year mourning period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly emotional,'' says the San Fernando-raised
Margulies. ``I cried constantly. In fact, I started crying the
first time I saw Jim as Andy. He made it so real. If his
performance was real for us, it was real for him _ and he fed off
that. It enabled him to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Margulies was the recipient of an unexpected gift from Carrey
once principal shooting on ``Man on the Moon'' was completed.
Carrey had restored a 1979 Chrysler Cordoba of the sort Kaufman
drove in order to help authenticate his performance. At the movie's
wrap party, Carrey handed Margulies a small box with a set of car
keys inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jim handed me the keys it dawned on me what they were
for,'' Margulies said. ``He knew how much I loved that car. It was
the car where Andy and I had our first kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Margulies said she always thought Kaufman's work would
eventually be re-evaluated _ but not in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy would always say, `Wait and see. Years from now, they'll
figure it out and see what I was doing,''' she said. ``He was right
once again. &QL;

 &HT;    Reporter's `Diary' takes clear-eyed view of cancer
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's become the new morning in America: healthy one day, cancer
the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family, there was like no illness, and then my brother got
leukemia and my mother got breast cancer and I got lymphoma, all in
the course of five years,'' Rebecca Perl says as she journeys from
her Maryland home to a Nebraska hospital for a bone marrow
transplant. ``It's just so weird, all this cancer in our family,
all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the next things we see in this often frankly funny yet
desperately frank Cinemax documentary, ``Scenes From a Transplant:
A Cancer Diary,'' is Perl giving herself an injection in a locked
Waffle House restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, I'd do it at like 7:25, right before `Seinfeld,'''
Perl explains as she shoots a prescribed drug into her thigh. ``If
it took me more than five minutes to do it, I'd miss `Seinfeld,' so
I'd hurry myself along.''
</P>
<P>
   Perl, who survived the transplant, is a science correspondent
for National Public Radio in Washington. She was diagnosed with
non-Hodgkins lymphoma six months after the birth of her son.
</P>
<P>
   A year of chemotherapy failed to destroy the cancerous tumor in
her chest. A bone marrow transplant was her last chance. ``A Cancer
Diary,'' co-produced and directed by Dan Collison and Perl's
longtime companion, Tom Jennings, chronicles her months-long
transplant ordeal. Told that she can go home after what appears to
be a successful transplant, with nurses patting her and cheering
her on, Perl comments afterward about her reaction, ``I felt like a
contestant on a game show. Like I was supposed to jump up and
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't?'' she's asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. ... I feigned a little excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this whole process that's overly
optimistic to me,'' she adds later. ``I have to be very cautious. I
don't really know what the deal is.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal here is nothing fancy _ Perl was teetering between life
and death _ and neither is this documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question we're kind of avoiding is the cancer
itself,'' Jennings says. ``We're so encumbered with the daily
routine, we're not really thinking about the final goal at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is that diarylike attention to the banal and unpretty
that ultimately makes this chronicle so profound. There are times
when ``Scenes'' can seem almost too clear-eyed; there's a sense
that Perl is both the reporter and the reported upon, and that
she's speaking at a slightly cool remove from what's happening to
her.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a huge, hard story that overwhelms any smallish
shortcomings. By the end, as she's leaving the Nebraska hospital in
the dead of winter, you want to fling your own hat along with the
tiny, baby-birdlike Perl, as she does a half-baked imitation of
Mary Tyler Moore (``You're gonna make it after all!'') from the old
TV show.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Perl has taught us to be cautious, too. The end is
full of both hope and heartache: another morning in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scenes From
</P>

SUPREME COURT WILL REVIEW A LANDMARK: MIRANDA VS. ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Va., Md., Utah)   (with MIRANDA-HISTORY)  
(DW) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Miranda decision, a 33-year-old landmark of the
Warren Court's criminal procedure revolution, headed Monday for its
most important test, as the justices announced that they would
decide whether Congress had effectively overruled it with a law
that was enacted for that purpose in 1968 and then was ignored
almost ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the court, in an appeal by an indicted bank
robber who made self-incriminating statements without having first
received his Miranda warnings, is whether Miranda vs. Arizona
itself established a rule of constitutional law or whether it
merely expressed the Warren Court's preferred method of enforcing
the constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Although the distinction sounds technical, it is critical: If
the decision itself was an interpretation of the Constitution,
Congress cannot overrule it, and prosecutors are barred from making
direct use of confessions obtained without Miranda warnings. But if
it was something less, then Congress presumably could exercise its
own legislative judgment, as it did in the Omnibus Crime Control
Act of 1968 by providing that confessions could be admitted in
federal court as long as they were ``voluntary'' in light of all
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled last February
that the 1968 law, usually known as Section 3501, for its
designation under Title 18 of the United States Code, was a valid
substitute for the Miranda rules in federal court because the rules
themselves, in the appeals court's view, were not required by the
Constitution. A case-by-case inquiry into whether a confession was
voluntary would essentially return the law regarding police
interrogations to where it was before the court decided Miranda vs.
Arizona in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   As any viewer of television crime shows has known for a
generation, the Miranda decision required the police to warn
suspects in custody, before questioning could begin, that they had
the right to remain silent; that any statement they made could be
used as evidence against them; that they had the right to have an
attorney present, and that if they could not afford a lawyer, one
would be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening 33 years, the Supreme Court has declined to
extend Miranda and has permitted the indirect use of some
statements obtained in violation of the decision. Despite
occasional criticism from individual justices, most notably Justice
Antonin Scalia, there is little sense that the current court is
poised to overrule the decision. The decision to take the case, at
the urging of the Justice Department, more likely reflects the
court's view that the issue is important rather than that the
appeals court was correct.
</P>
<P>
   While Chief Justice Earl Warren's majority opinion clearly
viewed the warnings as a means of enforcing a defendant's Fifth
Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, the 5-4
decision was not without ambiguity. ``Congress and the states are
free to develop their own safeguards for the privilege, so long as
they are fully as effective,'' the opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   The path the Miranda case has taken back to the court after 33
years is an unusual one.
</P>
<P>
   Through seven administrations, Republican and Democratic, the
Justice Department has refused to invoke Section 3501 as the basis
for admitting a confession obtained without Miranda warnings. Nor
has any administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn the
Miranda decision.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few years, however, conservative law-enforcement
groups have tried to force the Clinton administration's hand by
appearing as ``friends of the court'' in various prosecutions to
argue that Section 3501 had in fact superseded Miranda. That is how
the question was inserted into the government's prosecution of
Charles T. Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, a resident of Takoma Park, Md., who was charged in
1997 with participating in the robbery of a bank in Alexandria,
Va., challenged the use of statements he had made to two agents of
the FBI who had not first read him his Miranda rights. The federal
district court in Alexandria agreed with him and suppressed the
statements.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria then took the unusual
step of asking the district court to reconsider, arguing that the
statements had been made voluntarily and so were admissible under
Section 3501. The district court denied the request on the ground
that the federal rules of criminal procedure did not permit
reconsideration in the absence of new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, with an appeal pending before the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals , in Richmond, the Justice Department
became involved in the case and, continuing longstanding department
policy, decided against raising Section 3501 as an issue on appeal.
Instead, the government argued that Dickerson had waived his
Miranda rights during an earlier period of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   With no party in the case to press Section 3501, the 4th
Circuit, which has a reputation as one of the most conservative and
activist of the federal appeals courts, permitted a conservative
policy group that had been advocating on the issue to enter the
case. The Washington Legal Foundation argued that Section 3501 had
effectively overturned Miranda in federal courts and that the only
question was the voluntariness of Dickerson's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit agreed. The legal presumption created by the
Miranda decision, that a confession obtained without the warnings
was not a voluntary confession, was not required by the
Constitution and Congress was free to overrule it, the appeals
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 majority also lobbed several grenades at the Justice
Department. ``Even where the parties abdicate their responsibility
to call relevant authority to this court's attention, they cannot
prevent us from deciding the case under the governing law simply by
refusing to argue it,'' Judge Karen J. Williams wrote for the
panel. The full appeals court then refused, by a vote of 8-5, to
reconsider the panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's appeal to the Supreme Court, Dickerson vs. United
States, No. 99-5525, filed in July, presented the Clinton
administration with the politically delicate task of formulating a
response. The Supreme Court extended its deadline twice as debate
continued inside the administration and within the cadre of federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Nov. 1, the solicitor general's office filed a brief
urging the justices to hear Dickerson's appeal and to use the case
not to overrule Miranda but to reaffirm it as a decision that ``has
come to play a unique and important role in the nation's conception
of our criminal justice system.'' Attorney General Janet Reno took
the unusual step of adding her name to the brief filed by Solicitor
General Seth P. Waxman, as a signal that the brief expressed
administration policy at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   With no party to defend the statute, the court Monday named Paul
G. Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah, to argue on
behalf of the constitutionality of Section 3501. Cassell, a former
law clerk to Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, has made a career of
arguing that Miranda should be overruled.

BRITISH LEADER WANTS A REAL PEACE DIVIDEND: U.S. INVESTMENT IN
NORTHERN IRELAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Britain's senior minister for Northern Ireland
called on the Clinton administration Thursday to work with American
businesses to step up investment in Northern Ireland to support the
peace agreement by ending ``the very real poverty and deprivation''
found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to see an early dividend from the peace that
has been created,'' said Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland
secretary, after meeting at the White House with administration
officials to brief them on the accord that has brought home rule in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he was promoting investment to cement the peace,
Mandelson acknowledged that the negotiations that have ended
decades of violence in Northern Ireland could be set back ``to
square one'' without continued cooperation between pro-British
unionists and pro-Irish republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties now realize that they need each other,'' he told
reporters. ``This is the essence of the accommodation that has been
struck.'' But, he said, ``we still have to go the final mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, London transferred local government authority for
Northern Ireland to a new power-sharing assembly drawn from the
Protestant and Catholic parties. Last weekend, the outlawed Irish
Republican Army sent an emissary to meet with an international
disarmament committee to discuss the turnover of its weapons, which
is required under the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said that as a result of the peace process, Northern
Ireland had undergone a ``transformation'' that should have obvious
appeal to American business executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different place _ no roadchecks, no
roadblocks, people going about their day's business, their normal
lives, as anywhere else in the United Kingdom,'' he said, adding
that he wanted ``to bring home to the American business community
the huge return from their investment in Northern Ireland, if they
were to commit to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is already the largest single foreign investor
in Northern Ireland. According to British government figure,
American companies have invested about $1.9 billion there over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year two-thirds of all first-time investment in Northern
Ireland was made by American companies, including several
electronics firms seeking to take advantage of its well-educated,
relatively low-cost work force. American companies employ about 10
percent of the nearly 140,000 people who work in manufacturing jobs
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good people, good skills,'' said Mandelson, a close
political ally of Prime Minister Tony Blair who was named to the
Northern Ireland post in October.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the talks Monday between the British delegation led
by Mandelson and Clinton administration officials was that of a
mutual admiration society.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson repeatedly praised President Clinton and former Sen.
George Mitchell of Maine, who oversaw the negotiations that led to
home rule in Northern Ireland, for their involvement in the peace
process. He said that Clinton had made use of the ``the persuasive
skills for which he is famous'' in the peace negotiations and that
``he has not spared any effort, any ounce of energy.''

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T sets new path for high-speed future
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T on Monday moved to bolster its sagging reputation
on Wall Street, announcing a new strategy for giving rivals access
to its high-speed cable network and sweeping changes to its
management structure.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced the creation of a special tracking
stock for its wireless unit and $1 billion construction of a
fiber-optic network linking 30 metropolitan areas, including
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The news includes a shake-up among top executives jostling to
succeed Chief Executive Officer Michael Armstrong, whose bold but
risky strategic gambles have at least raised the specter of a
premature departure. Armstrong is 61 and the mandatory retirement
age is 65.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, flying high in early 1999, has seen a slow slide in its
stock price as doubts mounted concerning its ability to pull off
the seismic shift from lumbering long-distance company to agile
high-speed telecommunications provider. That bet rides in part on a
pending $62 billion purchase of MediaOne, in the midst of continued
bumpiness of AT&AMP;T's $70 billion acquisition of Tele-Communications
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After months of resisting the notion of providing access to
competing Internet service providers over its cable lines, AT&AMP;T
signed a deal with Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises setting out
principles for this. That deal would give AT&AMP;T customers a choice
in their ISP _ but not until 2002, when the company's current
arrangement with ISP Excite At Home expires.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal was endorsed by Kenneth Fellman, chairman of an
advisory board to the Federal Communications Commission _ any final
arrangement would need FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea drew fire from several who had been part of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   One who dropped out was Andrew Schwartzman, president of the
Media Access Project, a law firm representing citizen interests at
the FCC. Another was a representative of Mayor Bill Campbell.
Campbell was asked to participate by FCC Chairman William Kennard
in his capacity as head of the national mayors council.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Campbell's city is home to both MindSpring and a
franchise of MediaOne, which has about 610,900 customers in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, having won AT&AMP;T's big concession for open access,
MindSpring almost immediately began campaigning for more. In a
letter to the FCC, Dave Baker, MindSpring vice president, wrote
that the deal would allow AT&AMP;T to retain the power to control how
video streaming, telephone use and other services would be
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the FCC to pry still more concessions from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, today's agreement will not benefit consumers for
years to come _ if even then,'' Baker said. ``While this commitment
is an important step in the right direction, it is only a first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has about 10,000 employees in more than 20 locations
throughout metro Atlanta, including the Midtown offices that serve
as headquarters for the Southeast. The company also has one of its
three network control centers in Conyers, which handles close to
100 million calls each day, and its data processing and financial
centers in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the executive changes nor the creation of a tracking
stock announced Monday is expected to have any impact on Atlanta or
the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans a $1 billion fiber-optic network that will link 30
metropolitan areas, including Atlanta. Those areas, which already
have AT&AMP;T fiber, will account for about 80 percent of the demand
for high-speed services, according to Frank Ianna, president of
AT&AMP;T Network Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project will allow us to quickly and economically
increase bandwidth whenever necessary,'' Ianna said.
</P>
<P>
   Bandwidth _ the capacity of a line to transmit huge amounts of
data quickly _ is key to many new services, like video via the
Internet. But AT&AMP;T's local fiber did not connect directly to
consumers _ which is why the company went on an unprecedented
buying spree, hoping to forge detours around local phone companies
that have direct connections to consumer homes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong went to Wall Street and persuaded investors and
analysts that by spending more than $100 billion on acquisitions,
AT&AMP;T would hold a significant if not commanding piece of future
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Computer data, e-mail, phone, video, digital television and
high-speed Internet access would all flow through one wire _ owned
by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But the luster of that vision has dimmed. TCI, a largely rural
system, has been slow to convert to high-speed networks, and
MediaOne, too, will be tough to upgrade and integrate into AT&AMP;T's
system.
</P>
<P>
   At best, it will years before AT&AMP;T's plan bears fruit. At worst,
it will be mired in costly upgrades and outpaced by other
telecommunication systems _ especially the high-speed digital
subscriber lines offered by phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T stock crested in February at more than $63 a share before
starting its long slide. After one resurgence in May, AT&AMP;T fell
steadily, reaching a low of $41.75 a share on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, pre-Armstrong, AT&AMP;T seemingly couldn't do
anything right, and last year, post-Armstrong, they seemingly
couldn't do anything wrong,'' said Jeff Kagan, Atlanta-based
telecommunications analyst. ``Even though AT&AMP;T is making the right
kinds of moves to prepare for the future, we are just starting to
realize how massive a task transforming AT&AMP;T really is.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, AT&AMP;T began talking about ``unlocking the value'' of
its successful wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   The idea had been used with wild success by Sprint. Sprint PCS,
the wireless tracking stock created last year by Sprint, has
already quintupled in value.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless was seen as a high-growth, high-profit business that
could quickly achieve dramatically higher valuations than the old-
line long-distance business or the cable services in which AT&AMP;T
cable service was committed to sinking billions of dollars for
years. Tracking stocks provide no ownership, but instead promise
investors quick growth and often dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock can pump up a company's buying power. As the
tracking stock price rises, the company _ which retains most of the
shares _ has ever more currency to make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions ``are one of the reasons to do a wireless tracker _
to get the currency,'' analyst Guy Woodlief of Prudential
Securities told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The louder the AT&AMP;T secret was whispered, the more the stock
rose. In late November, AT&AMP;T hit $60 a share for the first time
since early July. AT&AMP;T closed Monday at $56.93 3/4, down 6.25 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   As if to highlight AT&AMP;T's challenges, the former chief of AT&AMP;T's
broadband and Internet unit picked Monday to announce that he had
taken a similar slot at Global Crossing, the ambitious company run
by another former AT&AMP;T executive.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Hindery, who left AT&AMP;T after repeated clashes with
Armstrong, will now report to Global Crossing CEO Robert
Annunziata, former CEO of Teleport Communications before it was
purchased by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, like Qwest Communications _ another company led
by an AT&AMP;T expatriates _ touts itself as the network of the future,
a high-speed, low-overhead outfit that will run rings around the
behemoths like AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong has been nothing if not bold.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stock announced Monday will sell a 19 percent stake
in the unit, which has had sales growth of about 40 percent. The
offering, which is expected to raise up to $10 billion, created the
AT&AMP;T Wireless Group.
</P>
<P>
   John Zeglis, president of AT&AMP;T, was named chairman and chief
executive of the new unit.
</P>
<P>
   Zeglis, often mentioned as a candidate for the top job, was
among a host of executives emerging Monday with a new role in the
key units of Internet, wireless and cable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes was the naming of Daniel Somers, who is chief
financial officer, as president and chief executive of AT&AMP;T
Broadband and Internet Services, responsible for cable television
and its upgrade to high-speed data. Somers is already unofficially
in that job, the position left empty by Hindery's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Hesse will remain president and CEO of AT&AMP;T Wireless and
will become executive VP of the AT&AMP;T Wireless Group.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keith, currently president of AT&AMP;T Business Services,
will join AT&AMP;T Wireless Group as executive vice president. Keith,
based in Atlanta for several years in the early 1990s as vice
president for sales in the Southeast, will now will be responsible
for launching a ``fixed wireless'' service that can offer
high-speed access where AT&AMP;T will not own cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the Strategis Group says the ascent
of wireless technology is close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless broadband revenues, most of it coming from local
telephone service and Internet use, will grow at a 418 percent clip
during the next five years, according to Strategis, a
telecommunications consulting group. Wireless broadband revenues
will reach $3.4 billion in 2003, compared to 1999 revenues of $11.2
million, said John Zahurancik, vice president of Strategis Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2003, we forecast that no less than 34 percent of U.S.
households and 45 percent of U.S. businesses will be serviceable by
broadband wireless networks.''

HOLBROOKE TAKES CAMPAIGN AGAINST CONGO CONFLICT TO SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Richard Holbrooke, the chief American
delegate to the United Nations, called on the warring parties in
Congo on Monday to live up to the peace accord they signed several
months ago, adding that other nations will help but not before they
see signs of sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here to foreign affairs experts and journalists,
Holbrooke praised the framework of the agreement signed in July and
August in the Zambian capital, Lusaka. He said that until steps
were taken to carry out the agreement, the United States would not
support sending peacekeepers to Congo, the sprawling central
African nation formerly called Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peacekeeping requires far more than just words, more than
paper agreements,'' he said. ``The parties to the Lusaka agreement
must respect their commitments if peace is to return to the Congo.
The international community cannot simply impose peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said that there will be no American troops for an African
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is visiting leaders of all the countries involved
in the conflict, expressed concern about recent battles between
rebels and government forces in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The renewed fighting in the Congo, which is a direct violation
of the Lusaka agreement, threatens to leave this important
agreement in tatters,'' he said. ``If the parties in Congo truly
want the international community's involvement and support, such
violations are simply unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's message will be repeated often over the next few
days. His tour of Africa has already taken him to Angola and
Namibia, both supporters of the Congolese government. After his
speech here in South Africa's administrative capital, Holbrooke's
agenda included visits to Zimbabwe and Zambia, which have also
backed the Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
   From Zambia he will go to Congo, to meet with President Laurent
Kabila, and to Uganda and Rwanda, both of which have been backing
the rebels in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila led a rebellion from eastern Congo that succeeded, in May
1997, in taking power from the longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.
A year later, a rebel movement began against his government, and
the neighboring countries have provided support to one side or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke hopes he can push the parties toward finally
appointing a mediator, as called for in the Lusaka agreement, to
guide the early stages of carrying it out. It would be a simple but
very significant step, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's efforts to address the conflict in Congo come as the
United States is preparing to assume the presidency of the U.N.
Security Council next month. Holbrooke said on Sunday that he
intends to the use the position to focus attention on Africa and in
particular the conflicts in Congo and Angola, where a long-running
civil war has started again.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has authorized a force of 500 military
observers as a prelude to a peacekeeping force in Congo. But the
renewed fighting has prevented the observers from beginning their
work and would make a peacekeeping effort a waste at this point,
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot expect that alone, outside peacekeepers will deliver
a peace that is lasting and just,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Holbrooke made it clear that he did not expect
his visits to solve the Congo conflict, but that he hoped they
might push the process forward a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders and experts say that the United States has an
important role to play but that ultimately the responsibility rests
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the U.S. going to directly affect this? No, not in any
way,'' said Jakkie Potgieter, a researcher at the Institute for
Security Studies in South Africa and an expert on military conflict
in Africa. ``But it is important. It reassures the region around
the conflict, countries like South Africa that are working very
hard trying to resolve this, that the U.S. supports what they are
doing.''

FRITZ FISCHER, GERMAN HISTORIAN, DIES AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Britain, Germany)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fritz Fischer, the German historian who rankled his peers and
Germans in general with the thesis that Imperial Germany was
squarely responsible for World War I and its consequences, died on
Dec. 1 in Hamburg. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a longtime Hamburg resident, had been a professor
emeritus at the University of Hamburg since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He stirred a hornet's nest in 1961 with the proposition that
Germany's naked ambition to spread its political and economic
domination across Europe and beyond, to Africa, caused the war.
What nettled his critics even more was the moderate language and
obvious scholarship with which he made his points.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy initially simmered in Hamburg. Then the news
magazine Der Spiegel reviewed his book and capsulized its
conclusions in 1964. Heated arguments continued for years, although
younger German historians later agreed that many of his inferences
from contemporary documents had some merit.
</P>
<P>
   Outside his country, Fischer became Germany's best-known living
historian. The book that had caused such commotion was published in
the United States as ``Germany's Aims in the First World War''
(Norton, 1967). Its title was a neutralized version of the German
original ``The Grasp for World Power,'' which gave a clearer idea
of the author's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It challenged the traditional view that Germany, like the other
great powers, stumbled into the war, and that there were those on
all sides who tried to avert it or halt it before it grew into the
catastrophe it became. Some modern British historians have also
taken the middle view that there was enough blame to go around and
that Britain had its share.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Fischer was born in Ludwigsstadt in imperial Germany, the
son of a railroad inspector. He graduated from the University of
Berlin with a doctorate in theology in 1934 and a doctorate in
philosophy in 1937. He taught church history in Berlin until 1939,
when he joined the history faculty in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he served with air force ground personnel and
was taken prisoner at the end of the war for two years, after which
he returned to Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of several more books on World War I and
German history and society. Over the years he also lectured and
taught as a visiting professor at universities throughout Europe,
as well as the University of Notre Dame. He was a honorary member
of the British Academy and the American Historical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 he married Margarete Lauth-Volkmann. There was no
immediate word on survivors.

 &HT;    Fall in stock price reflects abrupt change in leadership
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reflecting the uncertainties of a shift in management,
shares of Coca-Cola fell as much as 8.3 percent Monday on three
times average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   The shares tumbled to as low as $62.62 1/2 before finishing at
$63.93 3/4, down $4.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13.2 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts were divided on the near-term prospects
for the stock, which fell to a 52-week low of $47.31 1/4 about two
months ago before rebounding on several recent ``buy''
recommendations from brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation was that Coca-Cola's profits would recover next
year as prices and sales volumes rise and overseas markets pick up.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Coca-Cola reported volume trends during October and
November are tracking ahead of growth from the third quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the trends reflect improving economic
conditions in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The volume trend figures exclude those Cadbury Schweppes
beverage brands that Coke acquired in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also has been raising prices, hoping to boost profit.
</P>
<P>
   But the management change unsettled some investors, leading to
the sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's concern out there that even though Coke has given
indications volume is beginning to turn around, the change in
leadership could disrupt that process,'' explained analyst Tim
Drake of Banc One Investment Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns might be misplaced, said money manager Phillip M.
Larkins of Atlanta-based Legacy South, which owns 200,000 Coca-Cola
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would view the change as an effort to mend fences
internationally, particularly in Europe, with a non-American CEO,''
said Larkins, noting that Douglas N. Daft, who will succeed current
chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester next April, is an
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent the stock-price decline doesn't reflect renewed
earnings worries, I think it's a buying opportunity. It's not every
day a stock drops 8 percent or so.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Larkins noted that even at Monday's price,
Coca-Cola's shares still trade at a hefty premium to that of the
benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, of which it is a
member.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares now trade at 51.6 times trailing 12-month
earnings; and 49.5 times estimated 1999 earnings of $1.29 a share.
The S&AMP;P 500 is trading at 31.5 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you're nervous about the stock market, you don't
buy,'' Larkins said. ``But if you were looking to buy the stock,
you might at least begin to take an initial position. If you were
contemplating buying 1,000 shares, you might want to go ahead and
buy 500 shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkins said that based on the company's improving fundamentals,
he doesn't believe the stock will fall back to October's lows.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts that recently recommend the shares continued to
do so Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Douglas Lane of Merrill Lynch, who kept his
``buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock has sold off on the news because it was sudden and
unexpected, but we believe that Coke has a very deep bench, and
that fundamentals continue to improve at the company,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   The management change signals ``a close to a very difficult
chapter in the company's history'' and a change in management
style, Lane added.
</P>
<P>
   But several other analysts removed their ``buy''
recommendations, including Andrew J. Conway of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. He downgraded the stock to ``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   K. Timothy Swanson of A.G. Edwards lowered his rating to
``maintain position'' from ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have noted that, under Ivester, Coca-Cola's stock
has risen just 11 percent, trailing the 48 percent rise in the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in two decades, the stock's price is on
track for an annual decline.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, investors apparently weren't concerned about the
company's prospects last year, when they bid up the stock price to
as high as $87.93 3/4 on July 14. At that price, the stock was
trading at about 58 times trailing 12-month earnings, showing its
biggest P/E expansion in decades.
</P>
<P>
   To compare, the stock traded as low as eight times earnings in
January 1982, before the current bull market began.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Coca-Cola's shares are held by individuals, with
the other half owned by institutional investors.

   DETROIT _ In a concession to environmentalists, the Ford Motor
Co. said Monday that it would pull out of the Global Climate
Coalition, a group of big manufacturers and oil and mining
companies that lobbies against restrictions on emissions of gases
linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's decision is the latest sign of divisions within heavy
industry over how to respond to global warming. British Petroleum
and Shell pulled out of the coalition two years ago following
criticisms from environmental groups in Europe, where there has
been more public concern than in the United States. Most scientists
believe that emissions from automobiles, power plants and other
man-made sources are warming the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum and Shell were so-called general, or junior,
members of the lobbying group. Ford is the first company belonging
to the board that has withdrawn, and the first American company to
leave the coalition, said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's chairman since the beginning of this year, William C.
Ford Jr., is a great-grandson of Henry Ford and has long been
active in environmental causes. He has conceded that global warming
is an international problem that requires action, although he has
echoed other industry leaders in opposing the global warming
agreement reached two years ago in Kyoto, Japan. That agreement,
signed by more than 100 nations, calls for reducing man-made
emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases by
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists had questioned whether Ford's company had
shifted its position much, and demanded that Ford leave the
coalition. ``Over the course of time,'' said Terry Bresnihan, a
spokesman for the automaker, ``membership in the Global Climate
Coalition has become something of an impediment for Ford Motor to
credibly achieving our environmental objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresnihan said Ford remains opposed to the Kyoto agreement
because developing nations are largely exempt from its rules.
Connie Holmes, the coalition's chairman, said the group opposed the
Kyoto agreement and wanted more scientific research into whether
global warming was a problem, adding that she did not believe
Ford's current position was much different from the coalition's.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's predecessor as chairman, Alexander Trotman, who became a
British life peer earlier this year, had been one of corporate
America's most outspoken leaders in opposing international pacts on
global warming. Lord Trotman and his counterparts from General
Motors and Chrysler met with President Clinton in October, 1997,
and tried to talk him out of seeking an agreement two months later
in Kyoto. After meeting the president, Lord Trotman held a press
conference outside the White House and denounced the
administration's position.

PEDIATRICIANS URGE USE OF SAFER POLIO VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended Monday that
doctors should stop using the oral polio vaccine, made from a
weakened live virus, and switch over to injections, which contain
the dead polio virus.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the routine childhood immunization schedule, all
infants get the vaccine for polio, the highly contagious intestinal
infection that can spread quickly to the brain and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been controversy about the oral vaccine because,
although indigenous polio has been eradicated from the United
States since 1979, a few people get polio each year from the
vaccine designed to prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's new policy, to go into effect Jan. 1, is published
in the December issue of Pediatrics, the academy's journal.
</P>
<P>
   The oral vaccine was used for so long because it had a public
health benefit that the killed virus does not. When polio outbreaks
were common, people who received the killed vaccine in the
injectible form could still carry the indigenous virus in their
intestines and infect those who were not vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the inactivated vaccine only provided specific
immunity to the child receiving the vaccine. With the oral vaccine,
the child could also pass on immunity to those who didn't receive
the vaccine, doctors said, calling that an important advantage in
communities of unvaccinated individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though natural polio has been officially eradicated in the
United States since 1979, there were five cases of polio from
people entering the country with the disease between 1980 and 1986.
Because all children still must get their polio vaccine before
starting school, the disease didn't spread with those ``imported''
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But between 1992 and 1993, an ``imported'' virus in the
Netherlands resulted in 70 cases of polio in a community whose
members refused vaccination for religious reasons. Of those, two
died and 59 became paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The AAP has suggested doctors could use up their remaining
supplies of oral vaccine for the third and fourth doses in the
series of four that children receive, but they should not buy more.
There has not been a case of vaccine-caused polio when the first
two doses are injected and the last two oral, said the AAP.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Duplease of North Haven, Conn. is critical of the academy
for allowing a grace period so remaining supplies of the oral
vaccine could be used. Her six-year-old daughter, Alexis
Duplease-Landolfi, has to wear a leg brace on her right leg because
she got polio from the vaccine after the first dose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like how the academy has told the doctors that they
need to go to an all-injectible schedule and then give them another
chance to use up their leftover vaccines. Another parent should not
have to go through what I have,'' Duplease said.
</P>
<P>
   The company that has produced the oral vaccine, Wyeth-Lederle
Vaccines, no longer sells or produces it, said a company
spokeswoman. Physicians are able to obtain a full refund or credit
for the unused oral vaccines, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Georges Peter, a professor of pediatrics at Brown University
School of Medicine and member of the Committee of Infectious
Diseases of the AAP, said the transitional period was allowed
because there was no guarantee that the manufacturer would take
back the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The six-month period is only to provide a time limit. I don't
think there will be much use of the oral vaccine after the first
one or two months,'' Peter said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the oral vaccine should be used only when there is
a polio outbreak or when previously unvaccinated children will be
traveling in less than four weeks to polio-endemic areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a country that still had polio, it would be a
mistake to recommend the inactivated vaccine,'' Peter said.

 &HT;    Latest bad news in Juarez casts pall on economy, life
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Chihuahua _ Francisco Alcanter's eyes searched
for tourists coming over the international bridge from El Paso.
``Taxi?'' he asked, jockeying with other cab drivers for business.
</P>
<P>
   Alcanter has seen the news about Mexican and U.S. officials
digging for bodies at two ranches near Juarez, where they believe
victims of the city's long-running drug war are buried. The latest
headlines bother Alcanter, who remains skeptical of reports of mass
graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publicity, unfortunately, hurts a lot of families,'' he
said. ``The tourists listen to the news, and they're afraid to come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Juarez, a blue-collar factory city of
almost 2 million people, has been the scene of more than any city's
share of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 women have been slain in Juarez since 1993, many
of them young factory workers abducted as they returned home from
jobs in one of the city's 330 maquiladoras, the U.S.-owned plants
where Mexican workers assemble products for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The string of killings, which many Juarez residents suspect are
the work of one or more serial killers, ha-- attracted worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
   When drug kingpin Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who ran the powerful
Juarez cartel for years, died in July 1997 after undergoing plastic
surgery and liposuction, a bloody war for control of his empire
broke out in Juarez's streets. Gunmen massacred people in
restaurants. Bodies turned up all over the city. And people began
vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   All over Juarez, the violence has bred fear, and fear has
changed how many people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go from home to work and from work to home,'' said Eduardo
Lopez, a Juarez resident who works as a bricklayer in El Paso.
Lopez said he and his wife have two children, ages 4 and 8, and
``we don't let them go out, only to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Estrada, who has lived in Juarez for 42 years, said she
doesn't think the city's law-abiding citizens can do much to change
things. The drug traffickers have too much money and too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police don't do anything,'' Estrada said. ``They're
connected to all that (drug activity).''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Hervella, president of an El Paso group called the
Association of Relatives and Friends of Disappeared Persons, said
his group has counted 196 missing people in Juarez and El Paso.
Families in Juarez have reported loved ones dragged from their
homes by armed, uniformed men in vans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mexican authorities, aided by 65 FBI agents, began
excavating what may be the graves of people who have disappeared
during the past four years. Authorities have reported finding six
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez and El Paso, two cities linked by history, economics
and blood ties, images of masked Mexican soldiers guarding the
grave sites made residents shudder and businesspeople worry.
</P>
<P>
   For El Paso resident Javier Arias, the latest grim news just
reinforced his anxiety about crossing into Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, a Chihuahua native who lived in Juarez for 16 years
before moving to the U.S. side of the river, said he frequently
visits family in Juarez _ but only during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go at night,'' he said. ``Juarez is beautiful, but
it's not like before. It's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   On Juarez Avenue, the main strip leading from one of the
international bridges downtown, the pharmacies and gift shops
lining the crowded street live or die on tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby discos, which under Mexican law can serve alcohol to
anyone over 18, draw U.S. high school and college students with
thumping music and cheap drinks.
</P>
<P>
   El Pasoans routinely cross the border to dine, shop and visit
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   News of the graves is likely to hurt businesses on both sides of
the Rio Grande, at least temporarily, said Tom Fullerton, an
economist at the University of Texas at El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has no data to show how highly publicized crime
affects border businesses, Fullerton said businesspeople in both
cities have reported slowdowns after past news flurries.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez's merchants will ride out this latest wave of unwanted
international attention, as they have for years, said Felipe
Sorcia, who runs Mexico Lindo Curios on Juarez Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't affect us much,'' Sorcia said. ``Crisis is a
permanent condition in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Aguilar, 20, a Juarez native who is studying microbiology
at UTEP, said the restaurant shootings didn't stop students from
flowing into Juarez's entertainment district, and neither will the
latest news.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the discos are full of people from El Paso,'' he said.
``My friends here go regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Maese, a 22-year-old El Pasoan, said, ``I still go over
there. I'm not scared. It's good food; it's a good atmosphere. It's
cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Maese's 31-year-old friend shook his head, saying he hasn't been
to Juarez in a year. The man, who refused to give his name _ ``You
can't be too careful around here,'' he explained _ said one of his
friends, a 25-year-old UTEP student named Carlos Valmana, died in
1997 when gunmen sprayed Geronimo's Bar and Grill in Juarez with
automatic rifle fire. Valmana, a bystander, was among three killed
in what police called a drug-related hit.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came a month after six people died in similar fashion
at the Max-Fin restaurant, next door to Geronimo's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss Juarez,'' said Maese's friend, an El Paso native. ``But
you don't want to be a statistic. You never know what's going to
happen.''

 &HT;    Students help bring gifts to Honduras
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hoping to balm still-raw memories from a shooting last
May at Heritage High School that left six of their classmates
wounded, two Conyers, Ga., teenagers left Monday for Honduras to
help evangelist Franklin Graham deliver small Christmas gifts to
destitute and dying children.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said senior Tracie Watkins, 18, and junior Cary Sanders,
16, were chosen to take part in this year's ``Operation Christmas
Child'' program because their brush with tragedy will help them
empathize with some of the poorest people on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   While their modest gifts will ``bring great joy'' to the
Honduran children, who have nothing, it also will prove cathartic
for the Heritage teens, who in comparison, have practically
everything, Graham said in an interview. Meeting the poor Honduran
kids will make Conyers teens realize even more how lucky they are,
Graham said, though their memories of that bloody day last May will
never go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also thought this would be a wonderful way to show the good
that's in the schools where tragedies have occurred,'' said Graham,
47, son of evangelist Billy Graham and his already-anointed
successor. ``This will help the girls see how fortunate they are,
even though they have gone through tragic circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduras has always been among the poorest nations. And last
fall, Hurricane Mitch slammed into the Central American country,
killing 13,000 people _ a horrific tragedy in a republic of less
than 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, head of Samaritan's Purse, a $100 million-a-year
nonprofit relief organization in Boone, N.C., piloted a twin-engine
Sabreliner to Honduras after a news conference Monday morning with
Watkins and Sanders. They spoke near a cargo hangar, where 70,000
brightly-colored shoe boxes stuffed with toys packed by children in
Georgia and Alabama were loaded aboard a gigantic Russian-made
freight plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can touch the heart of even a single child, this project
will be an amazing success, Sanders told a crowd of several hundred
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Graham and his organization have delivered shoe box
gifts to almost 6 million underprivileged children in dozens of
war- and crisis-torn countries. This year, Graham said, 3 million
shoe box gifts will be delivered in 60 such countries.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the police car pulled up, the twelve were
sitting in a tired heap with 15 shopping carts and two dogs along a
landscaping wall outside the Trinity Plaza Apartments on Market
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Not an hour earlier, two officers had chased them all from a
park across the street, at the tourist-filled United Nations Plaza.
Not 10 minutes earlier, one of them, Caesar Cruz, a resident of the
alleys for three years, had said he felt like crumpled paper in the
wind, tossed from here to there all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Now an officer was saying someone had complained about them.
Cruz, holding two $76 summonses for ``camping in public'' (sleeping
in a doorway), worried about getting another. So he nodded again
and again when the officer said he would like Cruz to ``move
along.''
</P>
<P>
   No one uttered a word in protest. Everyone scattered.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not always so easy to make people who live on the
streets disappear. In San Francisco, homeless people haunt the
city: cocooned in doorways, pushing overloaded shopping carts,
standing on corners announcing their troubles on cardboard signs
(``Veteran, homeless and hungry'').
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is far from alone. At the richest time in the
nation's history, housing that the poor can afford is at an
all-time low, fueling an increase in homelessness, according to the
U.S. Conference of Mayors. And with complaints about beggars and
bag ladies and mumbling, stumbling vagrants growing as well, cities
are fighting as never before to move homeless people out of public
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, officials give homeless people one-way bus
tickets out of town. In Santa Ana, it is illegal to sit in the
Civic Center with belongings that occupy more than 3 cubic feet. In
Atlanta, a person who asks for money more than twice from a
passer-by who ignores the request can be arrested. In Seattle,
those caught sleeping in parks can be banned from them.
</P>
<P>
   For many cities, the model is New York, where Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's quality-of-life initiative swept midtown Manhattan of
panhandlers and squeegee men in the early 1990s. Thousands of
homeless people were ticketed, and many were arrested, for offenses
like sleeping in parks or obstructing sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   (While Giuliani recently announced that homeless people will
have to work for a shelter bed, New York is the only city that
guarantees any homeless person shelter on demand, and it has the
nation's most extensive services for the homeless.)
</P>
<P>
   Laws aimed at people on the streets have become popular in the
last 10 years, and even more so in the last five, as the booming
economy has brought real estate developers, tourists and well-to-do
home buyers back to central cities. The scramble for space has made
once overlooked neighborhoods _ the kind where
single-room-occupancy hotels thrived and the very poor lived
unnoticed _ hot properties. The catch is that they must be scrubbed
clean.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown revitalization or business improvement plans often
include park curfews and ordinances popularly known as
quality-of-life laws that make sleeping, lying down, and sometimes
sitting and standing in public, offenses punishable by
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Of 49 cities surveyed last year by the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, 73 percent were enacting or enforcing
such laws, up from 26 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   City officials talk about ``tough love'' approaches to forcing
homeless people to seek help, and about the growing impatience for
what some, echoing President Ronald Reagan, call the ``homeless by
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who fail to realize that we have to pay a
price if we want to improve the quality of life,'' said the Rev.
Amos Brown, a San Francisco supervisor. He has proposed a city
ordinance that would ban standing on a corner or street median for
more than five minutes, to discourage panhandling. Loiterers would
face a $250 fine and up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to decide, are we going to be a society where there's
a sense of order,'' Brown said, ``or do we want a disorderly
society where anything goes?''
</P>
<P>
   The Change
</P>
<P>
   From Society Ill to Personal Problem
</P>
<P>
   Whether fueled by highly publicized attacks by mentally
disturbed people described as homeless, or exhausted by the seeming
intractability of the problem, the current policies and attitudes
toward the homeless are a stark change from barely a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, 6 million people formed a 4,000-mile line coast to
coast to raise money to fight hunger and homelessness. These days,
solving homelessness has faded from the public consciousness.
Poverty, despite President Clinton's two forays this year to
down-and-out communities, barely rates the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homelessness has gone from being a societal problem to being a
messed-up individual's problem,'' said Paul Boden, a board member
of the National Coalition for the Homeless and a director of the
San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness. ``There is an attitude
that with unemployment at record lows, with the stock market at
record highs, if you're poor, it's your own damn fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in communities enforcing quality-of-life laws say they
are doing all they can to house and to provide medical and
mental-health services for the truly needy, despite increasing
competition for state and federal money.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor say many communities are spending
more energy and resources on plans to police and prosecute the down
and out as quality-of-life offenders than on tackling the causes of
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science to figure out that people become
homeless because of the lack of affordable housing and support
services for those who are mentally ill or addicted,'' said Mary
Ann Gleason, director of the National Coalition for the Homeless.
``Yet it's true that in many communities across the country, cities
are responding in not very helpful ways to the growing need for
affordable housing and accessible health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to discharge people from prisons and hospitals
into shelters. We continue to put people who need help with
substance abuse on long waiting lists. And now, putting people in
jail for doing in public what other people have the privilege to do
in private seems to be the way to go.''

   The Sweep
</P>
<P>
   Using the Law and Persuasion
</P>
<P>
   California's capital, Sacramento, began cracking down on street
people about four years ago, pushed by business people trying to
improve the city's image. The Downtown Sacramento Partnership,
which represents about 550 businesses, employs about 20 people that
it calls city guides to patrol 65 blocks. The patrols,
concentrating on tourist areas and shopping zones, call the police
when they find someone sleeping on the street or panhandling.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make this a destination and encourage continued
revitalization, we need to continue to make it clear that downtown
is not going to be a place where panhandling and other negative
activity is tolerated,'' said Michael Ault, the partnership's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento has become ``tired of the constancy'' of
homelessness, said Heather Fargo, a councilwoman, who said the city
was spending $14 million on homeless programs this year, up from
$1.6 million 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that many other communities have made, Sacramento,
after weeks of coaxing scores of people from an encampment along a
river parkway, began offering them bus tickets out of town. City
officials said they sent away only those who had a relative or
friend who had agreed to take them in.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby communities have found even more creative ways to police
their streets. In Roseville, a suburb about 25 miles east of
Sacramento, the police go under cover to catch panhandlers in the
act. Homeless people say they are often escorted out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Marysville, an old gold-rush town of 12,500 residents about 40
miles north of Sacramento, has painted 10 parking meters red,
removed the timers and called them homeless meters. Signs on the
machines say: ``Donation here will help the homeless. Please do not
give cash to panhandlers.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has also banned shopping carts from city streets and
rummaging through trash, and ``Dumpster diving,'' except with
permission of the property owner.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Siemens, the Marysville city administrator and chief of
police, said the city began cracking down on panhandling five years
ago, after ``a huge backlash from the business population in
town.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 to 50 transients and street people would haunt a
two-square-mile area, Siemens said. Many came by freight train, he
said, drawn by the city's rescue mission and other services for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said: ``When they realize, `Gee whiz, it just doesn't do
any good to stand on a corner and beg for money,' they find
someplace else to go. If there's no good fishing in the lake, you
find another lake.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, police sweeps and crackdowns on homeless
people have become so well known that in October the National
Coalition for the Homeless chose the city as the site to open a
national campaign for civil rights for the homeless. This year the
police here issued more than 20,000 citations for violations of
ordinances like trespassing, camping, carrying an open container
and violating park curfews, compared with 17,500 in 1998 and 15,700
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Because the citations do not appear to be making a dent in the
homeless population, the city's Board of Supervisors recently
approved $250,000 for the city attorney to set up a special unit
dedicated to prosecuting those offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Many people seem to approve. In random interviews with three
dozen people in San Francisco, many had qualified sympathy for the
homeless but most were also harshly critical of people they felt
were unwilling to change their situation. Only a fourth of those
interviewed named high housing costs as a cause of homelessness; a
third blamed laziness or addictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really sympathize,'' said Leia Sutton, a waitress. ``I
feel they are already taken such good care of with financial aid
and food stamps. They get free food. And I think it's making a lot
of them not get off their butts and survive for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron James, a parking control officer in San Francisco, blamed
housing costs. ``Yuppies from Silicon Valley are coming in and
sending the prices soaring,'' he said. ``Studios are going for
$1,200 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nabil Salem, 30, who owns the McCallister Market and Deli,
in the Tenderloin neighborhood where many homeless people live,
sees a lack of personal responsibility in the people he brushes
from his doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big problem for retailers,'' Salem said. ``Every
morning I come in to open up the store. And they're sleeping in the
doorway. Or they have left boxes, where they've slept. Or food.
They urinate or sometimes defecate. And it smells. I get so mad. It
happens all the time. Every morning. It takes me two hours to clean
it up sometimes. Why should I have to put up with that?''
</P>
<P>
   In October the city announced a plan to confiscate shopping
carts as stolen property from the hundreds of people who use them
to carry their belongings. The plan was canceled when the public
protested that the idea was cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in recent interviews with dozens of homeless people, most
reported having their possessions thrown away by teams hired by
supermarkets to retrieve the shopping carts, or by the police, who
seize the carts as abandoned property, even as the homeless person
stands by.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just took my stuff and dumped it in a Dumpster, and I had
all my papers in there,'' said Tyrone Saunders, 35, who has been
homeless for four years. ``I have AIDS, so I had to go fishing
through the garbage to get my stuff back. I don't ask nobody for
nothing. I clean floors at the corner store for my money. And
everyone still sees me as dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the police have also started arresting
volunteers for handing out food to homeless people (without having
a permit to do so) at United Nations Plaza. (The catch: The city
will not grant them a permit.) ``I have never seen anything so
mean-spirited,'' said Sister Bernie Galvin, director of Religious
Witness With Homeless People, an interfaith advocacy group, who was
one of those arrested and held in jail for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   George Smith, the director of the Mayor's Office on
Homelessness, and a former homeless drug user, acknowledged that
the police crackdowns had done little to help matters. He said the
city was in the process of increasing teams of outreach workers to
offer help to street people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people moving through the system successfully all the
time,'' he said. But, he said, ``San Francisco can't be expected to
solve a national problem.''

   The Shelters
</P>
<P>
   Rising Opposition to Growing Need
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, officials insist that the people wandering the
streets night and day come from elsewhere. They say the homeless
are drawn to a place by its weather or welfare allowance or
reputation for tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, studies of homeless people have suggested that most of
them once lived in the communities where they are homeless. Dennis
Culhane, a professor of social welfare policy at the University of
Pennsylvania, who has studied homelessness, said that based on
analyses in New York City and Philadelphia, homeless people were,
predictably, the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   They come from the poorest neighborhoods, where people pay the
most for their housing relative to income, they crowd together to
afford housing costs, and they have the highest unemployment and
temporary employment rates. Their neighborhoods have the worst
levels of housing abandonment. ``We have found that evictions are
the single biggest threat to homelessness,'' Culhane said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it seems, wants homeless people in their back yard. In
communities where homeless people are regularly cited for begging
or sleeping or trespassing, officials are encountering mounting
resistance when they try to open shelters to house those they have
swept off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, where an estimated 22,000 people are homeless, two
proposed shelters are stalled by opposition. Earlier this year, a
donor bought a building on Peachtree Street, the city's main
thoroughfare, for the Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless.
The task force proposed converting the building, which housed an
arts group, to a shelter that that would also provide counseling
for abuse of drugs and alcohol and help in getting jobs and
long-term housing.
</P>
<P>
   But the building is in the renovated downtown, where more than
9,000 homeless people were arrested in the 12 months before the
1996 Olympic Games for violating newly enacted quality-of-life
laws, and opposition to the shelter was swift and loud.
</P>
<P>
   The city requested that single men be housed in a separate
building from women and children in order for the project to
proceed. But when the task force then signed a contract to buy a
former nightclub in an industrial neighborhood, that, too, met
protests, and city officials earlier this month refused to support
the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the closest real neighborhood is across a highway, the
area is in the process of revitalization, with landlords converting
warehouses into loft condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't open it here, then where?'' said Anita Beaty,
co-director of the task force, as she looked around the pocked
landscape surrounding the empty building on a recent visit. Some 85
to 90 women and children have been sleeping in the task-force
office on recent nights, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, about two dozen men were lying a stone's throw
from the building where the men's shelter would be built. They live
under the highway, not on the ground but tucked under the top of
supports that hold an elevated section. In broad daylight, they
were shrouded in darkness. Only the glint of eyes and teeth were
visible, and several of the men covered their faces when they
noticed people observing them.

LAHORE, Pakistan: 1999. 7 a.m.''.

<P>
   Iqbal made these homicidal unburdenings seem the prelude to his
own premeditated death. ``I am on my way to drown myself in the
River Ravi,'' he wrote. ``I have planned to tie a heavy rock to
myself so that I can die quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police have dragged the shallow waters of the Ravi and
found no body. ``I am quite sure he is alive,'' said Malik Muhammad
Iqbal, the regional head of police. ``He is a very clever man. He
is enjoying his fame. He is reading the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   The police say they have arrested three men who admit to being
employees of Iqbal and his accomplices in the killings, using
chains to help choke the victims. ``And we will catch the main
culprit too,'' said Inspector Ashiq Marth, who runs the Ravi Road
police station, where crowds continue to gather. ``If I catch him
personally, I will commit against him what the law would call a
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahore, perhaps Pakistan's greatest cultural center, is a city
enriched by centuries-old monuments built by Mughal rulers and
stately Victorian buildings left by the British. It is where
Kipling begins the novel ``Kim,'' the main character a young boy on
his own in a ``stealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes''
of the mysterious walled city.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal rented a $40-a-month, three-room apartment in a narrow
alley off busy Ravi Road, just a few miles from where Kipling's
story takes shape.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is still a magnet for young boys in search of
independence. Some become pickpockets, some prostitutes, some drug
addicts. Some merely hang out around the Data Ganj Baksh, a giant
shrine named for an 11th-century Sufi saint. The police say that
Iqbal and his confederates found much of their prey beneath the
shadow of the great minarets and enticed the youngsters with offers
of good food and lively music.
</P>
<P>
   The photos show most of the boys bare-chested, standing before a
wooden window of the decrepit apartment. When the police finally
entered _ invited as they were by Iqbal's revelatory mailing _ they
found handwritten placards on the walls to serve as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five sacks lying in the corner of this room contain the
clothes of 100 victims while the remaining three contain 85 pairs
of shoes belonging to them,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   Barrels of chemicals were stored in the V-shaped room farthest
from the front door. ``Today, dated Nov. 25, 1999, I have decided
to commit suicide,'' read another poster. ``Yesterday, I killed my
employee, Sajid, and incinerated his body in the container so that
he could be punished for theft and for disturbing me again and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, police have questioned dozens of people
who have been part of Iqbal's life, including two former wives, a
son and a daughter, and a variety of relatives who say they had
been estranged from him. ``His family was angry with him because of
his bad habits,'' said Marth, a huge man capable of an occasional
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers, piecing together scraps of Iqbal's past,
report that he was caught committing sodomy against young boys as
far back as 1985. Back then, neighbors humbled rather than
reporting him _ demanding that he go door-to-door admitting his
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal was later arrested several times for child molesting, but
he managed to avoid prison by failing to show up in court or by
buying his freedom. He inherited a share of his father's
scrap-metal business in the early 1990s, converting his portion
into about $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here say better police work might have prevented Iqbal's
mortal binge. Even after receiving the killer's well-substantiated
confession, the police were slow to investigate. Reporters preceded
policemen to the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the victims had been reported missing to the authorities.
Some parents who did make reports said they had been thrashed by
constables for being bothersome. ``The poor have no friends in a
police station,'' said one father.
</P>
<P>
   Grieving parents blamed themselves as well, however. In the
courtyard of the Ravi Road station, as people searched through the
heaps of clothes under a peepul tree, many said their sons had run
away because of harsh discipline or simple neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son ran off because I made him work,'' said Hassan Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Rashida Bibi, desperate to again hold anything that had belonged
to her 14-year-old son, rued her own lack of concern at his
disappearance. Once before, he had gone away for a month and then
come back. She thought this time would be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she now found herself begging the police to bring out
his belongings, which they had removed from the heap and stored.
``I want to smell the clothes of my son,'' the weeping mother said.
``What else is there to do? Nothing else of him is left.''

MRS. CLINTON MAY BE ENJOYING HER LAST WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As visitors awaiting the arrival of First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton inspected the decorations adorning the
official White House Christmas tree _ one for each state and the
District of Columbia -- one of them asked, ``Where's New York?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prominently displayed somewhere,'' quipped White House Social
Secretary Capricia Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Clinton planning to move soon to New York to run for
the US Senate, even her traditional announcement of the White House
holiday theme pivots to her future as a Senate candidate from New
York and whether this will be her last Christmas in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, whose role as first lady is epitomized during the
holiday season when the White House is decked out in Christmas
decorations and becomes a revolving door of holiday parties, said
Monday she has begun packing and will move to New York as soon as
the Secret Service finishes securing the $1.7 million house she and
the president bought last summer in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service is moving forward, and making the changes
that they have to make,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I'm pulling things
out of storage and deciding what has to be recovered, or
reupholstered.'' She said she is ``looking to begin moving things
in later this month, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether this will be the last year she will be
available to host such Christmas receptions at the White House, she
demurred. ``We'll certainly be here for Christmas and we're looking
forward to having our entire family and guests and friends here for
the Christmas holidays,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mrs. Clinton said she plans to step back from her
role as first lady after Jan. 1 so she can devote a majority of her
time to campaigning for the Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the moving date hasn't been set, and neither has she bought
any furniture. ``I'm mostly trying to use what I have. I may have
to buy some things, but I'm trying to be really clear about what I
do have and get those in the best possible shape.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, the demands of moving to New York are
giving way to the demands of her duties as first lady, which often
intensify during the holiday season. She will play host to some
eight holiday receptions, along with playing a central role in
millennium festivities in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This year's theme, ``Holiday Treasures at the White House,''
drips with nostalgia and is a compendium of Mrs. Clinton's
interests in historical and cultural sites as honorary chair of the
Saving America's Treasures program.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Foyer, the entire Christmas tree features replicas
of places Mrs. Clinton visited on her tour, including Eleanor
Roosevelt's Val-Kill Cottage in Hyde Park, N.Y.; Benedict Arnold's
Revolutionary War Gunboat in Vergennes, Vt.; and Ventfort Hall in
Stockbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The official White House tree, an 18 1/2-foot Noble fir from
Washington state that adorns the Blue Room, is decorated with
11,911 scenes and objects as well as 80 handmade dolls featuring
aviator Amelia Earhart, scientist Albert Einstein, civil rights
activist Rosa Parks and three dolls of the abolitionist Harriet
Tubman.
</P>
<P>
   The mantels and pier tables in the Green Room, the Red Room, and
other areas of the White House also feature hand-crafted
reproductions of historic buildings across the country. The main
foyer is decorated with reproduction fruit in the style of Colonial
Williamsburg. White House pastry chefs created a 220-pound
gingerbread sculpture of the White House, the Jefferson Memorial,
the Washington Monument and Mount Vernon, with chocolate trees
lining the bank of the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also unveiled this year's White House greeting
card, an impressionist painting of the North Portico, which Mrs.
Clinton described as one of her favorite views of the White House.
The artist, Ray Ellis of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., also did last
year's greeting card.

BRADLEY, GORE FEUD OVER TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an escalating feud between the two Democratic
presidential candidates, Bill Bradley Monday denied that he had
called for a tax increase to help pay for his health care plan, and
he accused Vice President Al Gore of ``falsely'' distorting the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not proposing a tax increase,'' Bradley said, seeking to
clarify remarks he first made last Thursday. ``I specifically said
I was not proposing a tax increase and the Vice President knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fight is over more than taxes. After Bradley made
significant political headway by proposing a program for
near-universal health insurance, Gore has defended his
less-sweeping proposal as more fiscally realistic. By seizing on
the cost of Bradley's plan, Gore hopes to shift the debate away
from health care details and onto the possibility that Bradley may
have to raise taxes to pay for his expansive initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The tax issue, however, cuts both ways. While the two candidates
Monday threw barbs at each other, a review of the record shows that
both of them have left open the possibility of raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has said he might raise taxes to pay for his health care
plan. Gore, meanwhile, has said he might raise the cigarette tax.
In addition, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane, leaving some flexibility
in Gore's position, said Monday that the vice president ``has ruled
out tax increases barring a drastic change in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane did not elaborate, but given the recent history of
political rhetoric around tax increases, the definition ``drastic
change'' is open to wide interpretation. After all, former
President Bush famously issued his ``Read My Lips-No New Taxes''
promise, but he broke the vow in a move that played a role in his
defeat in the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, President Clinton and Vice President Gore in their 1992
campaign vowed to cut middle-class taxes but wound up increasing
tax rates in the 1993 deficit reduction deal. (Bradley also voted
for that tax hike). In addition, Gore initially backed tax
increases on certain energy products as a way to cut pollution, but
he said in a recent interview that he now is against such notions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Monday said Gore's history on taxes shows that he is
being disingenuous when accusing Bradley of backing a tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in falsely asserting I want to raise taxes, Al Gore is
once again turning an honest discussion about a future no one can
predict into a proposal I never made,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser Monday did not dispute that
Bradley had left open the possibility of a tax hike, but Hauser
said Gore has done the same thing. ``The only difference'' between
Bradley and Gore is that ``Bradley is being honest about it,''
Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hauser said, Gore has made dozens of proposals without
saying how they will be financed. The Bradley campaign Monday
issued a report called ``Promises Without Pricetags,'' which listed
63 Gore initiatives for which the vice president purportedly has
not provided financing information. The initiatives ranged from
Gore's education program to his plan to expand the number of drug
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for both Democrats is that they risk repeating the
fate of then-Vice President Walter Mondale, whose pledge to raise
taxes doomed his presidential bid in 1984. So, not wanting to issue
a Bush-like ``Read My Lips'' vow or to declare in the Mondale
fashion that they will raise taxes, Gore and Bradley Monday walked
carefully around the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fight erupted when Gore said in a Washington Post interview
that ``I'm talking about tax cuts, Senator Bradley is talking about
tax increases.'' Gore based his comment on Bradley's assertion last
week that he would decide in the future whether he needed to raise
taxes to help pay for his plan to provide health care insurance for
95 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Bradley comment in a separate Post interview that
prompted the controversy:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see where your revenues were and then make your
decision then as to whether, if you didn't have enough, what you
were going to do _ cutting spending or increasing taxes,'' Bradley
said. Asked whether that meant he would raise taxes, Bradley
responded: ``I'd make a judgment at that time. Not today.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bradley said it was unfair to interpret that comment as
a call for tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can predict the future of a trillion dollar economy,''
Bradley said. ``That why the Vice President also has not ruled out
the possible need for a tax increase. He and I have the same
position on future taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Bradley said he was determined to ignore
attacks from Gore, insisting he wouldn't be baited by what he
called the ``politics of the dartboard.'' Bradley said in a Boston
Globe interview that he knew his health care plan would be attacked
as soon as he released the details, likening it to throwing ``raw
meat into a cage of wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's resolve has waned as Gore's attacks have
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``When distortions become so clear cut, we are certainly going
to point them out, but we will do them in a straight forward way,''
Hauser said.

MIRANDA VS. ARIZONA: THE CASE THAT SPLIT THE COURT AND THE
COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.Y., Calif., Mo.)   (With SCOTUS-MIRANDA)  
(DW) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Miranda vs. Arizona, announced by the Supreme Court
on June 13, 1966, was the name for a decision that resolved four
separate criminal appeals, all raising the same question of what
the Fifth Amendment's right against compelled self-incrimination
meant in the context of an interrogation by the police of a suspect
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Because his was the lead case of the group, Ernesto Miranda
became by far the most famous of the four. Described in Chief
Justice Earl Warren's opinion as an ``indigent Mexican'' and a
``seriously disturbed individual with pronounced sexual
fantasies,'' Miranda had been convicted by an Arizona jury of
kidnapping and rape on the basis of a signed confession he gave to
the Phoenix police officers who had questioned him for two hours
without a lawyer present, in Interrogation Room No. 2 of the
detective bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in the other cases, from New York, California,
and Missouri, shared similar encounters with their police
interrogators. The California Supreme Court had overturned the
murder conviction of one, Roy Allen Stewart, because there was no
evidence that he had been advised of his right to counsel and his
right to remain silent. The justices affirmed the California
court's ruling and reversed the convictions of Miranda and the
other two defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The case split the court, 5-4, and split the country as well,
unleashing a furious debate over whether the Warren Court, which
had been significantly expanding the rights of criminal defendants,
had finally gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion, Warren said the case had raised
questions ``which go to the roots of our concepts of American
criminal jurisprudence: the restraints society must observe
consistent with the federal Constitution in prosecuting individuals
for crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He summarized the court's holding in this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless other fully effective means are devised to inform
accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a
continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are
required. Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that
he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make
may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the
presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed. The
defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the
waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. If,
however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process
that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking, there
can be no questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenters objected that the new rules would exact too
high a price on the criminal justice system by letting guilty
people, even those who had confessed their guilt, go free.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Byron R. White wrote in dissent, ``In some unknown
number of cases the court's rule will return a killer, a rapist, or
other criminal to the streets and to the environment which produced
him, to repeat his crime whenever it pleases him.''

TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT ORRIN HATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Betcha don't know that Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is a
very funny fellow. Not odd funny. Ha-ha funny.
</P>
<P>
   Who suspected? His image as a Republican presidential candidate
is so stodgy and stiff that he has the support of only 1 percent of
those surveyed in two recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a dinner Saturday of an organization here called the
Gridiron Club he was such a hilarious stand-up comic that the
journalists who make up the group informally crowned him the
funniest speaker in the club's recent history. Clearly, there's
more to the oh-so-serious chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee than first meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Joking can be dangerous on the campaign trail, which may have
something to do with why Hatch doesn't loosen up in front of
cameras. The 1996 GOP presidential nominee, Bob Dole, held the
Washington championship for biting wit for decades, but his humor
on the hustings came across as too sardonic and it cost him votes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes was recently burned by an attempt at humor that
wasn't even funny. He took a mocking swipe at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, saying, ``When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and
irresponsible, and unlike some, I grew away from that initial
position and clearly some others are still stuck in it.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was criticized as an attack dog, Forbes contended the
remark was a ``throw-away line'' merely meant to be humorous.
</P>
<P>
   But a little more campaign levity from Hatch might project a
warmer personality and boost his ratings. He has a better sense of
proportion than Dole and he's a heck of a lot funnier than Forbes.
And while he poked fun at his rivals, he didn't spare himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch didn't necessarily make political buddies of the Gridiron
Club cynics, who are primarily Washington newspaper chain bureau
chiefs, columnists and White House correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly got their attention. And attention is something
his limping candidacy really needs. He had such a good time
laughing at his own jokes that tears came to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that his good friend, Sen. Edward Kennedy, knows
New Hampshire in the winter well. (Kennedy really is a friend;
Hatch has been criticized by fellow conservatives for consorting
with an ideological enemy.) So he gave Hatch his campaign flask.
``I really appreciated it, because it's so hard to get my warm milk
in a motel at night,'' Hatch deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch proceeded to run down the names of the world leaders that
Bush fumbled in a pop quiz recently and ended with the spelling of
potato, which Vice President Dan Quayle once missed in a famous
classroom episode. Then the senator sailed on to other candidates.
Democratic challenger Bill Bradley, he noted, said he was too cool
to play that foreign-leaders-name game and would rather ``try to
prove, yet again, that sleep can be induced without medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Hatch continued, issued a press release saying he not
only knew all the answers but could spell the names of several
other world leaders, beginning with Great Britain's Tony Blair,
B-L-A-R-E.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a Mormon, said he thought such pop quizzes were unfair,
unless they asked ``general interest'' questions such as ``who
founded the Mormon Church?'' Or ``what kind of a name is Orrin?''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out, tongue in cheek, how much progress his own
presidential campaign was making. ``I've been clawing, scratching
my way to the top,'' he joshed. When he started he was 10th out of
10 candidates. Then he moved up to 9, 8, 7 and now 6. ``Some point
to the fact Lamar (Alexander), Dan (Quayle), Liddy (Dole) and Pat
(Buchanan) quit,'' he laughed, ``but I see a trend ... I have moved
up four places just standing still.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hatch came to President Clinton. He predicted that when
Clinton went to a mall to Christmas shop and Santa asked the big
question, Clinton would respond, ``It depends on what you mean by
`good.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he mused gleefully that as he sat on a stool looking at his
fellow GOP candidates during the New Hampshire debate last week he
couldn't help thinking, ``Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison _
how the heck did we come to this?''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch delightfully described himself as ``just a wacky kid from
Utah trying to get ahead in this crazy, mixed-up world.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Hatch as wacky is hilarious in itself. Maybe you had
to be there. But it does suggest that Hatch is a more complicated
creature than his public demeanor would indicate. A second look at
his candidacy might be worthwhile.

   SCOTUS-MIRANDA (Washington) _ The Miranda decision, a
33-year-old landmark of the Warren Court's criminal procedure
revolution, headed today for its most important test, as the
justices announced that they would decide whether Congress had
effectively overruled it with a law that was enacted for that
purpose in 1968 and was then ignored almost ever since. By Linda

   CHECHNYA-RUSSIA (Znamenskoye, Chechnya) _ The Russian military
drops thousands of leaflets over Grozny, warning residents to get
out by Saturday or risk death. ``You have lost!'' said a leaflet
addressed to Islamic militants. ``There will be no more
negotiations. Everybody who has not left the city will be
destroyed. The countdown has started.'' A less-threatening message,
addressed to civilians, warned them to leave the city ``by any
means possible.'' By Michael R. Gordon. (Scheduled to move by 8:30

expectantly and nervously for the Mars Polar Lander's mechanical
arm to start digging in the planet's cold ground, searching for
evidence of water ice. Instead, the engineer and others are worried
that the $165 million mission's failure could prompt public and

   HOMELESS-CRACKDOWN (San Francisco) _ In San Francisco, homeless
people haunt the city: hiding in doorways, pushing overloaded
shopping carts, standing on corners announcing their troubles on
cardboard signs (``Veteran, homeless and hungry''). But San
Francisco is far from alone. At the richest time in the nation's
history, housing that the poor can afford is at an all-time low,
fueling an increase in homelessness, according to the United States
Conference of Mayors. And with complaints about beggars and bag
ladies and mumbling, stumbling vagrants growing as well, cities are
fighting to move homeless people out of public spaces as never

   INTERFAITH-DECORATIONS (Undated) _ The December holidays have
long been a source of angst for many duel-faith couples, and the
tug is particularly acute for Christians and Jews whose seasonal
celebrations collide head on with Christmas and Hanukkah. Couples
have often decided to forgo one holiday or simply display the
paraphernalia of both side by side. But many families are now
synthesizing two customs. The commercial marketplace is starting to
respond to this pluralistic view of the holidays by producing what
was once taboo: decorations that merge the symbols of two
observances. By Leslie Kaufman. (The story has moved in ``f'' news

   LAHORE, Pakistan _ Rashida Bibi had returned once more, wailing
with grief, rocking side to side like the clapper of a bell. She
was pleading. Wouldn't they let her hold her dead son's clothes
again? Or touch his sandals?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there are bones somewhere,'' she cried out. ``There must
be something. I need to have something!''
</P>
<P>
   Others rushed to calm her, this slight woman sheathed in a black
shawl. But the soothing was useless. She shrieked and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before, Mrs. Bibi, like hundreds of others, crowded
into the courtyard of the Ravi Road police station, a yellow brick
building in the faded elegance of historic Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds of soiled clothes, rows of old shoes and piles of color
photos were on display there _ all taunting clues left by a man who
says he sexually molested and killed 100 young boys and then
dissolved their flesh and bones in vats of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have killed 100 children, all boys, and placed their bodies
in acid-filled drums,'' Javed Iqbal, 38, a wealthy, tormented man,
wrote in a boastful confession to the police. ``In terms of
expense, including the acid, it cost me 120 rupees ($2.40) to erase
each victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday morning, people, some of them from hundreds of
miles away, have come to look for evidence that their missing sons
are among the slain. So far, they have claimed 69 of the victims,
most of them boys between ages 12 and 15.
</P>

   Mrs. Bibi recognized the clothes of her 14-year-old son, Zaheer
Abbas. Monday, Qari Shabbir Ahmad, 32, found the photo of his
brother, a 10-year-old. He muttered the boy's name, ``Bashir,
Bashir!'' Then he howled, ``He has been missing four months, and
now he is dead, dead, dead!''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is in the midst of something monstrous: serial killings
that far more than the military coup of Oct. 12 have made this
religious society flinch. The name Javed Iqbal is gouging at the
nation's soul. He has forced the nation to think of raped boys and
lunacy and cities that teem with impoverished runaways who are
drawn to anyone with money.
</P>
<P>
   In his confessional and hauntingly bizarre letters sent last
week to the police and to an Urdu-language newspaper, Iqbal
remorselessly explained himself as a wronged citizen who was merely
answering abomination with abomination.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that he had been badly beaten up by two of his servants
in September 1998. His skull was cracked, his jaw fractured. He
went to the police, but they ignored him. The intolerable
frustration, he wrote, pushed him toward suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I prayed that if I left the world, I would leave it with
dozens of others. My prayer was accepted by God, and friends became
angels for me, and then a blood-curdling drama began. Now 100
mothers will die mourning the deaths of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   After killing 43 boys, Iqbal said, he bought a camera to improve
his methodical record keeping. He wanted the documentation of color
snapshots. So his final victims were photographed, their faces
eerily captured while they were alive and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He also provided a carefully annotated list of the dead, perhaps
because he intended to leave little else of them, except what was
flushed into the city sewers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he wrote: ``Victim 87 is Mohammad Imran, age 15,
son of Talib Hussain, district Bahawalnager, house located next to
animal hospital. Father makes wooden cots. Color whitish to fair.
Health very good. Face beautiful. Cheeks full. Killed on November
11, 1999. 7 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal made these homicidal unburdenings seem the prelude to his
own premeditated death. ``I am on my way to drown myself in the
River Ravi,'' he wrote. ``I have planned to tie a heavy rock to
myself so that I can die quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police have dragged the shallow waters of the Ravi and
found no body. ``I am quite sure he is alive,'' said Malik Muhammad
Iqbal, the regional head of police. ``He is a very clever man. He
is enjoying his fame. He is reading the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   The police say they have arrested three men who admit to being
employees of Iqbal and his accomplices in the killings, using
chains to help choke the victims. ``And we will catch the main
culprit too,'' said Inspector Ashiq Marth, who runs the Ravi Road
police station, where crowds continue to gather. ``If I catch him
personally, I will commit against him what the law would call a
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahore, perhaps Pakistan's greatest cultural center, is a city
enriched by centuries-old monuments built by Mughal rulers and
stately Victorian buildings left by the British. It is where
Kipling begins the novel ``Kim,'' the main character a young boy on
his own in a ``stealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes''
of the mysterious walled city.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal rented a $40-a-month, three-room apartment in a narrow
alley off busy Ravi Road, just a few miles from where Kipling's
story takes shape.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is still a magnet for young boys in search of
independence. Some become pickpockets, some prostitutes, some drug
addicts. Some merely hang out around the Data Ganj Baksh, a giant
shrine named for an 11th-century Sufi saint. The police say that
Iqbal and his confederates found much of their prey beneath the
shadow of the great minarets and enticed the youngsters with offers
of good food and lively music.
</P>
<P>
   The photos show most of the boys bare-chested, standing before a
wooden window of the decrepit apartment. When the police finally
entered _ invited as they were by Iqbal's revelatory mailing _ they
found handwritten placards on the walls to serve as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five sacks lying in the corner of this room contain the
clothes of 100 victims while the remaining three contain 85 pairs
of shoes belonging to them,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   Barrels of chemicals were stored in the V-shaped room farthest
from the front door. ``Today, dated Nov. 25, 1999, I have decided
to commit suicide,'' read another poster. ``Yesterday, I killed my
employee, Sajid, and incinerated his body in the container so that
he could be punished for theft and for disturbing me again and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, police have questioned dozens of people
who have been part of Iqbal's life, including two former wives, a
son and a daughter, and a variety of relatives who say they had
been estranged from him. ``His family was angry with him because of
his bad habits,'' said Marth, a huge man capable of an occasional
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers, piecing together scraps of Iqbal's past,
report that he was caught committing sodomy against young boys as
far back as 1985. Back then, neighbors humbled rather than
reporting him _ demanding that he go door-to-door admitting his
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal was later arrested several times for child molesting, but
he managed to avoid prison by failing to show up in court or by
buying his freedom. He inherited a share of his father's
scrap-metal business in the early 1990s, converting his portion
into about $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here say better police work might have prevented Iqbal's
mortal binge. Even after receiving the killer's well-substantiated
confession, the police were slow to investigate. Reporters preceded
policemen to the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the victims had been reported missing to the authorities.
Some parents who did make reports said they had been thrashed by
constables for being bothersome. ``The poor have no friends in a
police station,'' said one father.
</P>
<P>
   Grieving parents blamed themselves as well, however. In the
courtyard of the Ravi Road station, as people searched through the
heaps of clothes under a peepul tree, many said their sons had run
away because of harsh discipline or simple neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son ran off because I made him work,'' said Hassan Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Rashida Bibi, desperate to again hold anything that had belonged
to her 14-year-old son, rued her own lack of concern at his
disappearance. Once before, he had gone away for a month and then
come back. She thought this time would be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she now found herself begging the police to bring out
his belongings, which they had removed from the heap and stored.
``I want to smell the clothes of my son,'' the weeping mother said.
``What else is there to do? Nothing else of him is left.''

 &HT;    Coke's CEO shocks business world with retirement announcement
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a surprise announcement Monday that sent shock
waves from Atlanta's North Avenue to New York's Wall Street,
Coca-Cola Co. said M. Douglas Ivester will retire as chairman and
chief executive officer in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who oversaw a tumultuous two years at the helm of the
world's largest soft-drink company, will be replaced by Douglas
Daft, a 30-year company veteran who oversaw operations in the
Middle East, Far East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, 56, immediately became president and chief operating
officer _ a position that has been vacant since October 1997, when
Ivester left that No. 2 job to head the company following the death
of Roberto C. Goizueta.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some industry analysts and company observers believe
Ivester is retiring after resisting pressure from the board of
directors to appoint a No. 2 executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, declined to comment on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``After much soul-searching, I have come to believe our company
will now be best served by fresh leadership that will bring its own
energy to bear _ and I believe Doug Daft is the person to provide
that leadership,'' Ivester, 52, said in a message to all company
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The development took Wall Street by complete surprise, sending
the stock tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a startling development,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``I think it's a loss. Doug
Ivester is the most experienced executive Coca-Cola has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more of a surprise than the 49ers losing eight games
in a row,'' added Manny Goldman, global beverage analyst for
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester made his decision last week and informed a few board
members of it at the end of the week, said company spokesman Robert
Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   The board then held a special meeting Sunday to ``reluctantly''
accept Ivester's decision and to name Daft president. Some board
members attended the hastily-called meeting, while others
participated by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The board also indicated it intends to elect Daft, who Ivester
recommended, as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe board recently has been turning up the
heat on Ivester to appoint a No. 2 executive to help him run the
company in the wake of several well-publicized problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest recall in the company's 113-year history, which
occurred in Belgium in June after Coca-Cola products were blamed
for sickening nearly 250 consumers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trouble consummating strategic purchases, especially in
Europe, where government regulators have had the company under an
antitrust microscope.
</P>
<P>
   _ A depressed stock price caused by disappointing earnings,
which were in large part the result of faltering economies in parts
of Asia, Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ A racial discrimination suit filed by four employees who want
to expand it into a class-action case. Coca-Cola denies the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Ivester described the past 15 months as
the worst period for the company in the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ivester was bullish about the future in a recent
interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have been through is a temporary blip in the long-term
scheme,'' Ivester said. But, he quickly added, ``The future is as
bright as the past,'' referring to Coke's glory days when many of
the company's investors earned huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company recently announced a reorganization
that reduced the number of executives reporting to Ivester to six,
from 16.
</P>
<P>
   While the board agreed with that decision, announced on Oct. 29,
observers said some board members still wanted him to take the next
step and appoint a president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivester wanted to give the recent reorganization _ the first
major one in his tenure as chief _ a chance to work. Observers said
Ivester resigned after tension developed between him and the board.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Ivester has received a good bit of
criticism in some industry circles for not appointing a No. 2
person. The belief among those critics is that some of the
company's problems could have been better contained had Ivester not
been flying solo.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also may have grown weary of constantly being a
lightning rod for criticism in the media _ especially when compared
with Goizueta, who had been held in such high esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Some people familiar with the company said Ivester was in a
``no-win situation,'' comparing him to a football coach following
in the footsteps of Paul ``Bear'' Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   After two grueling years, the company's problems may have
combined with the unrelenting criticism to lead him to the decision
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Ivester is a human being,'' said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest. ``He must have felt under a lot of
pressure. ... He decided it was time to pass the torch.''
</P>
<P>
   What's hard to understand is the timing of the torch's passing.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, the board and industry analysts all have been expecting
a turnaround during the next few quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't he enjoy the fruits?'' Conway asked rhetorically.
``It must have been just a personal decision to step aside.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said Ivester's decision to retire was his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not forced out,'' said Baskin, the company spokesman.
``He wanted the company to focus on the positive, not on the
challenges of the recent past or on him, but on the opportunities
that lie ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We accepted his resignation reluctantly,'' said James B.
Williams, a Coca-Cola director and retired SunTrust CEO. ``He
resigned for personal reasons. I've always supported Doug.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, known for his financial acumen, will be replaced by
Daft, whose background is in company operations.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, who joined the company in 1969, just received his second
major promotion in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   In the October reorganization, he was given responsibility for
overseeing operations in the Middle East, Far East and Africa, as
well as the company's recently created Schweppes beverages
division. Before that he was responsible for the Middle and Far
East. He also has held important company positions overseeing
operations in Japan, China, Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daft has spent decades building the company's business,
primarily in Asia,'' Sicher said. ``He is experienced in building
operations in international markets and is well regarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, meanwhile, is credited with a number of accomplishments
during his 20-year tenure at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the key architects of the company's ``anchor
bottler'' system, which has resulted in the consolidation and
improved long-term financial performance of the company and its
bottlers on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a major driver of the company's lucrative share
repurchase program over the years, which benefited stockholders,''
said Goldman, the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a tremendous contribution over the years,''
Goldman said. ``But things don't always work out as planned in life
or in business.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memo to employees, Ivester said he will maintain a North
Avenue office until May 2001 and will remain a consultant to the
company ``for a number of years. I will do everything I can to
ensure that the transition is a flawless one.''

DECREASE IN PUBLIC SPENDING HURTS JAPAN'S RECOVERY, AGENCY

<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's tentative recovery from its worst recession
since World War II suffered a setback last quarter as economic
growth fell at an unexpectedly steep rate, hurt by depleted
spending on public works projects, the nation's Economic Planning
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that the gross domestic product fell 1 percent
in the July through September period. Although economists said the
data did not suggest that Japan might slip back into recession
after two quarters of expansion, it still illustrated the country's
dependence on public-spending projects to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   The data also re-established the two-steps-forward,
one-step-back pattern that has characterized Japan's economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   All measures of domestic demand _ which account for more than
half of the country's economic growth and which the government has
been trying so hard to stimulate _ turned negative in the quarter.
Consumer spending slipped three-tenths of 1 percent, corporate
capital expenditures fell 2.1 percent and housing investment,
previously strengthened by tax incentives, fell 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest factor in the economy's retreat was a plunge
in public spending, which fell 8.5 percent as the government
exhausted its last supplemental budget.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroyuki Inoue, senior economist at the Japan Center for
Economic Research, said, ``Although we have seen some recovery and
expect a moderate recovery going forward, we cannot forget the fact
that it was pushed ahead by special economic policies such as
enormous public spending, historically low interest rates and
massive credit guarantees for small and mid-sized businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Exports were the only major area of growth, rising 4.7 percent,
a trend that may not last because of the increased strength of the
yen, which has made Japanese products more expensive overseas. The
yen has been rising to nearly four-year highs against the dollar,
settling in New York Monday at 103.03 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saving grace in the quarter was a substantial rise in the
trade surplus,'' said Richard Katz, senior editor of The Oriental
Economist, a newsletter. ``Without that rise, GDP would have fallen
1.3 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Parliament is expected to approve another supplemental
budget this month, which could inject $61 billion into the economy,
but the effects of that spending will not be noticeable until some
time next spring or early summer. ost economists expect the economy
to flounder until then, though some think the government's forecast
of six-tenths of 1 percent growth for this year to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had taken great pains to dampen expectations. The
Japanese central bank, in particular, has been reluctant to
describe the growth of the first two quarters of 1999 as a
recovery. Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency,
warned economists and investors that a prediction of 1.4 percent
Japanese growth made last month by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, a group of affluent industrial
nations, was overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumption is down and will probably stay depressed,'' said
Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in Tokyo. ``There's weakness in the public works component, and
exports are likely to become flat-to-negative because of the
stronger yen. This is not the environment for strong GDP growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the stock market here seemed to shrug off the bad
news, with the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues continuing to
rise, up three-quarters of a percent to 18,507.20. Other indexes
were up more sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released Monday were in some ways difficult to
interpret because of revisions to the previous two quarters'
statistics. The Economic Planning Agency increased its figures for
economic growth in the April-June quarter to 1 percent from
one-tenth of a percent, which aroused some skepticism among
economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the upward revision in the second quarter looks
questionable to me,'' Feldman said. He noted that the figures for
public investment had sharply reversed, going from a 4 percent drop
in the initial announcement to a 2.8 percent gain in the revised
data, an unusually sharp adjustment. Other economists noted that
capital expenditures for the fiscal year from April 1, 1998 through
March 31, 1999 had been revised upward by 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are bound to cause confusion because of all the
revisions we've had,'' said Brian Rose of Warburg Dillon Read here.
``As an economist, one of the basic things you'd like to know is
the size of capital expenditures, and that's just changed, which
means forecasts and models have to change, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose noted that the latest quarterly data still showed that the
economy grew by nine-tenths of a percent compared with the quarter
a year earlier. ``The economy won't be great,'' he said, ``but the
supplemental budget will kick in early next fiscal year and that
should keep the economy going next year. But if you were relying on
the economy to go into a strong recovery, you should be worried.''

RUSSIANS WARN BESIEGED RESIDENTS OF GROZNY TO FLEE CITY

<P>
   ZNAMENSKOYE, Chechnya _ The Russian military dropped thousands
of leaflets over Grozny on Monday, warning residents of the
besieged city to get out by Saturday or risk death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have lost!'' said a leaflet addressed to Islamic
militants. ``There will be no more negotiations. Everybody who has
not left the city will be destroyed. The countdown has started.''
</P>
<P>
   A less-threatening message, addressed to civilians, warned them
to leave the city ``by any means possible'' for a tent camp set up
here in Znamenskoye. ``After the completion of the
counter-terrorism operation you will be able to return to your
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum underscored the resolve of Russian generals to
take the Chechen capital, either by forcing its complete evacuation
or by shelling it into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how many civilians remain in the city, battered and
desolated by Russia's first campaign in 1994-1996 and again in
recent weeks, vary considerably. Nikolai Koshman, a deputy prime
minister of Russia who has been put in charge of Chechnya, said in
an interview that some 45,000 to 50,000 civilians still reside
there. Russian military officials say that 5,000 to 7,000 rebel
fighters have also taken refuge in Grozny and have mined and
fortified the city.
</P>
<P>
   The separate warnings for the rebels and for the civilians were
dropped from planes, and signed by ``The Command of the Combined
Group of Russian Forces.'' Despite the difference in tone, both
warned those in the city that this was their last chance to get out
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Those who failed to leave by Saturday would be considered
``terrorists and bandits'' and would be ``destroyed by artillery
and aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   Only by leaving, civilians were told, ``will you be able to
avoid death and save your city. Remember, preservation of life and
the provision of security for the civilian population is the main
task of the Russian forces.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage disgruntled rebels to lay down their arms and
leave, Russian planes also dropped safe-conduct passes, telling
rebels they would receive medical assistance and be treated fairly
if they turned themselves in to Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The passes instruct rebels to remove the cartridge from their
automatic weapons, hang the weapons barrel-down over their left
shoulders and wave a piece of white cloth or the flimsy white
leaflet.
</P>
<P>
   The militants were told to leave Grozny through a specially
designated ``safety corridor'' and head north toward a checkpoint
in the town of Pervomayskoye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further resistance is senseless,'' the leaflets declared.
``The Command of the Combined Group of Russian Forces is giving you
a last chance.'' Those who came out would be offered shelter, food,
medical assistance ``and most important, life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a conflict that has seen more than its share of
indiscriminate attacks, the fate of the civilians in Grozny has
become one of the most compelling dramas of the war. While
thousands have already fled, many have been too afraid to try to
escape, taking refuge instead in basements and cellars to escape
the daily pounding.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many will choose to leave Grozny for the tent
city that the Russian military is rushing to complete for them in
this northern Chechen town.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny has been a thorn in the side of the Russian military for
most of this decade. Before the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, the
defense minister at the time, Pavel Grachev, boasted he would take
the city with a small force of paratroopers. Instead, it became the
scene of a humiliating and costly defeat for Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the current war, the Russians have approached the city
cautiously. Instead of sending troops into the center of the city,
they have approached it from the north, east and west to surround
it.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan appears to be to blockade Grozny and bombard it, and
avoid costly house-to-house fighting. The ultimatum on Monday
appeared intended to scare as much of the population into leaving
as possible, so that Grozny could be turned into a veritable
free-fire zone.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the destruction to the city itself does not appear to
concern the Russians. The Russian government has already decided to
administer Chechnya from Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city,
at least for now. Koshman said that Russia would not rush to pour
money into the reconstruction of Grozny after the war, but would
favor the restoration of the surrounding provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian officers would be happy to leave Grozny as a
smoking ruin and a grizzly testament to what happens to rebels who
tangle with the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been severely criticized by Western governments for
unnecessarily endangering civilians, and the warning on Monday
seemed intended to address those concerns as well as to protect
Russia's own citizens.

</P>
<P>
   Still, they raised many questions. Russian officials have
repeatedly charged that the rebels were preventing civilians from
leaving, raising the question of whether residents were capable of
using the newly established humanitarian corridor if they wanted
to. Some civilians are presumably too sick, weakened or injured to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Vladimir Bulgakov, the commander of the Northern
Forces, said that the rebels were confiscating documents from
civilians in Grozny and telling them that they will not be accepted
by the Russian forces without them.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear whether Russia is really prepared to handle
an exodus of civilians. The tent city in Znamenskoye appeared
relatively comfortable by the standards of refugee camps. It was
erected on a former automotive depot and had gas-heated tents, a
dining hall, showers and even a mosque, which was set up in a tent
that faced Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   But as the winter chill spread through the countryside and the
fields covered with frost, the tent city was not finished. Workers
said they had been ordered to complete construction by Friday. Even
when it is completed _ along with another tent city under
construction here _ they will accommodate only 4,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials acknowledge that the potential flood of
refugees will far outstrip the capacity of the camps here, but they
said two additional camps are planned at other locations in
northern Chechnya and that many refugees may find a place to stay
with their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many Chechen leaders still reside in Grozny.
The Russians have said that Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord,
has fled the republic, though this may simply be disinformation.
Russian television reported on Monday night that Aslan Maskhadov,
the president of the self-styled Chechen republic, may have escaped
to Shali.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels in Grozny could try to break out of the Russian
encirclement. And even if the Russians succeed in taking Grozny,
that would not be the end of their fight. Several thousand rebels
have taken up positions in the towns of Urus-Martan and Shali to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who remain, the message was blunt: ``Everybody who
has not left the city will be destroyed.''

COMMENTARY: GROUNDED FOR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we are, just 24 shopping days until the turn of the
millennium, and what I want to know is, what happened to the flying
cars?
</P>
<P>
   We're about to become Americans of the 21st century. People have
been predicting what we'd be like for more than 100 years, and our
accouterments don't entirely live up to expectations. No airborne
automobiles. No spaceliners to extraterrestrial vacation spots _ we
can't even deliver that mechanical thing to Mars in working order.
No housecleaning robots. No moving sidewalks, except those deeply
unsatisfactory ones in airports.
</P>
<P>
   Our failure to produce flying cars seems like a particular
betrayal, since it was so central to our image. A century ago, a
French novelty company produced a series of trading cards depicting
life in the year 2000. People had hardly figured out how to make
cars move on the ground at that point, but the cards showed
citizens of the future _ us _ soaring into air cafes for a cup of
coffee or setting down on floating stores that bobbed in the
English Channel. Movies about the 21st century almost always
featured flying cars. There was a Hollywood musical from 1930
called ``Just Imagine'' that imagined them all over New York City
by 1980.
</P>
<P>
   I actually did look into the flying car failure a while back,
and an expert in the internal design department at Ford explained
very gently that although building a flying car was certainly
conceivable, it would cost $10 million and sound like a Boeing 747.
And actually, it's just as well. If they were easy to produce, we'd
be walking around wearing helmets to protect us from the detritus
of flying car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the popular prognosticators of the past never
got us right is because they tended to envision our lives as filled
with the same things they already had, only better. They didn't
conceive of computers or faxes; they thought about pneumatic tubes
going really, really fast. They predicted something approaching
radio _ on those 100-year-old trading cards, we're pictured
listening to a news broadcast on what looks like a Victrola
attached to a small electric power plant. But they never figured
out television, possibly because they couldn't stretch their minds
around what having a perpetual entertainment machine in every
living room would do to family life.
</P>
<P>
   John Elfreth Watkins, who wrote a really first-rate set of
predictions for Ladies' Home Journal at the turn of the last
century, managed to anticipate air-conditioning, international
long-distance telephone service, school lunch programs, the rise of
the suburbs, color photography and frozen dinners. But he was,
unfortunately for us, overoptimistic in matters such as the
extermination of all roaches, houseflies and mosquitoes, and
physical fitness. ``A man or woman unable to walk ten miles at a
stretch will be regarded as a weakling,'' he decreed. Neither he
nor anyone else seemed to consider the possibility that the newer,
faster, transportation vehicles of the future would get in each
other's way. ``The trip from suburban home to office will require a
few minutes only,'' Watkins predicted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nicest things about our failure to acquire the
21st-century life style our great-grandparents expected is the
degree to which we've stubbornly clung to the impractical. The
forecasters of the past always presumed that once automobile travel
became universal, horses would become extinct. Nobody realized that
we'd keep them around simply because we like them. In 1950, Popular
Mechanics magazine announced that in another half-century people
would be living in plastic houses with waterproof furniture. ``The
housewife of 2000 can do her daily cleaning with the garden hose,''
the magazine predicted, and would wash her meltable plastic dishes
down the drain after every meal. The guys at Popular Mechanics,
enamored of utility, presumed we'd all want drip-dry living rooms
as soon as they were available. They never imagined that after
acquiring the microwave, houseproud men and women would embrace
Martha Stewart and welcome in the new century by cooking holiday
puddings that would have been too time-consuming for Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   So we march into the millennium, gravity-bound, traffic-clogged
and roach-infested as ever, less efficient, but maybe more human,
than anybody anticipated.

REPORT TIES 54,000 SWISS ACCOUNTS TO NAZIS' VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A three-year audit of Swiss banks found records of
54,000 accounts that were probably linked to victims of Nazi
persecution, a draft report released on Monday said. The report
described in detail how some of the banks had issued ``deliberately
misleading statements'' for decades to Jews who had come looking
for their family's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago the Swiss Bankers Association had insisted
that there were fewer than 800 such accounts on the books and that
they had few assets.
</P>
<P>
   While highly critical of the actions of individual banks, the
commission, headed by the former Federal Reserve Board chairman
Paul Volcker, concluded that there was ``no evidence of systematic
destruction of records of victim accounts'' and no ``organized
discrimination'' against them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Volcker's commission concluded that the banks showed
``a general lack of diligence _ even active resistance _ in
response to earlier private and official enquiries'' into the
accounts, according to a draft of its report.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the true value of the accounts proved virtually
impossible; much of the surviving information was fragmentary. Most
of the accounts had been closed by unknown parties over the years
and drained by banking fees and, in a few cases, by deliberate
profit-skimming by the banks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Volcker said, to the enormous relief of the embattled Swiss
bankers, that he saw no reason to revise the $1.25 billion
settlement that Switzerland's two largest banks concluded last year
with the surviving Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress, one of the many Jewish groups
involved in that settlement, said they agreed with Volcker's
assessment that the settlement should stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appropriate for the number of living claimants and
heirs,'' said Elan Steinberg, a top official of the World Jewish
Congress. ``The fact is that the owners of these accounts are
mostly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only asking the banks for one thing today,'' Steinberg
said. ``The words `We're sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   The banks said they felt vindicated by Volcker's findings. ``The
dramatic and sweeping accusations leveled against Swiss banks for
years have proved to be unfounded,'' said Georg Krayer, president
of the Swiss Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The report ends one of the most contentious issues in modern
Swiss history, and a conflict that quickly turned into a major
source of tension between the United States, which pressed the
inquiry, and Swiss authorities, who felt improperly blamed for
activities that took place under the duress of wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Volcker concluded that most major banks in Switzerland
cooperated with his team of hundreds of auditors, spending hundreds
of millions of dollars to search out long-buried records. But he
reported that some banks resisted a ``foreign investigation'' and
he named one, Banque Cantonale de Geneve, that the report said
``has not allowed the auditors to carry out any of their mandated
functions'' and ``posed a substantial impediment'' to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the most startling elements of Volcker's final report are
anecdotes about the lengths a number of banks went to in order to
hide those assets for decades after Germany's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Several banks endorsed procedures to mislead Jews, but not
non-Jews, who came in search of old accounts. But apparently
concerned about potential liability, the report did not name the
banks, a step that appeared far short of the full disclosure that
was promised when the audit began.
</P>
<P>
   The report quoted a 1969 internal memorandum from the legal
department of one bank that said ``in the case of inquiries about
Jewish clients whose assets had to be transferred'' to Germany in
the 1930s, ``we have always responded that we could not supply the
requested information as we are only obliged to retain ledgers and
correspondence for a period of 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the report adds, another internal memorandum ``confirms
that the unequal treatment of Jewish claimants and their heirs was
a direct result of the bank's concern that it may ultimately be
held liable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report describes another case of an account opened in 1930
by a Russian Jew that was worth over 1 million Swiss francs by
1962. But a memorandum found in the bank's record stated that the
bank ``could `cream off' the returns on the investment and recreate
the account documentation as if no profits had been earned.'' Only
recently, the report concluded, the bank settled with the account
holder's heirs.
</P>
<P>
   While evidence of similar instances was scarce, the report
concluded, the attitude of Swiss banks throughout the past few
decades has been one of resistance _ resistance to both individual
and government calls for a full accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handling of these funds was too often grossly insensitive
to the special conditions of the Holocaust and sometimes misleading
in intent and unfair in result,'' said the final report.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was appointed by both the Swiss banks and
international Jewish organizations, and was aided by the passage of
a law that lifted some aspects of Swiss bank secrecy to allow
auditors to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the panel was divided about how to assess both
the number of accounts and their value. Some members of the panel
drawn from the Jewish organizations, extrapolating from the data
the auditors found, believed the true value of the accounts could
range up to $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But others thought the number was a quarter of that figure, in
part because it was impossible to know who had removed cash from
the accounts during and after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, the publication of the report
assists its recent effort to repair the badly strained relations
with Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take years to straighten out the damage and get some
trust back,'' one senior administration official said. ``But the
first step was getting the banks to acknowledge how long they had
misled so many.''

AT&AMP;T PLANS WIRELESS TELEPHONE AND INTERNET SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a series of far-reaching announcements Monday spanning the
realms of finance, management and regulation, AT&AMP;T fleshed out its
plans for going after the regional Bell companies' markets across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the long-distance communications company announced
a change in its financial structure, a broad new wireless
communications initiative, sweeping changes in its top executive
ranks and a deal to open its cable television systems to outside
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled at a meeting with hundreds of analysts in New York
City, the panoply of initiatives was meant to convince Wall Street
and regulators in Washington that AT&AMP;T is serious about providing
better returns to investors and new choices for consumers in local
phone service and high-speed Internet access. More important, the
announcements are meant to convey that the company has the
wherewithal to make those things happen.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, AT&AMP;T announced plans to issue a tracking stock for
its fast-growing wireless unit that would trade separately from
AT&AMP;T's common stock, which is among the most widely held in the
nation. AT&AMP;T also said that it would deploy a new ``fixed
wireless'' technology to provide local phone service and
lightning-quick Internet access to millions of United States homes.
</P>
<P>
   However, wireless will not provide AT&AMP;T's main foray into the
local communications business, which the company had to give up
when it split under court supervision in 1984. AT&AMP;T has invested
more than $100 billion to become the nation's No. 1 cable
television provider, planning to use cable to deliver high-speed
Internet access and local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's cable strategy, however, has run into a wall of criticism
because in acquiring Tele-Communications Inc., it inherited a
contract giving the Excite(at)Home cable modem venture exclusive
rights to provide high-speed Internet service until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet providers, led by America Online Inc., say that
the arrangement is unfair and that AT&AMP;T should open its cable
systems to other Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has continued to stand by its exclusive deal with
Excite(AT)Home, of which it is the largest shareholder but has
tried hard to convince regulators and the Internet industry that it
will happily strike deals with other ISPs after 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, AT&AMP;T Monday announced a broad, if somewhat vague,
agreement with Mindspring, a big Internet provider, and with the
chairman of a Federal Communications Commission advisory group
regarding the principles that AT&AMP;T will embrace as it deals with
Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Those principles include an agreement by AT&AMP;T to provide its
customers with a choice of Internet providers; to allow users to
customize their ``start page'' on the Web, often considered
valuable advertising territory; and to allow users unfettered
access to all Web content without additional charges from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, outlined in a public letter to William E.
Kennard, chairman of the FCC, is clearly meant to forestall any
regulatory attempts to force AT&AMP;T to open its cable systems.
Municipalities including Portland, Ore., which must approve the
transfer of cable licenses from TCI to AT&AMP;T, are attempting to pry
open AT&AMP;T's systems, though Kennard has said the federal
government, not states or cities, has jurisdiction over any such
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the strategic and financial moves were
announcements of sweeping management changes to implement them.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, John D. Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's president, was named
chairman of the newly independent wireless unit. Daniel E. Somers,
the chief financial officer, was named chairman of the cable unit,
succeeding Leo Hindery, who left the company in October (and Monday
was named to head a division of Global Crossing). Richard R.
Roscitt, head of the AT&AMP;T unit that runs the networks of big
business customers, was named chief of AT&AMP;T's overall
business-services division.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to AT&AMP;T said the company was still negotiating
with Charles H. Noski, the No. 2 executive at General Motors'
Hughes Electronics operation, to succeed Somers as AT&AMP;T's chief
financial officer. The executives said a deal with Noski could be
announced soon. Kathleen Earley, who previously ran the company's
Internet operation, was named to a new post overseeing all AT&AMP;T's
disparate data communications offerings for business customers.

 &HT;    Daft named Ivester's successor
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola's next chief executive is a former
schoolteacher who washes his own cars. And he's got a listed number
in the phone book, if you need to give him a call.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and neighbors say Douglas N. Daft is a friendly,
down-to-earth guy who knows how to make people feel comfortable.
And that, analysts say, should help him as he faces foreign
government officials who have been increasingly hostile to the idea
of allowing a powerful American company overwhelm more overseas
beverage markets.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Daft may have something else going for him
internationally: He's not an American.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Australia. And while he has lived in Atlanta since
1991, he is not a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a first for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's chief
executive ranks. Retiring Chairman and Chief Executive Officer M.
Douglas Ivester is from New Holland, Ga. His predecessor, Roberto
C. Goizueta, was born in Cuba but became a naturalized U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tactful move,'' says Schroder &AMP; Co. analyst
Caroline Levy. ''It's possible that was part of the decision-making
process'' in the selection of Daft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I clearly think that having a very American leader hasn't seem
to have been as successful,'' Levy says.
</P>
<P>
   Daft ``is more international in flavor'' than Ivester, and in
that way more like Goizueta, she says. ``He's got the statesmanship
that you need to run a company that operates in 200 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been in the thick of some of Coca-Cola's worst
troubles as Asian economies have struggled over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Daft has headed Coca-Cola's Middle and Far East
Group, a position that made him responsible for operations from
Morocco in North Africa to India, China, Japan, Australia and
everything in-between. In a reorganization in October, Daft's turf
expanded to include the rest of Africa. The combined area accounts
for nearly one out of every four drinks Coca-Cola sells.
</P>
<P>
   Daft was also given responsibility for the Schweppes Beverage
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well-liked both inside the company and by the bottlers,''
says John Sicher, who is editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.
``He is a very hands-on executive in terms of really knowing the
business at the marketplace level.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Asian operations cover vast and immensely diverse
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been one of Coca-Cola's biggest and most profitable
markets. But consumer preferences there change quickly, and Daft
has proven nimble enough to keep ahead, says Merrill Lynch global
beverage analyst Manny Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Daft's responsibilities included China, where
Coca-Cola was one of the first and most successful American
companies to expand.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the company is in the midst of a consolidation of
bottlers and layoffs of employees.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Middle East, Daft has tried to build up brands in
countries where the company had had little or no operations until
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The job demands almost constant travel, which is why neighbors
say they only rarely see Daft at his home near the Atlanta History
Center and only a short walk from Atlanta's nightlife. He lives in
a small, walled complex of upscale townhouses and detached homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful guy,'' says neighbor Homer Deakins. ``His
biggest problem is he doesn't play enough golf. He's never
around.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is, Deakins says, Daft is in the neighborhood courtyard
with a Mercedes sports utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him out in his yard, washing his cars. That's not
something you would expect somebody of his stature to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft started out small.
</P>
<P>
   He got his bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of
New England near Sydney and a post-graduate degree in business
administration at the University of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a school science teacher for a year or two. Then he
joined Coca-Cola as a planning officer, watching market trends for
the company in Sydney. It was the beginning of what has been a
30-year career steadily moving up Coca-Cola's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't working or washing cars, Daft likes to fly fish
and snow ski. He has a wife, Delphine, and two grown children.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a brightly decorated classroom, four tiny children
sat around a low table the other day decorating their newly made
string phones by pasting colorful strips of paper onto cardboard
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold the roll and paste it yourself,'' said one of the four
teachers at the Cecillia Pre-School Center, cheerily encouraging a
3-year-old girl. ``Show it to the others. Look, it is becoming a
telephone!''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, there is little to distinguish the scene here
from an ordinary nursery school in other countries. Certainly,
there are few hints of the ``exam hell'' that Japanese say has
become a plague on childhood in their country.
</P>
<P>
   But just as surely as the students come to this special
preparatory school once a week from their ordinary nursery schools
for an intensive burst of one-on-one learning with teachers, they
are taking their first step into the country's performance-obsessed
national school examination system.
</P>
<P>
   Concern has mounted gradually for years in Japan over the
downward creeping spread of school entrance exams to ever lower age
groups, driving mothers to enroll their children in expensive cram
schools even before they have learned to eat with chopsticks. It is
said nowadays that even pregnant women here often count aloud
believing that it will help prepare their children for the
competition that awaits them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took a murder in Tokyo last week to shock many people
here into finally concluding that things had gone too far. Haruna
Wakayama, a 2-year-old girl who had just passed an entrance exam,
was killed by the mother of a classmate who had failed. The jealous
mother has told police that she strangled Haruna in a playground
bathroom, stuffing her body into a bag and boarding a train to take
it to her parents' home 120 miles outside of Tokyo for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's newspapers have been filled ever since with accounts of
the country's degeneration into a hostile society, driven by
outward measures of success rather than human relationships and
feelings. The killing has inspired scores of editorials about the
``examination wars'' that mark the progression from kindergarten to
12th grade of every Japanese child.
</P>
<P>
   And much more than in the past, there have been searching
discussions about the emptiness of mothers' lives and the
inequalities between the sexes here that have pushed many mothers
to desperately project so many of their aspirations upon their
young children. Fathers here have little to do with child rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, relationships were richer, not only with
relatives but within neighborhoods,'' said Gentaro Kawakami, a
professor of sociology at Shumei University and longtime education
critic. ``There were more varied ways of realizing one's potential.
But now the society has become so narrowly focused that the only
way we can measure ourselves is through IQ tests and school scores.
Most mothers even introduce themselves announcing the names of
their husband's company and the school their children attend.''
</P>
<P>
   But if descriptions of symptoms like these have been fairly
uniform, the prescriptions for change have been sorely lacking.
</P>
<P>
   For most parents of children this age, paying hundreds of
dollars a month for classes like these is intended to secure
admission for their child into one of Japan's prestigious and
highly competitive kindergartens affiliated with national
universities. Alternatively, others will aim for a group of
top-drawer private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance in either opens the way to a top elementary school and
is coveted by parents for giving their child some measure of
reprieve from the long hours of costly evening cram school that
most ordinary public school students endure from elementary school
through high school. Just as important is the almost lifelong leg
up in the ceaseless contest, repeated each generation, for success
and power through education that comes from attendance of a top
school.
</P>
<P>
   But many Japanese themselves say the force that drives this
system comes first and foremost from the country's so-called kyoiku
mamas, or education-obsessed mothers, for whom the successes of a
child starting at the earliest school ages are often the most
important source of self-esteem and prestige in their lives.
Japan's education system is unforgiving for those who slip up
early, and for these mothers, the celebration of their child's
acceptance into the ``right'' elementary school is analogous to
what an American parent might feel upon learning that her child had
just aced the College Boards or been accepted into an Ivy League
college.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan's exam-intensive approach to education is a legacy of the
Meiji period of the last century, when the country was a highly
stratified society and the national obsession was catching up to
the West. Imperial edicts depicted sacrificing heavily for
education as far more than parents' obligation to their children,
but each family's duty to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   By any economic measure, Japan caught up with the West nearly a
generation ago. Moreover, by American standards, this society has
since become highly egalitarian, both in terms of income
distribution and ideology. Still, amid the unending acceleration of
educational competition members of Japan's broad, affluent middle
class are desperately seeking whatever small advantage they can get
for their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cecillia Pre-School Center, in a well-to-do Tokyo ward
not far from the murdered child's school, the prepping of 2- and
3-year-olds for kindergarten entrance exams mostly takes the form
of pleasant, but unremitting interaction with teachers. Children
are led in song, encouraged to make simple toys, play games
together and respond to questions. The mothers who send their
children here are united in saying that the emphasis on testing and
competition for places in kindergarten may have gone too far, even
as they surrender to the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much competition should be avoided, but it is difficult to
remove competition from the system,'' said Tomoko Shimazu, a
smartly-dressed 29-year-old mother whose pigtailed 3-year-old
daughter had just taken her first class. ``Perhaps we need to
change, but it is difficult to say how.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mother whose child was beginning the classes that day
spoke up to deny that the competition meant much to her at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I would like my child to be admitted to a good school,
but I also want my child to have experiences playing with other
children his age,'' she said. ``Right now, competition seems to be
spreading into everything, but in 10 or 15 years, perhaps people
will realize that our exam system is not all that is cracked up to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the parents had finished collecting their children and
gone, however, Yoshiko Otsuka, the school director, offered another
rationale _ one that eerily echoed the Meiji ideologues who so
successfully associated education with the fate of the nation, then
under Imperial rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in early education for 30 years, and I've
realized that parents want the best education for their children,''
she said. ``What's wrong with competition? This doesn't mean
cramming, but giving the children a certain discipline that they
don't get at home, molding them in the ways that our consensual
society demands. For this purpose, nursery school alone, letting
children simply sleep and eat is just too free. What we are really
giving them is a sense of direction.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: BIG BROTHER POUNCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a book on a long-running civil conflict, the author
briefly describes how his government uses surveillance systems to
trace suspected enemies of the state. He is arrested, charged with
a serious crime, his house ransacked and papers seized.
</P>
<P>
   Did this happen in China, or perhaps Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore?
No, it happened in Tony Blair's Britain. It is an astonishing
story, and it discloses a dirty little secret: The Blair government
has authoritarian instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The author is Tony Geraghty, a respected journalist who was the
star defense correspondent of The Sunday Times of London in its
glory days and has since written half a dozen books. This one is
``The Irish War,'' about the centuries of conflict in and about
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago this month, six Ministry of Defense police officers
appeared at Geraghty's home on the Welsh border, searched it,
seized a mass of his papers and arrested him. He is charged with
violating the Official Secrets Act by publishing material given him
without authority by an official. The maximum penalty is two years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   What the Blair government apparently objects to is five or six
pages in a long, serious book. Those pages say that the British
government has computer systems that work with cameras and
microphones to keep track of suspected IRA terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a straight, highly professional account of the Irish
conflict, not at all skewed toward the IRA. Nor could anyone doubt
Geraghty's British patriotism. During the gulf war, when he was 58,
he volunteered for duty in the Royal Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Ministry of Defense representatives visited HarperCollins, a
publishing firm owned by Rupert Murdoch. It had planned a paperback
edition of ``The Irish War'' but postponed publication indefinitely
after the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surrealistic experience,'' Geraghty said when I
telephoned him, ``to find that Cromwell's style of government has
returned to England _ a determination to quash anything that looks
like dissidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system in Northern Ireland is to penetrate your target's
entire life. That's fine if you're stopping bombers. But the
surveillance machine, for want of employment, is now increasingly
being turned on Britons at home. The British population is now the
most intensely surveilled in the world. The terrorist's loss of
privacy is progressing to the ordinary citizen's.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution must prove that Geraghty, who for the moment is
free on bail, damaged national security. But the damage need only
be minuscule, because the statute does not balance it against a
public interest in openness.
</P>
<P>
   When the Official Secrets Act was revised in 1989, the Labor
Party and Tony Blair, then in opposition, proposed an amendment to
include such a public-interest element. It was defeated. Now Prime
Minister Blair evidences little sympathy for what Americans would
call First Amendment rights _ or other civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech not long ago Blair said he was sick of ``libertarian
nonsense masquerading as freedom.'' His home secretary, Jack Straw,
ridiculed civil liberties lawyers as people ``who get into their
BMW's and drive off to posh suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor's election platform promised a freedom of information act.
Straw has introduced a bill giving the government so much power to
prevent release of information that a number of Labor members of
Parliament are threatening to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   Straw also has a bill to deprive many criminal defendants of the
right to trial by jury. And an anti-terrorism bill targeting, among
others, anyone who seeks to overthrow a foreign government _ as
many anti-apartheid campaigners in Britain did for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair government, commendably, has acted to bring the
protections of the European Convention on Human Rights into British
law. But in his own actions, The Economist wrote, Blair has acted
as if he had ``a license to trample down civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Tony Geraghty is plainly designed to
intimidate those who would disclose official policy or criticize
it. And the intimidation seems to be working. HarperCollins caved
in. And the British press has had relatively little to say on
Geraghty's behalf. The case is a test of how much people care, and
will dare, for liberty.

 &HT;    Being a grandparent special at Christmas
 &HT;    By Dr. Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ One of life's unique experiences is that of
viewing the world from the perspective of a grandparent. Most
grandparents have long since past the following milestones:
</P>
<P>
   _ Needing to put together an electric train or arranging a doll
house underneath the Christmas tree as a ``gift from Santa'' on
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having to arise on Christmas morning at an uncivilized hour to
begin opening presents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being begged, cajoled, pestered and pressured by your children
to buy them the latest, hottest, trendiest toy or other gift on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a grandparent affords the opportunity to experience
many of the mystical qualities of Christmas again. Santa Claus
reemerges along with cookies and milk on the mantel and the
imagined sound of reindeer hoofs on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Memories come flooding back of Christmases spent with your own
children when they were young. Traditions may be passed on but new
ones are often added due to the inclusion of new family members
with their own historical perspectives on Christmas. Interesting
challenges and new opportunities present themselves:
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of making choices of toys for your grandchildren, as
you did on your own many years before, you must now consult with
their parents. Certain items that you deem appropriate might be in
keeping with the lifestyle of your grandchildren's parents. Except
for small items, coordinating your gifts with those of your adult
children and in-laws often makes for more meaningful and happily
remembered Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   _ If grandparents can afford it, contributing to their
grandchild's future college education fund or paying their tuition
to a summer camp is often meaningful and worthwhile. As
grandchildren get a little older, passing on family heirlooms at
Christmas time is meaningful and contributes to the traditional
elements of a holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   _ New traditions often need to be established due to
grandchildren residing in distant locations or needing to spend
time with their other grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not having to set the boundaries and limits for the
grandchild, enforce the rules and regulations or be the
disciplinarian gives the grandparent and grandchild a unique
opportunity to bond. As one humorist once put it, grandparents and
grandchildren have a special closeness because they have a common
enemy. Christmas time often brings this closeness to a focus
leaving many happy memories for both grandparent and grandchild.

HOMELESS PROBLEM IS ACUTE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With HOMELESS-CRACKDOWN) 
(lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Perhaps no city offers a more public example of
the problems of homelessness than San Francisco. The biggest
complaint visitors lodge about the city concerns the aggressive
panhandling and other manifestations of homelessness that they
experience, say city tourist officials. The No. 1 problem in the
city, according to a recent poll by The San Francisco Chronicle, is
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In the last three years, an overflow of Silicon Valley
professionals has moved in, sending the demand for housing, and
prices, to record levels. The average price of a three-bedroom
house is $720,000; the average rent on a small two-bedroom
apartment is $2,000, and rooms in single-room occupancy hotels are
$450 a month and up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 90,000 households here earn less than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the city has lost more than 1,200 units
in single-room occupancy hotels to fires and conversions to
apartments. Several hundred more apartments have been lost to
landlords who have evicted all tenants under a state law that
allows them to do so if they take the buildings off the market for
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   With the housing vacancy rate at 1 percent, finding a place to
live is extremely difficult even for those who can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, with a population of 750,000, has an estimated
12,000 to 15,000 people who are homeless and 1,500 shelter beds.
More than 1,200 people are on a waiting list for drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, with a population of about 7.5 million, city
data show that more than 80,000 different people use the city's
shelter system in an average year. About 23,000 homeless people use
the shelters on any given night.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco says it spends $60 million a year on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Of 10,000 people who were on a waiting list last year for
housing vouchers from the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 5,000 to 6,000 received them, but 44 percent had to
return them when they could not find apartments they could afford
within four months. More than 14,500 people are on a waiting list
for public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown blames the homeless situation on years of
cutbacks in federal money for housing and mental-health services,
and many homeless advocates agree.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress approved $1.02 billion for homeless
programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development for 2000, up from $975 million this year and $823
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget marked the first time that financing for homeless
programs had reached $1 billion since 1995. The budget that year
was $1.12 billion, the highest since Congress enacted the Stewart
B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act in 1987 in response to a public
outcry over homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the agency's overall budget for housing is far less than it
was 25 years ago. In 1978 the department's budget was $38 billion
and about 400,000 new families received housing subsidies each
year. But by 1995, when housing subsidies were eliminated
altogether, the department's s budget was $20 billion. The
subsidies were restored this year.

AMERICAN NURSE ADMITS TO SETTING FIRE THAT KILLED BILLIONAIRE
BANKER
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ An American nurse who had worked for Edmond Safra for
the last five months has admitted to setting the fire that killed
the billionaire banker as he took refuge in a bathroom in his
luxury penthouse in Monte Carlo last Friday, Monaco's chief
prosecutor said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said the nurse, Ted Maher, 41, of Stormville,
N.Y., had told the police that he had not intended to kill anyone,
but had fabricated his story that the apartment was under attack by
two hooded men with knives and had set fire to a wastepaper basket
in an effort ``to draw attention to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Daniel Serdet, said that Maher, was ``jealous''
of Safra's seven other nurses, one of whom died with Safra in the
bathroom. In claiming to have fought off the attackers, Maher hoped
to win approval, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a hero,'' Serdet said.
</P>
<P>
   The reported confession came after days of speculation over the
events that took place in the predawn hours atop one of the
principality's most secure buildings, home to three different bank
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Safra's death had stunned the rarified world of international
investment he had been part of for decades and triggered numerous
theories about why he might have been a target of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers around the world speculated that the Lebanese-born
Safra _ who without formal education built an international banking
empire _ might have been killed because of his many business
dealings, including those with Russian investors.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of his death was also particularly poignant. Safra,
who suffered from Parkinson's disease, was on the verge of
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to sell his businesses, including the Republic National
Bank of New York, which would have brought him about $2.65 billion,
is in its final stages.
</P>
<P>
   But French investigators said on Monday that there was no
complicated intrigue: Maher acted alone, they said, in part because
of a dispute with another nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Serdet said that, after starting the fire and slashing himself
twice with his own switchblade _ once in the thigh, and once in the
stomach _ Maher went downstairs to get the concierge to call the
police and firefighters to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Serdet said that Maher had not expected to kill anyone. Indeed,
investigating officials said on Saturday that Safra and his nurse,
Vivienne Torrent, could have escaped. But Safra, terrified that
assailants were after him, refused to leave the bathroom even when
the police and firefighters arrived on the scene, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials had said that Safra spoke twice by cell phone
with his wife, Lily, who tried to coax him out. However, The
Associated Press reported that a source involved in the case said
that this was not true, but that Safra had called the police twice
from the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Both Safra and Ms. Torrent, a 52-year-old American, died of
asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   Serdet said Maher would be charged with arson without intent to
kill, a charge that could bring him a life sentence. But the
prosecutor said also that Maher would be examined by psychiatrists
first to see that he was competent to stand trial. He said Maher
was apparently highly agitated and taking medication at the time of
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was psychologically fragile and under the influence of
medication,'' Serdet said.
</P>
<P>
   Maher, who was born in Maine, is a 1989 graduate of Dutchess
Community College in Dutchess County, N.Y., and received his New
York nurse's license in 1990. He had been a full-time pediatric
nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City for
nine years before taking an unpaid leave of absence earlier this
year, a hospital spokeswoman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, he and his wife, Heidi, who also worked as a
non-staff nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian, and their three children
have lived in a ranch house in Stormville, 70 miles north of New
York City. He had been in Monaco only for the past six weeks,
officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco police announced Maher's confession on the day of Safra's
funeral in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 mourners attended the ceremony at the Hekhal Haness
synagogue, including the Nobel Peace laureate, Eli Wiesel; Israel's
foreign minister, David Levy; Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan and the
former U.N. secretary general, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Safra's
body was then taken for burial to a Jewish cemetery the village of
Veyrier, just south of Geneva.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first, the authorities, basing their accounts on Maher's
initial testimony, said that two men wearing hoods and brandishing
knives had burst into an infirmary on the penthouse level, which
had recently been built for Safra.
</P>
<P>
   The pink stucco building sits along one of Monaco's most
gracious avenues, with views of a yacht-filled harbor and the
palace of Monaco's royal family. Safra, who shunned publicity, had
homes in New York, Paris, Geneva and a villa nearby on the French
Riviera in Villefranche-sur-Mer.
</P>
<P>
   But he spent a lot of time in Monaco, which offers the very rich
a income-tax-free haven. He apparently felt so safe here that he
did not have his bodyguards stay the night with him, when he slept
in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   But repeated questioning of Maher, who had been taken to
Princess Grace hospital in Monaco to be treated for his knife
wounds produced vague and conflicting accounts of the events, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, police officials said that they had no evidence to
corroborate Maher's story about a break-in or of the two masked
men. They continued to say they were unsure how anyone could have
gained access to the highly secured building.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Sunday night, the police formally took Maher into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Serdet said that Maher confessed to setting the fire on Monday
morning.

CANADA TIGHTENS GUN LAWS IN MEMORY OF 14 WOMEN SLAIN A DECADE AGO 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A decade after the murder of 14 women by a deranged
gunman at a university here, Canadians are grappling with the
massacre's legislative legacy, strict federal laws that mandate
registration of all guns and the licensing of all gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   In what many gun control advocates hope will be a North American
beachhead for tighter controls on firearms, all Canadian gun owners
must obtain licenses by the end of next year and they must register
their guns by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to laws passed in Britain and Australia following mass
shootings there, Canada's tightened gun controls followed the worst
mass shooting in this country's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on Dec.. 6, 1989, Marc Lepine, a 25-year-old unemployed
loner, stalked through three floors of an engineering building at
the University of Montreal. Carrying a semi-automatic rifle, he
targeted women, shooting 23 and killing 14. He also shot and
injured four men. Lepine, whose applications had been rejected by
the Canadian military and by the engineering school, then committed
suicide, leaving behind a note: ``Feminists have ruined my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadians had long thought that such mindless violence only
occurred south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all shocked out of our complacency to action,'' said
Heidi Rathgen, a survivor of the shooting who went on to help found
Coalition for Gun Control, the lead group that battled for tighter
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Although public opinion favored stricter laws, the battle for
gun registration and licensing turned into a bitter political
fight. On Sunday, Ms. Rathgen recalled after inaugurating a
memorial near the engineering school, ``We won because we
remembered, because we never gave up, because we didn't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls by Gallup Canada indicate that support for
the new National Firearms Registry has increased since enabling
legislation was passed in 1995, rising from 64 percent in 1995 to
73 percent in a poll taken six weeks ago. Support is strongest, 88
percent, here in Quebec, where many students were given Monday off
to attend memorials, concerts, symposiums and marches.
</P>
<P>
   But, in Canada's West, support in the Gallup poll was only 54
percent of respondents. And it is in Canada's West and North,
regions with the nation's highest rates of gun ownership, that a
very un-Canadian movement is brewing: civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people that I have spoken to have said
flat out, `I will not register, I just won't do it','' said Ray
Laycock, a founder of the National Firearms Association, a
gun-rights group, in a telephone interview from Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the new law took effect, on Dec. 1, 1998, only
184,808 of Canada's estimated 3 million gun owners have applied for
licenses. As for Canada's estimated 7 million firearms, 264,464 gun
registrations were approved over the last year. Canadians have had
to register revolvers and pistols since 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian gun owners say they are boycotting the registry
system because they believe it is a first step toward restricting
gun ownership to the police and military.
</P>
<P>
   Others seem to be procrastinating, waiting for Canada's Supreme
Court to decide on a challenge to the law, which is to be argued in
February. Arguing that gun control is a provincial and territorial,
not federal, right, the challenge is backed by Alberta, Manitoba,
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Yukon, and
Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Firearms Center, about 40 percent
of Canadian gun owners rarely use their guns and would probably
sell or destroy them to avoid registration.
</P>
<P>
   To Wendy Cukier, president of the Coalition for Gun Control,
this would make for a safer Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you have more guns, you have more gun deaths,'' said Ms.
Cukier, a professor of justice studies in Toronto. In an essay last
year in a Canadian public health magazine, she contrasted American
and Canadian statistics for gun ownership and gun deaths in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   She found that the United States had 3.5 times the number of
firearms per capita as Canada and 3.6 times the number of deaths by
firearms as Canada. The American rate for murder by firearms was 15
times higher than the Canadian rate.
</P>
<P>
   She concluded: ``You are hard pressed to explain the difference
in firearms deaths without touching on the availability of guns.''

<P>
   After a grueling year of falling profits, scuttled acquisitions
and the biggest product recall in company history, Coca-Cola's top
executive said Monday that he would step down in April.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing executive, M. Douglas Ivester, 52, said only that
he wanted to ``move on to the next stage of my life.'' But his
decision to retire so young after barely two years as chairman and
chief executive, a job in which he took delight, stunned
shareholders and the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Daft, a senior vice president who oversees operations in
Asia and the Middle East, was named president and chief operating
officer immediately and will assume the top role next year,
Coca-Cola said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester presided over one of the worst patches in the company's
performance since World War II, and that may have exhausted him or
led the board to believe it was time to look for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's rocky path looks even more so next to the smooth
machine that was Coke under the legendary Roberto Goizueta, the
chairman who oversaw a soaring stock price and global sales growth
for 16 years until his death from cancer. Ivester, a one-time
accountant who designed the interlocking Coca-Cola system with its
bottlers, had the misfortune to take over from him in 1997 shortly
after the Asian financial crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the company has been buffeted by disappointing sales
and a raft of other problems, including a racial-discrimination
lawsuit, government challenges to its acquisition plans and a
product contamination scare in Europe this summer, all of which
have caused it to slip from its perch as one of the most admired
companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Though board members had publicly restated their confidence in
Ivester's leadership, he had been increasingly criticized by some
investors and company insiders as arrogant and insensitive, most
notably in failing to quickly relieve consumer concerns in Europe.
In addition, his refusal to name a No. 2 was a sore point with Wall
Street and possibly some of Coke's directors. Ivester was fond of
jetting around the world to visit with Coke employees and with
customers, but seemed to lack the diplomatic skills to deal
effectively with European regulators and others whose agendas were
at odds with his own.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of soaring stock prices, executives with poor stock
performance can find themselves under extraordinary pressure from
impatient investors who will take their money elsewhere. Over time,
concerns about Ivester's management style and slowing sales in the
United States and abroad had knocked billions of dollars off his
company's value. Coke's share price, which exceeded $87 in
mid-1998, plunged to $48 in October before rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's resignation, which followed a special board meeting on
Sunday, punished the company's stock once more. One stock analyst,
Andrew Conway of Morgan Stanley, downgraded Coke for the first time
in five years. ``It's the equivalent of a major earthquake in
Atlanta,'' he said. The stock closed at $64.601, down $3.719. That
price represents an 11 percent increase during Ivester's tenure,
compared with a 50 percent rise in the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke used to be all about consistency from an investor
perspective, in terms of earnings results and volume results,''
said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
``We've had nothing but inconsistency the last couple of years, and
this just adds to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion Monday was the release of Coca-Cola's
volume numbers for the fourth quarter. The company estimated that
sales were ahead of those for the third quarter, suggesting that
the tide is turning in Coke's favor. That led many to wonder why
Ivester would make his decision now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug has informed the board of his desire to retire as
chairman and chief executive officer in April, a decision the board
has reluctantly accepted,'' the company said in a statement
attributed to James Williams, a board member who is also a major
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman, Rob Baskin, reiterated that it was
Ivester's decision. ``He decided at the end of last week that it
was time for fresh leadership at the Coca-Cola Co.,'' Baskin said.
``He had some conversations with a few board members, they called a
special meeting, and they reluctantly accepted his notice of
retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the board's 12 members are Warren Buffett, the value
investor who leads Berskhire Hathaway; Herb Allen, chairman of
Allen &AMP; Co.; former U.N. ambassador Donald McHenry, and James
Robinson, former chairman of American Express. Efforts to reach
board members for comment were unsuccessful Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the board, there has been underlying unhappiness with
the sequence of negative events,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global
consumer-products analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``It's been one after
another after another. No single one would necessarily be a
determinant, but it's the sum total that probably resulted in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts scrambled to hold conference calls with their
investor clients Monday, but came up short on details. ``The
explanation for his departure at this point in time for the reasons
I've been offered seems incomplete,'' said Marc Cohen, an analyst
for Goldman Sachs. ``It strikes me as odd timing, if indeed the
business has been repaired and is heading in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester publicly delighted in the challenges of running
Coca-Cola, where he was known to put in long hours, seven days a
week, with few interests outside the office. ``Even on a bad day,
it's still the best job in the world,'' he told a group of analysts
and money managers in July.
</P>
<P>
   Bottlers also seemed perplexed. ``I don't understand any of
it,'' said J. Bruce Llewellyn, the chief executive of Coca-Cola
Philadelphia Bottling Co., who said he learned of the announcement
while watching television. ``I've known Doug Ivester for a long,
long time, and I thought he was very good and very knowledegable
about this business. It's his troops and his plan that are in place
for the globalization of Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is completely out of character for a Coke executive to
step down early, leading some stock analysts to speculate that
Ivester had been pushed out by the board.

</P>
<P>
   In October, Coke hinted that a succession issue was rising. In a
sweeping management change, it gave additional power to three
executives, including Daft, setting up an apparent race for the top
spot. A 30-year veteran of Coke, Daft was passed over for the top
spot after Goizueta's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who the company said chose Daft as his successor, may
be leaving after weathering some of the worst problems abroad.
Economic crises in Russia, Japan, parts of Latin America and Europe
have curbed volume growth over the last 15 months, with currency
changes eroding earnings as well. Coca-Cola derives about 75
percent of its profits abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to expand the company abroad through acquisitions
stumbled over regulatory issues. A $1.8 billion purchase of the
Cadbury Schweppes brands in most of the world had to be scaled back
to exclude much of Europe, after objections from the European
Commission, and a two-year effort to buy the Orangina brand from
Pernod Ricard SA collapsed last month after the French government
blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   In June Coca-Cola had its biggest product recall ever after
hundreds of Belgians said they became ill with nausea and other
symptoms after drinking Coca-Cola and Fanta, another Coke brand.
The incidents prompted a 10-day ban on Coca-Cola products in
Belgium, the shutdown of two bottling plants in Belgium and France,
and an estimated $200 million in costs to Coca-Cola in Belgium and
beyond, as fears spread across the region. Its bottler in Belgium,
Coca-Cola Enterprises, took a $103 million charge to earnings from
the recall, in which 17 million cases of Coke were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spent heavily on damage control, giving away Cokes to
individuals and stores. Ivester appeared in a television
commercial, apologizing to the Belgian people and assuring them
that Coke was safe to drink. He also apologized in full-page
newspaper ads across the country. Still, the company was widely
criticized for responding slowly to the crisis; those apologies
came a week after the first reports of symptoms. Four
schoolchildren said last week that they had still not fully
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is also contending with a racial-discrimination lawsuit
filed by four employees who say they were denied pay increases and
other promotions because of their race. And the management shuffle
in October reassigned the highest-ranking black executive, Carl
Ware, who resigned days later as senior vice president. His
departure was a source of concern for some in Atlanta's civil
rights community.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Coke's 29,000 employees were sent an e-mail Monday
telling them of Ivester's decision. Baskin said Ivester has no
health problems that influenced his decision. Goizueta died at age
65, a few months after being diagnosed with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus shifts to Daft, who will have a chance to
influence a planned relaunch of Coca-Cola Classic early next year
and a strategic change at the company to raise prices even if it
means slowing case sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are significant strategic issues that Doug
Daft will face, and the resignation of Doug Ivester will mark a
historic transition,'' said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst for Sanford
C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Atlanta last year, Daft described the driving
force behind Coke's sales abroad. ``We all see Coke as being way
past a soft drink,'' he said. ``It can represent a way of life to
people. It can represent a change. You drink a Coke and it makes
you able to cope with an environment that isn't all that fun.''

 &HT;    Advice on fighting the blues
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are tips from experts on how to help lift the winter
blues:
</P>
<P>
   If you're feeling overwhelmed:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make time to spend with friends.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make time for fun.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Smile. Really. It releases pleasurable brain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Find out if your more demanding family traditions are
essential to the rest of the family. Maybe they can be replaced by
easier ones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get outdoors each day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drink at least eight glasses of water a day to flush out
toxins, facilitate digestion and keep the skin from drying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sugar, alcohol and caffeine can bring on feelings of stress
and depression in any month, so go easy on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   If your expectations might be unrealistically high:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't forget: Things go wrong in every month. Why should
December be an exception?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Enjoy the holidays moment by moment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Families have disagreements. Don't let them ruin your day, and
don't provoke them by bringing up weightier issues that can wait
till next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stick to a reasonable budget. Driving around past Christmas
decorations is cheap entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Follow your heart. ``So many times we rely on external
pressures to make a decision or evaluate a situation, when we
really have the answer inside of us the whole time,'' says licensed
counselor Scott Hall.
</P>
<P>
   If you have persistent symptoms of sadness, fatigue, disinterest
or changes in eating or sleeping patterns, see a mental health
professional. Those symptoms could indicate clinical depression and
seasonal affective disorder (SAD) _ both medical conditions that
can be treated.

 &HT;    Milestone year could take holiday anxiety to new heights
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Winter blues start showing their gloomy faces
around the first week of every December, counselors say, as
inevitably as Christmas music on the radio and advertising inserts
in the newspaper. But this year, with the odometer on our lives
turning over to three zeroes, the blues could be more prevalent
than normal as anyone old enough to remember the first moon landing
stops to wonder where all the years have gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a massive outbreak of the blues,''
Centerville psychologist Kathy Platoni said last week, ``especially
as people face the new millennium and realize how their lives are
not how they wanted them to be at this amazing crossroad. I'm
surprised we haven't seen more of it yet, but I think the warm
weather has been a delaying factor.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, December brings a dismal convergence of the unrealized
goals of New Year's, the unyielding grayness of winter and the
unattainable purity of Christmas cheer. They don't suffer from
clinical depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or other
serious, medically treatable illnesses that dampen moods. They're
just blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do something about it,'' says Scott Hall, a licensed
clinical counselor and assistant professor of counseling education
at the University of Dayton. As Hall and Platoni advise, people can
brighten their blues at least to a shimmering teal by trying to
keep their expectations and ambitions realistic and by reaching out
to others.
</P>
<P>
   People often cultivate their sadness with one of two thought
processes, Hall says.
</P>
<P>
   Then as Christmas approaches, either they are disappointed that
nothing in their lives resembles riding on a horse-drawn carriage
to the tune of ``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' or they're
overwhelmed by the feeling that a team of Clydesdales is bearing
down on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holiday demands tend to create over-the-top everyday stress
levels that begin to feel normal,'' says Susie Mantell, a
stress-relief expert whose relaxation audio tape is titled ``Your
Present: A Half-Hour of Peace.'' Don't try to do more than you can,
she says. Be a little selfish, or else you're no good to anyone
else. ``When in doubt, ask yourself, `Does this enhance my life?'
``
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the family could get along fine with fewer cookies,
decorations, outings and side dishes, Hall suggests. ``Doing
something a little differently this year doesn't mean that you are
shattering traditions or rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the overwhelmed and the disappointed can make things worse
for themselves by picturing life to be like those eye-moistening
movies and TV commercials ``where it's snowy and everyone is
home,'' he says. ``Those images plant a seed of how it should be,
and that's where we get in trouble. It puts an absolute on our
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world, things don't turn out perfectly. It helps
to accept the certainty that the holidays won't meet such lofty
expectations, Hall says. The gift might not bring whoops of joy,
the bean-and-mushroom-soup casserole might burn or the
sisters-in-law might start fighting. ``We expect certain outcomes
and if they don't happen, we can be shattered,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Unrealistic expectations also are a reason that New Year's
resolutions can be problematic even in years that don't end with
two or three zeroes, Hall says. The TOPS (Take Off Pounds Sensibly)
Club weight-loss organization released a survey last month saying
48 percent of Americans will make resolutions to lose weight or
change their eating habits, but only 14 percent will keep the
pledge all year. The average person will give it up around Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that many resolutions this year will
include crash diets, overexercising and overall unhealthy
practices,'' says Howard Rankin, TOPS' psychological advisor.
``Ideally, resolutions for improved health should stick _ long past
Feb. 23.''
</P>
<P>
   Re-evaluating life and anticipating needed changes aren't bad
things, Hall says, but ``Unfortunately, we tend to wait until the
end of the year and put all these things into one grand, huge goal.
It would be better to take things in little steps throughout the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall expects millennial blues to peak after Jan. 1. The simple
act of writing a check will remind us that even the 1 and 9 at the
front of the year is no longer a familiar constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a major issue,'' he says, particularly for
seniors and baby boomers. ``Going into a new century makes it a
more vivid reminder that life is passing us by.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jan. 1 will bring a sense of relief to many, Dr. James
Lomax of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston says it will bring
embarrassment to others. Their apocalyptic fears will be proven
wrong, the psychiatrist says, and some will have fallen prey to
``people who will exploit a person's financial fears in ways that
could be very costly.''
</P>
<P>
   But we can't stop the milestone from passing. Nobody is rich
enough or insignificant enough or determined enough to avoid it.
``I think it's important to acknowledge that,'' says Platoni.
</P>
<P>
   Make preparations, she says. ``If you feel you need to do
something, keep that bottled water available and a couple hundred
bucks of cash.'' She's buying Coleman lanterns for Christmas gifts.
But beyond that, she says, ``it's important to realize it's just
the passage of another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about millennial feelings can help, she says. Platoni
suggests friends, ministers, trusted family members. She also says
volunteer work for a church or charity often benefits the helper
even more than the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do something for somebody else that's meaningful,'' she says.
``Spend a day working at a shelter. Do something for needy
children, or for food relief. Get out there and generate some
positive feelings by giving of yourself from your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find your humanity within yourself. I have found that that is
more meaningful than anything else in terms of celebrating the
Christmas spirit.''

REPORT RELIEVES SWISS, BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SWISS-BANKS-HOLOCAUST) 
(lb) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ As the international panel released its
findings Monday on the assets of Holocaust victims in Switzerland,
the relief was palpable not only among bankers but also among other
Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that Swiss bankers had hoarded the accounts of Jews
from Germany and other Axis-occupied countries who had tried to
secure their assets in secure Swiss vaults had battered the
country's long-held beliefs that only wartime neutrality and valor
saved it from coming under Hitler's boot.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that while the actions of some individual
banks had been misleading, there had not been a conspiracy or
organized discrimination to deprive survivors of Nazi Germany of
their funds.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved banking officials, politicians and the public seemed to
embrace those conclusions, even though the report described some
egregious incidents of duplicitous and unprofessional conduct by
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the exercise was fair,'' said a prominent Zurich
banker, Hans Baer, who served as an alternate on the commission
appointed by the Swiss Bankers' Association and American Jewish
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest relief was that the report did not recommend
overturning the $1.25 billion settlement by Swiss banks in August
1998 to settle outstanding claims. Swiss banking officials had been
so fearful on that point that they had written about their concerns
to the commission chairman, Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
   The banking officials said the nearly 54,000 dormant, or
inactive, accounts that the panel said might belong to Holocaust
victims would present a payout so vast that it would exceed the
settlement amount.
</P>
<P>
   Although he agreed that claims could be covered under the global
settlement, Israel Singer, secretary-general of the World Jewish
Congress, said that the ``whole story is what we didn't find,''
referring to 2 million accounts from 1933-1945 that did not have
any documentation, so they could not be researched.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here today is a worldwide mea culpa,'' said
Singer, who was also a commission alternate. American Jewish groups
have long protested that there was considerably more money in
Switzerland than the $32 million in 775 Holocaust-linked accounts
that Swiss banks disclosed from their last search in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions were praised by Swiss political
parties, although the Socialist Party noted that it was
``absolutely unacceptable and a shame'' that it took 50 years to
reach a result.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's governing Federal Council released a statement
saying that the banks' cooperation and payment of the $200 million
search costs testified ``to their sincere determination to
establish the truth regarding the existence and extent of dormant
assets in Switzerland dating from World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, however, noted the report's findings that there
had been a ``lack of sensitivity and at times a scantly cooperative
attitude'' toward people seeking their assets in the postwar years
_ incidents documented in the report that have drawn little comment
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Swiss Bankers' Association chairman, Georg Krayer, said
he regretted the insensitivity to claimants. ``I should like to
apologize for all the disappointments and hurt feelings this
inadequacy may have caused,'' he said. But he insisted that except
for a few ``isolated cases,'' the banks had acted correctly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the cases documented in the report describes how an
account holder who found refuge in Chile asked the bank to release
funds to pay for a food package for his wife who was interned at a
concentration camp. The bank refused, citing government directives.
Later, however, the bank sent money to a Berlin bank on the
instruction of Nazi trustees of the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude here is that since it was not systematic robbery,
since it wasn't planned, then it was a mistake, so people feel
relief,'' said Rolf Bloch, president of the Swiss Federation of
Jewish Communities, speaking from Bern.
</P>
<P>
   The key remaining question is whether Swiss banking regulators
will agree to publish 25,000 names from accounts that may be linked
to the Holocaust. Baer and others predicted that bankers would do
so in the end to bring the dormant-accounts saga to an end.

U.S. AIRLINES ASKED TO REPORT ON SAFETY OF FOREIGN PARTNERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to improve safety on airlines that do
not fly to this country, the transportation department announced
Monday a plan to require U.S. airlines to report on the performance
of their foreign partners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The program is similar to an agreement last August between the
big American carriers and the defense department, under which the
airlines audit their overseas commercial partners and report what
they have found. The defense department has already used that
information to allow service personnel to resume flying on one
airline and to begin an investigation of another.
</P>
<P>
   But the transportation department program would make those
audits mandatory before it would approve partnerships called
code-share agreements. It could also terminate existing code
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through this program, Americans will know that foreign
code-share partners meet international safety standards,'' said
Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation, who was attending
aviation conference in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Code shares are agreements under which one airline flies the
airplane but two can sell tickets on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The safety implications of code shares became clearer after
Swissair Flight 111 crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1998,
killing all 229 people aboard. Swissair and Delta have a code-share
agreement, and Delta was legally responsible for the two-dozen
people to whom it had sold tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has maintained its relationship with Swissair, which is
already subject to transportation department regulations because it
flies to the United States. But Delta dropped Korean Air Lines
after several accidents, including a plane crash in Shanghai in
April.
</P>
<P>
   The plan announced on Monday is modeled after an agreement
struck by six American airlines and the defense department, which
buys 200,000 tickets a year on foreign airlines. The six have 160
code-share agreements with foreign airlines among them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has already used information from Delta Air Lines
to reinstate Korean Air Lines, which the Pentagon had stopped using
after the Shanghai crash. Delta has not reinstated its own
agreement with KAL, but has reported on the airline's improvements,
according to a Pentagon official involved in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has used information from the program to begin an
audit of another foreign carrier to see if it should be put on the
``non-use'' list, the official said. He would not name the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six domestic and international airlines are on the
Pentagon's non-use list, some of them with only two or three
planes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Social Security Administration is not being
optimistic enough about how long Americans will live in the 21st
century, and as a result it has underestimated how much their
benefits will cost, a federal advisory panel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration underestimated the financial problems
of the Social Security program because it had understated likely
improvements in the life expectancy of Americans, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials already assume that Americans will live longer
in the next century. But the expert panel said that the
government's assumptions were too conservative, and that life
expectancy would probably continue improving in coming decades,
just as it has through the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member panel said the decline in mortality rates had
financial implications: ``Longer lives imply more years of Social
Security benefits,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel reviewed the economic, demographic and other technical
assumptions used by the trustees of the Social Security program,
including the secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report was commissioned and issued by the Social
Security Advisory Board, an independent bipartisan body created by
Congress and appointed by the president and congressional leaders.
The trustees may incorporate the panel's suggestions in their own
annual report. But Social Security tax rates, the formula for
computing benefits and the standard retirement age can be altered
only by changes in federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy at birth increased to 76.7 in 1998 from 63.6
years in 1940. The Social Security Administration predicts that it
will rise to 79.3 in 2030 and to 81.5 in 2070. The expert panel
said these numbers are likely to be higher; it predicted that life
expectancy would probably reach 81 in 2030 and 85.2 in 2070.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think life expectancy will increase more rapidly than the
actuaries have estimated in the past,'' said Richard Lee, a
professor of demography and economics at the University of
California at Berkeley and a panel member.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has often described this type of situation as
``a high-class problem,'' because it reflects improvements in the
well-being of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, led by Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban
Institute, also said that wages and productivity would rise a
little faster than the government had assumed, and also suggested
other changes for the trustees' report.
</P>
<P>
   Taking these changes together, the panel concluded that Social
Security's long-term financial problems were about 25 percent
greater than the official government estimates indicated. To cover
the shortfall by raising taxes, the panel said, annual payroll
taxes would have to be increased by 2.6 percentage points above
current levels _ not just by 2.07 percentage points, as would be
required under the Clinton administration's assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   For a worker earning $30,000 a year, that means the payroll tax
would have to rise by $780 a year, rather than the increase of $621
needed under the assumptions now used by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that Social Security officials had made the
pessimistic and implausible assumption that life expectancy in the
United States would continue to lag far behind that of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it said, Social Security actuaries assume that
American women will have to wait until 2033 before they achieve the
life expectancy already achieved by French women in 1995 (about 82
years). Likewise, it said, the actuaries assume that American men
will have to wait until 2029 before they achieve the life
expectancy recorded by Japanese men in 1995 (77 years).
</P>
<P>
   The experience of other countries shows that ``U.S. mortality
can fall a long way without encountering biomedical limits,'' the
panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Ross, deputy commissioner of Social Security, said the
panel's recommendations would be ``carefully considered'' as her
agency prepares future annual reports on the program's financial
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Goss, deputy chief actuary of Social Security, said:
``Everybody agrees that mortality will continue to improve in the
future. The point of debate is how fast that improvement will be.''

DOCTORS URGE POLIO SHOTS TO REPLACE ORAL VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The oral polio vaccine, used routinely in the United States
since the 1960s, should be replaced by old-fashioned polio shots,
the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement issued on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation is the final step in phasing out the oral
vaccine, which began in 1997 when health officials recommended that
the first two doses of polio vaccine be given by injection and the
last two by mouth, instead of all four being given by mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the change is that the oral vaccine, which
contains a live but weakened form of the polio virus, can in rare
instances cause polio, either in the child receiving the vaccine or
in an unvaccinated adult who comes into contact with the child.
About eight such cases occur each year in the United States, one
for every 2.4 million oral doses given.
</P>
<P>
   The injected vaccine, which is just as effective as the oral
one, cannot cause polio, because it uses an inactivated form of the
virus. The injected vaccine used today is an updated, stronger
version of the original vaccine that was developed by Dr. Jonas
Salk and introduced to the public in 1953. The Salk vaccine
injections were later replaced by Dr. Albert Sabin's oral vaccine
because the oral version was more effective and better able to stop
outbreaks in areas where many cases occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's new recommendation is nearly identical to one made
in June by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which said that after Jan. 1, 2000, all four doses of the vaccine
should be injected, rather than given by mouth. The doses are to be
given when children are 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months and 4 to
6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But the academy's recommendation differed from that of the
federal centers in one respect: instead of recommending, as the
centers did, that doctors stop using the oral vaccine altogether in
January, the academy said that during the first few months of 2000
doctors could use up their leftover oral vaccine by giving it as
the third or fourth dose to children who had already had two or
three injections of polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   An advocacy group representing families whose children had
contracted polio from the oral vaccine strongly objected to the
idea of allowing doctors to continue to use it, suggesting that it
might cause more cases of polio. John Salamone, president of
Informed Parents Against VAPP (vaccine-associated paralytic polio),
issued a statement saying that members were ``deeply troubled'' by
continued use of the vaccine, especially since doctors could return
it the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the manufacturer, Wyeth Lederle Vaccines, a
division of American Home Products, confirmed that the company
would take the oral vaccine back and give doctors refunds or
credits.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Georges Peter, a professor of pediatrics at Brown
University and chairman of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee,
who helped develop the academy's recommendations, said that no
cases of polio had ever been linked to the oral vaccine when it was
used as a third or fourth dose in children who had already had two
or three injected doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean in any way to belittle the parents' concerns, but
I think the risk from the academy's policy is minimal to
nonexistent,'' Peter said.

CLINTON TO ORDER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will order federal agencies to
take steps to reduce medical errors blamed for tens of thousands of
deaths, administration officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The steps include precautions to prevent pharmacists from
dispensing the wrong drugs and procedures encouraging hospitals to
investigate any errors that cause serious injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House ceremony on Tuesday, the officials said,
Clinton will instruct federal agencies that provide or finance
health care for 85 million people _ one in three Americans _ to
adopt the latest techniques for reducing medical errors, so far as
such steps are feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the officials said, Clinton has decided to accept
major recommendations from a report issued last week by a panel of
the National Academy of Sciences. The report said that medical
mistakes caused tens of thousands of deaths a year and that health
care providers could reduce the number of errors by 50 percent in
the next five years, by collecting and systematically analyzing
data on accidents, as the aviation industry does.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has immense leverage over the health care
industry because it buys or subsidizes large amounts of health care
and regulates hospitals, nursing homes and many other health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has the authority to make some changes unilaterally.
Thus, White House officials said, any health insurance plan that
wants to cover federal employees in 2001 will have to take steps to
reduce medical errors and protect patients, as recommended by the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   This directive will affect more than 300 private health plans
that insure nine million Americans through the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will order other federal agencies that provide or
finance health care to ``evaluate and, where feasible, implement
the latest error-reduction techniques,'' a White House document
says.
</P>
<P>
   This instruction will be addressed to the Department of Health
and Human Services, which runs Medicare and Medicaid; the
Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides medical care to
millions of veterans, and the Defense Department, which provides
health care to military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said the federal government would try to use its leverage as
the nation's biggest purchaser of health care to improve the
quality of care for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Clinton created a task force of federal agencies
to find ways of measuring and improving the quality of health care.
On Tuesday, officials said, Clinton will order this interagency
group to report back to him within 60 days on ways to carry out
recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The interagency group will develop proposals that can be
included in the president's next budget, which he intends to submit
to Congress in late January or early February, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they had not figured out how
Clinton's new initiative would deal with the concerns of health
care providers who fear they will be more exposed to lawsuits for
medical malpractice if they openly acknowledge more of their
mistakes. The Clinton administration has generally opposed efforts
by health care providers to limit the damages they may be required
to pay in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday signed a bill expanding the mission of the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a unit of the Public
Health Service. One of the agency's new roles is to ``identify the
causes of preventable health care errors'' and to find ways of
curtailing such mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the health care industry, including leaders
of the American Hospital Association, will meet with the president
at the White House on Tuesday, to signal their support for some of
the academy's recommendations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The hospital association is sending a list of error-reduction
techniques to each of its 5,000 hospitals. Richard H. Wade, senior
vice president of the association, said his group was forming a
partnership with the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a
nonprofit organization based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., to reduce
errors in the prescribing and dispensing of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The institute reviews medication errors reported by doctors and
nurses across the country, and it advises drug companies how to
change the labeling or packaging of products to prevent such
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will praise the hospital association for its efforts to
prevent medication errors, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said on Monday that he would
introduce a bill to carry out all the recommendations of the
National Academy of Sciences, including ``mandatory reporting'' of
serious errors and creation of a new Center for Patient Safety in
the federal government. The center would have an annual budget of
$30 million, rising to $100 million in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 20 states require hospitals or other health
care providers to report their mistakes, but compliance is uneven,
and many states have no such requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that his effort would be bipartisan and that he
intended to work with two Republican senators, James Jeffords of
Vermont and Bill Frist of Tennessee, as well as with Sen/ Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's bill would require hospitals and nursing homes to
adopt policies to reduce medical errors as a condition of
participating in Medicare or Medicaid, just as many Clinton
administration officials want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, which finances health care for 39 million people who
are elderly or disabled, and Medicaid, which insures a similar
number of low-income people, provide more than 40 percent of the
revenues for hospitals and nursing homes. So standards for these
two programs become virtual mandates for the entire health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering Cabinet officers to evaluate the recommendations of
the National Academy of Sciences, Clinton is following a pattern he
established in 1997 and 1998. He appointed a panel of experts to
draft a ``bill of rights'' for patients, and he embraced its
recommendations eight months later. He ordered federal agencies to
grant such rights to people enrolled in federal health programs,
and he urged Congress to enact similar standards for private health
insurance.

UTAH WILDERNESS SEARCHED FOR LAST OF 8 YOUTHS WHO ASSAULTED
COUNSELORS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR CITY, Utah _ For a second day, searchers combed a rugged
desert region west of here Monday, looking for the last of eight
teenaged boys from a program for troubled youth who assaulted their
counselors on Saturday and escaped into the wilderness of southwest
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   One boy was found by authorities on Saturday after he became
ill; five others turned up Monday, the authorities here in Iron
County said. One surrendered at a farm near Milford, Utah, and
another was taken into custody in Ely, Nev., after hitchhiking a
ride with a truck driver. The boy found in Nevada told
investigators they would find three other boys in a remote area
between Ely and Garrison, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But with search efforts on the ground and in the air so far
unsuccessful, the authorities and program officials said they were
worried that the other two boys' could not endure the severe
nighttime cold in the area. Typically, this time of year,
temperatures in southwest Utah can fall below 10 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern right now is for the health and safety of
the remaining boys,'' Steve Peterson, one of the founders of the
program, the Redcliff Ascent Wilderness Therapy Program, said in a
statement. `'The boys are not outfitted for extended periods in
this type of weather and in this type of terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ages of the boys, 14 to 16, their identities were
not released by the authorities. Officials said only that are from
New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what happened on Saturday is known through interviews of
the first boy found by the Iron County sheriff's department. Now in
custody at a juvenile detention center on charges of aggravated
assault and theft, the boy told investigators that the group
overwhelmed the counselors _ Kirk Stock, 23, and Sunshine Fuller,
22 _ by beating them with sticks. The authorities said Stock was
knocked unconscious and bound with duct tape, and Ms. Fuller was
left tied to a tree.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson said in his statement, ``Reports that one counselor
was rendered unconscious were erroneous. Both instructors freed
themselves and hiked to a neighboring group about two hours away to
call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the remaining seven boys in the group fled on foot
after their attack, taking some food, water and radios that use
only frequencies dedicated to Redcliff. He said efforts have been
made to contact the youth using the radios, and aircraft have been
dispatched to search for fires in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time this year that the authorities in
southwest Utah have been summoned to search for missing teenagers
from the Redcliff program. In separate incidents in April,
investigators found a 14-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy who
had wandered off from their therapy groups.
</P>
<P>
   But even with periodic problems of missing youth, Peterson and
other Redcliff officials defended the wilderness program as an
effective tool for troubled and at-risk youth.
</P>
<P>
   He said the assault is the first incident of its kind since
Redcliff began operations six years ago, a period in which he said
the program has helped more than 1,500 youth from around the
country, using techniques that build self-esteem and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the popularity of programs like Redcliff have grown in
recent years as an increasing number of families, many of them
high-income, turn to unusual alternatives to confront a child who
has exhibited signs of behavioral problems, emotional needs or
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the programs are located in southern Utah, where the
rugged terrain plays a major role in rehabilitation. By design,
groups of teenagers are led by counselors into mountains and desert
for several days at a time, where the vagaries of nature are used
to teach responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nadauld, director of admissions for Redcliff, said several
hundred teenagers are enrolled each year in its wilderness therapy
program of 30 or 60 days, and groups generally consist of six to
nine people with three staff counselors and a support team that
includes a therapist and other administrative personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the parental decision to send their children to programs
like this reflects a last-resort approach after mounting
frustrations of unsuccessful discipline through more conventional
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at their best, these programs can be very powerful,
efficacious and impactful experiences,'' said Bill Zimmerman,
accreditation coordinator for the Association of Experiental
Education in Boulder, Colo., a company that monitors professional
wilderness camps and adventure training programs in the United
States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons these businesses are flourishing is because
they have had such profound changes on the participants in terms of
those individuals self-concept or self-esteem,'' he added. `'It's
an environment where things get really simple _ making adequate
shelter, making sure they don't get hurt _ and they have to rely on
communication so they can achieve their goals. Gradually they
realize they that if they want to achieve something really
difficult, they have to develop those skills.''

MARKET PLACE: SO, WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT THE RITE AID MEETING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the financial position of Rite Aid Corp. unraveled this year,
the most intriguing single meeting seems to have taken place on
June 30. There are diametrically different versions of what was
said at that meeting _ differences that raise questions about the
performance of Rite Aid's board and its auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid says that at that June 30 meeting of the audit
committee, auditors from KPMG International failed to mention that
they no longer trusted the company's chief financial officer. Nor,
said the company, did KPMG make it clear that its doubts about the
quality of the company's financial controls were so great that the
auditing firm would not issue quarterly reports on the company's
financials.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG says that it did discuss both points, which Rite Aid agrees
the auditor had made in earlier conversations with the company's
management. Two weeks later, the company issued a quarterly
financial report that gave no hint of the auditor's belief that the
company's financial controls could not be relied upon.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the chief executive, Martin Grass, was forced out of
the company, and Rite Aid said it would have to restate its results
for the last three years. It expects to reduce reported profits by
$500 million. In November, KPMG resigned as the company's auditor.
</P>
<P>
   A new management team took over Rite Aid Monday, voicing
optimism but saying the pace of growth will be slowed. In a
conference call with analysts, Robert G. Miller, the new chief
executive, said financial controls ``must be strengthened, and they
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he believed ``most of the writeoffs are behind
us'' but said final numbers will await completion of an
investigation of the company's accounting practices by Swidler
Berlin Shereff Friedman, a New York and Washington law firm, and an
audit by Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the company's new auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The June 30 meeting came after a difficult period in the
relationship of Rite Aid and KPMG. The company had been forced by
auditors to take the humiliating step of making major changes in
its financial statements for the fiscal year that had ended in
February. The profits had been substantially higher in the news
release issued in March than they were in the report filed on June
1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of June, Rite Aid's stock price was about $25, half
the peak it had reached in January but far above the low of $4.50
it fell to after the bad news came out in November. Monday, the
price rose $3.625, to $11.875, as investors reacted to the new
management team.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, KPMG notified Rite Aid that it felt it could no
longer rely on representations made by Frank Bergonzi, the
company's chief financial officer, and that because the company's
accounting controls were so bad, it would not be able to issue
reports on the company's quarterly financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   That is confirmed by Rite Aid, but the company would not say to
whom that message was given. And a spokeswoman said it was not
passed on to the audit committee.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG, in a filing with the SECMonday, said that its personnel
who attended the June 30 audit committee meeting remember
discussing the lack of confidence in Bergonzi and KPMG's refusal to
issue quarterly reports. But Rite Aid says the subject neverarose
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In its own filing with the SEC, Rite Aid said its version of
what transpired is supported by the three members of the audit
committee, as well as by another director, who was not identified,
who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the audit committee are Preston Robert Tisch, the
co-chairman of Loews Corp. and the part owner of the New York
Giants football team; Nancy Lieberman, a partner at Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, the New York law firm, and William Bratton,
the former New York City police commissioner. Of the three, only
Bratton returned a telephone call, and he said he could not discuss
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rite Aid directors' recollections are accurate, it must
have been an extraordinary meeting. Everyone agrees that KPMG
delivered a letter to the audit committee saying that financial
controls were so bad that Rite Aid could not ``accumulate and
reconcile information necessary to properly record and analyze
transactions on a timely basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company says that meeting did not get into KPMG's
conclusion that it could not perform quarterly reviews, which are
less extensive than audits but offer some assurance for companies
before quarterly statements are issued.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for KPMG said the firm would not discuss the
situation beyond what is contained in the filings. Bergonzi, who
left Rite Aid two weeks after the June 30 meeting, in what the
company called a retirement, also declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S EC,
rules have been proposed and are now being considered by various
regulatory bodies, to strengthen the role of corporate audit
committees. Among them is a rule that would require audit
committees to discuss with auditors the quality of the corporate
financial statements, not just whether they meet the minimal
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would also require companies to say whether
any information had come to the attention of audit committee
members that caused them to believe financial statements contained
materially misleading statements.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal has run into resistance from some companies, which
have told the SEC that they fear it would increase the legal
liability of audit committee members. The SEC is considering
whether to relax that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rite Aid case makes clear that it is possible for a
difference of opinion to arise regarding what was said about the
very question that is at the heart of the reason for creating an
audit committee: Can investors be confident that a company's
financial reports are accurate?
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid's audit committee says it didn't know what was going
on, and KPMG says it did.

 &HT;    SabreTech held liable for actions leading to ValuJet crash
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal jury on Monday convicted the SabreTech
maintenance firm of eight criminal counts of recklessness and one
count of improper training in the deadly May 1996 ValuJet crash,
but cleared the company and two maintenance workers of 14 other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In what was believed to be the first criminal conviction in an
accidental air crash, both prosecutors and SabreTech declared
victory. But Gwendolyn Marks of Miami, who lost her son Philmore in
the crash, called the verdict ``a dagger in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Crash investigators believe a horrific fire sent Flight 592
slamming into the Everglades, killing all 110 aboard. Investigators
have concluded that 144 outdated oxygen generator canisters _
removed from another plane, listed as ``empty'' by SabreTech and
loaded by ValuJet in Miami for return to ValuJet's Atlanta
headquarters _ activated in the DC-9's cargo hold, sparking the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the deadliest in Florida history and may have been
one of the most preventable anywhere. The National Transportation
Safety Board has said the crash reflected complacency, rushing and
a bottom-line mentality on the part of both the airline industry
and its overseer, the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began Nov. 17, is believed to be the first ever
criminal case in an accidental plane crash in U.S. history. The
12-member jury began discussing the case late Thursday, spent all
day Friday in discussion and deliberated for a little more than six
hours Monday before announcing its verdict about 3:15 p.m. Jurors
left without comment.
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech still faces 110 state felony murder counts and another
110 manslaughter charges in the case. Miami-Dade County prosecutors
allege the deaths stemmed from the illegal transportation of
hazardous materials. No one would go to prison, but the company
could be fined up to $10,000 per count if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury Monday ruled that SabreTech recklessly allowed
hazardous materials _ the oxygen generators _ to be transported and
failed to properly train its employees. It also concluded SabreTech
improperly trained employees in handling hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   It faces up to $500,000 in fines per count plus unspecified
restitution to the victims' families. U.S. District Judge James
Lawrence King did not set a sentencing date.
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech and employees Daniel Gonzalez and Eugene Florence were
acquitted of charges of conspiracy and lying on repair records. The
company also was cleared of additional hazardous materials charges.
</P>
<P>
   A third defendant, Chilean native Mauro Valenzuela, jumped bail
and has been declared a federal fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and Florence hugged in the court, then stood with their
lawyers on the steps of U.S. District Court, but declined repeated
calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Florence had signed a work card saying he fitted the generators
with plastic caps designed to prevent them from activating, but
admitted days after the crash that he never did. Gonzalez is
accused of pressing Florence and other mechanics to sign false
paperwork. He also was charged with falsely signing off on work
never done on another plane in 1995; prosecutors have said that
shows SabreTech had a history of sacrificing care for profits.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has said the workers made unintentional mistakes but
committed no crimes.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been convicted, Florence would have faced up to 15
years in prison, Gonzalez up to 10 years. Last week, King dropped
eight of 11 charges against Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accentuated the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it sends a strong message . . . that there will be
serious _ I repeat, serious _ criminal consequences,'' assistant
U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis said. ``The good news is that the flying
public can sleep well tonight.'' The SabreTech corporation, which
lost $37 million after the crash, is out of business. Its parent
company, St. Louis-based Sabreliner, would be liable for any fines
and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never should have gone through this nightmare,'' Sabreliner
spokesman Kenneth Quinn said. ``We may never know what happened on
that fateful flight, (but) the search for a scapegoat for the
terrible ValuJet tragedy is plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet, which has changed its name to AirTran, and SabreTech
have settled most lawsuits brought by victims' families, but a few
are set for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Sawyer of southern Miami-Dade County, whose grandparents,
Conway and Anna Laurie Hamilton of Coral Gables, died on the plane,
let out a long sigh in the courtroom after the verdicts were
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got off on a lot of charges,'' she said later outside.
``It's a shame but it's a good first step and it shows America you
can't put the almighty buck ahead of peoples' safety.''

FIREFIGHTERS STRUGGLE WITH EMOTIONS DURING DELAY IN SEARCH FOR FIVE
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. -- Anguish turned to frustration as weary
firefighters were forced Monday to halt for eight hours their
efforts to find five fallen comrades inside a burned-out warehouse
because of fears that an unstable firewall might collapse on top of
search crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing on earth we want to do is hurt someone,'' said
Worcester Fire Department District Chief Walter Giard, as dozens of
firefighters milled outside what one fire official dubbed ``the
building from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the remaining five firefighters resumed after a
large crane had dismantled part of the unsteady fire wall.
</P>
<P>
   The delay added to the emotional pain of exhausted firefighters
and family members of the six men who died Friday night battling
the blaze that still continued to smolder at the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co. building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually have to hold people back'' from entering the
building under unsafe conditions, District Chief Ron Fritz said.
``The frustration is really overwhelming. Words really can't
explain what we're going through right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of dejected firefighters had nothing to do during the day
but stand by, watching front-end loaders sort rubble into piles _
piles of blackened, twisted metal piping, piles of crumbled brick
and piles of ashes. Family members huddled in blankets nearby as
smoke hung in the air and a light rain fell. So far, investigators
have no leads on what caused the massive fire on the edge of
downtown that reduced the sprawling, vacant building to charred
rubble. Investigators said they did not know if the empty building
had been boarded up or secured in anyway to keep out trespassers.
</P>
<P>
   District Chief Michael McNamee, who commanded the first unit to
arrive at the scene of Friday's fire, provided new insight Monday
into how the fire spread and why it so quickly engulfed the
warehouse in thick black smoke.
</P>
<P>
   When 25 to 30 firefigthers first entered the burning building to
look for homeless people reported to be inside the area was so
clear and conditions so unthreatening that the men were not wearing
face masks, McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But within four seconds the building filled compltely with
black, hot billowing smoke,'' said McNamee.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he added, was because of the building's original
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was built to hold in the cold, so it could hold the heat
in, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thick brick walls were padded with cork and in many of the
maze-like storage areas sheet rock had been padded with
polyurethane foam, a petroleum product, McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of heavy, black smoke that disoriented the firefighters
probably erupted just as the blaze reached the polyurethane, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refer to it as the building from hell,'' said McNamee.
</P>
<P>
   After firefighters were ordered to retreat, two members of
Rescue Company No. 1 failed to show up for a headcount _ Paul
Brotherton, 41, of Auburn, and Jeremiah Lucey, 38, of Leicester.
</P>
<P>
   Four men who went in to search for them and never returned -
Lieutenant Thomas Spencer, 42, of Worcester, Timothy Jackson, 51,
of Hopedale, James Lyons, 34, of Worcester, and Jospeh McGuirk, 38,
of Leicester.
</P>
<P>
   There were no homless people believed to be inside the building
when the fire started.
</P>
<P>
   While the warehouse had once been part of a bustling commercial
neighborhood, city officials who had visited the building in recent
years described it as a windowless, claustrophobic maze of hallways
with ceilings no higher than seven or eight feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no electricity, no water, no heat and the sprinkler
system was busted,'' said the city's commercial assessor, Ed
Hostrander, who visited the building in 1994. ``I remember thinking
that I would not have wanted to be a firefighter in there. I was
just afraid I would never find my way out.''
</P>
<P>
   After removing Jackson's body Sunday, investigators found his
badge Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, hopes faded among the 300 people working
outside the warehouse that the other five men would be quickly
located and their remains turned over to anxious relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials Monday refused to discuss in any detail their
investigation into the fire and stepped back from previous comments
that the blaze may have been set because it was burning in two
places when firefighters first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it suspicious, but suspicious doesn't mean
anything,'' said District Chief James Callery. ``We wouldn't be
investigating if it weren't suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Dennis Budd Monday set up a board of inquiry that
will begin meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters Monday were facing the possibility that the bodies
of the five dead firefighters might not be retrieved in time for
Thursday's memorial at the Worcester Centrum, which is expected to
draw 15,000 to 20,000 firefighters from across the country and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only just now getting a handle on the scale this
operation is going to be,'' Callery said with a note of tired
resignation in his voice. ``It's going to be long and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the family members gathered Monday at the warehouse ruins
was Timothy Jackson, Jr., 32.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his father's body had been found and taken away,
Jackson said he came back because there was still unfinished
business among the close-knit community of firefighters who
repeatedly refer to each other as ``family'' and ``brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be coming back here until the last fireman is out,''
Jackson said. ``I don't think I should sit home while my father's
brothers are still in there.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the recovery effort, the Boston Fire Department
brought in a high-tech fiberoptic imaging device with a 26-foot
range and 180 degree rotation that can snake into crevices too
small for humans to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   But the most useful tool Monday was the 130-foot crane brought
from out-of-state to dismantle, bit-by-bit, about 20 feeet of the
warehouse's internal firewall to prevent the possibility that it
would collapse during the recovery effort.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours of work accumulated, many firefighters had received
little or no sleep since Friday night, going home only when ordered
by superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is that keeps us going, but whatever it
is, we should all bottle it and sell it,'' said Donald Courtney,
vice-president of the local firefighter's union.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's devastating fire has elicited a tremendous outpouring
of support from people in this central Massachusetts city of
170,000.
</P>
<P>
   A firetruck-turned-memorial was virtually hidden behind piles of
flower bouquets left as condolences by strangers, along with toy
firetrucks, paper hearts, photographs, and handmade signs.
``Firefighters saved my baby. I will always remember,'' read one
card, which was signed: ``a grateful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, families continued to reflect on the fathers,
sons, husbands and brothers they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Jr., recalled that his 10-year-old son, Joshua, has a
firefighters' calender in his room and wanted to follow in his
grandfather's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and he had a bond where he was supposed to teach his
grandson to be a firefighter,'' Jackson said. ``Now Joshua just
sits and holds his grandfather's picture.''

   MIAMI _ A federal jury on Monday convicted the SabreTech
maintenance firm of eight criminal counts of recklessness and one
count of improper training in the deadly May 1996 ValuJet crash,
but cleared the company and two maintenance workers of 14 other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In what was believed to be the first criminal conviction in an
accidental air crash, both prosecutors and SabreTech declared
victory. But Gwendolyn Marks of Miami, who lost her son Philmore in
the crash, called the verdict ``a dagger in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Crash investigators believe a horrific fire sent Flight 592
slamming into the Everglades, killing all 110 aboard. Investigators
have concluded that 144 outdated oxygen generator canisters _
removed from another plane, listed as ``empty'' by SabreTech and
loaded by ValuJet in Miami for return to ValuJet's Atlanta
headquarters _ activated in the DC-9's cargo hold, sparking the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the deadliest in Florida history and may have been
one of the most preventable anywhere. The National Transportation
Safety Board has said the crash reflected complacency, rushing and
a bottom-line mentality on the part of both the airline industry
and its overseer, the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began Nov. 17, is believed to be the first ever
criminal case in an accidental plane crash in U.S. history. The
12-member jury began discussing the case late Thursday, spent all
day Friday in discussion and deliberated for a little more than six
hours Monday before announcing its verdict about 3:15 p.m. Jurors
left without comment.
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech still faces 110 state felony murder counts and another
110 manslaughter charges in the case. Miami-Dade County prosecutors
allege the deaths stemmed from the illegal transportation of
hazardous materials. No one would go to prison, but the company
could be fined up to $10,000 per count if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury Monday ruled that SabreTech recklessly allowed
hazardous materials _ the oxygen generators _ to be transported and
failed to properly train its employees. It also concluded SabreTech
improperly trained employees in handling hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   It faces up to $500,000 in fines per count plus unspecified
restitution to the victims' families. U.S. District Judge James
Lawrence King did not set a sentencing date.
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech and employees Daniel Gonzalez and Eugene Florence were
acquitted of charges of conspiracy and lying on repair records. The
company also was cleared of additional hazardous materials charges.
</P>
<P>
   A third defendant, Chilean native Mauro Valenzuela, jumped bail
and has been declared a federal fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and Florence hugged in the court, then stood with their
lawyers on the steps of U.S. District Court, but declined repeated
calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Florence had signed a work card saying he fitted the generators
with plastic caps designed to prevent them from activating, but
admitted days after the crash that he never did. Gonzalez is
accused of pressing Florence and other mechanics to sign false
paperwork. He also was charged with falsely signing off on work
never done on another plane in 1995; prosecutors have said that
shows SabreTech had a history of sacrificing care for profits.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has said the workers made unintentional mistakes but
committed no crimes.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been convicted, Florence would have faced up to 15
years in prison, Gonzalez up to 10 years. Last week, King dropped
eight of 11 charges against Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accentuated the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it sends a strong message . . . that there will be
serious _ I repeat, serious _ criminal consequences,'' assistant
U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis said. ``The good news is that the flying
public can sleep well tonight.'' The SabreTech corporation, which
lost $37 million after the crash, is out of business. Its parent
company, St. Louis-based Sabreliner, would be liable for any fines
and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never should have gone through this nightmare,'' Sabreliner
spokesman Kenneth Quinn said. ``We may never know what happened on
that fateful flight, (but) the search for a scapegoat for the
terrible ValuJet tragedy is plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet, which has changed its name to AirTran, and SabreTech
have settled most lawsuits brought by victims' families, but a few
are set for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Sawyer of southern Miami-Dade County, whose grandparents,
Conway and Anna Laurie Hamilton of Coral Gables, died on the plane,
let out a long sigh in the courtroom after the verdicts were
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got off on a lot of charges,'' she said later outside.
``It's a shame but it's a good first step and it shows America you
can't put the almighty buck ahead of peoples' safety.''

CONTRACTOR FOUND GUILTY IN TRIAL ON VALUJET CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ SabreTech Inc., the aircraft maintenance company that
safety investigators concluded had improperly packaged the oxygen
generators linked to the 1996 crash of ValuJet Airlines Flight 592,
was found guilty Monday in a subdued federal courtroom of
improperly handling the hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   As the court clerk read the verdict here Monday afternoon, there
were no shouts of victory or even words of satisfaction from
relatives of the crash's 110 victims. There was only a quiet
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Marks, the mother of Philmore Marks, a 23-year-old
victim of the disaster, sat in her seat, her eyes pooling with
tears: ``If Philmore were here, he would shake his head, and say,
`Nothing ever works out like you want it to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although SabreTech the company was found guilty on eight counts
of causing the transportation of hazardous materials, no top
executives were charged in the crash. A fine to be set by Judge
James Lawrence King of U.S. District Court will be the only
punishment. And the two company employees who did go on trial here
with SabreTech, Daniel Gonzalez, chief of hangar operations, and
Eugene Florence, a mechanic, were acquitted on charges that they
lied on repair records.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had argued that SabreTech and the two
employees _ a third worker is believed to have fled the country _
sacrificed caution for expediency to complete contracted work on
time, then lied on work forms, causing the crash of ValuJet Flight
592.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Heck Miller, assistant U.S. attorney, said SabreTech
workers did not install safety caps on oxygen generators that
heated up in the plane's cargo hold but said on paperwork that they
had. The generators caused a fire in the cargo hold of Flight 592,
which then crashed just after takeoff from Miami International
Airport on May 11, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big business, getting away with murder,'' said Laura Sawyer,
whose grandparents, Conway and Anna Laurie Hamilton, died in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech is out of business; following post-crash publicity,
its business dried up. But it is not bankrupt, and will, its
lawyers say, continue to fight legal challenges against it,
including unrelated state charges of murder. The fine for the
federal conviction could run as high as $2.25 million. Meanwhile,
ValuJet is still flying, under a new name, AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   If anything good came from the federal charges, said relatives
of its victims, it is that the ValuJet crash may become a
cautionary tale. ``I just hope the airlines will learn a lesson
from all this,'' Mrs. Marks said. ``That they will be safe, because
it's the law. That people who do their jobs do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, who had described the crash as an accident, not
a crime, claimed some victories in the verdict. ``My client felt
that no one committed a criminal act,'' said Jane Moscowitz, a
lawyer for Florence. ``He's sorry that the accident happened. It
was a tragedy. It wasn't a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech had been charged with one count of conspiracy, but the
jury found the company not guilty of that count and of five counts
of making false statements. But it did find SabreTech guilty on one
count of failing to provide training in handling hazardous
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty good vindication of the company,'' said Ken Quinn, a
lawyer for SabreTech. ``We are very pleased with the not guilty
verdicts for our former SabreTech mechanics. We are also pleased
that the jury dismissed almost two-thirds of the charges against
the company, including the government's outlandish conspiracy and
terrorist counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the company would appeal. He and other lawyers for
SabreTech had argued that no one at the company intended for anyone
to be hurt, and that, although mistakes were made, the company's
actions never amounted to a crime. Instead, company lawyers said,
the crash was probably caused by the condition of the 27-year-old
DC-9, which had mechanical and electric problems.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, disappointed that the two SabreTech employees were
not convicted, said the jury's verdict ``validated the government's
case.'' Guy Lewis, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District
of Florida, said that Gonzalez and Florence were not ``the most
culpable party in this horrific tragedy.'' The company itself was,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's charges stemmed from what prosecutors said was
``pencil-whipping'' by Gonzalez, who, they said, pressed Florence
and other workers to sign the paperwork even though the actual work
had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Florence, prosecutors said, signed a work card stating that he
had installed shipping caps on the volatile generators _ caps that
would have prevented them from heating up in the cargo hold and
causing the 2,200-degree fire.
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet and SabreTech have settled most of the lawsuits brought
by relatives of the victims, but some are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami courtroom, relatives of the victims walked away
from the three-week trial feeling empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always talks about the 110 victims,'' said Ms.
Sawyer, whose grandparents perished in the crash. ``But there are
so many more victims than the people who died on that plane. There
are thousands.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ In grief and alarm, residents from all corners of
this city expressed shock Monday at the death of one of their most
outspoken newspaper writers in a street stabbing in the unlikely
bastion of affluent Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of principle with him, not a manhood thing,''
said Jude Bruno of the sudden, violent death of W. Russell G.
Byers, a columnist with the Philadelphia Daily News who resisted a
robber Saturday night near the hamlet's picturesque main street and
was stabbed in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Byers was very opinionated and made it clear in his
columns that he stood against urban crime,'' said Bruno, manager of
Caruso's Market in Chestnut Hill where Byers shopped and, his
neighbors said, held forth on city issues more avidly as a
committed resident than a professional pundit. ``He just couldn't
give in.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intense citywide search, the police announced the
arrest Monday of a murder suspect, identified as 20-year-old Javier
Goode, who reportedly was recorded on a surveillance television
tape at the neighborhood Wawa convenience store where Byers bled to
death after being assaulted in the adjacent parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to get the guy away from me and into the light,''
Byers' wife, Laurada, told the Daily News. She described how the
assailant emerged from the nighttime shadows outside the store
after they had stopped for ice cream in the heart of what police
say is statistically one of the safest areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   From the city's political establishment to the cobble-stoned
streets of his home neighborhood, Byers was mourned as a writer of
popular, sharp-edged civic commentary and as a man who transcended
his roots in old-line wealth to reach a tabloid readership with
solidly researched views on government problems.
</P>
<P>
   Byers' great-grandfather was W.R. Grace, the 19th-century
industrialist who amassed a fortune and became the first Catholic
elected mayor of New York City. He was twice married to and
divorced from Connie Mellon, a daughter of the Pittsburgh society
family, and for all his upper-class credentials mourners stressed
Byers passion for the give and take of street-level politics and
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell was a man who had a tangible love for the city of
Philadelphia,'' said Mayor-elect John F. Street, a politician who
crossed swords with Byers in the past, notably in a libel suit that
the columnist won.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Katz, a close friend and Republican businessman who narrowly
lost to Street in last month's election, said the city was left
with ``a huge, huge void.'' ``He was an amazing guy with a
tremendous sense of optimism,'' Katz said as city residents
expressed amazement at the very idea of murder in Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never ever had a killing like this,'' said Marie Jones,
editor of the Chestnut Hill Local, the community weekly. ``The
neighborhood is terribly shaken,'' she said in her office off
Germantown Avenue, the main street of small shops and galleries
that was aglow with holiday lights.
</P>
<P>
   The police reported only eight incidents of violent crime in the
neighborhood since June, and these typically involved such property
crimes as purse snatchings and car break-ins. ``We feel so safe
here leave our car doors unlocked,'' said Mickey Valinis at the
local visitors bureau. ``We're totally amazed this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno at Caruso's said some merchants feel that a more visible
police presence was needed. But as attractive as the neighborhood
might be to passing thieves, residents emphasized that Byers and
other local voters heartily endorsed remaining a part of
Philadelphia a decade ago when they rejected a secession proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Chestnut Hill's problem or Philadelphia's problem;
the fact is we live in a violent society,'' said John Ingersoll at
the Chestnut Hill Cheese Shop, who knew Byers as a friend and
regular Saturday morning customer and conversationalist. ``He was
always full of good ideas, sort of like a good coach,'' said
Ingersoll, noting the Byers held the most eclectic Christmas
parties with the guest list ranging from ranking politicians to
local tradesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old Byers was senior editor at the News. He came to
newspapering a decade ago after a career in politics and government
that included service with Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and
executive jobs with the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. In roaming the city, he built a reputation for budget
delving and blunt writing, with his last columns urging the new
mayor to ``read the riot act'' to ``what is now Your
Establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   An impromptu memorial of flowers and candles _ including a pack
of the Lucky Strike cigarettes Byers smoked as he paced his office
and composed his columns _ was placed by friends outside the store
where he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to remember,'' said Zachery Stalberg, a
close friend who is editor of the News, ``is that Russell was
really not a journalist first. He was really a citizen first.''

EUROPEAN GROUP'S LEADER TO VISIT CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHECHNYA-RUSSIA) 
(jt) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chairman of Europe's leading
intergovernmental organization promoting democracy and human rights
said Monday that he planned to go ahead with a restricted visit to
Chechnya next week despite profound differences with Russia over
the conduct of its war and in particular its threat of an attack on
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Knut Vollebaek, Norway's foreign minister and current chairman
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in
an interview that he had asked the Russians for a political
peacemaking role for the organization, but had initially been
rebuffed and barred from the area. The organization spans Western
Europe and the former Soviet bloc countries, and Russia is a
member.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Russian government relented in part and told
him he could take a delegation of observers on a two-day trip to
Dagestan, Ingushetia and parts of Chechnya under Russian army
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we look at the humanitarian needs,''
Vollebaek said, ``because if at a later stage we play a political
role, it is important to be seen now, being with the people who are
suffering.'' He said that he planned to meet Chechnyans displaced
by the fighting and listen to their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we might say that this is limited, not the full
mandate that I had wanted, I still think it is important,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek, whose organization has played a leading role in human
rights monitoring in Kosovo, also said he wanted to make the point
that internal conflicts _ which is how Russia describes its war
against Muslim rebels in Chechnya _ cannot be ignored by the OSCE
because the war could have an unsettling impact throughout the
Caucasus area and into Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Civil wars in Central Asia, he said, would be ``something that
can be worse than the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which has largely prevented international organizations
from visiting Chechnya, has also managed to escape official censure
of any kind at the United Nations. The Russian war, with almost
daily reports of atrocities against civilians, has not been brought
to the Security Council for discussion. An Eastern European
diplomat suggested that there was great reluctance to interfere in
a traditional Russian sphere, whatever the situation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is mounting concern among Islamic nations and others
that fear the possibility that the Chechnya crisis will become a
new crusade for Islamic militants, especially if Grozny is
destroyed with significant loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the city of Grozny, which Russia ordered evacuated
ahead of a major offensive, was not on the OSCE delegation's
itinerary.

 &HT;    British barristers to bargain with U.S. courts in Florida murder
case
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A team of proper British barristers
appearing (SET ITALICS)amicus curiae (END ITALICS) on behalf of a
countryman condemned to die more than a decade ago for the grisly
murders of a father and son in a Miami hotel penthouse may appear
curious indeed when they argue before the Florida Supreme Court
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The barristers, trying to help overturn the conviction of
Krishna Maharaj, plan to appear in horse hair wigs and flowing
black robes. One may even sport silk stockings.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys believe American courts unfairly handled Maharaj's
case after his trial judge was arrested in Miami on bribery
charges. They also contend prosecutors withheld evidence and
Maharaj's defense attorney performed ineptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, Kris got screwed over, and it's shocking they haven't
done something before now,'' said Clive Stafford Smith, a
British-born attorney in Louisiana representing Maharaj. ``I told
them to send the damn gun boat and just shell Washington until we
beat them into submission and they reminded me those times had
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the British barristers have taken a more diplomatic
tack in their ``friend of the court'' arguments:
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of capital punishment in Great Britain and the
United States is littered with tragic examples of justice
miscarrying with fatal effect,'' barrister Julian B. Knowles
pleaded in his brief. ``(We) would respectfully urge the Court to
act now to prevent the possibility of another case being added to
this list.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare, though not unheard of, for bewigged barristers from
the British Empire to appear in American courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, representing 104 members of the House of Commons, will
be accompanied by attorneys for 128 members of the House of Lords
(England's highest court), the European Parliament, the Human
Rights Committee of the Bar of England and Wales, and Queen's
Counsel Phillip Sapsford, he of the silk stockings.
</P>
<P>
   While international intervention in death sentences has rarely
persuaded American courts, it does bring attention to a
controversial law abandoned by all but a few Western countries,
said Richard Dieter, director of the Washington-based Death Penalty
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the European Parliament called for a
moratorium and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights asked
countries to suspend death sentences while it examines the issue.
The Catholic Church has long opposed capital punishment and this
year the pope succeeded in persuading the governor of Missouri to
grant clemency to a Death Row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an important case whenever any foreign national
is on Death Row because of reciprocity, . . . just as if we wanted
to send over our lawyers if someone was going to be caned in
Singapore,'' Dieter said. ``It's no secret Florida is going before
the U.S. Supreme Court on the issue of the electric chair . . . and
all of that heightens the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj, 60, once a millionaire with a fleet of Rolls-Royces and
a stable of thoroughbreds, was convicted in October 1987 of killing
a business partner and his son in the two-story penthouse suite of
the Dupont Plaza Hotel in downtown Miami a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj, a British subject born in Trinidad, had moved to the
U.S. in 1985 after building a fortune importing bananas and fruit
to England, said Smith. Maharaj lived large: He owned the second
largest string of racing ponies in Britain at one time, and a
prized horse beat the Queen Mother's entry at Royal Ascot. He also
paid the law school tuition for his brother, who is now the
attorney general for Trinidad and coincidentally helped shepherd an
unprecedented string of executions in that country recently.
</P>
<P>
   When Maharaj's English business started declining, he decided to
invest in Florida real estate and in1986 hired neighbors Derrick
Moo Young, 53, and his son, Duane, 23 to manage property. (In 1981
Maharaj purchased undeveloped land in Royal Palm Beach for $3.75
million, but it fell victim to foreclosure a year later when he
failed to make payments.)
</P>
<P>
   The partnership soured when Maharaj blamed the Moo Youngs for
blowing a business deal and sued. Police say Maharaj lured the Moo
Youngs to the hotel to confront them and shot first the father,
then the son.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys say that Maharaj was framed and that the
prosecution's eyewitness failed a lie detector test. The Moo
Youngs, they say, were linked to a $5 billion dollar money
laundering conspiracy and had many enemies. In addition, the judge
was arrested four days into the trial on bribery charges and
Maharaj's attorney, Eric Hendon, failed to ask for a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon declined to comment on the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On appeal, Maharaj's case was returned to the trial court for a
new hearing in October 1997, but defense attorneys complained that
they were given no money to help try the case and Maharaj was
broke.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami-Dade circuit judge upheld Maharaj's conviction, but set
aside his sentencing which will go back to a jury. At that point,
interest in England grew and the government took an interest,
Stafford Smith said. Prosecutors will again seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem we've had in motivating people is I think Kris
suffers from color of skin on both sides of the Atlantic,'' he
said. ``Basically, the bottom line is this guy is patently not
guilty.''

forces on Monday on Grozny, the besieged Chechen capital, as
translated by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the city of Grozny! Russian troops are completing
the encirclement of the city. In order to avoid civilian
casualties, we propose that you leave the city of Grozny before
December 11, 1999. Use any means possible. The Command of the
Combined Group of Russian Forces has set up a checkpoint for
civilians in Pervomayskoye, and a tent camp has been set up so you
can settle in Znamenskoye. You are guaranteed all constitutional
rights. After the completion of the counter-terrorism operation you
will be able to return to your homes. Do not give in to the
provocations of the terrorists and the bandits. Do not allow them
to use you for their purposes. Only in this way will you be able to
avoid death and save your city. Remember, preservation of life and
the provision of security for the civilian population is the main
task of the Russian troops.

EXXON REVOKES BENEFITS FOR PARTNERS OF GAY WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil Corp., which was created last week after Exxon
completed its acquisition of Mobil, has revoked a Mobil policy that
provided health-care coverage to the partners of newly hired gay
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The move outraged gay rights advocates, who said the reversal is
a step back for gay employees and goes against the recent trend of
companies, and municipal governments, extending benefits to gay
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, partners of Mobil employees who had already
been receiving coverage are ``grandfathered'' and will continue to
get benefits. But partners of employees hired after November will
not be able to receive the benefits, and long-serving gay employees
of Mobil who take a partner in the future will not be able to
obtain benefits for that partner.
</P>
<P>
   The trend of companies extending ``domestic partner'' benefits
to gay couples began in the technology industry, but lately it has
been extended to other industries, including the airlines and some
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, BP Amoco PLC, which was formed by the merger of
British Petroleum and Amoco, will offer domestic-partner benefits
to all U.S. employees as of April 1. Previously, Amoco had offered
the benefits but BP had not. Gay rights groups say about 15 percent
of the United States' largest companies now offer domestic-partner
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new Exxon Mobil policy became effective Nov. 30 _ the day
the acquisition closed _ and tracks Exxon's existing policy, which
did not extend domestic-partner benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of the Mobil policy was attacked Monday by the
Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group in Washington, which said
it learned of the change after being contacted by several angered
Exxon Mobil employees.
</P>
<P>
   The group issued a statement condemning the action as only the
second major U.S. employer to take such steps, following the
decision last year by the chairman of Perot Systems, Ross Perot, to
not offer benefits to the partners of newly hired gay employees.
That policy remains effective today, a Perot Systems spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cirigliano, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the new policy
states that benefits will be offered to anyone in a ``legally
valid'' marriage or common-law marriage to an Exxon Mobil employee.
``It's our opinion that basing benefits coverage on a legally
recognized relationship eliminates the need for the company to
establish criteria of its own for which to assess the legitimacy of
any relationship, whether it's straight or gay,'' Cirigliano said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not know how many gay Mobil employees
currently have benefits for their partners, and he said he did not
know how long the Mobil policy had been in place.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates were quick to note that no state currently
recognizes same-sex marriages, although they said court cases may
change that in a few states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smoke,'' said David M. Smith, the Human Rights Campaign's
communications director. ``They're basically trying to justify what
they have done. The fact is, no jurisdiction recognizes marriages
between same-sex couples. These benefits have proliferated
throughout corporate America as a way for companies to offer equal
pay for equal work.'' He said 74 of the Fortune 500 companies now
offer domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kevin Cathcart, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education fund, a gay rights groups in New York, said,
``They're taking a giant step backward that is out of step with
where the public and industry is going. It's not clear to me what
they gain from this. They will save some small amount of money, but
it hardly seems worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathcart said the trend toward more companies offering
domestic-partner benefits had been helped by ordinances in some
cities restricting the ability of companies to do business with
municipalities unless they offer domestic-partner benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates on Monday attacked Exxon Mobil's decision
to adopt a policy that does not specifically name sexual
orientation as a category of forbidden discrimination, as Mobil's
policy had done.
</P>
<P>
   Cirigliano said Exxon Mobil's anti-discrimination policy simply
lists the same categories that the federal government does. And he
added that language has appeared in Exxon's securities filings _
and in speeches by company executives _ making plain that
discrimination based on sexual orientation will not be tolerated.

<P>
   FORT GIBSON, Okla. _ A seventh-grade boy described by witnesses
as yelling ``I'm crazy, I'm crazy!'' opened fire on Monday morning
outside the middle school in this small east Oklahoma town,
injuring five of his fellow students in the latest school shooting
in the nation this year.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager began firing a 9mm semiautomatic handgun into
clusters of students who were waiting outside for the morning bell
to signal the start of classes at Fort Gibson Middle School. An
investigator estimated that the youth fired 13 or 14 shots,
emptying his clip, before a science teacher who is the school
safety officer managed to subdue him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, man, what's going on?''' said Justin D. Barnes,
13, a sixth grader who saw the youth moments before the attack.
``He put down his book bag, took out a gun and started shooting.
Somebody yelled, `What are you doing?' His response was, `I'm
crazy, I'm crazy!'''
</P>
<P>
   The attack is one in a spate of school shootings across the
country this year, including the April shooting at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., in which two students killed 12
students and a teacher, wounded 23 others and then killed
themselves. On Monday, President Clinton expressed relief that no
one had been killed in the Fort Gibson attack and said ``our
prayers are with each of the children and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the victims were taken by ambulance and helicopter to
hospitals in nearby Muskogee and in Tulsa, about 50 miles northwest
of here. One victim, a 12-year-old girl listed in fair condition,
underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to her cheek. Three boys, a
12-year-old and two 13-year-olds, suffered gunshot wounds to the
arms or legs and were listed in fair or stable condition. The fifth
victim was nicked by a bullet fragment and not badly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Gibson's police chief, Richard A. Slader, refused to
identify the shooter because of state laws protecting the
identities of juvenile offenders. The teen-ager, identified as
being either 13 or 14, is being held in a nearby juvenile detention
center. The Muskogee County district attorney, John David Luton,
said charges would be filed once investigators finished their
report, possibly within a day.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon news conference, Slader said the suspect's
parents had refused ``at this time'' to allow him to question the
teen-ager. The chief said the youth had never been arrested nor
been the source of any problems to his department, and he described
the teen-ager as ``calm and dazed'' after his arrest. ``He never
said anything,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a possible motive, Slader responded, ``As of this
second, I absolutely, honestly can't tell you why.'' He said he did
not know if the suspect was targeting particular students or if he
simply arrived at school and began firing randomly.
</P>
<P>
   Slader said he did not know how the youth obtained the gun.
Federal agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
were tracing the origins of the handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1824 as the first military post in the Oklahoma
Territory, Fort Gibson is a quiet town of about 3,500 people in
which the big news of late had been the local high school's first
appearance in the state football championship game. The team lost
last weekend, but the ``Go Tigers!'' signs are still painted on the
windows of the brick storefronts of the small downtown.
</P>

<P>
   The middle school is in a large complex that includes the high
school and elementary school. Awaiting the morning bell, students
loitered outside the middle school building after 7:30 a.m., then
fled in terror into the cafeteria at the sound of gunshots. ``It
sounded like little firecrackers,'' said Julie Bowen, 12, who had
arrived after 7:30 a.m. ``When I looked back, one of my friends was
lying on the ground with blood on her face. She had got shot in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Bowen, Julie's mother, described the suspect ``as a nice
kid'' and said his family had once lived nearby and still attended
their church. ``They're nice people,'' she said. ``They're just
nice people.''

<P>
   Q -- Our manager told us that he heard that employees today seek
recognition more than anything else at work, including money. He
said that we need to keep this in mind when supervising in our
areas. I think this is an oversimplification, but when I said this
to him, he said I was flat out wrong. Am I? T.S.
</P>
<P>
   A -- A manager who tells his employee that he is ``flat-out
wrong'' is usually flat-out wrong. A more productive managerial
response is to discuss your points.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you simply said to him that his thoughts are an
oversimplification, your comments may have been perceived as an
attack. If you disagree with your manager on this type of issue,
you can increase the likelihood of a discussion rather than a
brush-off by starting with a question rather than an answer.
</P>
<P>
   As for your manager's thoughts about recognition, he is correct,
but only to a point. Recognition is motivational at work, providing
that other basic work elements are perceived as fair and adequate,
such as the pay, working conditions and benefits. For example, if
the pay is perceived as inequitable, all the recognition in the
world is not going to have much of a motivational impact.
</P>
<P>
   However, once the basic elements such as pay are taken care of,
then recognition can play an important motivational role, as can
advancement, responsibility, achievement and the work itself. Your
manager needs to recognize that there is more to motivation than
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We have casual dress days every Friday, but I am reluctant
to wear casual attire because I feel that, as a female, we tend to
diminish our stature when we dress casually, while the same does
not seem to apply to males. My associates tell me that I am wrong
about this. What do you think? A.N.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Your proficiency, competence and excellence as an executive
are based far more on your work style than on your clothing style.
If people look at your appearance on a casual day and somehow
misperceive your role, stature or status in the organization, that
is their problem. It is important that you do not let it become
your problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you regard yourself as less significant or influential when
you are casually attired, you may actually turn this
self-perception into a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people
believe that they are not effective, their performance tends to
slip and fall into line with this expectation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been some studies that have noted
the differences you mentioned in the way that males vs. females are
perceived on casual dress days. This perception is clearly on the
endangered stereotype list and should be extinct fairly soon. The
irony is that when people do not dress casually on casual days,
that can point to questionable confidence, excessive formality, and
even indifference to the company culture.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, your company has a policy of casual dress days,
and you should take advantage of it if you want to. Your strength
as a leader comes from within, and just because your attire is
casual does not mean that your professionalism is casual too.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- Our new manager gives me the creeps. I don't know what it
is about him, but as soon as I met him, I felt my skin crawl. I
can't identify anything in particular that he did, but I just don't
like being around him. I like my job, but the whole place has
really changed for me because of him. What can you suggest? D.D. &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 3,3!tag!A!off! This is the type of situation in which
you need to literally and figuratively step back and take a look at
what is actually happening. You have made a snap judgment about a
new person in your work life. The problem is that although many
people think they can make expert judgments instantly, many of
these judgments are instantly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In your own life, there have probably been cases where you took
a quick liking to someone, only to find out over time that there
was less to this person than met the eye. And, you have probably
found that some of those people whom you did not initially like
actually turned out to be rather likable. The key element is the
passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Your instant opinion of this individual may be entirely
accurate. Perhaps your experiences with people have helped you to
identify subtle problematic traits of others. However, your quick
opinion could also be indicators of bias, prejudice or previous
negative experiences with someone who unconsciously reminds you of
this individual.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, your question is going to be answered. In the
interim, try to deal with him with an open mind, lest he make an
inaccurate snap judgment of you.

SHARES OF GM AND HUGHES JUMP ON HOPES OF A STAKE SALE
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speculation that General Motors Corp. might spin off part of its
stake in Hughes Electronics, or even become the target of a
takeover bid, led to heavy trading Monday in GM shares and GM's
tracking stock in Hughes. But a meeting of GM's board adjourned
Monday afternoon with only an announcement of a factory investment.
</P>
<P>
   After rising sharply on Friday, GM shares closed at $76.50, up
75 cents Monday, on volume nearly double the daily average. The GM
class H shares, which track its stake in Hughes, soared $5, to
$94.6875. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A tracking stock lets companies highlight the financial value of
a business unit without relinquishing ownership. Investors can buy
and sell tracking stock like regular shares, but the stock does not
represent an actual separate ownership stake in the business it
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading, GM said only that its board had
approved investing another $700 million in a pickup factory in
Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Pearce, GM's vice chairman, had told analysts earlier
this fall that the board would hear its annual report Monday on the
performance of Hughes, in which GM owns a 68 percent stake. Pearce
warned that this did not mean that GM planned to change its
relationship with Hughes, but his comment prompted speculation that
the board might decide to spin off a piece of GM's Hughes stake to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have urged such a move, contending it would
temporarily raise the value of GM stock. Hughes is valuable because
its DirecTV unit has become the nation's leading provider of
satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials have resisted a spinoff, contending that Hughes has
strategic value to the automaker. GM has tapped Hughes' expertise
in satellite communications and electronics in developing its
OnStar auto navigation system. GM said last month that it planned
to add e-mail and other services to OnStar.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in October, Pearce indicated that any changes at
Hughes might not happen quickly. ``We don't do major restructurings
in any circumstances on a whim overnight,'' he said. ``There are
tax and organizational ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at credit-rating agencies have also said they were
counting on GM to retain a sizable stake in Hughes. That means if
GM shed a large part or all of Hughes, GM's borrowing costs would
rise when it finances car loans and leases for customers.
</P>
<P>
   While there was some speculation Monday that GM might be a
takeover candidate _ speculation reported this weekend by Barron's
_ several investment bankers and traders were skeptical. ``Why
would an industrial buyer walk into the reality of owning a
manufacturing business and expose themselves to all the risks, like
GM's union situation?'' one investment banker asked. &QL;

EMBATTLED HEAD OF LABORERS' UNION ANNOUNCES HIS RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur A. Coia, the embattled president of the laborers' union,
announced his retirement Monday, two months after several union and
federal officials said he would soon step down as part of a deal in
which he would plead guilty to fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Coia, 56, one of President Clinton's biggest labor supporters,
said he was retiring because of illness and because he and his
family thought it was time for him to step down. Officials with the
Laborers' International Union of North America, one of the nation's
largest building trades unions, insisted that his retirement had
nothing to do with a deal with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Justice department officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Coia angrily accused the department of leaking
incriminating information about him. Those attacks came after
newspapers reported that he would soon resign and would plead
guilty shortly afterward to charges involving his purchase of a
$450,000 Ferrari from a supplier to the 750,000-member union.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a government official and a union official said the
plea would not result in a prison term but would bar Coia from
future contacts with the union, which a president's commission
described in 1985 as one of the nation's most corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement Monday, the union said Coia would become
president emeritus. He would stop serving on the union's board, but
would receive part of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   In March, after a five-year investigation, an officer o the
independent union hearing cleared Coia on charges that he had ties
to organized crime. But the officer fined Coia $100,000 for an
ethics violation concerning his purchase of the Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Coia said, ``For too many years, my position in
the union has caused me to be investigated nonstop, top to bottom
and inside out. For far too many years, my entire life has been
scrutinized _ every action reviewed, every motive analyzed, every
decision questioned, every good deed doubted.''
</P>
<P>
   Coia, who has largely recovered after grueling bouts of
Hodgkin's disease and prostate cancer, said it was time to retire
rather than continue to put his family in a secondary role.
</P>
<P>
   Coia was a co-chairman of several fund-raisers for Clinton, and
Republicans pushed for a federal investigation of whether the
president asked prosecutors to go easy on Coia and his union.
Administration officials have denied that Clinton asked any such
favors or that they went easy on Coia.
</P>
<P>
   Coia has long been one of the nation's most flamboyant union
officials. He drove a Ferrari and other luxury cars, he had a large
seaside home in his native Rhode Island, and he loves to golf. His
office just two blocks from the White House resembled a golf pro's
shop.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he modernized his union, making it concentrate
more on organizing additional members and improving health and
safety programs. In 1995, he provided a pivotal vote to John
Sweeney when he was running for president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Coia's father was once secretary-treasurer of the union and,
prosecutors said, associated closely with Raymond Patriarca Jr.,
New England's longtime crime boss.
</P>
<P>
   The union said Monday that its board had elected Terence M.
O'Sullivan, 44, to replace Coia. O'Sullivan was a union vice
president, mid-Atlantic regional manager and assistant to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said O'Sullivan was chosen only after
government officials rejected other candidates backed by Coia.
</P>
<P>
   Like Coia's father, O'Sullivan's father once served as the
union's secretary-treasurer. His father was indicted in 1981 in a
kickback scheme but was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McGough, director of Laborers for Justice, a dissidents'
group, said, ``It's good news that Coia is getting out of the
union. Unfortunately, O'Sullivan is not the kind of reformer that
the reformers want.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal said to have been reached between Coia and the
government follows an anticorruption investigation that the union
conducted under an earlier agreement with the government. The
government dropped a planned a civil racketeering suit intended to
install federal supervision. Instead, the Justice Department took
the unusual step of allowing an elaborate group of union
investigators and hearing officers to carry out an internal
housecleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Coia has been a target of that internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the union's hearing officer, Peter Vaira, fined Coia
$100,000 for a conflict of interest regarding the Ferrari. The
union's in-house prosecutor, Robert D. Luskin, discovered that Coia
had bought the sports car with the help of a Rhode Island company
that leased cars to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Coia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing regarding the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``At all times, in all ways, I have acted with the good of the
union and its members foremost on my mind and in my heart,'' he
said.

JUSTICES TACKLE TROUBLED STATE PRISON SYSTEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether the Constitution permits Congress to limit the authority of
judges to oversee troubled state prison systems.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, concerned that judges were asserting too much control
over states, enacted legislation in 1995 that essentially requires
federal judges to respond within 90 days to a state's request that
they withdraw their oversight of prisons. If the judge fails to
answer within that time, the court's prison supervision ends
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   But inmates at an Indiana prison have successfully challenged
the law as a violation of the Constitution's call for a separation
of powers between federal lawmakers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May that Congress
unconstitutionally encroached on judicial oversight of prisons. The
court called the 90-day response deadline ``a direct legislative
suspension of a court order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has joined the state of Indiana in
urging the high court to reverse the 7th Circuit and rule the
Prison Litigation Reform Act constitutional. Federal and state
lawyers said the law does not violate the Constitution because
judges retain their oversight authority if they respond to the
state in time.
</P>
<P>
   But the prisoners' attorney countered that the law violates the
unencumbered authority of judges to ensure constitutionally safe
conditions at prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision by July.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, inmates at the Indiana Reformatory sued the state,
claiming conditions at the prison were unconstitutionally
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, a federal judge called for drastic changes in prison
operations, including a cap on population and improved standards
for medical care and food preparation. The judge also ordered a
reduction in the use of physical restraints and improvements in
vocational training and substance-abuse and mental-health programs
at the prison, now named the Pendleton Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Indiana moved to terminate the court's oversight of the
prison, 15 years after the judge asserted control.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, judicial oversight of a prison system can be
suspended if the judge fails to respond within 30 days to a state's
request that supervision end. The law allows a judge to postpone
that deadline for 60 more days if there is ``good cause'' for the
failure to respond.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge S. Hugh Dillin of Indianapolis, who is
overseeing the Indiana prison, ruled the statute an
unconstitutional infringement on the separation of powers. The 7th
Circuit agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully urging the justices to hear Indiana's appeal,
state Attorney General Jeffrey Modisett called the law a valid
attempt to prevent zealous judges from overriding, for years at a
time, the well-established authority of states to regulate their
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 7th Circuit's decision struck down a vital provision of a
congressional enactment designed to preclude federal courts from
intruding unduly on state prison administration,'' Modisett wrote
in a legal brief to the justices. ``The overriding purpose of the
invalidated statute is to motivate prompt judicial action, and the
7th Circuit's decision foils congressional intent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the inmates' attorney, Kenneth Falk of Indianapolis,
countered that the law unconstitutionally makes a federal judge a
congressional ``clerk'' subject to a statutory order that he or she
stop overseeing prisons at the request of state officials.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE BY SPREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wouldn't have to be much more than a pat on the
sleeve of the coach's sports coat. A wink or a nod, while lining up
for the center jump. A pointed finger, after establishing eye
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, forget the finger. Temptation is the last
thing Latrell Sprewell ever needs.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't owe P.J. Carlesimo a modest show of conciliation
Tuesday night when the Golden State Warriors play the Knicks again,
two weeks after Sprewell was a profane spectacle out West. He owes
it to himself because, some day, sooner than he thinks, Sprewell
won't be able to explain away his dearth of accountability, his
lack of compassion, with 30 well-timed points.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about saying ``I'm sorry,'' which Sprewell already
said two years ago after choking Carlesimo during a Warriors
practice. It is about growth, about recognizing another human
being's suffering, primarily because of him. If Sprewell truly
can't see this, I'm not one of those who believes he is getting
away with a thing. I just pity him.
</P>
<P>
   I have known Carlesimo since the mid-1970s, when he coached at
Wagner College, when he made his first splash by taking the small
Staten Island school to the National Invitation Tournament.
Twenty-five years ago, when Bobby Knight was a young coach's role
model, Carlesimo screamed at his players until everyone's ears
ached. I would imagine that three or four years of it had to be
wearing, yet lost in Sprewell's revisionist spin is that he went
for Carlesimo's throat after less than eight weeks. And that his
rationale was fueled, as usual, by his sense of entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a trade, and it wasn't happening fast enough to suit
him. What has he learned? This year, he wanted a contract and blew
off training camp to underscore that it better come fast enough to
suit him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Carlesimo would never have been a very good professional
coach. Sprewell sure made certain that, at Golden State, he
wouldn't get the chance. Carlesimo lost his best player that first
season, and then the Warriors traded the dynamic Sprewell to the
Knicks for players old and flawed. While Sprewell has moved on to
get all he wanted and more than he could hope for, Carlesimo comes
to Madison Square Garden Tuesday night with a nine-game losing
streak, without much chance of getting past Christmas still
employed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, last time, he was the one who made a move to shake hands
with Sprewell, who made believe he didn't see Carlesimo coming.
What's wrong with that picture? With all the good that's happened
to him in the past 10 months, Sprewell somehow managed to be out on
the court for more than two hours, and not for five seconds feel a
pang of sympathy for a man whose principal offense was a grating
workplace personality. That is scary, or an indication that the
whole thing was an act.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I thought the news media's portrayal of Sprewell
bordered on racial typecasting; it was as if all photos and footage
of him without a scowl had suddenly been lost. Keyshawn Johnson of
the Jets is right when he says that race plays a role in the way
people respond to his immature outbursts. Whereas black athletes
are too easily portrayed as angry and disloyal, whites _ including
temperamental coaches like Bill Parcells _ are just being
aggressive and fiery.
</P>
<P>
   At Golden State a couple of weeks ago, Sprewell was none of the
above. He was just a self-aggrandizing boor, playing for a coach
who was terrified to wind up in the same place as Carlesimo.
``Spree handled it badly _ I would have told him it wouldn't have
been selling out to go shake P.J.'s hand,'' Doc Rivers said when he
was in New York coaching Orlando on Thanksgiving weekend, offering
the conscience Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy has conveniently
misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy would never have quietly suffered a similar display
from John Starks. But then, Van Gundy always understood that Starks
had the ability to demonstrate regret, beyond being able to say
``I'm sorry.'' Every response to one of Starks' outbursts, every
ruling, did not become another baseless attack against the martyred
player. That is why Starks could finally understand the Knicks'
thinking in trading him, why bitterness is not obstructing Tuesday
night's Garden homecoming, for which he has promised to kiss the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   If people in the Knicks organization could ever again be honest,
they would admit that Sprewell's continuous defensive lapses, among
other fundamental mistakes, have much to do with his being a player
who is still making up his own rules. Poor Carlesimo. He is still
trying to coach by them.

   AS HOLIDAY CUSTOMS MERGE, THEIR SYMBOLS DO AS WELL
</P>
<P>
   The December holidays have long been a source of angst for many
couples who observe different faiths, and the tug is particularly
acute for Christians and Jews whose seasonal celebrations collide
head on with Christmas and Hanukkah. But many families are now
synthesizing two sets of customs. The marketplace is starting to
respond to this pluralistic view by producing what was once taboo:

U.S. DEPICTS MICROSOFT'S ACTIONS AS PART OF AN ILLEGAL PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government argued forcefully Monday that the court's
findings in the Microsoft case point inevitably to the legal
conclusion that the big software maker repeatedly violated the
nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a 70-page court filing, the justice department and the 19
states suing the Microsoft Corp. enumerated more than a dozen acts
by the company to defend its monopoly in the personal computer
operating systems and to try to extend its dominance into the
market for Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   But the court filing also makes the more ambitious assertion
that the sum of Microsoft's acts should add up to an even greater
legal liability than the individual transgressions one by one.
After noting that ``each of these actions is itself sufficient'' to
be a violation, the government added that ``each exacerbated the
effects of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts found the legal bundling of Microsoft's
purported acts of anticompetitive behavior particularly intriguing
_ especially since the legal brief was filed on the same day that
the two sides gathered in Chicago for a second round of settlement
talks with Richard A. Posner, a federal appellate judge serving as
a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making this pattern of practices argument, the government
is saying that Microsoft is a fundamentally dangerous company and
strongly suggesting that severe sanctions are required,'' said
William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
law school.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions against Microsoft can be imposed by the court, if the
company is found to have violated the law, or by agreement in an
out-of-court settlement. The remedies under consideration by the
justice department and states have ranged broadly from mild ones
like prohibiting Microsoft from imposing certain contract
restrictions to harsh ones like breaking the company up or forcing
it to license its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side will discuss details of the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   The legal brief filed on Monday by the government and states is
their view of what legal conclusions are justified by Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson's findings of fact, which he issued on Nov. 5.
Jackson gave the government a lot to work with in his findings,
saying that Microsoft was a monopoly whose tactics stifled
competition and innovation. The company will get its chance to
respond on Jan. 17, followed by additional briefs from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The justice department and the states cited four categories of
legal claims, but the broadest focused on the many steps Microsoft
took to defend its monopoly. Indeed, many of the major business
decisions Microsoft made during 1995 to 1998 amounted to illegal
acts to protect its monopoly in personal computer operating
systems, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the monopoly protection section of its brief, the government
enumerates 14 anticompetitive acts by Microsoft, especially citing
its contracts and meetings with everyone from Windows-based PC
makers to Apple to Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, such claims became easier for the government to make
because Judge Jackson found Microsoft last month to be a monopoly.
Being a monopoly is not illegal, but the legal standard of
corporate behavior for a monopolist is more circumscribed than for
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   A monopolist, for example, is not supposed to enter into
contracts that ``unreasonably disadvantage a competitor'' _ with
the courts and legal precedent as the guide to just what conduct
crosses that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a monopoly finding, which you do here, the legal
threshold for a violation becomes much easier for the government to
achieve,'' said Richard M. Steuer, a partner in the antitrust
practice at Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays &AMP; Handler, a New York law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts also said the government had deftly tried to
package certain allegations for which the legal standard is more
difficult _ like predatory pricing _ in its monopoly defense claim.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chose to meld its Internet browser with its Windows
operating system and give the browser away. But recent legal cases
have tended not to find price cutting to be illegal unless it can
be shown that the company plans to increase prices later, after a
rival has been driven from the market.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the government repeatedly described Microsoft's
free distribution of browsing software as a ``predatory'' tactic to
harm its main rival in that market, the Netscape Communications
Corp. But Microsoft's predatory campaign, ``for its anticompetitive
effect,'' did not require ``an ability to raise the price of
Internet Explorer in the future,'' the government asserted. ``It
achieved its anticompetitive effect simply by perpetuating
Microsoft's monopoly in the market for another product, the Windows
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Deft legal argument, antitrust experts say, but such reasoning
will certainly be challenged when Microsoft files its own suggested
conclusions of law next month.

HIGH COURT TO WEIGH IF '68 STATUTE STAYS SILENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court will decide whether an obscure
federal law blunts its 33-year-old admonition that police warn
suspects of their right to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case is the continued vitality of the court's
``Miranda warning,'' which has become a staple of law enforcement
agencies and has been made familiar by television crime dramas. The
justices, in a 1966 decision, called for police to tell those they
arrest of the right to remain silent and that anything they say can
and will be used in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the justices' ruling, lower courts have often
refused to admit into evidence incriminating statements by criminal
defendants because they were not advised of their constitutional
right not to talk to police. But that general refusal could change
if the justices decide that a little-known 1968 law supersedes the
Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   That statute, passed by a law-and-order Congress, was meant to
obviate the need for the warning and allow courts to hear
incriminating statements so long as the defendant spoke voluntarily
and with knowledge of their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and other opponents of the law argue
that, if upheld, the statute would lead to the admission of
confessions and other incriminating statements from defendants who
did not fully understand their right not to speak to police.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Dickerson vs. United States, by July.
</P>
<P>
   Bank-robbery suspect Charles Dickerson says police declined to
give him a Miranda warning before he told them that he was driving
the getaway car. Dickerson said fellow suspect, Jimmy Rochester,
gave him a gun, which he put in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police then searched Dickerson's home, where they found the gun
and money allegedly taken from the First Virginia Bank in
Alexandria, Va. Dickerson was then charged with bank robbery,
conspiracy and using a firearm during the January 1997 theft.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, through his attorney, sought to have his statements
to the police prohibited from being used at trial, saying he had
not been told of his right to remain silent. The District Court for
Eastern Virginia agreed, ruling that the statements could not be
used against Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision
in February, citing the federal law and saying that Dickerson knew
his rights and made his statements to the police voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit added that the Miranda warning was not required
under the Constitution but was merely an example the justices gave
of a warning that would pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's reliance on the law was surprising because
U.S. prosecutors had not referred to the statute in urging the
court to allow the gun and money to be used as evidence against
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no Justice Department, from President Lyndon Johnson to
President Clinton, had relied on the federal statute to get a court
to accept into evidence a defendant's incriminating statement given
without a warning. Federal prosecutors have consistently held that
the Miranda warning is a constitutional requirement from which
police and courts are not permitted to deviate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's Justice Department, although urging the justices
to allow Dickerson's prosecution to proceed, is pressing the high
court to state clearly that the Constitution requires police to
provide Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ruling in Miranda's favor would render the federal
statute unconstitutional because Congress has no authority to pass
laws that contradict or relax constitutional mandates.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in its legal brief to the justices, said
that requiring police to warn people of their rights is a
constitutional requirement that has the unfortunate result of
``reliable evidence'' sometimes being suppressed. But such
suppression is an acceptable cost for ensuring that defendants
receive a fair trial, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overruling Miranda _ at this juncture, more than three decades
after it was announced and after law enforcement has accommodated
to its basic requirements _ would ... tend to undermine public
confidence in the fairness of (the criminal justice) system,'' U.S.
Solicitor General Seth Waxman wrote on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law enforcement system depends on citizen cooperation and
support in myriad ways,'' he said. ``Steps that may damage that
confidence should not be taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, despite its call for upholding Miranda,
said prosecutors should still be able to use as evidence at trial
the gun and money they found in Dickerson's apartment. The police
officers had a valid warrant to search for these items, based on
their reasonable suspicion that Dickerson was involved in the bank
robbery, the department argued.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's attorney, James Hundley of Fairfax, Va., countered
that neither the statements nor physical evidence may be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, as interpreted by the high court, requires
that the Miranda warning be given to all arrestees, Hundley argued.
The police officers' failure to warn Dickerson rendered his
statements regarding the gun inadmissible, and the police were
barred from relying on those comments in searching his apartment,
the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley also disputed the 4th Circuit's conclusion that the
Supreme Court intended Miranda to be only an example of a warning
that police must give arrestees, rather than a constitutional
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the high court ruled in Miranda vs. Arizona that police
have a duty to ensure that the people they arrest know they have
the constitutional right not to say anything to law enforcement.
The justices, in that decision, provided guidance for what has
become widely known as the Miranda warning: ``You have the right to
remain silent. If you choose to waive this right, anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning quickly became a fixture among law enforcement
agencies and in the media. Failure by police to provide a warning
has compelled courts to refuse to admit incriminating statements
into evidence, ruling that the testimonials were given by people
who thought they had no choice but to talk to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in the wake of the Miranda decision, passed the
controversial statute. The law allows courts to accept into
evidence ``voluntary'' statements made by arrestees, even if no
warning was given, provided they knew of their right to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Houston criminal defense lawyer Edward Mallett said he hopes the
Supreme Court rules that the Miranda warning is constitutionally
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived with Miranda for a generation now,'' said Mallett,
president-elect of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers. ``The American people believe that Miranda not only is
consistent with the Constitution but is a good rule.''

incriminating statements so long as the defendant spoke voluntarily
and with knowledge of their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and other opponents of the law argue
that, if upheld, the statute would lead to the admission of
confessions and other incriminating statements from defendants who
did not fully understand their right not to speak to police.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Dickerson vs. United States, by July.
</P>
<P>
   Bank-robbery suspect Charles Dickerson says police declined to
give him a Miranda warning before he told them that he was driving
the getaway car. Dickerson said fellow suspect, Jimmy Rochester,
gave him a gun, which he put in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police then searched Dickerson's home, where they found the gun
and money allegedly taken from the First Virginia Bank in
Alexandria, Va. Dickerson was then charged with bank robbery,
conspiracy and using a firearm during the January 1997 theft.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, through his attorney, sought to have his statements
to the police prohibited from being used at trial, saying he had
not been told of his right to remain silent. The District Court for
Eastern Virginia agreed, ruling that the statements could not be
used against Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision
in February, citing the federal law and saying that Dickerson knew
his rights and made his statements to the police voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit added that the Miranda warning was not required
under the Constitution but was merely an example the justices gave
of a warning that would pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's reliance on the law was surprising because
U.S. prosecutors had not referred to the statute in urging the
court to allow the gun and money to be used as evidence against
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no Justice Department, from President Lyndon Johnson to
President Clinton, had relied on the federal statute to get a court
to accept into evidence a defendant's incriminating statement given
without a warning. Federal prosecutors have consistently held that
the Miranda warning is a constitutional requirement from which
police and courts are not permitted to deviate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's Justice Department, although urging the justices
to allow Dickerson's prosecution to proceed, is pressing the high
court to state clearly that the Constitution requires police to
provide Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ruling in Miranda's favor would render the federal
statute unconstitutional because Congress has no authority to pass
laws that contradict or relax constitutional mandates.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in its legal brief to the justices, said
that requiring police to warn people of their rights is a
constitutional requirement that has the unfortunate result of
``reliable evidence'' sometimes being suppressed. But such
suppression is an acceptable cost for ensuring that defendants
receive a fair trial, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overruling Miranda _ at this juncture, more than three decades
after it was announced and after law enforcement has accommodated
to its basic requirements _ would ... tend to undermine public
confidence in the fairness of (the criminal justice) system,'' U.S.
Solicitor General Seth Waxman wrote on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law enforcement system depends on citizen cooperation and
support in myriad ways,'' he said. ``Steps that may damage that
confidence should not be taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, despite its call for upholding Miranda,
said prosecutors should still be able to use as evidence at trial
the gun and money they found in Dickerson's apartment. The police
officers had a valid warrant to search for these items, based on
their reasonable suspicion that Dickerson was involved in the bank
robbery, the department argued.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's attorney, James Hundley of Fairfax, Va., countered
that neither the statements nor physical evidence may be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, as interpreted by the high court, requires
that the Miranda warning be given to all arrestees, Hundley argued.
The police officers' failure to warn Dickerson rendered his
statements regarding the gun inadmissible, and the police were
barred from relying on those comments in searching his apartment,
the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley also disputed the 4th Circuit's conclusion that the
Supreme Court intended Miranda to be only an example of a warning
that police must give arrestees, rather than a constitutional
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the high court ruled in Miranda vs. Arizona that police
have a duty to ensure that the people they arrest know they have
the constitutional right not to say anything to law enforcement.
The justices, in that decision, provided guidance for what has
become widely known as the Miranda warning: ``You have the right to
remain silent. If you choose to waive this right, anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning quickly became a fixture among law enforcement
agencies and in the media. Failure by police to provide a warning
has compelled courts to refuse to admit incriminating statements
into evidence, ruling that the testimonials were given by people
who thought they had no choice but to talk to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in the wake of the Miranda decision, passed the
controversial statute. The law allows courts to accept into
evidence ``voluntary'' statements made by arrestees, even if no
warning was given, provided they knew of their right to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Houston criminal defense lawyer Edward Mallett said he hopes the
Supreme Court rules that the Miranda warning is constitutionally
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived with Miranda for a generation now,'' said Mallett,
president-elect of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers. ``The American people believe that Miranda not only is
consistent with the Constitution but is a good rule.''

 Tech Industry Benefits From WTO Problems  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Technology industry leaders put on a brave face yesterday in
analyzing the outcome of the Seattle summit of the World Trade
Organization.
<P>
   But the bottom line was that they, as with just about everybody
except the guys in ski masks who smashed up shop windows, came away
from the meeting with precious little to show for their months of
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to reach agreement last week in
Seattle,'' said Tim Bennett, senior vice president of the American
Electronics Association, which represents about 3,000 high-tech
heavyweights. ``But it's certainly not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bennett believes the 11th-hour eleventh-hour &LR;   &LR; collapse
of WTO negotiations worked in the tech industry's favor.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was beginning to look on Friday as though many of the
key issues on the industry's agenda were going to be left out of
the guiding declaration issued by the WTO's negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned,'' Bennett said. ``Now we've got
another bite at the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO talks are slated to resume in coming months in Geneva. A
so-called ministerial declaration will emerge from those
discussions, outlining the main points to be addressed in
subsequent trade meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The tech industry hopes this declaration will prominently
feature a continued moratorium on e-commerce taxation. Industry
leaders also hope to expand the range of high-tech products covered
by a separate treaty on tariffs, and to accelerate the speed with
which many of these tariffs are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce tax question is now up in the air. Some say that
the past moratorium expired with the collapse of the Seattle talks
and that any nation is now free to implement its own  &LR; taxes on
electronic retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Others insist that the moratorium remains in effect because,
well, nobody has yet to say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that it's very hard to tax e-commerce, so we're not
going to see governments popping up with tax plans in the next 24
hours,'' said Michael Maibach, vice president of government affairs
for Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, most tech-industry insiders say WTO haggling will
take a back seat to the political slugfest expected to break out on
Capitol Hill over granting China permanent ``normal trade
relations'' status _ a precondition for China becoming a WTO
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``China remains the most important issue for us,'' said Dave
McCurdy, president of the Electronic Industries Alliance, a
confederation of tech and telecom trade groups. ``By far.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little official talk of China in Seattle because last
month's landmark trade accord between Washington and Beijing came
too late for the WTO to take up the matter of China joining the
135-member global trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing first must cut separate deals with the European Union,
Canada and about 20 other nations. And each of these deals then
must be ratified by the concerned countries before the WTO can
weigh in on China's membership.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the United States, the AFL-CIO and other labor
groups, including the California Labor Federation, have said they
will fight hard to prevent China from receiving permanent
most-favored trade status. They cite Beijing's dubious track record
for human rights as well as the threat of increased competition
from low-paid Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
   At a seminar in San Francisco yesterday on investing in China,
Jiang Bo, director of U.S. affairs for Beijing's Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, stressed that things are
changing quickly on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese people don't just want to make shoes and provide
toys,'' he said. ``We want to get into high technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, he said Beijing will continue providing tax breaks and
other incentives to attract overseas tech and telecom companies.
But Jiang emphasized that such companies must be prepared to
compete aggressively for Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, it was very easy to do business in China
because there was no competition,'' he observed. ``Now, American
companies and European companies and other companies are all there.
You must now bring your best products to China. Just investing is
not enough.''

 Alameda Biotech Firm Boosts Gene Therapy  &HT;     By Tom Abate  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A biotech firm in Alameda gave the embattled field of gene therapy
a boost yesterday by reporting that it had restored partial blood
clotting ability in three hemophiliacs by injecting them with an
experimental drug containing the short length of DNA they were born
without.
<P>
   Although Avigen Inc. said it was far too early to proclaim its
treatment a cure, the results it reported at a scientific meeting
in New Orleans were hailed as one of the first successes in more
than 10 years and 300 experiments aimed at fighting disease by
repairing defects in DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very significant that what we're seeing now is the first
hint of effective gene therapy trials,'' said Dr. Estuardo Aguilar,
a gene therapist at Baylor University. Aguilar said that at the
same meeting on Sunday, a European gene therapy group also reported
an early stage success in combatting an immune disease. Still, he
cautioned that both experiments are still early in the drug-testing
process. ``We have yet to see any definitive success stories,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Long hyped as a magic bullet against diseases, gene therapy came
under fire this fall after a healthy patient died after getting an
experimental drug that used a cold virus to deliver DNA into the
subject's cells.
</P>
<P>
   Many gene therapy experiments work by packing a useful pieces of
DNA into a virus and using the bug as delivery vehicle, taking
advantage of the fact that viruses are adept at burrowing into
cells.
</P>
<P>
   A National Institutes of Health advisory committee will meet in
Washington, D.C., tomorrow to look into the reported instances of
deaths during gene therapy trials.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen chief executive John Monahan said his company had used a
different virus than the cold bug now being investigated by the
NIH. Monahan said Avigen's experiments are based on
adeno-associated virus (AAV), a common bug that seems to have no
disease-causing effect in human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Blood clotting normally occurs when two proteins, Factor 8 and
Factor 9, combine to plug leaks. Each of these clotting proteins is
made by a different gene. Hemophiliacs are born without one of the
two genes.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people in the United States have the form of
hemophilia caused by a deficiency in the Factor 9 gene. Avigen's
therapy is aimed at them.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and Stanford
Medical Center, who have been working with Avigen, gave the three
human subjects in the experiment a single shot of the gene therapy
drug six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan said none of the subjects showed any reaction or side
effect from the virus itself. But within two months of receiving
their gene therapy shots, each of the three test patients began to
create detectable amounts of the Factor 9 clotting protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have observed is that the gene has been successfully
delivered and is producing biologically active Factor 9,'' Monahan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen will continue to test its gene therapy in six more human
subjects over the rest of the year, giving each patient a somewhat
higher dose of the drug. The idea is to establish what dose
patients can safely tolerate. Avigen will also be anxious to see
whether higher doses of the gene therapy produce enough Factor 9 to
free hemophiliacs from the need to take expensive protein
supplements every few days to stop uncontrolled bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market for Factor 9 hemophilia remedies is now worth
roughly $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Avigen's stock price has more than quadrupled,
as investors have begun to bet that this tiny Alameda firm might
break the gene therapy jinx and come up with a useful drug.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen's shares rose $4.63 today to close at $35.25 before the
gene therapy news was announced.

 AT&AMP;T Set to Open Its Cables  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
AT&AMP;T yesterday confirmed that it will let other companies market
high-speed Internet access over its cable-video network, but its
vaguely worded statement left critics demanding a clearer
commitment and faster transition to open competition.
<P>
   The communications giant has fought for more than a year to
retain exclusive rights to sell the speedy service to consumers.
But yesterday it said it is prepared to negotiate agreements with
multiple Internet service providers that would let them market
similar services under their own brands. AT&AMP;T pledged not to impose
surcharges that would price competitors out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, however, would not take effect until 2002. Until then,
Internet access over the AT&AMP;T network, the nation's largest, will
be available only through ExciteAtHome, a Redwood City company that
is 58-percent owned by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they say it's the right thing to do and then ask
everybody to wait two years?'' asked Greg Simon, co-director of the
openNET cq &LR;  Coalition, a year-old organization that represents more
than 900 ISPs and technology companies, including America Online,
MCI, GTE, US West and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's apparent change of policy came in a letter to William
Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, signed
by representatives of AT&AMP;T and MindSpring, a large ISP based in
Atlanta. The move came at Kennard's behest, and he applauded it as
``a good first step.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for AOL, by far the nation's largest ISP, also
called yesterday's letter ``a positive first step,'' but noted that
``the devil is in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released from its Washington, D.C., headquarters,
the openNET Coalition pointed out some of the issues the AT&AMP;T
declaration left unresolved, such as whether the company would
treat all ISPs equally and whether it would impose restrictions on
the kinds of services and content ISPs could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without persuasive answers to these questions, this is just a
speech, not a change of policy,'' said Rich Bond, the trade
organization's other co-director.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Nothhaft, CEO of Concentric Networks, a San Jose ISP,
dismissed the AT&AMP;T letter as ``a clever PR move to blunt the
criticism they've been getting from the industry, the public and
even some parts of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a step in the right direction, but a lot more needs
to be done,'' he added. ``The FCC should step in to ensure a level
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Even MindSpring, which co-signed the AT&AMP;T letter, asked the FCC
to step in. In a separate letter to the FCC's Kennard, it said,
``only clear and unambiguous federal policy can make the promise of
this first step real, enforceable and timely.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T became the largest cable provider in the nation and in the
Bay Area when it acquired the former Tele-Communications Inc. last
year. By itself, AT&AMP;T controls less than 25 percent of the cable
market. Yesterday's announcements shed no light on whether the 22
other cable companies that also provide Internet services through
ExciteAtHome, such as Comcast and Cox Communications, will follow
AT&AMP;T's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these companies have exclusive contracts with
ExciteAtHome that remain in effect until as late as 2006, according
to David Pine, vice president and general counsel of ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   That company yesterday announced signing its millionth
one-millionth  &LR; subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing Web content specially tailored to user
with high-speed access, ExciteAtHome owns and manages the equipment
linking the cable networks to the Internet, including 21 regional
data centers and servers at cable company offices.
</P>
<P>
   How much of this infrastructure competitors would have to
duplicate is ``a great question,'' Pine said, acknowledging that
``the details have not been fleshed out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that having each ISP provide its own
equipment would be ``hopelessly complex.'' In the end, he
predicted, competing ISPs will probably pay a fee to his company to
use its infrastructure, as well as one to AT&AMP;T and other cable
providers for the right to transmit data over ``the last mile,''
the cables that go to homes and businesses.

TV-RIGHTS TALKS FOR 2002 WORLD CUP RAISE ETHICS ISSUES IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When Shinji Ono, a star Japanese midfielder, pulls the
first sheet from a drum on Tuesday to kick off the preliminary draw
for soccer's World Cup in 2002, it will be a crowning moment for
Japan's involvement in international sports.
</P>
<P>
   The country has played host to the Olympics three times, and the
fanfare surrounding the draw is intended to set the stage in
glittering fashion for Japan's joint hosting, together with South
Korea, of what is often called the world's most popular sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the painstaking efforts to insure that the event
goes off without a hitch, there is one important element that even
at this relatively late date has not been settled: the rights for
the television broadcast of the games here in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual recriminations have been flying among the Japanese
broadcast companies seeking to buy rights to the games. From their
descriptions of the way the negotiations have been handled, as well
as from documents obtained by The New York Times, a picture emerges
of possible conflicts of interest, noncompetitive deal-making and
deep suspicions of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions and accusations hardly form the face that FIFA,
soccer's international governing body, would have chosen for its
quadrennial showcase.
</P>
<P>
   But taken together, the accounts of participants in the struggle
over television rights in the host country seem to wed the murky
and sometimes secretive relationships that marked past Olympic
bidding scandals with the kinds of collusive commercial practices
that Japan has often been accused of by its trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   At its essence, the breakdown in talks over television rights
here is a dispute over price. Japanese broadcast officials say they
were shocked by initial proposals from ISL Worldwide, the
international sports marketing company that bought global
television rights for the World Cup from FIFA, for 54 billion yen,
or more than $500 million. The price was later reduced to about
$250 million, some broadcast executives say, which would still
represent about a fortyfold increase over the price that Japan's
national public broadcaster, NHK, paid for the rights to broadcast
the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese network executives now say in private that they
would like to negotiate on their own for the rights to the 2002
World Cup, but Japan's major broadcasters responded to ISL's
opening bid by forging a united front last April. Known officially
as the Japan Consortium, the broadcasting group includes the public
broadcasting network, the country's five private television
networks and nearly 200 local stations.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese television executive said the consortium had ``grown
out of friendships over a long period.'' But the articles of
association, which were obtained by The New York Times, often read
more like an underworld pact than a conventional commercial
agreement. Members pledge in the document to restrict broadcasting
rights to consortium partners, to jointly set acquisition fees for
the games, to relinquish the right to make individual bids for
television rights and to adhere to strict confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any member that wants to withdraw from the consortium,
the document says, ``must report its intention to the executive
body, and must have its consent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to consortium members, ISL met once with the group,
noticed that none of its members would offer competing bids or even
speak out of turn, decided that the consortium was essentially a
cartel and refused to negotiate any further.
</P>
<P>
   ISL declined repeated requests for comment on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Seiji Urushido, an executive of Japan's BS Nippon Co., a TV
network, and an officer of the consortium, defended its tactics.
``I know that this is unthinkable in the States,'' he said. ``Three
networks there competed fiercely for the rights to the Olympic
Games. As a result, NBC paid an exorbitant fee, which led to
soaring broadcast rights fees all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically,'' he added, ``Japan doesn't have the luxury to
pay these kinds of prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of what happened next vary widely according to the
participants, but in all versions, Dentsu, the powerful Japanese
advertising agency that has been described as the world's largest,
soon began to play the role of a go-between among Japan's
broadcasters and ISL.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Dentsu presented itself in the Japanese news media
as the agent of the Japan Consortium, and Dentsu officials say that
they succeeded in talking down the asking price for TV rights to
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But many Japanese television executives say that Dentsu's
participation in the negotiations represents a remarkable conflict
of interest. Dentsu owns a 10 percent equity stake in ISL, Dentsu
officials acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Dentsu is said to control one-third of all the advertising on
Japanese television and to enjoy a virtual monopoly on the sale of
ads during prime time, according to ``The Enigma of Japanese
Power'' (Vintage Books), by the Dutch journalist Karel van
Wolferen, a highly regarded recent exploration of contemporary
Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
   The clout that Dentsu exercises over commercial television in
Japan ``is quite unlike any kind of social control through the mass
media anywhere in the world,'' van Wolferen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ISL became concerned enough about the conflict to produce a news
release in September stating that ``in the specific case of the
sale of the television rights of the FIFA World Cup, Dentsu is not
the official representative of ISL.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, as questions about the openness and perhaps even
the legality of the bidding process have been raised, the Japan
Consortium has sought to distance itself from Dentsu. In an
interview, Katsuji Ebisawa, the president of the national public
network, NHK, denied that Dentsu had been officially authorized to
negotiate on behalf of Japan's broadcasting consortium.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   None of this has discouraged Dentsu in its attempts to remain a
central player in the sale of the broadcasting rights, however.
Haruyuki Takahashi, a senior Dentsu executive who has been involved
in the negotiations, said in an interview last week that his
company would continue trying to restart the stalled negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to support both sides, because Dentsu is doing
business with both sides _ with the consortium and with ISL,''
Takahashi said. ``It seems very complicated, because Dentsu has two
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   While these relationships appear to present a conflict of
interest, a Japanese legal expert said that the country's laws on
such conflicts are less stringent than those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether any laws have been broken depends on a number of
details: whether Dentsu was earning a fee for its work, whether
Dentsu has disclosed its role to both sides in negotiation and
whether it has committed any fraudulent act,'' said the lawyer, who
spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, things have become even more complicated.
Although Dentsu has strongly denied it, many Japanese broadcasting
executives say they are afraid that Dentsu has concluded a secret
deal for the purchase of broadcasting rights for the World Cup
games _ apparently without informing the Japanese broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Some broadcast executives now say that the bidding process
should be thrown open and conducted according to international
standards of competition and fairness. Few will say so publicly,
though, because they are sworn to silence by their consortium
agreement and fear retribution from Dentsu and the rest of the
industry if they go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The president of FIFA, Joseph S. Blatter, said in an interview
in Tokyo on Saturday that Japan was the only region of the world in
which the soccer organization still faced broadcasters who form
cartel-like associations, which he called unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The price of soccer broadcasts has increased dramatically but
reasonably, he contended, because of an explosion of interest in
the sport and the proliferation of television stations and cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Dentsu had represented itself as a negotiator on
behalf of Japanese television broadcasters, Blatter said, ``There
is something wrong there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is most unusual, and not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Urushido, the BS Nippon executive who is a member of the
consortium, scoffed at the notion that excessive coercion was at
work. ``The normal definition of a cartel is to keep a price high
and to inflict damage on the consumer,'' Urushido said. ``What we
are doing has the opposite purpose, so I don't think it is right to
call us a cartel. It would be misleading to focus on the punitive
elements here.'' &QL;

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Nasdaq-100 Trust a Wise Choice 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
I am advising my cousin on his investment portfolio and would like
some help. He plans to retire in 10 years, and much of his
retirement income will come from defined-benefit pension plans. I
have urged him to jazz up his portfolio by investing a small amount
of money in the Nasdaq 100 index and to hold on forever. But what
is the best way to do this while minimizing taxes? We are looking
at two investment choices: the Rydex OTC mutual fund and the
Nasdaq-100 Trust.
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Rydex OTC, a mutual fund managed by Padco Advisors Inc., and the
Nasdaq-100 Trust, which trades as a stock on the American Stock
Exchange (symbol: QQQ), should produce virtually identical
investment performances, because both track the Nasdaq 100 index.
</P>
<P>
   The index is composed of 100 of the largest over-the-counter
stocks, with about 70 percent of its value in high technology. Tech
stocks have been white-hot lately, and the index carved out a
fantastic 62 percent gain through the first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But notwithstanding its strong upward bias, the Nasdaq 100 has
its bad days. Single-day drops of 2 percent to 4 percent are all
too common. Make sure your cousin can live with that kind of
volatility before he takes the plunge. Also, remind him that the
Nasdaq 100's upward march could end someday _ but don't ask me
when.
</P>
<P>
   Rydex OTC is a no-load fund _ meaning that you can buy shares in
it without paying a sales commission. However, according to
Morningstar Inc., which provides information on financial services,
the Rydex fund charges its shareholders management fees and
expenses equal to 1.15 percent of their assets per year. That is on
the high side for index funds, which are passively managed.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq-100 Trust charges a substantially smaller management
fee _ less than 0.2 percent of assets per year. However, you have
to pay a brokerage commission to buy the stock. If you use a
discount broker who charges $10 per trade, the commission will
amount to 1 percent on a $1,000 purchase, or 0.1 percent on a
$10,000 purchase.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the lower management fee, year after year, seems to
give the Nasdaq-100 Trust an edge over the mutual fund, even though
you must pay that modest, one-time commission to buy the trust
shares.
</P>
<P>
   As for taxes, here, too, the Nasdaq-100 Trust has an edge. If
vast numbers of Rydex OTC shareholders were to sell back their
shares, the mutual fund might be forced to liquidate some of its
holdings to meet the demand for cash. This could happen, for
example, after a market crash or during a prolonged market
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   If it did happen, the fund would be required to distribute
capital gains generated by these sales to the remaining
shareholders. Those shareholders would then have to pay
capital-gains taxes on the money they receive.
</P>
<P>
   This won't happen with the Nasdaq-100 Trust, because it is
structured like a closed-end fund. When shareholders want to bail
out, they simply sell their stock to other investors through the
Amex, rather than redeeming them through the trust itself. Even if
every current shareholder sold at the same time, there would be no
liquidation of assets by the trust.
</P>
<P>
   So, if your cousin were to ``hold on forever,'' he wouldn't pay
taxes on any gains in the value of his Nasdaq-100 Trust holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Oracle Spin-Off
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read an article about a new company tied to Oracle Corp.,
called Network Computing, which plans to sell a network computer
for $199. I would like to learn more about the company but can't
find any further information. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You must be referring to a former Oracle subsidiary called
Network Computer, which was spun off last July as a separate,
publicly held company with a new name _ Liberate Technologies. The
name change explains why you are finding it tough to do the
research.
</P>
<P>
   Liberate is based in San Carlos, and its stock (Nasdaq symbol:
LBRT) recently was trading around $170 per share _ more than 10
times the initial public offering price! It boasts a total market
value of more than $7 billion. All this despite the fact that the
company has never turned a profit. It lost more than $10 million in
the latest quarter on piddling revenues of slightly more than $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial fact you should know: The company has shifted away
from network computers, which are not turning out to be the hot
product envisioned by Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. Its new
emphasis is Internet-access appliances. It produces software for
telephones, TV set-top boxes, game consoles and the like.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still interested, you can research Liberate as you
would any other publicly held company. For a start, take a look at
its Web site: www.liberate.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Window on a Portfolio
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a free Web site where I can enter a list of my
mutual funds and the portfolio will be analyzed by sector and/or
market capitalization?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The best I know of is the ``Portfolio Monitor'' provided by
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com). Morningstar specializes in the
analysis of mutual funds, but also invites you to enter information
about stocks you own.
</P>
<P>
   You can then analyze your portfolio in various useful ways,
including by asset class (U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, bonds,
cash), price-earnings ratio, ratio of price to book value, and _
yes _ sector (also known as industry) and market cap.
</P>
<P>
   All this analysis is provided free, although you have to
register on the Web site, disclosing your name, ZIP code and e-mail
address. Morningstar also offers a premium portfolio service,
allowing you to analyze more deeply. But that will cost you $9.95
per month.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Two New Books See Remarkable Stock Market Growth  
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Go to your local bookstore and you will see it prominently
displayed: ``Dow 36,000,'' a recently published book with a flashy
gold, black and white cover.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Dow Jones industrial average trading around 11,000, you
have to feel energized by that title if you own stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look around a bit more, you will find another new
book (with a still-flashier green, purple, black and white cover)
that bears an even more exhilarating title _ ``Dow 100,000: Fact or
Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about one-upmanship! This is 64,000-upmanship!
</P>
<P>
   If you are a wild-eyed optimist, you might be tempted to buy the
Dow 100,000 book and spurn the Dow 36,000 book.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its electrifying title, ``Dow 100,000'' is an
unsurprising, run-of-the-mill investment treatise.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Charles W. Kadlec, an investment strategist with
J.&AMP;W. Seligman &AMP; Co., predicts that the Dow will reach 100,000 in
21 years if certain political, social and economic conditions
remain favorable.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to an average annual gain of about 11 percent
_ not bad by historical standards, but less impressive than the
previous 21-year period _ 1978 to the present _ when the Dow rose
by an average of 13 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   It will reach the 100,000 mark, Kadlec calculates, if tax rates
remain reasonable, currencies remain stable, &LR;  and trade is
permitted to flow freely across international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow will be less vibrant if taxes shoot up, the world
suffers a currency crisis or the United States imposes severe trade
restrictions on economically important adversaries such as China.
</P>
<P>
   Kadlec also informs us that you can kiss Dow 100,000 goodbye if
the United States gets bogged down in a war or suffers germ-warfare
attacks from terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Duh.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dow 36,000'' book is by far the more radical _ and
fascinating _ because its authors _ James K. Glassman and Kevin A.
Hassett _ insist that 36,000 is where the blue-chip indicator
should be now. That's right: They think it has the potential to
more than triple overnight.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like headline-grabbing sensationalism, but the
scholarly and punctilious authors make a persuasive case. The
reasoning and some of the mathematics can be tough to follow at
times, but, by and large, the book is highly readable and witty.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett are colleagues at the American Enterprise
Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman has also held numerous, high-visibility jobs in
publishing and writes a financial column for Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
   The basic premise of the book is that investors historically
have valued stocks too low because they were afraid of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the pall cast by the 1929 crash; or the long,
grinding 1973-74 bear market; or the 1987 crash _ or all of the &LR; 
above  &LR; these and more. In any case, investors have perennially
considered stocks more risky than other investments _ in
particular, bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett concede that stocks may be risky over short
periods, but they stridently insist that, in the long run, stocks
are no more risky than any other investments _ even U.S.
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   If you hold on long enough to a diversified portfolio, they
observe, stocks will be ``steady winners through thick and thin.''
They cite research going back to 1802 indicating that there never
has been a period as long as 17 years when stocks have failed to
rise in value, even after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there have been numerous 17-year periods when bonds
have produced negative returns.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you had invested $10,000 in the market averages the day
before the October 1929 crash, your holdings _ including
reinvestment of dividends _ would have grown to $93,000 by 1960,
$999,000 by 1985 and $8.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In view of that record, the authors say, investors should have
no qualms about buying stocks _ and paying a lot more for them than
they do now. Yet the fear of stocks persists, causing their prices
to remain unwarrantedly low.
</P>
<P>
   To bring stock returns in line with other investments, the
authors note, the price-earnings (PE) ratios of stocks would have
to rise sharply. The authors figure that, based on their estimates
of future earnings, dividend growth, inflation and interest rates,
an average PE ratio of roughly 100 would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow now selling at a PE of around 24, it seems clear
that not all investors agree with the Glassman-Hassett appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors point out that the average PE for the Dow over
many decades was only 15, so investors by and large must be getting
more savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment professionals have issued dire warnings about
the big jump in PEs, particularly during the raging-bull market of
the past five years, describing it as a mania, &LR;  or a speculative
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett say just the opposite _ that the surge in
PEs is a sign of wisdom, not lunacy. ``The idea that a historic PE
ratio acts as a ceiling on stock prices is nonsense if stocks have
perennially been undervalued,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, the higher PEs indicate that today's investors
are wisely recognizing that stocks aren't as risky as yesterday's
investors thought, and that the stocks are worth more than they now
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are paying more for stocks because they have come to
realize that they don't need as great a ``risk premium'' _ that is,
a price discount _ as they demanded in the past. When everyone
catches on, the authors figure, the risk premium will disappear and
the PE will finally reach 100.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman and Hassett have taken a lot of flak from economists,
investment professionals and the press for their theory, which they
first broached last year in an article in the Wall Street Journal.
With the publication of their book, the attacks have accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management in
San Francisco, says Glassman and Hassett seem overly optimistic
about the relative safety of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be an extended period when stocks suffer more than
bonds,'' Schlossberg observes. ``There was a period in the late
'60s and early '70s when stocks badly underperformed other types of
assets. There is nothing to say that this sort of thing couldn't go
on for a longer period of time in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While investors are cheerfully paying higher price-earnings
multiples than before, Schlossberg adds, that doesn't necessarily
signify a sea change for the market in general.
</P>
<P>
   The high PEs are ``centering increasingly on
large-capitalization technology stocks,'' he notes. ``There is a
disparity between those and the rest of the stocks in the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Goldman, investment strategist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son in
St. Louis, concedes that annual investment returns from stocks
appear to have moved up more or less permanently, thanks to a
strengthening world economy and a rapidly rising ``global demand
for common stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures that the market averages will rise 14 percent
annually _ dividends included _ in the foreseeable future, well
above their long-term historical rate of 10 or 11 percent. He sees
the Dow reaching 22,000 _ about double its present level _ by 2006.
But, ``I have trouble with 36,000 anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In a high-powered attack in the December 5 issue of Fortune,
economist Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
argues that stocks have not been risky in the past precisely
because ``historically, people have been very cautious about buying
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``the average return on stocks was high and ...
small changes in expectations about growth or interest rates didn't
move valuations all that much.''
</P>
<P>
   But if investors ``start buying stocks based on the belief that
they are not risky at all, that belief will turn into a
self-defeating prophecy: The new valuations will be very unstable,
swinging widely with the slightest bit of news.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Glassman and Hassett to respond to Krugman's article.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman notes that their thesis assumes that earnings and
dividends will grow at an annual rate of 2 percent above the
inflation rate and that this assumption is ``extremely cautious and
conservative.'' Going back a half-century, the margin above
inflation has been in the 2.9 percent to 3.3 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   As for volatility, Hassett makes the point that as people come
to ``understand'' stocks better, stock prices might be expected to
become ''more stable than today _ less volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will know for certain whether Glassman and Hassett are on
the right track until that glorious day when the Dow does indeed
finally surpass 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, perhaps?

<P>
   UNDATED _ Irvin Knudson was alert, even after two heart attacks.
But he was also 92 years old. Twice, Dr. Manucher Nazarian refused
to do the surgery. The ethics committee at Harris Methodist Fort
Worth also discussed the case. Finally, Nazarian tried what he
considered Knudson's only surgical option, a double bypass
performed while Knudson's heart was still beating. Nazarian is
considered one of the local pioneers of the innovative and still
somewhat controversial surgery, which avoids the use of a
heart-lung machine. Two weeks ago, Knudson and his 85-year-old wife
returned to their Eastside home, where he hopes to soon be back in
his garden. By CHARLOTTE HUFF. Story will move in ``a'' general

embracing Christmas even though the holiday was back in favor after
Oliver Cromwell (who had banned Christmas) was overthrown by Henry
II. Dickens wrote the prequel to ``A Christmas Carol'' in ``The
Pickwick Papers,'' a series of short stories that earned him
acclaim. In 1843, he reprised his short story _ ``The Story of the
Goblins Who Stole a Sexton'' _ keeping the same theme but changing
the names. One of his protagonists was Ebenezer Scrooge, a
mean-spirited old man who comes to love Christmas. ``A Christmas
Carol'' remains as popular today as it was more than 150 years ago.

AT COKE, SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT STYLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COKE-INVESTER) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug is gone. Long live Doug. And don't confuse the two.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Ivester and Douglas Daft _ the outgoing and incoming
chief executives of Coca-Cola respectively _ share a name and have
worked together closely during their combined 50 years at the
company. Still, their resumes and styles vary greatly, people who
follow the company said on Monday, and those differences indicate
that the public face on one of the best-known brands will change
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who abruptly announced his resignation Monday after
more than a year of disappointing results, grew up in Georgia and
spent almost his entire career working out of Coke's Atlanta
headquarters. His background is in finance and while he has a deep
understanding of the company's far-flung businesses, he had spent
relatively few years running any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, who is 56, joined the company in his native Australia in
1969 and next April will become the first person who is not a U.S.
citizen to run Coke. He has worked in Sydney, Australia; Hong Kong;
Tokyo; and Atlanta, running one division after another but never
overseeing any part of the company's North and Latin American
businesses, which account for 55 percent of cases sold.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest difference is in their personalities,
observers said. While Ivester is an intense former accountant,
people who know Daft speak of his sense of humor before almost any
other trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a conversation with him at a dinner party'' about
matters other than ``concentrate shipments in Zimbabwe,'' said
Peter Sealey, a former Coke executive.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Daft reminds some of Donald Keough, the former Coke
president who was the longtime deputy to Ivester's predecessor, the
late Roberto Goizueta. Both have a knack for making others feel
comfortable even during difficult conversations, a skill that could
serve Daft well as he faces sometimes hostile foreign government
officials and bottling executives.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester never appointed a second-in-command, a sore point among
many analysts and investors. Instead, he kept in frequent contact
with the presidents of Coke divisions. In fact, in an interview
last year, Daft said he would leave Ivester as many as six
voice-mail messages a day while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts credit Daft with smartly leading a diverse region and
helping to establish Coke as a brand that only McDonald's rivals in
terms of worldwide recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said that
Daft diversified Coke's business in Japan from virtually all
carbonated soft drinks to one that is almost equally split among
colas, bottled coffee and bottled tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug has been largely responsible for making sure the company
has been nimble and responsive,'' said John Sicher, the editor of
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his tenure has not been free of trouble. Coke has
struggled in India, and its market share in the Middle East and
East Asia is lower than in Europe, Latin America or Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Daft's experience in operations probably
helped him against his two closest competitors for the job, James
Chestnut and Jack Stahl, who like Ivester rose through Coke's
financial group.
</P>
<P>
   A fly fisherman and skier, Daft majored in mathematics at the
University of New England in Australia. He and his wife have two
children.

   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Saying it would be irresponsible and
dishonest for any presidential candidate to take a ``no new taxes''
pledge, former Sen. Bill Bradley refused Monday to rule out raising
taxes to pay for his plan to make health insurance available to
almost every American.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, said he did not think a tax increase would be necessary
to pay for the $65-billion-a-year proposal because of the nation's
robust economy and the projected $1 trillion surplus, which he
contends is large enough to finance the plan over the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's lone rival for the Democratic
nomination, has been steadily attacking Bradley's health care plan
as too expensive, and last weekend he began criticized Bradley for
leaving open the option of paying for the plan by raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being dishonest in saying that I want to raise taxes,''
Bradley said Monday in an interview. ``I haven't proposed raising
new taxes. I'm not proposing raising taxes.'' But, he added,
``Nobody can predict the future of a trillion dollar economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also defied Gore to take a no-new-taxes pledge himself,
suggesting that it would be totally disingenuousness for him to do
so. To bolster his point, he noted that Bill Clinton effectively
attacked George Bush's famous 1988 promise of, ``Read my lips: No
new taxes.'' Bush later supported raising taxes to close a budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill Clinton ran in 1992, he said it would be
irresponsible to take a no new taxes pledge,'' Bradley continued.
``I am not taking the no new taxes pledge, and neither is the vice
president. So we have the same position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is, you be honest with the American people,'' he
continued. ``If you think you cannot predict the future, then it
would be irresponsible to say, no new taxes. But he thinks if you
utter the word, somehow or other it's bad politics. I think people
respect honesty. And think that's the difference. And I truly thing
that people are really tired of politicians who only tell them part
of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said Monday, ``Vice
President Gore has ruled out raising taxes to pay for his programs
barring some drastic change in the economy.'' He said that was a
``far cry from what Bradley says,'' asserting that Bradley seemed
willing to raise taxes even if the economy is not in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley denied that Monday. He said that Gore was making a
mistake in being willing to raise taxes to finance programs during
an economic downturn, asserting that recessions are the best time
to cut tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't raise taxes in bad economic times,'' Bradley said.
``That's when you cut taxes. Raising taxes in dire economic times
makes the economy worse. That's when you put money in people's
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley tried to turn Gore's latest attack on its head, saying
that the vice president was resorting to the ``ultimate
conventional approach to politics'' by being negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the old politics,'' Bradley said. ``If you don't have
confidence in your own positive vision you attack somebody else.
And you try to do that as often as you can. That's what the name of
the game is. I think people are fed up with it. They've been fed up
with it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president launched his latest attack in reaction to
remarks Bradley made to the Washington Post last week about his
health care plan. In that interview, Bradley was asked if he would
consider raising taxes to pay for the plan. Bradley said it would
depend on the health of the economy. He said he would consider it
only after other options had been reviewed, including closing tax
loopholes and reducing federal subsidies for certain industries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seized on that opening in an interview with the Post on
Saturday, saying, ``I'm talking about tax cuts, Senator Bradley is
talking about tax increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Gore campaign accused Bradley of making
contradictory and confusing statements about taxes and the economy.
``Senator Bill Bradley's zigs and zags over the past few weeks
raise questions about his steadiness as a possible steward of the
American economy,'' said Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, had also leaped into the fraying, asserted that anyone
who refuses to rule out tax increases is likely to increase taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Told of that remark, Bradley said Monday, ``Tell him to ask
George Bush,'' referring to the former president. After pausing, he
turned the remark toward Bush's son, the Republican presidential
candidate: ``Tell him ask George W. Bush to take a no new taxes
pledge.''

 GOODBYE TO A ROSE THAT THRIVED IN EVERY CLIMATE  &HT;     By MIKE WEISS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Right to the end, which came Saturday in
Stanford hospital, Rose Bird kept her sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The friend who persuaded her to enter the hospital, a
neurologist, was surprised to hear that she was 63. ``I thought you
were much younger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So did I,'' she shot back.
</P>
<P>
   You needed a sense of humor to be Rose Bird. She was one of the
great Californians of the century, probably among the least
understood, and undoubtedly one of the most vilified.
</P>
<P>
   You would have thought she had committed murder herself, rather
than defended a principle: her belief that it's unconstitutional
for the state to put anyone to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as she lived,'' said her friend and neighbor Harriet
Pedersen, ``she was always receiving death threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Harriet Pedersen, I was also Rose's neighbor. Rose lived
about three blocks from me in a cottage at the end of a cul-de-sac
alongside Matadero Creek in Palo Alto, Calif. I got to know her two
years ago when I wrote a column about her.
</P>
<P>
   The column told how a tallish lady in a hat and sunglasses
showed up at a community law project in East Palo Alto and
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   She said her name was Miss Bird. The people at the center knew
her type, or so they thought: a do-gooder, with no real world
experience. They put Miss Bird to work photocopying and filing.
</P>
<P>
   The young lawyers going about their business paid scant
attention to Miss Bird, who proved willing to do whatever was asked
of her.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, clinic director Shauna Marshall, who had been
inspired by Rose Bird's pioneering opinions in law school,
discovered who had been doing her filing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rose made it easier for Shauna Marshall. She had that
natural grace that puts people at ease. I know, because after the
column appeared I received a phone call from her out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mentioned in your column that you're a neighbor of mine.
Why don't you come over for brunch?'' she said. ``But as a
neighbor, not as a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I accepted the invitation. We ate in her garden,
which was enclosed by a white picket fence and aflame with the
roses she loved to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   She talked about her long battle with breast cancer, her
impatience with doctors and especially the health care industry and
its greed.
</P>
<P>
   It shocked her that when her right-wing enemies recalled her and
two colleagues from the California Supreme Court in 1986, the
attacks on her were personal. She had refused to uphold a single
death penalty because, as a matter of constitutional law, she
thought it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that the consequences of the attacks by
conservatives such as Pete Wilson, and big business, were not
psychologically brutal. She stood for ideas; her opponents wanted
to vanquish a person. And a person they knew almost nothing about.
They made her into a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to be a pariah. But politically speaking, she
lived in a cowardly age without ever succumbing.
</P>
<P>
   She talked all the time to Jerry Brown, who as governor had
appointed her as  &LR; chief justice, but when I asked her whether she
would participate in his campaign for mayor of Oakland, she said:
``I can't. Being associated with me would hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the person who knew her best was her friend Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Frank doesn't want his last name in the newspaper. ``I'm just
Frank the hairdresser,'' he said Sunday. Frank was at Rose's house
when we talked Sunday afternoon, to walk her beloved Australian
terrier, Miss Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   Frank had been unable to keep his last promise to his dearest
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want the hospital to be her final destination,''
Frank said. ``I told her, don't worry, I'm not taking you to your
grave. You'll make one last headline: `Rose Bird Kidnapped From
Hospital by Hairdresser.''`
</P>
<P>
   After she had been driven off the high court, her life became
more than private. She made herself obscure. Some said she went
into hiding, but that wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hid in plain sight,'' Frank said. ``She went about her
business. She was in and out of every store in Palo Alto. She was
not a recluse, not living on the fringes.''
</P>
<P>
   She went to the opera. She participated in Death Penalty Focus,
an organization opposed to capital punishment. She visited with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of her friends and admirers thought there was
something sad about Rose. But not Frank, who knew her best.
</P>
<P>
   She was fierce about her privacy, he said, ``but it wasn't that
Rose didn't have anyone _ she had everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   I would see Rose occasionally in the early morning as she was on
her way to swim, and she always stopped to talk. She told me about
stories she thought I should write, stories about injustice done,
especially to people of color.
</P>
<P>
   She was a woman of great kindness, with a generous spirit, an
indomitable will, an integrity that never faltered. Her friend the
law professor, Gerald Uelman, called her ``one of the most
courageous people I ever met. She endured a lot with grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was a glorious autumn day, and early in the morning I
walked to Rose's house to pay my respects. I walked beneath trees
in shades of amber and gold and burnt orange, under a clear blue
sky.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about how on the day when the great but often
maligned U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas died, the
tallest Douglas fir tree in his native state of Minnesota tumbled
to its death, too.
</P>
<P>
   I half-expected to see her beloved rose bushes withered and
gone. Instead, her favorites, the delicate white-pink flowers
called Simplicity, were in full bloom in December. Great jurists
live and die. Great spirits bloom forever.

RESEARCHERS CLAIM TO HAVE BROKEN PRIVACY CODE FOR WIRELESS PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)  (mk) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two Israeli researchers say they have found an
efficient way to crack the encryption scheme that protects the
privacy of conversations and data transmissions over a type of
wireless phone used by more than 215 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The encryption method, known as A5/1, is part of the GSM
wireless phone standard. Although not dominant in the United
States, GSM is the world's most widely used cellular technology. It
is employed in more than 215 million digital phones worldwide,
including about 5 million in the United States and more than 100
million in Europe. Analog cellular phones do not encrypt
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cell phones in the United States are based on a
variety of other wireless technologies, but a number of American
cellular phone companies, including Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC
Communications Inc., and Omnipoint Corp., use the GSM standard.
</P>
<P>
   Although the finding was not formally announced, it was
confirmed Monday by one of the researchers after word spread
quickly among encryption experts on Internet mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Omnipoint on Monday called the researchers'
claims ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're describing is an academic exercise that would
never work in the real world,'' said the spokesman, Terry Phillips.
``What's more, it doesn't take into account the fact that GSM calls
shift frequency continually, so even if they broke into a call, a
second later it would shift to another frequency, and they'd lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Wagner, a computer security researcher at the
University of California at Berkeley, insisted the discovery was
significant. ``This is big,'' he said. ``I don't think that the
frequency hopping will be a major barrier.'' He added that it put
the interception of GSM calls ``within the reach of corporate
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer security researchers continually attempt to break
cryptographic codes because the measure of any code-scrambling
scheme is how much time and computing power are needed to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   While cell phone encryption has been cracked before, the new
method is significant because it requires very little computer
power; an eavesdropper with just a PC could break into a
conversation in less than a second, its developers said.
</P>
<P>
   Several schemes for attacking the GSM algorithms have been
announced before, but most were impractical, requiring several
hours and a network of computers to intercept a single
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Wagner and Ian Goldberg, also at U.C.-Berkeley, and
Marc Briceno, of Smart Card Developers Association, demonstrated
that they could crack a different encryption method associated with
GSM in a matter of hours on a single PC. That technology prevents
detecting a phone's number and ``cloning'' it in another phone to
bill calls fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their research, they discovered that the A5/1
algorithm used keys that were much shorter than advertised,
prompting speculation that the algorithm had been deliberately
weakened to allow for government eavesdropping. The underlying
algorithms in GSM's encryption design are thought to have
originated from the German or French military, industry
cryptographic experts said. GSM stands for Groupe Speciale Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Wagner, Goldberg and Briceno announced a method for
breaking into calls protected by weak versions of the A5/1
algorithm used in parts of Asia and Australia. Their method could
break into a conversation in a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers who discovered the latest method are Alex
Biryukov and Adi Shamir of The Weizmann Institute in Rehovot,
Israel. The men said they were able to break the code on a PC with
128 megabytes of RAM and two 73 gigabyte hard disks. The PC is used
to analyze the output of the A5/1 algorithm in the first two
minutes of the conversation. Once that data is gathered, the
eavesdropper can listen to the rest of the conversation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the new cracking method requires resources not
available to most individuals. Before intercepting telephone
conversations, the eavesdropper must perform a one-time data
preparation stage that demands significant computing power, but
after the data is prepared once, all GSM-protected conversations
are accessible, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The eavesdropper must also have access to a digital scanner, a
device that can intercept wireless calls within a radius of several
miles. Such devices cost thousands of dollars and are illegal in
the United States.

 &HT;    Board leader praises Ivester
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most Coca-Cola directors were reluctant to talk about
Douglas Ivester's planned departure.
</P>
<P>
   The only director contacted who was willing to talk was James B.
Williams, former chief executive of SunTrust Banks. Williams is
chairman of the Coca-Cola board's finance committee, and he also
serves on its executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how much I think of Doug,'' Williams said Monday.
``I've always supported Doug's decisions. And to the best of my
knowledge, he's never made a bad decision. He knows what he's
doing, and I'm supporting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other directors contacted referred calls to Coca-Cola Co. or to
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Ivester lived, breathed and drank Coca-Cola Co. An
admitted workaholic, Ivester often would be the first one in the
office and the last one to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves the Coca-Cola Co. No question about that,'' Williams
said. ``It's still everything to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester had been groomed to be the long-term chief executive
officer of company following the death of Roberto C. Goizueta in
October 1997. He had been anointed successor of the company by
Goizueta himself, a nod that carried a great deal of weight on the
board. After being entrusted with the company's future by the
board, why would Ivester retire?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug doesn't let people down,'' said Williams, who declined to
answer specific questions as to how Ivester's plans to retire came
about.
</P>
<P>
   Charles H. ``Pete'' McTier, president of the Robert W. Woodruff
Foundation, which has most of its wealth in Coca-Cola stock, called
the Ivester's decision a personal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but the highest admiration for Doug Ivester and
his leadership,'' McTier said. ``Mr. Ivester has contributed
enormously to the success of the Coca-Cola Co. over the past two
decades. The company is in terrific shape. His successor, Doug
Daft, will handle the transition of leadership flawlessly.''

MARS EXPLORATION FAILURES WILL BE FELT AT NASA

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The almost certain loss of the Mars Polar
Lander has thrown NASA's faster, better, cheaper strategy of
exploring the Red Planet into disarray with some experts
questioning whether the agency is attempting too much with too
little.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander has been silent since it was to land on the
Martian south pole Friday. Its seeming demise follows the Sept. 23
loss of NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, a small weather satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency invested $371 million to develop, launch and
operate the two missions, which were to work in concert to help
scientists determine whether water once flowed across the now arid
surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Landers and orbiters are slated for launchings in 2001, 2003 and
2005. The two later missions are to robotically gather samples of
Martian soil and rock and return them to Earth in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the similarity of the designs in the 1998 (Polar
Lander) and 2001 landers, if the '98 lander were lost, that will
surely have an impact on what we are going to do,'' said Carl
Pilcher, NASA's director of solar system exploration. ``But it's
impossible to say now what that impact will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The space agency announced a more aggressive, lower-cost program
of Mars exploration in 1993 after the loss of its $1 billion Mars
Observer, the first American probe dispatched to the planet in 17
years. Lost as it neared its destination, the Mars Observer
included all of the instruments later divided between the smaller
Global Surveyor and Climate Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   A change in approach, outlined by NASA administrator Dan Goldin,
was to increase the frequency of the missions by lowering their
cost and cutting their development times.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe, though, that NASA has been forced to carry the
strategy too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea that we should be flying more at less cost per
missions is basically sound,'' said John Pike, director of space
policy for the independent Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hope they will take the opportunity to make a little
mid-course correction with cheaper, better, faster,'' Pike said.
``I don't see any problem that couldn't be fixed with an extra few
hundred million dollars. As long as they are trying to do things on
the cheap rather than just cheaper, you run the risk that simple
problems will slip through the system and all the money will go to
waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Polar Lander and Climate Orbiter were the latest salvo in a
succession of low-cost missions begun in 1996. They included the
successful $262 million Mars Pathfinder mission that reached the
surface of the planet with a small robotic rover on July 4, 1997.
The $247 million Mars Global Surveyor has been circling the planet
since late 1997 photographing the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, NASA lost contact with its Climate Orbiter probe
as it maneuvered into Martian orbit. Investigators quickly tracked
the cause to navigational errors attributed to a mix-up between
NASA and its contractor, Lockheed Martin, over the use of English
and metric units of force to calculate maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into the Climate Orbiter mishap identified a
list of contributing causes, many of them linked to inadequate
staffing and poor communication among development, navigation and
spacecraft operations teams. It found that flight control teams
were not thoroughly familiar with design limitations on the
spacecraft, and it questioned the wisdom of operations teams
attempting to manage the inflight activities of the Global
Surveyor, Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading to the Climate Orbiter's arrival at Mars,
NASA was battling a surprise decision by congressional
appropriators to cut the agency's 2000 budget by more than $1
billion. Warning the cuts would devastate his scaled-back Mars
program and other initiatives, Goldin managed to stave off the
threat in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they do these projects needs to be carefully examined,
but I don't think it's a basic indictment,'' said Louis Friedman, a
scientist and the executive director of The Planetary Society, the
Pasadena, Calif.-based non-profit pro-space organization started by
the late Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Mars missions really push the envelope. They try to do
as much as they can for the buck, which is laudable,'' said
Friedman. ``But if it risks the safety of a mission, maybe it's not
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he points to the Polar Lander team's decision to
exclude a transmitter on the probe that could have kept signals
streaming to Earth during the descent and landing. As planned by
mission managers, the transmissions stopped about 12 minutes before
the landing so the spacecraft could assume a protective posture for
its high-velocity descent.
</P>
<P>
   The signals were supposed to resume when the Polar Lander was
safely on the surface, generating electrical power and preparing to
photograph its surroundings. When the signals never came, it raised
the question of whether the Polar Lander and the attached Deep
Space 2 probes ever separated from the rocket stage that delivered
them from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Functioning much in the role of the ``black box'' that
investigators attempt to recover after an airline crash, even
limited transmissions from the descent could have revealed what
really happened to the Polar Lander, allowing those involved in the
development of future missions to correct a design flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Polar lander engineers say they elected to dispense with such a
transmitter because they could not have responded even had they
received a hint of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black box is important to everyone but those on the
airplane,'' said Friedman. ``I think that's the way the people on
this project felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Early flight control teams at the agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory hoped to hear signals from a backup transmitter on Polar
Lander. The spacecraft and its two soft-ball sized companion probes
have not been heard from since Friday, when they were to begin
their descent to the planet's south pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pretty much reached the point where we've used up our
final silver bullets,'' NASA's Richard Cook, the Polar Lander's
project manager, said Monday. He characterized the sixth attempt to
communicate with the probe since it failed to make a post-landing
transmission on Friday as the ``last high-probability attempt we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Though less intensive efforts to locate the squat lander will
continue for several more weeks, the odds get longer that the
spacecraft survived its descent before sustaining multiple failures
of computer and communications equipment. Battery power on the Deep
Space 2 companion probes likely exhausted Monday, the space agency
said.

INDUSTRY GROWTH IS GOOD FOR 1999; FORECAST FOR 2000: MORE OF THE
SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How upbeat are the two leading forecasters of
advertising spending about the prospects for the marketing and
media industries in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   At a conference Monday, they almost warbled a medley of ``Blue
Skies'' and ``Cockeyed Optimist'' in outlining their predictions
for strong, sustained growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe that was an exaggeration. But unusually rosy glows
permeated the presentations of Robert J. Coen, senior vice
president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York,
and John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media in
London, at the opening session of the 27th annual PaineWebber Media
Conference. The conference, in Manhattan, continues through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fluctuations of ad spending are closely watched because they
often prove to be important indicators of the strength of the
overall economy, especially offering clues about consumers' intent
to spend. There had been some concerns that the economic turmoil in
late 1998 in Asia and Latin America would seriously slow the growth
in ad spending, but Madison Avenue has emerged virtually unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial people were running around wondering if the world
would end in 1999,'' Coen said. ``But 1999 turned out better than
we thought possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, said Christopher Dixon, a managing director at
PaineWebber who introduced the presentations, is ``the
extraordinary growth of dot-com advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought that 10 or more companies that didn't
exist two years ago would be willing to spend up to $3 million on a
spot on the Super Bowl?'' he asked with a trace of surprise in his
voice. His reference was to the record sums being spent to
advertise during ABC's coverage next month of Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, our forecast was more conservative,'' Perriss
said. ``I'm delighted to say we've been proved wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The global economy has been extraordinarily strong,'' he
added, ``and we expect three years of very steady growth'' in ad
spending from 2000 through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $233 billion
to advertise in the United States next year, an increase of 8.3
percent from the $215.2 billion that he now forecasts for 1999
after revising upward some previous estimates. Both he and Perriss
make their predictions twice a year and then revise them based on
updated data.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 figure from Coen represents a 6.8 percent increase from
the $201.6 billion spent in 1998. That gain is the smallest in
percentage terms since 5.2 percent in 1993, reflecting to some
degree the worries early this year about the tumult in overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The 8.3 percent increase for 2000 would be the largest in
percentage terms since 1994, when American ad spending rose 8.7
percent. And it would also set a record for ad spending as a
percentage of gross domestic product at 2.48 percent, compared with
2.37 percent in 1998 and 2.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when advertising has reached about 2.3 percent of GDP,
it then grows less rapidly than GDP,'' Leland A. Westerfield,
senior analyst for broadcasting and publishing at PaineWebber, said
in an interview after the presentations. ``The numbers today could
signal a breakout from historic norms.''
</P>
<P>
   Westerfield suggested two trends are powering ``this increased
level of consumer brand competition.'' One is ``broadband coming
into the home, cable modems, which will be a driving force of new
advertising'' in the interactive realm. The other is ``deregulation
in Washington, which is enabling increased competition in
telecommunications, drugs, health care, financial services,
utilities.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coen initially predicted ad spending for 2000 at a
presentation in June, he estimated it would total $230 billion. The
rise reflects the fact that ``we see strong, heavy spending by
national marketers'' next year, he said, in part because of the
millennium and the Summer Olympics, and also because of spending
for political ads and the first paid ads to promote participation
in the federal census.
</P>
<P>
   Increased budgets are likely for traditional advertisers, Coen
said, in categories like automobiles, computers, drugs, mutual
funds and telecommunications as well as for dot-coms. And the gains
are likely to be registered in traditional media like national
cable and broadcast television networks, he added, as well as in
the new media.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of new media, for the first time Coen broke out
spending for online advertising as a separate category, which he
estimated at $1 billion in 1998, $1.8 billion in 1999 and $3.2
billion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas in 2000, Coen forecasts ad spending of $231.4 billion,
up 7 percent from a revised figure of $216.3 billion for 1999. That
too represents an increase from his initial prediction in June,
when he estimated ad spending overseas next year at $224 billion.
The 1999 figure represents a 5.3 percent rise from $205.4 billion
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Coen's international figures for 2000, he said,
reflected strengthening economies in countries like Brazil,
Indonesia, Mexico and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's worldwide total for 2000, then, is $464.4 billion, which
would represent an increase of 7.6 percent from a revised worldwide
total of $431.5 billion for 1999. The 1999 figure marks a gain of 6
percent from the $407 billion spent in 1998. The rise in 2000, if
it occurs, would be the largest since 1995, when world ad spending
rose 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though Perriss uses a different methodology than Coen, tracking
only major media, he was similarly effusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world looks pretty rosy going forward,'' Perriss said.
``There don't seem to be any clouds of any consequence on the
horizon.'' Two reasons he listed involved the American economy,
which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's ad spending.
One was this country's ``consumer boom'' and the other was the
``incredible'' growth of dot-com ad spending in the United States,
where he tracked campaigns from ``over 800 brands'' through the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons for Perriss' optimism were the nascent trend of
``dot-coms becoming a European phenomenon in ad spending'' and
improvements in Asian economies, except for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Perriss predicted worldwide ad spending of $319.1 billion for
2000, which would represent an increase of 6.5 percent from his
revised estimate of $299.7 billion for 1999. The 1999 figure marks
an increase of 4.9 percent from $285.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Perriss also offered forecasts beyond 2000: $338.8 billion in
2001, an increase of 6.2 percent from his expected total for 2000,
and $359.2 billion in 2002, a gain of 6 percent from his predicted
total for 2001.

POLITICS AND LITTLE FRED HAD NO TINY PART IN BELOVED CHRISTMAS
TALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the original version of ``A Christmas Carol,'' Tiny Tim
didn't exclaim, ``God bless us every one'' _ Little Fred said it.
But the name of the most memorable character in this beloved
Christmas story was changed from Little Fred to Tiny Tim by author
Charles Dickens just before ``A Christmas Carol'' was published in
1843.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the little-known but intriguing facts about
the holiday novella. While we continue to enjoy numerous movie and
TV productions of ``A Christmas Carol,'' equally fascinating is the
story behind the story and why Dickens was moved to write the
classic.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   England played an instrumental role in establishing Dec. 25 as
the year's pre-eminent holiday. Many historians credit the British
with coining the name ``Christmas'' from ``Christ's Mass'' around
1038.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas traditions survived even when Henry VIII broke from
the Roman Catholic Church and it became politically incorrect for
children to anticipate visits from a Catholic saint. Instead,
``Father Christmas'' arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Father Christmas, carols, wreaths and gifts were banned in
1645 after Oliver Cromwell and his Roundheads won a civil war,
beheaded King Charles I and established their conservative
religious rule. Christmas, they declared, was to be treated as an
ordinary day. Anyone celebrating would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1660, after another civil war, Charles II and the royals
returned to power and Christmas was back in favor. But the 15-year
ban on holiday celebrations had long-term effects. Employers,
overjoyed at keeping staff at work on Dec. 25, enforced their own
regulations and continued to treat Christmas as a working day. ``A
Christmas Carol's'' Ebenezer Scrooge wasn't an aberration, but the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1830s, when a young journalist named Charles
Dickens began publishing free-lance articles in monthly magazines
(under the nom de plume ``Boz''), Christmas in England was
celebrated by some in church, by some privately in their homes, and
by many not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1836, Dickens was recruited to write a series of humorous
short sketches featuring ``typical'' English gentry _ specifically,
the misadventures of one Samuel Pickwick and friends. The first
``Pickwick'' stories were popular, and by 1837, his collected
tales, titled ``The Pickwick Papers,'' were published in book form.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens loved Christmas and deplored Britain's uneven
celebration of Dec. 25. One episode of ``The Pickwick Papers''
included a character, Mr. Wardle, who recounted a Christmas folk
tale titled ``The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Grub, a nasty, friendless man, spends this particular
Christmas Eve digging a grave and chastising anyone, especially
children, trying to celebrate the holiday. Alone in a church
graveyard at midnight, Grub begins to imbibe when he is confronted
by goblins. They chastise him for working instead of celebrating;
when he tries to escape, they drag him underground and force him to
witness visions of families who find joy in life, even though their
own lots are so hard.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, loving parents and siblings gather at the bedside
of a beautiful, terminally ill child. The adults and children are
strengthened by the memory of the boy, and reaffirm their love for
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing this, Grub repents his evil ways. He disappears for a
decade, then returns to his village a happier, kinder man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1843, Dickens was determined to reprise this story. This time
his irritable protagonist was Ebenezer Scrooge, who grudged coal to
his counting-house employees and humbugged anyone foolish enough to
celebrate Christmas. Scrooge's spiritual metamorphosis came via
visits by three ghosts, but anyone reading ``Goblins'' will find
Scrooge's ``encounter'' with the Cratchits to be familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens was certain his star power would make ``A Christmas
Carol'' instantly popular. His main concern was keeping the price
of the book low enough so that everyone could afford to buy it.
When his publisher balked, Dickens contributed his money to keep
the price down, a Victorian equivalent of self-publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens wrote the short novel in a fury, some estimating it was
five weeks. It is believed that only one significant editing change
was made. The sickly and youngest Cratchit child was named Little
Fred, chosen by Dickens supposedly because he said there were so
many people named Fred. It is believed that Dickens' wife suggested
that the character needed a more alliterative name. She suggested
Tiny Tim.
</P>
<P>
   Published on Dec. 19, ``A Christmas Carol'' was a smashing
success. William Makepeace Thackeray, perhaps Dickens' only
literary peer of the time, declared that the book ``seems to me a
national benefit, and to every man or woman who reads it a personal
kindness.'' If any book could make such a claim, ``A Christmas
Carol'' certainly encouraged an entire nation to fully embrace Dec.
25. Dickens had accomplished his objective.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't satisfied. Dickens would write several more short
Christmas tales, beginning with ``The Chimes'' just a year after
``A Christmas Carol.'' He made a point of telling friends that his
new holiday story ``knocked the `Carol' out of the field,'' but,
obviously, it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens continued to write brilliant, socially relevant fiction,
but before his death in 1870, the author turned actor. Dickens had
always enjoyed participating in local theater groups, and in his
declining years he took the stage more seriously. One of his
signature performances was a public reading of ``A Christmas
Carol.'' His first reading took three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Without Oliver Cromwell's Scrooge-like edict, Dickens might
never have felt inspired to write ``A Christmas Carol.'' Had Little
Fred not been renamed Tiny Tim, the story might not have appealed
as much to readers. And if Charles Dickens hadn't loved Christmas
so much ...?
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know. But to paraphrase Tiny Tim, with ``A Christmas
Carol,'' Charles Dickens has blessed the literary world, and every
one.

IT'S A LOAD OF BCS

<P>
   You know what I find most disgusting about the upcoming Bowl
Championship Series match between Florida State and Virginia Tech
to decide who has the best amateur football team in America for the
1999 season?
</P>
<P>
   The fact the paterfamilias of them all, the Rose Bowl, isn't
hosting it?
</P>
<P>
   No. Actually, I find Stanford against Wisconsin to be a more
interesting game for an assortment of reasons, foremost of which I
happen to be a friend of the father of the starting Cardinal
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Virginia Tech had a cushy schedule and faced the kind
of weak, willing opponents that Bob Arum has fed Oscar De La Hoya
for most of De La Hoya's career?
</P>
<P>
   No. Oh, the Hokies probably would have lost two or three games
had they been stuck in the Big 10, but I'm sure Florida State also
would have lost a game or two had it had to endure the Big 10
gauntlet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that I will be bombarded for the next four weeks in the
media with the cornball aphorisms of Bobby Bowden and the riveting
life tale of Frank Beamer?
</P>
<P>
   No. Blessedly, I still have the legal right to choose what
articles I prefer to read on the Internet and in the newspapers and
magazines. And I no longer listen to sports talk radio because I
find the kindergarten ramblings, shallow contrivances and feeble
attempts at humor among the hosts to be even more insufferable than
the appalling swill I once dispensed on the airways.
</P>
<P>
   What stokes a nerve in me and inspires my wrath most is that the
general sporting public and even many in the media, much like
glassy-eyed acolytes in one of those bizarre cults, are reciting
the same cloying spiel, ``Well, at least they got it right this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The hell they did!
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolute embarrassment as we reach the millennium that
the NCAA, with nodding approval from college presidents and bowl
promoters, still has refused to institute a playoff system for
Division I football.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolute scandal that in a fiercely capitalistic country
that savors competitiveness still decides one of its most
prestigious honors---its national college football
championship---via computer and ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolute injustice that Nebraska, Alabama and
Tennessee---teams, incidentally, that all would be favored by the
oddsmakers to beat Virginia Tech on a neutral site---have no chance
to win the national title even though they deserve such an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   What chills me most is the apathetic acceptance by so many
people of the entire BCS machinery that it is as phony as some of
the pedagogues who thought up the convoluted process in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in light of the widespread silence and lack of emotional
protest surrounding the selection of the Seminoles and Hokies, this
signals a stirring triumph for bureaucrats, technocrats and all
those other `crats I can't stand.
</P>
<P>
   Just great!
</P>
<P>
   And just ridiculous!
</P>
<P>
   If I'm an athletic director at Nebraska, I'm furious.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't I have the good sense to schedule mighty James
Madison---one of Virginia Tech's more renowned victims---instead of
Texas at Austin where my beloved Cornhuskers suffered their only
loss of the season?
</P>
<P>
   As we near the year 2000, we have mind-boggling advances in
every field of endeavor, except Division I football where
championships are decided by the votes of coaches and sportswriters
and the data base of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Well, a lot of college presidents and NCAA officials claim that
a protracted playoff system would take too many hours away from the
study time of the student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the reason, then why not shelve the NCAA basketball
tournament, which spans three weeks and also cuts into the
student-athletes' precious study time?
</P>
<P>
   And why does Division II have a playoff system for football
intact that works perfectly?
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight inconsistency here, isn't there?
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand it, but, as everyone knows who's brave enough
to read this prose, there are countless things I don't understand
in this harrowing world in which we reside.
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand how coaches and baseball managers with lousy
resumes keep coming up with choice jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand how ex jocks with minimal command of the
English language keep winding up with high-profile positions in
television.
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand how so much politically correct claptrap has
managed to take hold across this country and so negatively infested
every layer of one's existence.
</P>
<P>
   And I certainly don't understand why everyone has meekly
accepted Florida State and Virginia Tech as the ultimate showdown
simply because both happen to be undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the outraged?
</P>
<P>
   What if the NFL had arbitrarily stuck the Minnesota Vikings in
the Super Bowl last season because the Vikings happened to have a
15-1 record, which was the best in the league?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure the Atlanta Falcons would have liked it.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I football champion should be decided on the field
between two teams who have survived playoff ordeals and not by
reporters and coaches with private agendas and innate biases and by
computer nerds who wouldn't know a Bobby Bowden from a Bobby
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the BCS is a sham not to be taken seriously.

ESPN AND BASEBALL KISS AND MAKE UP, AND BASEBALL IS RICHER FOR IT 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN and Major League Baseball agreed Monday to an $815 million
contract extension through 2005 _ hours before the start of a trial
that threatened to shatter their decadelong relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's average annual payment of $38.1 million for 2000 to 2002
will remain unchanged from its current contract. But for the three
new years added to the deal, ESPN will pay $175 million in 2003 and
$200 million in both 2004 and 2005. ESPN will also pay baseball a
$125 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The additional money tantalized baseball, which viewed its
payments from ESPN as undervalued and watched Nascar and the NCAA
men's basketball tournament reap huge increases in their new
network deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the economics are very important, but a number of
things influenced our thinking,'' Bud Selig, the baseball
commissioner, said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ESPN would have preferred to keep its baseball fees
low, it knew that a settlement would require paying dramatically
more.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN could not afford to lose the rights to baseball, not after
bidding too low to retain Nascar races after next year and not
bidding enough to snare the National Collegiate Athletic
Association deal that CBS recently renewed for $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, ESPN believes this is a a good deal and great
value for all our networks,'' George Bodenheimer, the president of
ESPN, said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal conflict focused on baseball's anger over ESPN's
desire to shuttle three Sunday night baseball games in September to
ESPN2 to make room for National Football League games.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the settlement vastly increases ESPN2's baseball
coverage, which increases the value of this six-year-old network.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN2, which broadcast 10 baseball games last season, will carry
a minimum of 44 games on Wednesday nights and select Sunday nights,
and ``Baseball 2Day,'' a new Sunday night series. Starting next
season, the Wednesday night doubleheaders seen on ESPN will usually
be split between ESPN, which reaches 77 million cable television
homes, and ESPN2, which reaches 67 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be practical, and when I looked at this entire
deal, it's a different picture,'' said Selig, who denounced ESPN's
plan to move the late-season games to ESPN2 last year, but is happy
now. ``Under these conditions, I find it quite acceptable and it
wasn't difficult to accept in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ends the conflict over the Sunday night games in
September. ESPN will show the higher-rated NFL games, but for the
next two years, the three disputed baseball telecasts will be
exchanged for six other games _ on Friday nights in September on
ESPN and on Sunday nights earlier in the season on ESPN2. Starting
in 2002, ESPN2 could program baseball against football on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanding ESPN2's role, the contract extends ESPN
Classic's rights, increases highlight rights for ESPN's
``SportsCenter,'' adds a daily highlight package to ESPN.com, and
includes a license to create video games. Separately, baseball
renewed the ESPN Radio deal for six years at $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people offered all the marketing and hours we needed,''
Selig said. ``They were willing to do all the things we wanted to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   To a considerable degree, Monday's shift from animosity to amity
came at the urging of U.S. District Court Judge Shira A.
Scheindlin, who was presiding over the case. But self-interest on
both sides helped produce the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN desperately needed to retain baseball rights, which are
crucial to its spring and summer schedule. And baseball knew that
it could not achieve the presence and level of marketing it gets
with ESPN if it ended up with another cable partner.
</P>
<P>
   When ESPN first proposed moving the late-season games to ESPN2,
in 1998, baseball was infuriated that potentially crucial telecasts
would be relegated to a lesser network. But ESPN pointed to a
clause in its contract that said baseball could not unreasonably
withhold its permission to move games to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball had granted shifts of Wednesday night games to
ESPN2, it had never done so for Sunday broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it's reasonable to move for early-season
football games,'' a baseball spokesman said last year. The only
football game deemed reasonable for a pre-emption, he said, was the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict deepened, baseball refused to grant its
permission the past two Septembers for ESPN to put the games on
ESPN2. Instead, it wrested the games from ESPN to let the teams
show them on their local TV outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after baseball canceled ESPN's contract last April,
effective after this past season but with three years remaining,
ESPN sued in federal court. The cable network accused baseball of
withholding its consent as a ploy to resell its cable rights for a
lot more money in a highly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to ESPN earlier this year, baseball proposed
increasing its fees by more than $50 million annually from 1999 to
2001, and extend the contract to 2002 for $125 million and to 2003
for $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement appears to pay baseball everything it wanted _
and more _ in that letter.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also sets the stage for ESPN's negotiations to extend
its $42 million-a-year playoff contract beyond 2000, and for
baseball's talks with NBC and Fox, which are entering the final
seasons of their deals. NBC and Fox are not expected to more than
triple their payments. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   RWANDA: GUILTY OF GENOCIDE
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. war crimes tribunal convicted a leader of a Hutu militia
that helped lead the attempt to destroy the ethnic Tutsi in Rwanda
in 1994. Georges Rutaganda, 43, an urbane businessman and son of a
diplomat, was found guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and
murder in the 100 days of massacres in which at least 500,000 Tutsi
died. Rutaganda, who was sentenced to life in prison, is the sixth
person found guilty since the tribunal began hearings in Arusha,
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA: ETHIOPIAN FACES EXTRADITION
</P>
<P>
   Facing criticism from human rights groups, the government has
agreed to review Ethiopia's request to extradite the exiled
dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who has been living in Zimbabwe and
came to South Africa last month for medical treatment. Mengistu,
who ruled Ethiopia for 17 years, is wanted on charges of genocide
dating to the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA: ANTI-TOBACCO MOVES
</P>
<P>
   Proposed regulations introduced by the government would limit
tobacco advertising but not end it. The new rules, which follow
passage of the Tobacco Products Control Act this year, would also
enact restrictions on smoking in most public spaces and would
gradually reduce the permissible level of nicotine and tar in
cigarettes sold in the country.
</P>
<P>
   NAMIBIA: PRESIDENT'S BIG WIN
</P>
<P>
   President Sam Nujoma finished with 77 percent of the vote in the
third national election since independence, defying some
predictions that he and his ruling South West Africa People's
Organization would lose some support to the Congress of Democrats.
The new party finished a distant second in balloting for the
presidency and Parliament and will become the new official
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN: CHALLENGES TO COUP
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed to begin hearing several petitions on
Jan. 31 that challenge the constitutionality of the Oct. 12
military coup that toppled Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. One of the
petitions was filed by Sharif's political party, the Pakistan
Muslim League. Sharif now faces criminal charges that carry the
death penalty for his suspected role in refusing to allow a plane
carrying the army chief to land in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA: STATE CHIEF QUITS
</P>
<P>
   The chief minister of the eastern state of Orissa, Giridhar
Gamang, has resigned under pressure after legislators from his own
Congress Party criticized what they saw as his failure to respond
effectively to a cyclone that hit the state in October, killing
almost 10,000 people. Gamang was the handpicked choice of the
Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi. The party replaced him with
another tribal leader, Hemananda Biswal.
</P>
<P>
   AFGHANISTAN: AID GETS THROUGH
</P>
<P>
   In what relief officials are calling a breakthrough in getting
aid to civilians trapped by fighting in Afghanistan, the Taliban
government and a northern opposition force agreed to allow eight
trucks to cross battle lines carrying wheat and winter clothing.
The goods, delivered by the U.N. World Food Program, are intended
for distribution in the Panjshir Valley, where tens of thousands of
displaced people are sheltering with rebels opposed to the Taliban.
``It was a good day,'' said Jacques Collingen, who led the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: BASQUE CALLS FOR VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Basque separatist group ETA has called on fellow
Basques to aim not only at Spain but also at France in its campaign
of violence. Jose Arizcuren Ruiz, who is on trial in Paris, said
that the French and Spanish governments were enemies of the Basque
people and that the ETA, which has ended a 14-month cease-fire, had
to fight them. Such a threat to France is unusual: While
separatists have cooperated in the past, there has been little
evidence of armed Basque actions in France since a crackdown by the
French police.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: RENEWED PEACE PROTESTS
</P>
<P>
   Spaniards in 15 cities demonstrated to urge the Basque
separatist group ETA not to fulfill its threatened resumption of
attacks. The Interior Ministry released photos of nine suspected
rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND: BOYNE SITE BOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to buy and develop the site of the Battle
of the Boyne 40 miles north of Dublin where in 1690 the Protestant
King William III defeated the Catholic troops of King James II. The
victory is celebrated each July by parades across Northern Ireland,
which have added to divisiveness in the province, and Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern said, in keeping with the new Ulster peace
settlement, ``We must dedicate ourselves to promoting mutual
respect and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   THE AMERICAS
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: BOYCOTT CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   A boycott of Mexican goods in U.S. markets will continue until
the government definitively cancels a plan to require deposits of
up to $800 from motorists driving foreign-registered vehicles into
Mexico, organizers of the protest said. The boycott of Sauza
Tequila, Corona beer and four other Mexican products was organized
by Mexican groups in the United States. Last week the government
suspended the deposit plan, two days after it went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE EAST
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: PALESTINIAN PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   The senior Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said he
would not negotiate with the Israelis until they addressed
Palestinian concerns about settlements, specifically the
government's recent approval of plans to enlarge Jewish communities
in the West Bank. The Israelis interpreted this as posturing,
intended to create a sense of crisis before Madeleine Albright's
expected arrival in Jerusalem on Tuesday. The Israelis and the
Palestinians are also at an impasse over a land transfer that was
supposed to take place in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: SOLDIERS' BODIES IDENTIFIED
</P>
<P>
   Israel positively identified the remains of two soldiers, Leon
Cohen and Mordechai Nadiv, whose bodies had been missing since the
Yom Kippur War of 1973. They were found buried under the sand in
the Sinai, close to where their tank was attacked near the Suez
Canal. Israel continues its search for 16 other people missing from
that war.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ: U.S. JETS ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy jets attacked an anti-aircraft battery and a radar
station near the city of Al Amarah, about 165 miles southeast of
Baghdad. Officials said the strikes were a response to Iraqi
anti-aircraft fire at jets patrolling the no-flight zone over
southern Iraq. Iraq said the jets hit civilian targets.

EXPELLED SECT MEMBERS MAKE WAY TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Members of a doomsday sect, expelled from Israel this
year, arrived at Kennedy International Airport on Sunday night
after being expelled once again, this time from Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Greek authorities rounded up 18 members of the Concerned
Christians over the weekend, saying they feared that the group
might be planning a mass suicide or other violence for the
millennium. The officials said the group members were being
deported after overstaying their residence permits.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu news conference and meeting with worried
relatives at the airport, group members denounced America as ``the
great Babylon.'' Then they departed in taxis, destination unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Israel arrested and deported 14 members of the
apocalyptic sect, which is based in Denver, Colo., and led by Monte
Kim Miller, a former marketing executive who has claimed that he
can speak in the voice of God. Miller's whereabouts are not known,
although some relatives of sect members have said they think he is
in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Brig. Gen. Elihu Ben-Onn, an Israeli police
commander, said, ``They planned to carry out violent and extreme
acts in the streets of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the
process of bringing Jesus back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police said the sect members intended to create a
catastrophe, believing that would hasten the second coming of
Christ by provoking a deadly shootout with the police in the Old
City.
</P>
<P>
   After being returned to Denver, where they stayed for three
weeks in a Holiday Inn, these members of the sect apparently moved
to Greece, where a base had been set up in Rafina, outside Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had earlier predicted that the apocalypse would come in
October 1998, beginning with earthquakes in Denver. This did not
materialize, but that fall, members of the group disappeared,
emptying their houses and selling their possessions.

BRITISH SKY MOVES INTO CONTINENTAL EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC made its first major
move into Continental Europe on Monday with a $1.5 billion deal to
acquire 24 percent of Premiere World, a pay-television service
owned by Kirch Group, the German media company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of an effort by British Sky to build upon its
success in Britain and Ireland by expanding into other European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owns 40 percent of BSkyB, has
been eager to move into Continental Europe for some time, and has
been aggressively negotiating with many European media companies
for stakes in their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Monday also means that three of Europe's
top media concerns _ BSkyB, Kirch and Vivendi of France _ are now
linked, in a way similar to the interlocking partnerships that have
connected a number of media companies in the United States. Vivendi
holds a 24.5 percent stake in BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
   BSkyB will finance the deal by selling new shares to raise about
$524 million. The British company will also give KirchPayTV, a unit
of Kirch Group, 78 million new shares of BSkyB, valued at about
$996 million. The deal will also make Kirch a shareholder in BSkyB
with a 4.3 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after several failed efforts by Murdoch to
gain a foothold in Europe, and may signal the beginning of more
acquisitions of stakes in similar media companies on the Continent
by BSkyB. Murdoch held discussions with Kirch as early as 1997, but
did not negotiate with Kirch in earnest for its stake in Premiere
World until October.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal could still face regulatory obstacles,
though the German government is unlikely to intercede. Peter Voss,
chairman of Germany's state-owned ARD television broadcaster, said,
however, that the acquisition should be rejected because it could
give Premiere World a near monopoly in sports and film rights.
</P>
<P>
   Both BSkyB and Kirch have been losing money as they invest in
digital services and spend aggressively. BSkyB lost 12.1 million
pounds, or $20 million, in its first fiscal quarter. KirchPayTV,
the Kirch unit that operates Premiere World, said it did not expect
to break even until 2002.

GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER EXPLAINS `BITTER TRUTH' ABOUT DEBT, TAXES
AND OLD AGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Entering the new home of Germany's Ministry of Finance
here is like walking into a time warp. Situated in a Nazi-era
building east of the old Berlin Wall, the facade features a huge
mural celebrating the founding of Communist East Germany. In the
mural, women in blue uniforms march proudly with banners
celebrating socialism, flanked by smiling factory workers and
sturdy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, took up quarters here
when the government officially moved from Bonn to Berlin late in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel is steering Germans toward a future of tax cuts, budget
cuts and what he has called the ``bitter truth'' about the limits
of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to understand, first, that the situation we have at
present is one in which the federal budget carries far too much
debt,'' he said. ``They have to recognize the shift of the society
toward older age, that there are ever more elderly people and ever
fewer people of working age.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, makes it crucial that the government balance its
budget and ``raises questions about expectations and
entitlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichel, 57, has been in the cross-fire of change in Germany
since he took over as finance minister in March.
</P>
<P>
   A former premier of the state of Hesse, which includes
Frankfurt, the country's financial center, Eichel replaced the
left-wing faction leader, Oskar Lafontaine, who quit as finance
minister in a feud with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel has been almost virtually an opposite of his predecessor.
Lafontaine tried to browbeat the European Central Bank into
softening monetary policy, and he infuriated industry by pushing
for steep business tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Eichel resolutely avoids commenting on monetary
policy and has charted a course to reduce top tax rates, close some
loopholes and cut back the government's share of the total economy.
</P>
<P>
   Late in November, Eichel won a major victory when Parliament
approved budget cuts of 26 billion marks, or about $14 billion. It
was the deepest package of budget cuts reductions in years, and the
finance minister has plans for more.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel wants to increase annual savings to 50 billion marks by
2002 and achieve a balanced budget by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he has won considerable praise from business
and from many economists. He has also found surprising support
among German voters. In a recent poll conducted by ZDF, one of
Germany's public television networks, 73 percent of those surveyed
backed the recent cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Eichel has hardly been shielded from the
ideological shifts within Germany's governing Social Democratic
Party or strong changes of emphasis by Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who ranges between pro-business pragmatism and
more traditional left-of-center policies, has come under heavy
criticism for his stance against hostile corporate takeovers and
his support for a major corporate bailout.
</P>
<P>
   He recently helped engineer a $2.2 billion bailout of the
bankrupt construction company Philipp Holzmann AG. Industry groups
also expressed worry when both Schroeder and Eichel criticized the
hostile takeover steps against Mannesmann AG, the engineering and
telecommunications giant, by Vodafone AirTouch PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues aroused fear among institutional investors that
Germany might be veering toward increased government intervention
in the economy. Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central
Bank, went so far as to hint on Dec. 2 that the Holzmann bailout
may have helped push down the euro, Europe's new single currency,
to record lows against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel defended the Holzmann bailout, arguing that the
government has a responsibility to step in if a major German
company is about to collapse and cost thousands of people their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel also reiterated Schroeder's criticisms of hostile
takeovers, which have long run afoul of Germany's tradition of
``consensus'' and interlocking corporate relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel carefully avoided saying that the government might block
Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann. ``It is the owners who make the
decisions,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he warned ``Anglo-Saxon'' companies against
ignoring what he called the cultural differences in countries where
hostile takeovers are not practiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to be successful in Europe, and this has been
shown before, is well advised to pay attention to the habits
practiced here,'' Eichel said.
</P>
<P>
   For Eichel, Mannesmann and Holzmann are mostly side issues. The
big challenge will be to advance his long-range goals of cleaning
Germany's convoluted tax system, reducing the huge debt accumulated
through the re-construction of eastern Germany and strengthening
the nation's pension system.
</P>
<P>
   Though German taxes are high in comparison with the United
States, the government also provides far more services _ from
national health care to free universities.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, Eichel argued, is that top tax rates are too
high and special tax breaks too plentiful. The result, he said, is
that the tax burden falls disproportionately on personal income
taxes and social security payments. That has made labor expensive
and hindered job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four years, Eichel said, he hopes to reduce the
government's share of the economy from 48 percent now to 45.5
percent. That is still far higher than in the United States, where
government consumes about 30 percent of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Will Germany need to trim back more once it reaches the
four-year goal? Eichel is staying quiet. ``I don't want to
speculate about the years after that,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: MIRANDA REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times saidi in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to hear a challenge to one of
the most famous decisions of Chief Justice Earl Warren's era _ the
landmark 1966 ruling in Miranda vs. Arizona that requires police to
advise suspects of their rights before beginning an interrogation.
The oral argument in the case, to take place sometime next spring,
is likely to produce high drama. But as a matter of constitutional
law and sound law enforcement procedure, this should not be a
difficult decision. The intervening years have powerfully
reinforced the essential fairness and workability of the Miranda
rule, which says that criminal suspects must be told of their right
to have a lawyer present and to remain silent, and that any
statement they make can be used against them.
</P>
<P>
   The court required the warning after determining that stronger
safeguards were needed to protect the Fifth Amendment's privilege
against self-incrimination in the inherently coercive atmosphere of
police questioning. There were fears that the ruling would cripple
the police, and over the years some guilty defendants have gone
free because the police failed to read them their Miranda rights.
But these fears turned out to be greatly exaggerated, and by and
large the law enforcement community has come to accept the Miranda
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda has now returned to the Supreme Court because an
appellate court in Virginia ruled earlier this year that the
failure to issue Miranda warnings no longer required automatic
exclusion of evidence in federal prosecutions. To justify that
ruling, the court relied on a dormant federal law that Congress
passed in 1968 in an effort to overrule Miranda by reinstating the
prior rule that confessions could be admitted in federal court as
long as they were ``voluntary'' in light of all the circumstances.
No attorney general of either party has tried to enforce that law.
The reason is that Congress can only overturn a constitutional
ruling by the Supreme Court with a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked the court to repudiate the
mischievous lower court ruling. The court has never precisely said
the Miranda rule was grounded in the Constitution, though if it did
not think so it could not have extended Miranda to the states, as
it has. Miranda remains sound law and policy, and the court should
say so unequivocally.

LOW-KEY DEBATE OFFERS BUSH CHALLENGING QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four days after a spark-filled New Hampshire
debate, the six Republican candidates conducted a low-key, mostly
friendly meeting, Monday agreeing on traditional GOP themes of
lower taxes, stronger national security and disapproval of the
Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
   With US Senator John McCain of Arizona participating via
satellite from Massachusetts, the five other Republican
presidential candidates met in his home state capital of Phoenix.
For the second straight debate, McCain was relatively unscathed
while George W. Bush received a disproportionate number of barbs
and pointed questions.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most striking line of the night, Senator Orrin
Hatch of Utah turned to Bush and praised him, but then firmly
suggested that the Texas Governor lacks experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been a great governor,'' said Hatch, standing on stage
at the Orpheum Theater and before a national CNN audience. But,
Hatch continued, ``You need more experience before you become
president of the United States and that's why I'm thinking of you
as a vice presidential candidate. You should have eight years with
me and, boy, you'll make a heck of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also dealt with one of the trickiest questions of the
night, when CNN anchor Judy Woodruff followed up on his assertion
during the New Hampshire debate that he was reading a biography of
former Secretary of State Dean Acheson. When Woodruff asked what
Bush had learned from the book, Bush gave a generic answer about
the need for America to be a world leader and didn't cite anything
specific about Acheson.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, McCain, standing by in a Watertown, Mass. studio,
leaped on the question, recalling how Acheson walked into the
office of President Truman and discussed whether the United States
should intervene in the Korean conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Truman didn't take a poll,'' McCain said, while implying
that the Clinton administration has done just that before engaging
in military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was a night dominated by those least likely to
win the nomination. All of those struggling in the single digits in
national polls, including Hatch, former Reagan aide Gary Bauer and
talk show host Alan Keyes, used the free-wheeling discussion as an
opportunity to showcase their command of their favorites issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, asked what he would do to prevent school shooting, said
he would allow religion in the schools, particularly the posting of
the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a gun problem,'' he said. ``I think this is
a problem of the heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes did not repeat his New Hampshire debate complaints about
being the subject of a media ``black out.'' Instead, he spoke
calmly and passionately, agreeing with Bauer about the need to
allow prayer in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we took prayer out, we have seen violence in,'' Keyes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who won the Arizona primary in 1996 and is running
advertisement attacking Bush for ``betrayal'' for considering an
increase in the Social Security retirement age, seemed to go out of
his way to put on a friendly face. He told his familiar jokes about
how politicians are attracted to money like bees after honey, and
he urged Bush to call him ``Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   In the friendly spirit of the night, Bush asked McCain about his
views on the involvement of faith-based institutions using
government funds to in help provide social services. McCain then
joked about whether he should call Bush ``Governor, George, or W.,
or Bush'' before going on to praise Bush's work on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are on the right track,'' McCain told Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at one point denied that he has called for federal testing
as a means of monitoring to determine whether public schools should
continue to receive public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in national testing,'' Bush said. ``I strongly
believe in local control of schools.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Bush relied on his Texas background and former
work in the oil business when he was asked by Forbes how he would
lower home heating oil prices in New England. Bush said he would
encourage more oil exploration and the use of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great hope for the natural gas business,'' Bush said,
describing it as ``hemispheric in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the debate was calm, with few fireworks. Even though the
format allowed the candidates to question each other, most of the
inquiries were friendly. McCain, for example, did not go after his
chief rival, Bush. Instead, his first question was actually a
compliment to Bauer for supporting his campaign finance overhaul
bill. Bauer responded by praising McCain's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to commend you for what you have done in this campaign
on campaign finance reform,'' Bauer told McCain, who beamed in
return.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain received a number of glowing reviews for his
performance in the New Hampshire debate last week, which helped
land him on the cover of this week's Time magazine, much of the
focus Monday night expected to be on the long-distance participant.
McCain participated by satellite after initially turning down the
invitation due to what he called a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   McCain seemed nervous during his first response, referring to
CNN panelist Candy Crowley as ``Connie'' and stumbling over his
words. But for rest of the night, McCain looked at ease, smiling in
almost every response. Unlike in New Hampshire, no one raised the
question of whether he has a bad temper, but McCain touched upon
the issue when he joked, ``I win Miss Congeniality every year in
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was held in a state that may have one of the most
important primaries. The Arizona Republican primary is slated to be
held on Feb. 22, three weeks after the New Hampshire vote and
before the huge March 7 round of primaries, which include New York
and California.
</P>
<P>
   But for McCain, the Arizona contest is filled with pitfalls. If
he does well, analyst are bound to say he should succeed in a state
where he won reelection with 70 percent of the vote. But if McCain
fails in his own state, his chances of winning the nomination are
likely to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bush has poured significant resources into the
state and is preparing to run television advertisements. And
Forbes, who won the Arizona primary in 1996, may spend millions of
dollars in an effort to repeat that success. McCain also has faced
problems in Arizona due to a well-publicized feud with Governor
Jane Dee Hull, a Bush supporter who has said McCain has a bad
temper but said Monday that the issue has been overblown.

THE HARD WAY IS THE ONLY WAY FOR STARKS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October 1990, the Knicks were moments away from
wrapping up their final practice and breaking the news to an
undersized shooting guard that his dream of playing in the National
Basketball Association was over. John Starks, a 25-year-old veteran
of three junior colleges, the Memphis Rockers of the World
Basketball League and the Piggly Wiggly supermarket in his
hometown, Tulsa, Okla., where he bagged groceries, was about to be
waived from his second NBA roster in two years.
</P>
<P>
   He had no job prospects outside basketball when, during the
team's final scrimmage, he launched his 6-foot-3-inch frame high
into the air, boldly trying to dunk over an agile 7-foot Patrick
Ewing. Basketball was not Starks' career as much as it was his
life. Both hung in the balance as he took flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blocked it,'' Ewing said, smiling at the memory. ``I
remember the whole play.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks, who will play in Madison Square Garden Tuesday night for
the first time since he was traded for Latrell Sprewell last
January, said: ``Yeah, the Big Fella got me. I twisted my knee on
the play. Had to go on the injury list. You can't predict how
things are going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was on the injury list, the Knicks could not release
Starks. They had to wait until he was healthy. A month later, Trent
Tucker went down with an injury and Starks got his shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pounding his chest after slashing layups, pointing to the New
York insignia on his No. 3 jersey after a long jump shot, he
head-butted his way into the hearts of jaded Knick fans. He refused
to let anyone tell him again that he was not good enough to play in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no idea he was going to be cut that day,'' said Jeff
Van Gundy, then a Knicks assistant and now the head coach. ``I
think about that Miami game last year with us, how everything was
riding on Allan Houston's shot. John had already been cut the year
before. Who knows if he gets another shot and makes it? You
couldn't make his story up.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he made you throw food at the television that night in
1994, when he could not make a shot in the NBA finals, connecting
on 2 of 18 attempts in Game 7 against Houston. But if you are a
Knick fan, at one time or another Starks _ Horatio Alger in
hightops _ had a magnetic pull on you. He either charged your heart
because he played with so much passion or he so infuriated you that
you screamed, ``Hey, psycho boy!'' _ as the deranged Pacer fan
behind the Knicks' bench did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a Golden State Warriors jersey, Starks comes home to the
place where he forged his career. He is no longer the player who
deposited a left-handed lean-in slam over Michael Jordan and Horace
Grant in 1992, a play referred to simply as the Dunk. Starks, at
34, is nursing a sore knee, shooting poorly and playing on one of
the NBA's most moribund teams.
</P>
<P>
   His legs are not as spry and his shot is often short. But his
memories are intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pinpoint my emotions on Tuesday night, how I'll feel
or what I'll do when I step on the court,'' Starks said by
telephone over the weekend. ``The biggest thing will be seeing all
the old faces again. I left a lot of friends there.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks said he might kneel down and kiss the Garden floor. Spike
Lee, who quickly purchased a No. 8 Sprewell jersey after the trade,
was prepared to wear his No. 3 jersey in honor of Starks' return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up having to go to L.A.,'' said Lee, the filmmaker and
Knick fan. ``But I would have worn it. He's one of my all-time
favorites. You have to admire someone who was bagging groceries at
the Piggly Wiggly and despite being cut and in the CBA saying to
himself: `They're not going to hold me down. I'm going to make
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starks actually returned to the Garden last May during the first
round of the playoffs. He watched Game 3 against Miami from the
tunnel leading to the locker rooms. When his face was shown on the
scoreboard, a standing ovation almost brought him to tears. He hung
out in the locker room after the game like the tag-along little
brother no one had the heart to completely ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Starks was especially close to his former teammates, including
Ewing, Houston and Chris Childs. After that training-camp play in
1990, Starks and Ewing became the best of friends and their
families spent considerable time together. One of the more
endearing moments at the team's SUNY-Purchase practice facility
came a few years ago when Ewing's gangly teenage son, Patrick Jr.,
and Starks' son, John Jr., were playing against two college
students. As young Patrick dribbled inside, John Jr. stood
positioned on the perimeter, repeating over and over: ``I'm open!
I'm open!'' Like fathers, like sons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered Starks one of his favorite teammates,
Ewing responded, ``He is my favorite teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston recalled meeting Starks on his first day as a Knick,
hours after Houston had signed a $56 million contract to become the
team's new and improved shooting guard. There was no uncomfortable
moment. Starks embraced his new teammate and never once treated
Houston like the guy brought in to take his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always said a first impression is a lasting
impression,'' Houston said. ``I remember that day. He was always a
dude that no matter what happened, whatever people thought about
him, what people didn't know about him, he ultimately wanted to win
a game. He was one person I know, more than anybody I ever played
with, that would do whatever it took to win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Starks and Houston signed autographs at
3-point Wireless, a cell phone business they co-own near the
Garden. Starks plays golf at some of the Bay Area's most exclusive
clubs and no longer asks the waiter to take his lobster off the
bone, as he once did at a Boston restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is where John learned a lot about life, too,'' Van
Gundy said. ``If you would have interviewed him in his first years,
he would have appeared less sophisticated. As he got older, he
spoke better, became community-minded. He's one of those guys who
truly cares about kids. And he understood New York fans, one of the
few guys who really understood the mentality of where they came
from.''
</P>
<P>
   The day he was traded last January, Starks sent personalized
letters to every New York newspaper thanking the fans for their
support over the years. ``A lot of the players in the league today
had crowds cheering for them in college and high school everywhere
they went,'' Starks said. ``I never really had that. I was just
happy anyone was cheering for me when I got to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks hit his nadir twice in New York. Once after that Game 7
against Houston _ he spent an hour weeping in the shower _ and
again when Don Nelson, the former coach, waged a feud with him,
relegating him to the bench and openly questioning his talent.
Nelson had cut him after 36 games with Golden State in the 1988-89
season, and Starks felt Nelson was trying to undermine his career
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about our blow-ups and incidents,'' said Van
Gundy, who had some of his most heated exchanges with Starks over
the years. ``The thing I'll remember is him calling me after Coach
Nelson was let go. With Hubert Davis starting, there was a possible
conflict. So John calls me up and says: `Jeff, you can start me,
bring me off the bench, do whatever you want. I'll understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere could Starks find more empathy than from Van Gundy, who
had waged his own war against perceptions to become an NBA head
coach. After Starks' first season, Van Gundy began annual visits to
Tulsa, where he would help Starks develop his skills at Oral
Roberts University over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a closeness there that came over time,'' Van Gundy
said. ``John wasn't blessed with any one great skill, but he had
such unusual hustle and heart. People who say his career was about
2 for 18 should be ashamed. What they forget is, with four weeks to
go in the regular season, John had knee surgery that year. He was
back in time for the first playoff game. Think about that. His pain
threshold and his desire was so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I remember most about John? That once he got in, he
never let go. He never let anybody even think about taking it away
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Knicks, nothing has been planned for tonight to
commemorate Starks' nine years with the team. Not a video montage
nor a pregame announcement for a player who, in Game 6 of the 1994
finals, came within a jump shot of bringing the Knicks their first
title in two decades. With Starks, what might have been is not the
point. The point is what might not have been had a Continental
Basketball Association refugee not had the gumption to try to dunk
on the franchise center on the last day of practice in the final
minutes of a scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all ready to bring him aside and tell him he was
cut,'' Van Gundy said. ``He had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, John Starks can be celebrated for making it at
all.

CLINTON'S REMARK ON CHILD LABOR IRKS BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Labor Minister Francisco Dornelles was
furious. ``Has the United States resolved all its racial
problems?'' he asked. ``No. But the country criticizes us without
considering its own issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of the Brazilian official's anger was a little phrase
uttered by President Clinton at the abortive World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle. The president said he wanted to end
child labor, giving children a way ``out of the soccer-ball
industry in Pakistan, out of the shoe industry in Brazil, the
fireworks industry in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase backfired like much else at Seattle, where ministers
failed to agree on a new round of talks to liberalize trade. In
general Clinton meant to encourage developing countries to keep up
their efforts to do away with child labor.
</P>
<P>
   But as the world's ninth-largest economy, Brazil does not take
kindly to being lumped with Guatemala. And as a developing nation
grappling with the turmoil caused by the forces of globalization,
Brazil tends to grow testy when it feels that its problems are
misrepresented by an all-powerful United States busy handing out
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had much to gain from success in Seattle. Agreement on
agricultural trade alone could have brought an additional $11
billion in annual export revenue. The opening of trade in the farm
and textile sectors of the developed world remains a critical issue
for countries from Brazil to India.
</P>
<P>
   But the perceived insult came to dominate Brazil's perception of
the Seattle fiasco, a measure of the growing unease in developing
countries over a global system that tends to apply the same
economic recipe to nations at vastly different stages of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton made a big error,'' said Edmar Bacha, a banker and
leading Brazilian economist. ``By addressing Brazilian child labor,
he wanted to ease the worries of unions and other interest groups
over an invasion of cheap, labor-intensive goods. In an American
election year, that is good politics. But to Brazilians it looks
like a cheap political shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitivity here is particularly acute because the last decade
of economic liberalization has been so tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   The country as a whole has secured huge benefits from opening to
the world, including a privatized phone system that works, access
to imported goods, more efficient industries and a booming Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   But the price in a country of 165 million people always marked
by a glaring abyss between rich and poor has been onerous. In the
Sao Paulo area alone, unemployment has doubled in recent years to
nearly 20 percent as businesses have closed, moved or merged in the
face of global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has been battered by what some critics here call ``motel
capitalism,'' characterized by money that is always on the move.
Although it has recovered from the financial crisis of two years
ago, the country still has growth that is too sluggish for a
swelling population, and interest rates that are too high for all
but the wealthy, who can prosper by depositing their cash.
</P>
<P>
   High unemployment in the developed world does not often mean
desperation, since social insurance acts as a buffer. But in
developing nations, high unemployment may push the very children of
whom Clinton spoke into the streets to shore up a family's income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have at least 3,500 children living in the streets today,''
said Celso Pitta, the mayor of Sao Paulo. ``We are trying in
various ways to help, but economic conditions are against us. And
the easiest, cheapest business for these kids is drugs,'' often
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has also soared in Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial
capital. More than 4,000 people have been murdered here this year,
many of them adolescents killed in shootouts over territory in the
drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have to look at the fortresses of the bourgeoisie
surrounded by growing walls of barbed wire,'' said Raimundo Bonfim,
a social worker, ``and the city's spreading slums, where drugs are
a means to survive, to see that what is needed is a mass movement
to change the global economic model.''
</P>
<P>
   While those who govern developing countries regard Clinton's
sentiments about worker rights and child labor as worthy, they are
not convinced that the United States understands the problems.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder whether granting those rights might destroy the
competitive advantage they need for development and whether the
West is prepared to provide the billions of dollars needed to
eradicate the poverty that lies behind child labor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Brazilian shoe industry, an important exporter to the United
States, on Monday described President Clinton's remark as a
lamentable mistake. Nestor de Paula, the president of one of the
main associations of shoe manufacturers, said, ``Our opposition to
child labor in the shoe industry is widely known.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the industry _ buffeted by globalization and the loss
of thousands of jobs _ has made huge progress in recent years
toward eliminating child labor. In Franca, the main production
center in the state of Sao Paulo, child labor has been eliminated,
and it is fast disappearing elsewhere, U.N. studies show.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the more than 700,000 children aged 7 to 14 at work
in Brazil are now employed in the coal industry in rural areas and
in various informal jobs in the underground or criminal economy of
big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Clinton had been well informed, he would have condemned
the use of children in the coal business and the criminals who
exploit children,'' commented Klaus Kleber in Gazeta Mercantil,
Brazil's leading business paper. ``But it so happens that Brazil
does not export coal to the United States, or street children.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment reflects the widespread view in Brazil and in
countries like India that behind the pious sentiments of the United
States lie down-to-earth political and economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the United States no longer knows how to protect its
industry, it turns to social issues,'' said Francisco Renan
Proenca, the president of the industrial federation of Rio Grande
de Sul, a state where the shoe industry is large. Dornelles, the
labor minister, said, ``The United States is open in its language
but closed in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Such suspicions feed the growing conviction that behind the
seemingly neutral terms of ``globalization'' and ``free trade''
lies a calibrated calculation by Washington of its own interest.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians have responded by trying to attack what they see as
inconsistencies in U.S. trade policy, including barriers to
Brazilian orange juice and sugar. But the unease seems broader.
``Most Brazilians favor globalization,'' Bacha said, ``but not at
the price of subordination.''

EDITORIAL: THE DECEPTIONS OF SWISS BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's reputation and especially that of its banks has
been battered in recent years as new evidence revealed surprisingly
close cooperation between Swiss institutions and those of
neighboring Nazi Germany and in particular called new attention to
disgracefully shabby Swiss treatment of Nazism's Jewish victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's long-awaited report on the Swiss banking industry's
handling of Nazi-era Jewish accounts added little fresh damage,
finding no conclusive evidence that Swiss banks had systematically
conspired to conceal or loot those accounts. But the report, by an
international panel headed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal
Reserve chairman, found that Swiss banks had somehow managed to
lose track of a shockingly large number of these accounts over the
intervening decades and that many banks had cruelly and deceptively
turned away family members trying to recover lost assets. The
Volcker panel was able to trace some 54,000 of these missing
accounts, far more than the Swiss have previously acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   To ward off court suits and pressure from every level of the
American government, Swiss banks last year agreed to a $1.25
billion settlement that resolved claims arising from these and
other Nazi-era financial abuses. That total will not be affected by
the new Volcker findings. But the report substantially reinforces
the evidence supporting that settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss bank settlement, the first in which a major European
industry agreed to repay victims of Hitler-era economic crimes, set
an important precedent that surviving Nazi victims are now rightly
trying to follow up in other areas, most notably in talks with
German industry about compensation for their use of slave and
forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, to its credit, has tried to nudge these
negotiations toward a successful conclusion. But Switzerland's
government has thus far been defensive and even resentful about
acknowledging its responsibilities. That lack of leadership may
have contributed to the growing anti-Semitic tone in Swiss politics
in recent months. With the release of the Volcker report, and
another report due later this week on Switzerland's treatment of
refugees fleeing Nazism, Swiss leaders have a fresh chance to
acknowledge the less attractive features of their country's wartime
record and embrace efforts to compensate the victims.

PARAMOUNT'S LANSING HEADS LIST OF POWERFUL WOMEN IN ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sherry Lansing, chairwoman of Paramount's motion picture group
since 1992, has replaced Oprah Winfrey as the most powerful woman
in the entertainment business, according to an annual trade
publication due out today.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lansing's reign, Paramount has popularized the concept of
co-financing many of its big-budget films. The studio finished a
close second to Disney last year in market share and ranks fourth
in 1999 share after Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal, with hits
like ``Runaway Bride,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' and ``The General's
Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansing finished second in The Hollywood Reporter's ranking last
year, compiled annually as part of a ``Women in Entertainment:
Power 50'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry has more green-light power than any other woman in film
and her studio has had a pretty good year,'' said Randy Tierney,
special issues editorial director at The Reporter. ``She's in great
control there. The fact that she's been there for so long
definitely factors into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reporter named Universal Pictures Chairwoman Stacey Snider
as No.2 on its list, noting that Lansing and Snider are the only
two women single-handedly running motion picture studios. ``There's
a lot of instant power in being the head of a studio,'' Tierney
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Snider, a three-year veteran of Universal who was ranked 19th
last year, became co-chairwoman in June as the studio was ending
its long box office slump with ``The Mummy,'' ``Notting Hill'' and
``American Pie.'' She assumed sole chairwomanship last month when
Brian Mulligan departed.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney pointed out that the list _ based on position, how much
money they control and success in the marketplace of their products
_ reflected a generally strong upward shift among women executives
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Sherry Lansing anymore,'' he said. ``There has
been a huge upward movement within the past year-and-a-half to two
years. It looks as if the business has been opting for the best
person (instead of the best man) because there's definitely been a
lot of movement that has broken the inertia.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased power among female executives is the key reason
why Winfrey's ranking slid from first to 19th, according to
Tierney. ``It's not as if Oprah isn't hugely successful, but the
dynamics have changed,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, chairwoman of Chicago-based Harpo Entertainment Group,
also saw her ranking fall due to a below-expectations performance
by ``Beloved,'' in which she starred, and a slight decline in the
overall clout of the talk-show business.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing in a tie for third place were Lucy Fisher, vice
chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and Amy
Pascal, president of Columbia Pictures. Sony ranks sixth in
domestic box office with ``Big Daddy'' as the only hit but it has
high hopes for the soon-to-be-released ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music executive Michele Anthony finished fourth, followed
by ABC Television Network President Patricia Fili-Krushel, CBS
Entertainment President Nancy Tellem and Universal Pictures
distribution Chairwoman Nikki Rocco.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney said he expects more upward movement among female
executives, which should lead to more opportunities for women in
acting, writing and directing. ``The numbers are still very low in
some areas so I think you're going to see more openings,'' he
added.

GIANTS RESPOND TO A BRASH COACH NOW CALLING THE PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Tiki Barber stood in the huddle near the
end of Sunday's game against the Jets, waiting to hear what play
would be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ahead, 34-21, it's third-and-10, we're on our own 20,
and there's less than four minutes left,'' Barber said. ``I figured
we're going to rsn the clock out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sean Payton, the Giants' first-year quarterbacks coach,
who haD been handed the play-calling duties by the head coach, Jim
Fassel, called for a pass deep down the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the huddle going, `What?''' Barber said afterward.
``Here we are leading late in the game and Sean is throwing bombs.
I was flabbergasted, but I was impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The play would become an 80-yard touchdown, with quarterback
Kerry Collins finding Amani Toomer in another artful combination: a
precisely run pass route and a perfectly thrown pass. It was the
last of the Giants' 490 yards in their 41-28 victory, more yards
than any other Giants team had gained io 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   To Giants fans, there was greater meaning beyond the statistics.
If for a day, their team was entertaining. They liked what they
saw, even if they did not know Sean Payton from Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean is a cocky guy,'' Barber said of the Giants' new
offensive wizard. ``He goes for it, and that's fun for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired in January after two seasons as the quarterbacks coach
with the Philadelphia Eagles, the 35-year-old Payton, unassuming in
his mannerisms, appeared neither brazen nor bold in his first
several months with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in recent weeks as Payton became more vocal
around the offensive unit. In practice between plays, the coaching
conversation increasingly revolved around the spot where Fassel and
Payton stood, frequently side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was Payton's coming-out party, and while he was far from
showy, he was hard to miss on the Giants' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   While it has always been the Giants' routine to have the entire
coaching staff dress in matching outfits like a band of valet
parking attendants, on Sunday, Payton wore a bright red sweater.
His colleagues wore white golf shirts and plain blue windbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   This was probably done so that Payton could be more visible to
Collins, who received the plays from Payton via the
headset-to-helmet communications system but might have needed to
find Payton should they want to communicate with hand signals. In
any case, Payton wore his gaudy sweater with a certain aplomb, a
figure in repose for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He calmly called the plays, usually standing 10 to 15 yards from
Fassel, who also had a headset through which he heard Payton's
calls.
</P>
<P>
   It was Payton who held the large white chart of plays, not
Fassel. And if the head coach made subtle suggestions, he never
vetoed a call. Indeed, Fassel spent much of his day keeping others
away from Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the hammer down on that,'' Fassel said Monday. ``I told
people: `Get away from him. Let him call the game.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in eight years _ when Fassel was a
first-year Giants quarterbacks coach _ that he stood on the
sideline of a National Football League game without calling the
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Fassel said he found the experience
liberating. ``I felt more in control of things over all,'' he said.
``It frees you up to assess the whole game, to get a feel for
what's going on all over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offensive players were also elated to have Payton at
the helm. For weeks now, they have felt that Payton was the coach
who best explained the intricacies and goals of the offensive
system. He used terms they readily understood and was more
free-wheeling, which may be a natural function of his role as an
assistant to the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coaches who call a team's plays are often aggressive
because they are ultimately trying to impress, hopeful that they
may someday become a head coach. Head coaches are usually more
fixed on keeping the jobs they have, a situation that can lead to
conservative play calling.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, Payton attacked on Sunday. When the
Giants approached the Jets' end zone, Collins said Payton's play
calling was ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Payton played down his role, deflecting praise
to Jim Skipper, the Giants' offensive coordinator, and other
assistants. He admitted to being nervous but credited the players
with the real heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those calls, what you're doing is challenging them to
come through,'' Payton said. ``And they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton came to the Giants on the recommendation of their
defensive line coach, Denny Marcin, who worked with Payton at the
University of Illinois in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rod Dowhower, Fassel's quarterbacks coach in 1997 and
1998, had taken a job as the offensive coordinator at Philadelphia,
Fassel interviewed a handful of candidates for the job. He canceled
his trip to the Super Bowl last January to bring Payton to Giants
Stadium and ended up offering him the job that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intrigued by him and felt very comfortable right away,''
Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Payton is the man who made even the Giants' offense
look interesting. The guy with the guts to call a double reverse
and the sense to run the football 45 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called the same plays we always do,'' Payton said. ``The
difference was they were executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but others noticed a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean takes risks,'' Barber said. ``As a player, that gets your
attention. You're a little on edge. And we need that.''

 EDITORIAL: SENATOR McCAIN'S HEALTH  
(sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The whispers about Sen. John McCain's temperament seemed to grow
in intensity as he moved up in the polls as a Republican
presidential candidate. So McCain's decision to release 1,500 pages
of medical records about his physical and mental health _ along
with a volley of self-deprecating jokes about his temper _ has the
look of a tactical coup. It also marks the start of the nation's
quadrennial discussion about how much the public is entitled to
know about a candidate's personal history.
</P>
<P>
   The tactical analysis is the easy part. McCain is running as the
candidate of self-revelation, even when the personal history that
is revealed has a few rough spots. The Arizona senator is betting
that the public will prefer candor about his past over packaging or
evasion. The approach has the obvious advantage of contrasting him
with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has refused to answer
questions about alleged cocaine use during an admittedly reckless
youth.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the underlying civic question? Voters have a
legitimate interest in the health and stability of potential
presidents. They clearly factor that information into their choices
in a variety of ways. The ``age issue,'' widely discussed in 1976
and 1980, did not stop Ronald Reagan. George McGovern's 1972
campaign never really recovered after it was disclosed that his
running mate, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, had received shock treatments
for depression. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, a presidential
candidate and cancer victim, called for a commission to study rules
for medical disclosures by candidates. History shows, of course,
that being president does not require either physical or
temperamental perfection. Consider Abraham Lincoln's gloominess and
Franklin Roosevelt's paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's disclosure should not set off a browbeating of other
candidates to match him detail for detail. But it does outline a
common-sense approach. Presidential health, like presidential
character, is an important public concern. Voters have a right to
look at anything that relates to ability to serve, including major
health issues in a candidate's life. Journalists have a
corresponding duty to be responsibly curious about these matters.
McCain's particular way of releasing information need not become an
exact requirement for other candidates, but it ought to prompt them
toward a corresponding openness appropriate to their own histories
and candidacies.

NESTLE SELLS COFFEE LABELS TO SARA LEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SUZIE ST. JOHN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Nestle USA Inc. committed to the company's new
Nescafe coffee line Monday by announcing the sale of its Hills
Bros., MJB and Chase &AMP; Sanborn coffee brands to Sara Lee in a deal
that includes the sale of Nestle's coffee plant in Suffolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but the purchased assets
have combined annual sales of about $280 million, according to Sara
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon careful review of our coffee brands in the U.S. market,
we determined that it is best to focus our efforts and resources
toward the long-term growth of our new premium line of Nescafe, in
both retail and food service channels, as well as Taster's Choice,
one of the leading brands of instant coffee in America,'' said Joe
Weller, chief executive officer of Nestle USA based in the city of
Glendale in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nescafe line was launched earlier this fall across the
West Coast, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego,
Sacramento, Denver, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line was designed to deliver a new coffee experience,''
said Terri Haywood, communications manager for Nestle's beverage
division.
</P>
<P>
   The product line offers 20 different coffee beverages in a
variety of flavors and textures, including gourmet whole bean and
ground coffee, gourmet instant coffee, Nescafe Frothe specialty
coffees and frozen coffees.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood said the line is targeting younger coffee drinkers
ranging in age from 25 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last statistics we have about coffee trends shows an
increase in younger coffee drinkers,'' Haywood said. ``We have an
ad campaign out with commercials being directed by (actor and
sitcom director) Michael Lembeck. They are nontraditional, looking
more like a sitcom.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being sold in retail locations, Haywood said
Nescafe is being sold at college campuses, restaurants, hotels,
movie theaters and self- and full-service coffee bars nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very committed to seeing the success of this brand in
the United States,'' Haywood said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee has long been a competitor of Nestle in Europe, where
it sells coffee and tea under the Douwe Egberts, Marcila, Merrild
and Pickwick brands. Monday's acquisition adds three well-known
brands to Sara Lee's Chock Full o' Nuts, which the company bought
in October to enter the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara Lee is in a leading retail position all over the world,
so it's logical that we would want to expand in the U.S.,'' said
Jeffrey Smith, director of media relations for the Chicago-based
Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Sara Lee is offering to hire the 210 employees at the
Suffolk plant in the same capacity or in comparable jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees were notified of the sale (Monday) and senior
management was on site to meet with the employees,'' Smith said.
``We plan to continue operating the plant in its current location.
It allows us to be able to better balance production between retail
and food service.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there are no immediate plans to change the three
purchased brands.

   ``It's a little early to detail a broad marketing plan but
packaging and roasting quality are things we'll be evaluating,''

   Q -- Our manager told us that he heard that employees today seek
recognition more than anything else at work, including money. He
said that we need to keep this in mind when supervising in our
areas. I think this is an oversimplification, but when I said this
to him, he said I was flat out wrong. Am I? T.S.
</P>
<P>
   A -- A manager who tells his employee that he is ``flat-out
wrong'' is usually flat-out wrong. A more productive managerial
response is to discuss your points.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you simply said to him that his thoughts are an
oversimplification, your comments may have been perceived as an
attack. If you disagree with your manager on this type of issue,
you can increase the likelihood of a discussion rather than a
brush-off by starting with a question rather than an answer.
</P>
<P>
   As for your manager's thoughts about recognition, he is correct,
but only to a point. Recognition is motivational at work, providing
that other basic work elements are perceived as fair and adequate,
such as the pay, working conditions and benefits. For example, if
the pay is perceived as inequitable, all the recognition in the
world is not going to have much of a motivational impact.
</P>
<P>
   However, once the basic elements such as pay are taken care of,
then recognition can play an important motivational role, as can
advancement, responsibility, achievement and the work itself. Your
manager needs to recognize that there is more to motivation than
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We have casual dress days every Friday, but I am reluctant
to wear casual attire because I feel that, as a female, we tend to
diminish our stature when we dress casually, while the same does
not seem to apply to males. My associates tell me that I am wrong
about this. What do you think? A.N.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Your proficiency, competence and excellence as an executive
are based far more on your work style than on your clothing style.
If people look at your appearance on a casual day and somehow
misperceive your role, stature or status in the organization, that
is their problem. It is important that you do not let it become
your problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you regard yourself as less significant or influential when
you are casually attired, you may actually turn this
self-perception into a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people
believe that they are not effective, their performance tends to
slip and fall into line with this expectation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been some studies that have noted
the differences you mentioned in the way that males vs. females are
perceived on casual dress days. This perception is clearly on the
endangered stereotype list and should be extinct fairly soon. The
irony is that when people do not dress casually on casual days,
that can point to questionable confidence, excessive formality, and
even indifference to the company culture.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, your company has a policy of casual dress days,
and you should take advantage of it if you want to. Your strength
as a leader comes from within, and just because your attire is
casual does not mean that your professionalism is casual too.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- Our new manager gives me the creeps. I don't know what it
is about him, but as soon as I met him, I felt my skin crawl. I
can't identify anything in particular that he did, but I just don't
like being around him. I like my job, but the whole place has
really changed for me because of him. What can you suggest? D.D.
</P>
<P>
   A -- This is the type of situation in which you need to
literally and figuratively step back and take a look at what is
actually happening. You have made a snap judgment about a new
person in your work life. The problem is that although many people
think they can make expert judgments instantly, many of these
judgments are instantly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In your own life, there have probably been cases where you took
a quick liking to someone, only to find out over time that there
was less to this person than met the eye. And, you have probably
found that some of those people whom you did not initially like
actually turned out to be rather likable. The key element is the
passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Your instant opinion of this individual may be entirely
accurate. Perhaps your experiences with people have helped you to
identify subtle problematic traits of others. However, your quick
opinion could also be indicators of bias, prejudice or previous
negative experiences with someone who unconsciously reminds you of
this individual.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, your question is going to be answered. In the
interim, try to deal with him with an open mind, lest he make an
inaccurate snap judgment of you.

PARAMEDICS' GROUP ARRANGES FUNERALS FOR BABIES WHO ARE ABANDONED TO
DIE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. _ The early morning sun shone brightly on the
tiny coffin coated in white velvet. It sat next to a heap of earth,
ready for burial, among the brass plaques marking graves adorned
with rubber ducks, pacifiers and toy Santas.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn girl, Mary Hope, had been found dead in a bag by
workers sorting through recyclables and trash trucked to a Brooklyn
plant. So for the 11th time in a year and a half, Timothy Jaccard,
a Nassau County paramedic, stood graveside on Saturday with a
clutch of fellow paramedics, police officers and strangers,
grasping for the right thing to say about a baby found in the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will rest in peace with her brothers and sisters,''
Jaccard said, his voice catching.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``brothers and sisters'' _ tossed away in the trash,
suffocated in bags, smothered in shallow graves _ lay in a long row
to her right, two to a grave on a triangular median at Holy Rood
Cemetery in Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   There is Jonathan Hope, found in March 1998 in a bag tucked into
some bushes in Albertson and buried on April 14 of that year.
Matthew Hope, found that same month in a pile of garbage at a Bay
Park sewage plant. Faith Hope, found in a shallow grave in Freeport
by a curious dog. Holly Hope, wrapped in a blanket with a piece of
holly, found in May 1998 decomposing in a shallow grave at, of all
places, Holy Rood. Noel Hope, discovered by a passer-by in December
last year, in a garbage can in the Bronx. Christina, Gabriella,
Angel, Christine _ all abandoned, all dead.
</P>
<P>
   Jaccard, 50, could save none of them, but at least, he said, he
has found a way to accord the most vulnerable victims the ``dignity
and identity that every human being deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been this way since he and fellow ambulance medical
technicians of the Nassau County Police Department on Long Island
formed the nonprofit amT Children of Hope Foundation Infant Burial
Inc. last year.
</P>
<P>
   Run largely from a table in the recreation room of Jaccard's
home in Wantagh and financed with money from fraternal lodge dances
and Heart of Hope pins, the foundation legally adopts the babies
after police officers have exhausted their investigations; the
members then arrange a funeral Mass and burial, full of ceremonial
touches normally reserved for fallen comrades.
</P>
<P>
   A motorcade escorts the hearse to the church and cemetery.
Bagpipes wail ``Amazing Grace.'' Crisp salutes abound as two
pallbearers, often Jaccard and a fellow paramedic, carry the
coffin. All of the infants are given the surname Hope, but the
first names have come from Jaccard or people involved in their
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The paramedics involved with Children of Hope say it provides
closure, a way to resolve the inner emotional turmoil that keeps
eating away as they rush from pumping the chest of the crumpled
child at a car accident, to picking up the pieces after a ``suicide
by train,'' to clutching the hand of a moribund gunshot victim
begging not to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a professional,'' said Ronald Kahl, a paramedic and a
member of the foundation's board. ``You do what you have to do, and
then you go home and cry and hug the kids and go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaccard, a paramedic for almost 25 years, knows the drill. But
the stiff upper lip began to quiver after his assignment to the
morgue detail a few years ago. He drives the white unmarked van
that arrives to pick up the dead, whether at a crime or accident
scene or hospital. He collects the evidence, photographs the body,
straps it to a gurney and wheels it away.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, he was called to the Nassau County courthouse in
Hempstead. He entered a bathroom stall and found an infant only
hours old stuffed in a toilet bowl. He began to weep and could not
stop. He is not sure why. Maybe, he figured, it was because his own
daughter was enduring a difficult pregnancy. Court officers and
paramedics arranged a funeral for the child _ named Baby Angelica
by a court officer _ after she remained unclaimed for three months
in the morgue, nagging at Jaccard as he returned from his rounds.
Jaccard, a former florist, arranged the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later came another call. A newborn stuffed in a
plastic bag discarded in bushes in Albertson. Jaccard picked up the
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, my God, not another child,'' he recalled. ``Why is
this happening? Why am I getting it?''
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by the senselessness and his Roman Catholic faith, he
resolved to ensure that such children at least had a dignified
burial.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation enlisted nearly every paramedic in the county,
close to 100, though the 7 on the board do most of the work. They
got a local funeral home, Charles J. O'Shea, to donate most of the
cost of preparing and transporting the bodies. They bought plots at
Holy Rood. They now have space for only six more infants.
</P>
<P>
   They began raising money, $22,000 so far this year, through
dances at the Knights of Columbus hall and the sale of Heart of
Hope pins for $10 apiece, and by accepting donations.
</P>
<P>
   They sponsor a help line _ (516) 679-1111 _ for mothers or
fathers who may be inclined to abandon or dispose of their infants,
referring them to the Long Island Crisis Center in Bellmore.
</P>
<P>
   Jaccard often answers the phone calls himself, and sometimes,
with his wife or a friend in tow, he meets the callers, so far all
women, to encourage them not to dump their babies. He said he was
confident that of the 100 calls to the line, at least 7 women
intent on abandoning their babies chose to give them up for
adoption or made arrangements to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has posters and pamphlets displayed at clinics,
counseling centers and train stations imploring people not to
abandon their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Jaccard's ambition hardly flags. He operated his first business,
a car wash, as a 15-year-old growing up in Wantagh. After college,
he opened two floral shops. In the early 1970s, when the economy
slowed during the energy crisis, he got a job with the county
Police Department as a paramedic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, more than 80 turned out for the Mass at St. Agnes
Cathedral in Rockville Centre. The Blue Knights of New York, a
police motorcycle club, provided an escort. The Hempstead Police
Department color guard handled the flags. The service drew mostly
paramedics and their friends as well as prayer groups and some
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, as the cathedral bell pealed, Mary Hope was carried
to the hearse for the procession to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea of the funeral home said a few words and then Jaccard
stepped forward. He paused, cleared his throat and took notice of
the other infants his group had buried. ``I find it hard to
wonder,'' he said. ``How do I hold back? But I do. I go on hoping
that we do not have to do this again. Thank you for coming.''

 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Ryan, the manager of the Olana State Historic Site near
Hudson, N.Y., who oversaw most of the restoration of the
Persian-style Victorian mansion that the 19th-century painter
Frederic Edwin Church built high above the Hudson, died on Nov. 29
at Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y. He was 57 and lived in
Catskill, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was renal failure, said Karen Zukowski, curator at
Olana. Ryan received a kidney transplant 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan became manager of Olana in 1979, it had been owned by
the state for 12 years, and much of the work had already been done
to make its extraordinary hilltop location publicly accessible. But
the house was in dire need of repair and restoration, even though
its ground-floor rooms had been maintained much as Church had left
them when he died in 1900. (The home's last occupant had been
Church's daughter-in-law, who died in 1963.)
</P>
<P>
   Church made his fortune as a painter of the New World, but the
house, which many consider an artwork equal to his paintings,
reflects his later interest in ancient cultures and was stimulated
by trips to the Middle East in the late 1860s, just as he was
beginning to build Olana.
</P>
<P>
   The house's interior was accented with Persian and Persian-style
tiles and, like its exterior cornices, was elaborately stenciled
with patterns that Church borrowed from books about Persian
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The decor represented an eclectic sensibility and a lifetime of
collecting, mixing Aesthetic Movement furniture and paintings by
Church and his contemporaries with old master paintings and objects
from all over the world, among them Mexican folk art, painted
chairs from India, Middle Eastern armor and Far Eastern ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan knew Olana's elaborate history inside out. He gave
fascinatingly comprehensive house tours that chronicled the
restoration process, provided detailed origins of individual
objects and their roles in Church's vision of each room, and he
explained how the house was a carefully constructed reflection of
Church's ideas about art, religion and nature.
</P>
<P>
   For some visitors Ryan might end the tour with a clamber through
the attic, up the ladder on Olana's fourth-story porch and into the
crow's nest, with its stupendous view of the Hudson stretching
north and south against the green shoulders of the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was involved with history and its objects for most of his
career. He was born in Kansas City, Mo., in 1942, and graduated
from the University of Notre Dame in 1966 with a degree in American
intellectual history. In the late 60s he worked at the Kansas State
Historical Society in Topeka, and from 1970 to 1975 he was the
curator of the Kansas City Museum of History and Science in
Missouri, where he was also a researcher for the landmarks
commission from 1972 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He worked briefly for the Society of the Preservation of New
England Antiquities and came to the Hudson River Valley in 1977,
first as site manager for the Senate House State Historic Site in
Kingston, N.Y. That year he also earned a master's degree in museum
administration from the Cooperstown Graduate Program, part of the
State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also applied his preservationist instincts to the landscape
surrounding Olana, becoming deeply involved with land management
issues in the Hudson Valley. In the early 80s he was part of a
legal effort that blocked the construction of a nuclear power plant
near Olana, the first case that brought a denial on aesthetic
grounds for the preservation of a historic site's view.
</P>
<P>
   He was a proponent of scenic easements, in which landowners are
compensated for clauses in their deeds that prohibit development,
and he served on the boards of the Columbia County Historical
Society, the Catskill Public Library, the Greene County Historical
Society and Hudson River Heritage. His house in Catskill was
perched above the river and had a direct view of Olana.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is survived by his companion, David Seamon, a professor of
architecture and environmental psychology at Kansas State
University in Manhattan, Kan.; his sister, Esther, and his brother,
John, both of Kansas City.

COURTESY RULES AT DEBATE OF 6 GOP CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Resisting their first opportunity to attack one
another directly on national television, six Republican
presidential candidates treated one another courteously Monday
night as they touted their stance on foreign policy, taxes,
education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a forum last week in New Hampshire, in which Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas took part for the first time and was the favorite
target of the other candidates, this time the contenders were more
subtle in contrasting themselves with Bush, the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, gathering at the Orpheum Theater, were allowed
to question one another. But mostly their questions sounded like
recitals of their own credentials.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates had the opportunity to ask questions, it was
no surprise that the first up, Gary Bauer, turned his attention
toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who has made human rights abuses in China a principal
issue in his campaign, asked Bush why he, like President Clinton,
favored more open trade with China, as opposed to a sharper
confrontation with China.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the way President Reagan dealt with the Soviet
Union, Bauer asked Bush, ``Why not follow a Reagan policy rather
than a Clintonian policy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how to insult a guy,'' Bush said, adding: ``I believe
competitors can find common ground. I think it's in our country's
best interest to open up China to Arizona farm products, to Iowa
farm products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also in our best interest to make sure the
entrepreneurial class in China flourishes,'' Bush said. ``If you
give people a breath of freedom, a taste of freedom, I think you'll
be amazed, Gary, at how soon democracy will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer asked, ``Is there no atrocity that you can think of that
would tell you to put trade on the back burner?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ``If we turn our back on China and try to isolate
China, things will get worse. Imagine if the Internet took hold in
China. Imagine how freedom will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round of questions for all six candidates concerned
education, and each candidate used his response principally as an
opportunity to state his general views on the federal government's
role in public education. Those views were alike to the point of
being nearly identical: All the candidates emphasized clear, finite
limits to federal involvement and many advocated at least some
experimentation with vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bauer and Alan Keyes rued the flight of prayer and religion
from classrooms, with Bauer citing that as a reason for violence in
schools. ``I don't think this is a gun problem, as some might
suggest,'' Bauer said. ``I think it's a problem of the heart and
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes agreed, saying, ``Since we took prayer out, we seem to
have let violence and decline in.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Bush talked up the virtues of
vouchers, although Bush did not use that word. Bush reiterated his
frequently stated belief that schools that receive federal funds
should face consequences if the children in those schools are
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if the federal government spends money on the
poorest of the poor children, we need to ask a simple question,''
said Bush. ``What are the results? What are the results?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona was reminded of a statement he has
repeatedly made that good teachers should make more than bad
senators, whose salary will rise to $140,000 in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that I would never allege that there are any bad
senators,'' McCain joked. Then, making light of questions that have
been raised about his temper, added: ``I win Miss Congeniality
every year in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said that tax reform would in fact help improve
education, because parents would be better able economically to
choose schools for their children. ``The combination of genuine tax
reform, where parents can make quality of life decisions, and
allowing parents to choose the schools that work for their children
_ that's the way to move forward,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to prevent his rivals from ganging up on Bush, CNN set
ground rules that prohibited the candidates from all using their
allocated question for another candidate on the same person.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not travel to Arizona to share the stage with his
competitors because, his campaign said, he had long-scheduled
events in New Hampshire and New York on Monday and Tuesday. But
after CNN agreed last week to include him by satellite, McCain put
off a town meeting set for Guilford, N.H., Monday night and agreed
to participate. Polls here show that McCain faces a potent threat
from Bush in Arizona, where the primary is Feb. 22. The Republican
governor, Jane Dee Hull, has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between McCain and Bush in New Hampshire, the state
with the first primary, has grown particularly competitive. Three
new polls in that state _ by Newsweek, Gallup and Quinnipiac
College _ show the race is statistically even.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting indication of how eager McCain's campaign is
to nullify the lingering issue of his temper and contradict any
assertions that McCain will have trouble winning Arizona, his home
state, three lawmakers who support him held a news conference an
hour before the debate to promote their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., underscored the public release of
McCain's medical records and basically implored the scores of
reporters in the press room near the Orpheum Theater to let that be
the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to put an end to it and focus on the issues in the
campaign,'' Kyl said. ``If anything, he has a right to brag about
his temperament,'' given everything he has been though.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., said: ``Releasing those records is
not a smoke screen. If anything, it's a shining light.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Groscost, speaker of the Arizona House, noted that about 60
mayors in Arizona had endorsed McCain and that more were being
added to that list every day. He acknowledged that a few Republican
officials have not chosen to support McCain. Gov. Hull was clearly
on his mind, though he did not specify her.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost also, interestingly, took pointed note of the fact that
McCain was a master of policy who, if people would stop asking him
about his temper, would be able to show that. The unspoken
comparison was with Bush. ``He gets into the meat of the issues,''
he said. ``He understands them. He can articulate them.''

   NEW YORK _ Heaven forbid that Minnie Driver, or any other hip
celebrity with nothing better to do on a Sunday night than to
stroll up another red carpet in New York, should wander backstage
in her ravishing couture frock with little sparkles scattered
around the hem and encounter ... a reporter. How hideous! How rude!
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to ask any questions, are you?'' a press
agent said to a reporter on the way into the green room, marked
``Talent Holding,'' at the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington
Avenue, where the VH1/Vogue fashion awards were being broadcast
live.
</P>
<P>
   Out front, about 1,200 guests were packed into chairs and
risers. Sharon Stone and Rupert Everett were there. So were Tom
Ford, Alexander McQueen, Donatella Versace, Faith Hill and Sandra
Bullock. Beck had just finished performing. As he and his handlers
were rushing backstage, the photographer Roxanne Lowit, in the
voice of Eliza Doolittle calling for tuppence, asked if she could
take one picture. But the singer never looked up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the extravagantly named green room, the only thing
holding seemed to be a doubt about whether anything spontaneous
would happen that evening _ a glimmer of flesh-and-blood life
beyond the red-carpet smiles and artificial-plant poses, a sign
that the fashion crowd, at least, could still be counted on for
some real thrill and surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, everyone who had been nominated for an award knew in
advance whether he or she had won, as a result of a distribution
glitch by Vogue, which announced the winners last week on the cover
of its January issue.
</P>
<P>
   And as if to underscore the evening's sense of predictability,
all the designers nominated for the top design award _ Calvin
Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani, Ford of Gucci _
not only appear regularly in Vogue, but are also, through their
companies, among the magazine's top advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Driver, she had barely entered Talent Holding, when,
seeing no one but a couple of technicians and photographers eating
rolls and what looked like Green Giant Corn Niblets, she suddenly
turned and bolted.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, Vogue and its editor in chief, Anna Wintour, brought
flair and status to the VH1 awards. The show moved swiftly, without
windy speeches or bombing jokes, and the fashion segments, all
coordinated by Candy Pratts Price, a former Vogue editor, and
modeled by runway pros like Giselle and Maggie Rizer, reflected
Vogue's sense of mainstream fashion tastes as well as its powerful
clout with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting what you want,'' Ms. Price said _ meaning that
Vogue was getting what it wanted _ one afternoon before the show.
For instance, when she asked Klein to produce more styles in the
blue-dyed python he had used sparingly, but effectively, in his
recent spring collection, he did so. When she called Manolo Blahnik
for shoes, hundreds of pairs arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered the design world to all the presenters,'' Ms. Price
added. That might mean, she said, ``a video, a look-book from the
collection, sometimes a rack of clothes'' delivered to their homes.
``It's not like they're going over to 550, you know what I mean?''
Ms. Price said, referring to 550 Seventh Ave., where Ms. Karan,
among others, has her headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   She worked with the show's hosts _ Heather Locklear, who during
the two-hour program changed from Versace into Dolce &AMP; Gabbana into
Gucci, and Puffy Combs, who wore, among other things, a full-length
Fendi chinchilla coat, a white fedora wrapped around a head scarf
and many diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price recalled that Combs, who conducted his fittings in a
suite at the Peninsula Hotel, told her that his credo was
``marination creates style'' _ that is, he likes to mix things up _
and that she immediately telephoned Ms. Wintour and the magazine's
editor at large, Andre Leon Talley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Anna, I told Andre,'' Ms. Price said with
characteristic stage presence. ```Marination was it for me. I
marinate!'''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly guests arriving at the armory were counting on Vogue
to add some glamour to the event, which was the first in a week
heavy with fashion galas, including the annual Costume Institute
dinner Monday night at the Metropolitan Museum, and the opening of
the LVMH Tower on East 57th Street Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vogue has a point of view,'' Ms. Karan said, clutching her
wrap, ``and it will be very interesting to see how the whole thing
gets orchestrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mizrahi, who designed the show's shiny white curvilinear
set, acknowledged that such events can be boring but said Ms.
Wintour ``knows how to make something great when she has her way.''
As for his set design, Mizrahi added: ``Oh, I wanted it to look
like an airport. I don't know, airports are so pretty and modern,
and when I was little my mother used to take us to JFK for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Wintour, who was dressed in Gucci (Ford was
named designer of the year during the evening), said, ``It was a
show very much with a life of its own before we joined up, and
although we'd been advising behind the scenes, we have a more
active role this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Ms. Price described the magazine's role, ``We know how to
make it look like Vogue.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a way, that was precisely the trouble with the show. It
didn't reflect the diversity of fashion or popular culture. It was
slick, all right, but without the element of surprise or
spontaneity that would lift it from the banally commercial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mood showed up, too, in the controlling atmosphere
backstage, with all the handlers. ``They don't allow you to catch
the moment,'' a photographer said. ``You just have a movie star or
celebrity smiling at you, and every picture looks the same and
every photographer has the same picture. And at fashion shows, the
models used to walk down the runway in Pat Cleveland's era spinning
and turning and relating to the editors. Now they go straight
toward the video camera. They're not expected to have
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   There were exceptions, notably Lil' Kim, who looked like a
gossamer butterfly in see-through tulle pants and a sequined mask.
And then there was Combs, who was hardly ready to be cowed by
establishment fashion. Asked about his fantastic-sounding credo, as
Ms. Price had related, he broke into a huge grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to let my clothes sit in the closet for about three
months and marinate, like a steak,'' he said. ``Then, gradually,
you know, I go in and figure it out. I mixed a lot of designer
labels with my own things. Which they don't like me to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's marination, not just conformity. Know what I'm
saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Standing backstage after the show, Combs seemed unusually
talkative, a relief after the one-liners offered by most of the
other celebrities. ``I don't have no fear when I dress, you know?''
he said. ``I don't go with majority rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all his exotic wardrobe changes in the show, he couldn't
single out a favorite. ``I loved it all,'' he said. ``The fur coat.
The classic things. The suit I'm wearing now.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``I'm not trying to be political about it. I took my
time and marinated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought he had outdone Ms. Locklear, his co-host, in
the style department, he put on a tough face. ``Heck, no,'' he
said. ``She had, like, 20 stylists, so she didn't fight fair.''
Then he laughed again.

SPORTS COLUMN: SUNDAY'S BIG WINNER IS FASSEL, WHO WILL BE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Monday morning, hours after perhaps the New York Giants'
biggest victory since they beat the Dallas Cowboys on the road in
the last game of the regular season two years ago to capture the
division with a 10-5-1 record. The Giants' hierarchy remained abuzz
Monday over the stunning victory against the Jets, and while the
status of Coach Jim Fassel was not a central topic among
management, it was definitely discussed, and a consensus emerged as
the day concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a collapse, Fassel will be back.
</P>
<P>
   It has been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Count on it.
</P>
<P>
   The owners Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch, the executive vice
president John Mara and the general manager Ernie Accorsi all want
Fassel back. And the desire for him to return is not lukewarm. It
is strong, almost gushing, spurred by the dominating victory over
the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking Giants executive said Fassel would be given a
multiyear contract extension at the end of the season because the
organization is more than happy with the head coach's dedication,
toughness and the way he handles his life in general, which is
exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we go 1-3 or 0-4,'' the executive said, ``he will be
back. As long as this team keeps fighting the way they are, which I
expect, he will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive added: ``The only way the thinking changes is if
there is a total collapse in the effort of the players, but I don't
see that. No one does.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his guess was that Fassel would sign a two-year
extension once the season was over.
</P>
<P>
   They could indeed lose their four remaining games, but a more
realistic scenario is that the injury-riddled Giants steal one, or
with a great amount of luck, two. The Giants, who are 6-6, probably
play the most brutal final four of any team in the National
Football League: at Buffalo, at St. Louis, home against Minnesota
and then Dallas on the road. The Rams and Vikings are Super Bowl
contenders, the Bills are always tough to beat at home, and Dallas
is a bitter division rival. The combined record of those four teams
before last night was 31-16.
</P>
<P>
   But do not be shocked if Fassel pulls a few miracles. Right now
the Giants are dangerous, and their hierarchy, wisely so, thinks
Fassel can build something off the drubbing of the Jets, not just
for this season, but over the next few years as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership wants Fassel back because his calm demeanor and
golly-gee looks betray an inner toughness that allowed him to
overcome the death of his mother and the rumors of his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership wants Fassel back because he will never embarrass the
Giants: he is a good man with a good heart, and that does matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership wants Fassel back because he put his ego aside, handed
off the play-calling against the Jets to an assistant and then
publicly admitted such to reporters. How many coaches would be
secure enough to do that? Fassel saw that something needed to be
done about his offense and that he might have been the problem. He
stepped aside, for the good of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership wants Fassel back because he beat the Jets. Badly.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons to feel encouraged about the future of
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   First, Accorsi is one of the most underrated talent evaluators
in the league, and two of his players are proving to be solid
choices. While it is still early to anoint quarterback Kerry
Collins as the next Phil Simms, Accorsi was right in that Collins
throws one of the most accurate footballs in the NFL, pretty
spirals that drop into the hands of receivers like apples from a
tree. Collins has turned into a leader on this offense, something
that Accorsi predicted but know-it-alls like me doubted. And
Accorsi was right about his second-round pick, Joe Montgomery, who
demonstrates the kind of excellent field vision that Rodney Hampton
once did.
</P>
<P>
   Second, defensive end Michael Strahan, after his chaotic week,
deserves credit for the victory over the Jets by keeping the
defense from disintegrating. Strahan's critical remarks about
Fassel last week while the coach attended the funeral of his mother
might have been ill-timed, but they were needed. Strahan saw how
his defense was sagging, on the verge of giving up on the season,
and knew something needed to be done to rally his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   What most people do not know is that Strahan has spent
inordinate amounts of energy trying to keep the spirits of his
defensive teammates up, meeting with some of them individually in
the locker room or on the practice field, asking everyone to stay
focused.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a day, months or years from now, when Fassel looks
back at this brutal past week and feels both exhilaration, because
he and his staff completely outcoached Bill Parcells, and sadness,
because his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel did both, and more, these past few days. He also saved
his job. &QL;

SUTTON DISCHARGED BY ARMY AFTER 9 YEARS AS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years after he guided Army to a record 10 victories and
won the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, but two days after his
team's third consecutive losing season, Bob Sutton was fired Monday
as Army's coach.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of the 48-year-old Sutton after nine years at West
Point was announced in the wake of the Cadets' 19-9 loss to Navy on
Saturday, their fourth consecutive defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over as the coach after eight seasons as an assistant,
Sutton had had only two winning seasons, in 1993 when the Cadets
were 6-5, and 1996 when Army went 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the loss to Navy cost Sutton his job, Army's first-year
athletic director, Rick Greenspan, who announced Sutton's
dismissal, said: ``The way we played reinforced the concerns we had
over the course of the year. It was a huge game and in some degree
it was a reflection of games throughout the season. Wins and losses
are a huge factor in these decisions, and we feel that we did not
perform particularly well at the end of the season, particularly on
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   No successor was named, but Greenspan said he had already begun
a search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of people in mind,'' Greenspan said. ``We've
already been visiting with some people and have fielded some phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan indicated that academy officials had hoped to be more
competitive in Conference USA, which Army joined last year.
</P>
<P>
   Army had been an independent, whose schedule usually included
several Division I-AA teams such as Lafayette, Colgate, Yale and
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   This year's schedule, by contrast, included games _ both
one-sided loses _against two top-25 teams, East Carolina and
Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that we have upgraded but we feel we should
compete for the conference championship,'' Greenspan said, ``and we
will compete.'' Sutton's teams had competed well against Navy,
winning six of nine games, including five straight from 1992
through 1996 when the Cadets, led by quarterback Ronnie McAda, made
only their fourth bowl appearance. Army had beaten Navy last
season, but that was only the Cadets' third victory of the year.
This season, Army finished at 3-8 for a second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand college football, I understand the coaching
profession, I understand bottom-line philosophy,'' Sutton said. ``I
was only interested in having the opportunity to finish what I
started and to finish what I was promised. I was probably too
idealistic because I felt the academy would not compromise one of
its principles and one of its real bedrock values.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had been under pressure from West Point's alumni,
Greenspan said, ``There are a number of constituencies that we seek
advice from, and we do seek advice and counsel from our grads,
absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's nine-year tenure as coach, during which his teams won
44 games, lost 55 and tied 1, is surpassed in longevity only by
Earl (Red) Blaik who was the coach for 18 years, from 1941 through
1958.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the decision to dismiss Sutton was reached in
Philadelphia Saturday night following the Navy game, and that
Sutton had been informed of his firing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fulfill our contactual obligations to Bob Sutton,''
Greenspan said. ``We just felt that we weren't progressing and that
the program required a change.'' &QL;

N.Y. POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, NOTED FOR SHARP TONGUE, STEPS
DOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The editorial page editor of The New York Post, which
is known for its astringent, sometimes acerbic but always
conservative political voice, has resigned to focus on a variety of
writing jobs, including a twice-weekly column and a planned book
about the 2000 political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the editor, John Podhoretz, from top editor to
multimedia contributor to various outlets of Rupert Murdoch's
empire, followed a meeting on Friday afternoon with Kenneth
Chandler, The Post's publisher. Chandler characterized the move as
a reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been apparent to me for some time that we'd piled a lot
on his plate,'' Chandler said. ``He was responsible for the
editorial pages and the arts and leisure section seven days a week,
and it seemed to me it was too much. We had a discussion on Friday
and he basically agreed. I offered him the column and he agreed.
It's a good outcome for all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his twice-weekly Post column _ an expansion on
his earlier, occasional columns _ Podhoretz writes for the magazine
The Weekly Standard and is a commentator on Fox News. He said he
had resigned to concentrate on his writing. ``I'm burned out,'' he
said. ``It's been a wonderful but a very rough two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Podhoretz, 38, returns to writing in the midst of the undeclared
political battle between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary
Rodham Clinton for the Senate. The Post has been quick to point out
actions and statements that seem to reflect badly on Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's tack on the campaign has been the subject of
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The attention prompted Podhoretz to write, in a column published
on Friday: ``Forgive me if I'm a little self-obsessed, but just
from reading this week's press clips on The New York Post, I have
grown drunk on my own power. Make no mistake, buddy _ cross me and
I'll squash you like a bug. Hey, if I can do it to Hillary Clinton,
the first lady of these United States, just imagine what I can do
to you!''
</P>
<P>
   Podhoretz's keen intellect and sometimes abrasive style won him
mixed reviews in his editing role. He made a public gaffe in July,
after the airplane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., when he
wrote a satirical column along the lines that Joseph P. Kennedy had
sold his soul to the devil in return for his family's success.
</P>
<P>
   That column, which Chandler pulled from the July 22 newspaper
after it ran in one edition, was forgotten by the time Chandler met
with Podhoretz on Friday, Chandler said. The strongly negative
reaction to the column, he added, ``lingered only a couple of
weeks.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike many of her generation, Ellen Enders, 34, is not readily
able to recite the history of Netscape or allude to things in Wired
magazine or otherwise speak with a cocktail-party knowingness about
this decade's high-tech revolution. Still, high tech has been good
to her.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Ms. Enders, who had just completed turns working
as a design assistant for Oscar de la Renta and Randolph Duke,
received a call from Lori Light, a headhunter, that was nearly as
life-changing as a stock tip from Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Light asked Ms. Enders if she'd be interested in meeting a
well-to-do Texan who hoped to start a fashion house and needed a
designer. The Texan happened to be Susan Dell, wife of Michael
Dell, chief executive of the computer company that bears his name,
the No. 1 personal-computer maker in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dell clothes _ quiet suits, shift dresses and gowns that
wouldn't have appeared on ``Dallas'' _ will be sold only at Susan
Dell, the Charles Gwathmey-designed store she has just opened in
Austin, Texas, a city filled with Dell millionaires but with few
up-market boutiques to cater to them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dell studied fashion merchandising at Arizona State
University but was working in commercial real estate when she met
her future husband on a blind date in Austin in the late 1980s.
Finding no wedding dress that she truly loved, she decided to
design her own.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, she said, she began designing suits and evening
clothes for herself, as well as for friends and clients. Recently,
Ms. Dell, a mother of four, decided that she wanted to start a
full-fledged label and hand the designing duties to an expert.
</P>
<P>
   She met 10 young designers before choosing Ms. Enders. ``Ellen
has amazing hands,'' she said. ``I've taken pictures of her hands.
Her drawings dance off the page. My drawings lay there flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Enders left the University of Maryland to attend the Parsons
School of Design in New York. She helped produce fashion shows
before moving to Los Angeles at the encouragement of a childhood
friend, Adam Spiegel, now known as Spike Jonze, the movie director.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Enders had thought about working for Spiegel's skateboard
company, but landed a job instead with Richard Tyler. ``I owe him
everything,'' she said of the designer. ``He really let me develop
my talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Enders' first effort under the Susan Dell label was a
wedding dress decorated with seashells, which she designed for her
friend Julie Taubman, who married in August. The dress won raves
from guests like Tiffany Dubin, head of Sotheby's fashion
department and the bride's sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dell's store is not offering menswear, though Dell is one
of the few high-tech billionaires who don't dress as though they
are going windsurfing. ``He's not a flannel-shirt dude,'' Ms. Dell
said. ``I would have changed that years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Revving Up Halston
</P>
<P>
   During the four seasons that Kevan Hall designed for Halston,
the label, alas, stirred as much buzz as an episode of ``Walker,
Texas Ranger.'' For its spring 2000 collection, in fact, Halston
did not even hold a runway show.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the company, which has been bought by Neema Clothing
Ltd., a men's clothing concern, announced that Hall had been
replaced by Craig Natiello, who worked for Bill Blass for 10 years,
most recently as Blass' senior designer. (Blass retired in
September. The fate of future ready-to-wear collections bearing his
name is uncertain. Another of his head designers, Laura Montalban,
has just moved to Oscar de la Renta.)
</P>
<P>
   Halston's chief executive, Nicholas DeMarco, said that Natiello
was chosen because he understood ``today's woman and her
lifestyle'' and has the talent to expand the Halston line into day
wear. DeMarco also acknowledged that Natiello's connection to
high-profile shoppers like Marina Rust (for whom Natiello designed
a wedding dress this year) was important in making the decision.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that socialites might not be the best
representatives of ``today's woman.'' But Natiello promised that he
would be designing clothes ``not just for the lady who lunches, but
for the lady who works.'' He made another promise, too, which
should delight fashion editors and buyers. He said his fashion
shows would last no longer than 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy, he is not. Natiello got his new job on Saturday and turned
out his first Halston piece, a velvet dress made over the weekend
for the house's public relations director, Laura Henson. She wore
it to the Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
on Monday night.

 &HT;    By Ken Herman

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The six GOP presidential contenders mixed it up Monday
night, albeit cordially, taking advantage of a debate format that
allowed them to question each other.
</P>
<P>
   The event was televised nationwide by CNN, with Arizona Sen.
John McCain participating via satellite from Boston, near where he
has been campaigning in New Hampshire.

<P>
   The event marked Gov. George W. Bush's second debate of the
season. He skipped several debates prior to showing up last
Thursday in Manchester, N.H. for a forum that was more simultaneous
news conference than debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of Monday's night at a Phoenix theater, each
candidate had two chances to question an opponent of his choice.
But in each round, each candidate could be targeted only once.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the candidates to question each other hardly produced
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laid out their own positions, and they were all very safe
questions,'' said Diana Carlin, a professor of communication
studies at the University of Kansas. ``I was disappointed. I
expected a little bit more of going after what the other people are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In both rounds, the first questioner chose to question
frontrunner Bush. Bauer challenged him on China. Publisher Steve
Forbes challenged him on rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer noted that President Ronald Reagan never proposed trade
breaks for the Soviet Union. Bush wants the World Trade
Organization to accept China. Bauer said China, through human
rights abuses, has not earned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no atrocity you can think of that would tell you to
put trade on the back burner?'' Bauer asked Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush wouldn't budge from his belief that trade leads to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make China an enemy they will end up an enemy,'' he
said. ``If we trade with China and give people a taste of freedom I
think you will be amazed, Gary, at how soon democracy will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we turn our backs on China and isolate China things will
get worse,'' Bush said. ``Imagine if the Internet took hold in
China. Imagine how freedom would spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes got to ask the first question in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will surprise you, Judy,'' he told moderator Judy
Woodruff of CNN. ``It goes to George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes challenged Bush to come up with a plan to reverse recent
hikes in oil prices, triggered by OPEC production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had no immediate plan, but said he would ``encourage
exploration'' and has great hope for the continued expansion of
natural gas use.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was unsatisfied with the response, but Bush countered by
saying, ``Governors don't control the price of oil in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to wean ourselves off foreign oil and rely on other
products,'' he said, echoing a popular political mantra dating back
to the gasoline lines of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used his two questions to elicit praise of his programs. In
the first round, though he could have questioned Forbes, Bush opted
to ask Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch what he would do to help the GOP draw
more minority votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve a lot of credit,'' Hatch told Bush. ``You are one
of the Republicans who reached out to women and minorities. I think
that's one of the strongest things you have going for you.''
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up, Bush spoke about his efforts to abolish social
promotion in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been a great governor,'' Hatch told Bush, adding,
however, that a term and a half as governor does not qualify Bush
for the White House. ``I should be president and you should have
eight years with me and, boy, you'd make a heck of a president
after eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Bush asked McCain what he would do to
encourage faith-based organizations to provide social services, a
key plank in the Bush platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are on the right track governor or George or W.
Bush,'' replied McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain took advantage of a Bush follow-up question to
challenge the Texan's belief that continuing surpluses will pay for
his proposed $483-billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not envision surpluses forever,'' said McCain. ``I take
the money for tax breaks out of wasteful spending and corporate
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did last Thursday in New Hampshire, Bush played it close
to the vest, dishing out sound-bite-sized-chunks of his stump
speech whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are saying that he's just reciting lines from his
speeches aren't being fair. Yes, he's doing that, but so are the
others,'' said Dartmouth government professor Linda Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, McCain even pulled a line out of a Forbes speech
and asked, with a sly grin, ``Where have I heard that before?''
</P>
<P>
   Polls here have shown Bush in second place in Arizona, within
striking distance, of McCain. McCain led Bush 39 percent to 31
percent in Arizona in a late-October poll by the Media Research
Program at Arizona State University, but 18 percent of the voters
were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republicans, who backed Steve Forbes in the 1996
primary, vote Feb. 22. McCain has been a ballot-box monster in his
Senate races, grabbing 70 percent of the vote in his 1998
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Since the New Hampshire debate, where his temperament came under
question, McCain has released more than 1,000 pages of medical
records related to treatment after his five years of captivity in
North Vietnam. The records show no reason why McCain, who
acknowledges he has a temper, can't serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who says she has seen McCain's
temper in action, is a Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also was noted for his temper when he was an aide to
his father, although he hasn't lost as cool as governor. Fowler
said she detected signs of his old testiness during an exchange
with Forbes in Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the warmth and personal charm that he's noted for
simply doesn't come across on television,'' she said. ``People may
start to tease him about his temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate came as polls continued to show Bush with a
substantial lead nationwide, but in a neck-and-neck battle with
McCain in New Hampshire, where the Arizona senator hopes to turn a
Feb. 1 victory into a springboard to an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent New Hampshire polls show McCain has closed the
gap to a statistical dead heat with Bush, who had double-digit
leads there in October.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College poll released Monday showed Bush with
support of 37 percent of the 514 Republican respondents, putting
him just a point ahead of McCain. The poll, with a margin of error
of 4 percentage points, was conducted Friday through Sunday.

EXCERPTS FROM FORUM WITH GOP CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBLICANS-DEBATE) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Following are excerpts from the forum Monday night in Phoenix
for the Republican presidential candidates, Gary Bauer, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as recorded by The New York
Times.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Gov. Bush, while you echo the overwhelming majority of
Republicans in saying that most education decisions should be made
at the state and local level, you would mandate federal testing,
cut off federal funds to schools that didn't make the grade and tie
other strings to the federal money that goes to the states. Isn't
this very similar to the Clinton administration approach that so
many Republicans including many of your colleagues here say is the
wrong way for the federal government to be involved in education?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not even close to what President Clinton thinks. I've
got a record of reform in the state of Texas and I'm going to take
that to the White House. I believe that if the federal government
spends money, say on the poorest of the poor children, we need to
ask a simple question: What are the results? What are the results?
Are the children learning? And if they are, we ought to give
bonuses to schools for the poorest of the poor. But if they're not,
if the poorest of the poor remain in trapped schools, that money
that would go to the school should go to the parent so the parent
gets to make a different choice.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in national testing. I believe that local folks
ought to develop their own tests and their own standards because I
strongly believe in local control of schools. I also believe in
charter schools. I believe in education savings accounts to give
parents a $5,000 per year contribution to be able to save for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   No, my plan says less power in Washington, not more...
</P>
<P>
   McCain
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've said a number of times that no good teacher should be
paid less than a bad senator. In January the senators will be
making over $140,000 a year. Now without getting into the question
of whether there are any bad senators, how could you pay anything
even close to that? Who would fund anything even close to that for
the good teachers?
</P>
<P>
   A. You know that I would never allege that there are any bad
senators. I win Miss Congeniality every year as you know in the
Senate. But Connie, Candy, they may not need as much money as
$140,000 a year. Perhaps senators don't need as much as $140,000 a
year. When we vote ourselves pay raises all the time and the
American worker is not making nearly the increases that we are,
it's really wrong. But look, we need to test vouchers, we don't
need to take the money from public education. We need to do away
with corporate welfare, put that money so they'll be a test voucher
program in the poorer school districts in every district in
America. We shouldn't have any federal bureaucrat deciding whether
money should go to the states or not. That's decided by Lisa Graham
Keegan and the people that I trust in the state of Arizona to run
our education, not the federal bureaucracy in Washington and I'll
keep them out of it. I'll give the money where it belongs...
</P>
<P>
   Forbes
</P>
<P>
   Q. Look back at the past seven years. We have 20 million new
jobs, 4.1 percent unemployment, low inflation, more than a tripling
of the stock market, yet you have been critical not only as many of
your rivals here have been of the incumbent president's economic
stewardship, but also of the job performance of the Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan. What in your view has Mr. Greenspan done
wrong? And if you are elected president, who would you nominate to
replace him?
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all the prosperity that we're enjoying today, those
foundations were laid by Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s. Let's
not forget that. And it was the Republicans who stopped some of the
destructive nonsense of the Clinton-Gore administration that
enabled us to enjoy the prosperity we have today.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the Federal Reserve, as I've said before, Mr.
Greenspan did a very good job in the early 1990s. But in the last
couple of years he's fallen prey, fallen for this crazy theory,
John, that prosperity causes inflation. And so they're trying to
slow the economy down by raising interest rates. Why? It's like
going to a doctor. The doctor says, John, you're in great health,
so we have to make you sick a little bit. It's a bizarre theory.
And it's already wrought havoc in agriculture. It's going to hurt
our economy and in terms of a replacement, there are a number of
good people out there, Jack Kemp, the head of the Dallas Reserve
Bank as well, the people who understand it...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Keyes
</P>
<P>
   Q. Under your plan to substitute a 23 percent national sales tax
for the current federal income tax, a poor family could save all
year to buy a bicycle for their child for Christmas and pay the
same tax as a wealthy family does. So no matter how many items you
set aside and make exempt from sales tax, isn't at the heart of it
this kind of tax something that disproportionately hits the poor
over the wealthy?
</P>
<P>
   A. It can't possibly be. The present tax system, which allows
you to escape taxation if you're wealthy enough to pay accountants
and lawyers, is what disproportionately hits the poor and the
working middle-class people of this country. Under my system you
don't pay taxes until you decide how to spend your own money. And
when you take it to this door and decide how to spend it, if you
can't afford to be heavily taxed right now you will confine
yourself to those goods that are not taxed, to those goods that are
necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, that's going to mean some sacrifices. But it puts the
question of how you develop your wealth base back under your
control. You don't have to beg politicians and bureaucrats to get
back in control of your own hard-earned dollars. But it also means
that if you're a working person, think about it, before you have
put bread in the mouths of your children, before you put a roof
over the head of those children, before you put a stitch of clothes
on their backs today, you pay the government. We're worse off than
serfs. Serfs used to pay their masters after they were fed and
clothed. We have to pay our master before we're fed and clothed. I
think, I think it's a travesty. And I think it's time we ended
it...
</P>
<P>
   Hatch
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have spoken of scrapping the current income tax code and
replacing it with a national sales tax, and you've said you're
working on a plan. With just seven weeks until the people of Iowa
cast the first votes in this race, can you tell us tonight what
that rate would be and what specific exemptions you would propose
to deal with the criticism as we've discussed that such a tax could
hurt the very poor people it's intended to help?
</P>
<P>
   A. Look, I'm for any tax plan that will simplify this awful tax
code. I'm on the Senate Finance Committee. I deal with these
matters every day. And I've got to tell you anybody in this room
can be indicted for violations of the tax code because no two tax
preparers in the IRS can prepare the same return.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'd like to see something like Alan's talking about because
then people could determine what they pay by the consumption that
they make. We're certainly going to have to take care of the poor
through some mechanism that they will not have to pay as much as
others.

BELL ATLANTIC-VODAFONE VENTURE CLEARS A HURDLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain won
conditional approval from the justice department Monday for their
September deal to combine their United States wireless operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the two companies, along with GTE, which has agreed to merge
with Bell Atlantic, will have to get rid of billions of dollars
worth of cellular systems and millions of customers before they
allowed complete the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to foster competition, federal rules prohibit companies
from owning more than one major wireless system in any given
market. Because the three companies are each big wireless players,
they have significant overlaps from San Francisco to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   So the companies have agreed to dispose of systems with about
three million customers, covering almost a fifth of the United
States population, about 49 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the combined United States operations of the three
companies will become the nation's No. 1 wireless phone carrier,
with about 21 million ``proportionate'' customers and systems
covering about 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless companies use proportions to count their partial
interest in other carriers. &QL;

   PHOENIX _ The six GOP presidential contenders mixed it up Monday
night, albeit cordially, taking advantage of a debate format that
allowed them to question each other.
</P>
<P>
   The event was televised nationwide by CNN, with Arizona Sen.
John McCain participating via satellite from Boston, near where he
has been campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The event marked Gov. George W. Bush's second debate of the

his father, although he hasn't lost as cool as governor. Fowler
said she detected signs of his old testiness during an exchange
with Forbes in Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the warmth and personal charm that he's noted for
simply doesn't come across on television,'' she said. ``People may
start to tease him about his temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate came as polls continued to show Bush with a
substantial lead nationwide, but in a neck-and-neck battle with
McCain in New Hampshire, where the Arizona senator hopes to turn a
Feb. 1 victory into a springboard to an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent New Hampshire polls show McCain has closed the
gap to a statistical dead heat with Bush, who had double-digit
leads there in October.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College poll released Monday showed Bush with
support of 37 percent of the 514 Republican respondents, putting
him just a point ahead of McCain. The poll, with a margin of error
of 4 percentage points, was conducted Friday through Sunday.

ANNE FRANCINE, 82, ACTRESS AND CABARET SINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Francine, an actress who worked in film, theater and
television and who was also a prominent cabaret performer for six
decades, died on Friday at the Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in
London, Conn. She was 82 and lived in Old Lyme, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Born into Main Line Philadelphia society, Miss Francine came of
age during the 1930s, when New York's numerous intimate night spots
offered opportunities for beginners. With her imposing good looks,
bawdy humor and raspy contralto, she made her performing debut at
the Coq Rouge, after winning an amateur contest, and went on to
engagements at the Pierre, the Persian Room, the Copacabana and the
Algonquin.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1940s she traveled abroad, singing in late-night
haunts in London and Paris. Impeccably mannered and beautifully
spoken, she centered her programs on the flippant high-society
songs of Cole Porter and Jerome Kern, inserting comedic gestures
often funny enough to bring the house down.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Francine made her Broadway debut in 1954 with Shirley Booth
in ``By the Beautiful Sea'' before going on to work with Alfred
Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in ``The Great Sebastians'' the next season.
In the APA-Phoenix Repertory Company production of ``The School for
Scandal'' she stepped in for a vacationing Helen Hayes. But her
favorite role was that of Vera Charles in the 1966 Broadway
production of ``Mame,'' starring Angela Lansbury. She and Ms.
Lansbury reprised their characters in the 1983 revival. Ms.
Francine last appeared on Broadway in 1987 as Mrs. Harcourt in the
Lincoln Center revival of ``Anything Goes,'' starring Patti LuPone.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Francine's film work included ``Crocodile Dundee'' and
Fellini's ``Juliet of the Spirits.'' On television she was best
known for her portrayal of the conniving matriarch Flora Simpson
Reilly in ``Harper Valley P.T.A.,'' with Barbara Eden, in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent performer on the summer stock circuit, Miss Francine
was a regular presence at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in
Waterford, Conn., where she taught at the annual cabaret symposium.
Even after a 1992 stroke left her unable to speak, she would
instruct students by pantomiming her commands or writing them on an
erasable box designed for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate relatives survive.

QUIETLY, TOBACCO GIANT FIGHTS LOCAL SMOKING BANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after health officials in Dutchess County, N.Y., announced
plans last year to prohibit smoking in restaurants, they realized
that an unfamiliar lobbyist named John F. Gillespie was shadowing
them whenever they publicly deliberated the issue. At hearings,
there he was, always in the background, sometimes scribbling notes,
but never rising to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The officials eventually learned of Gillespie's mission. Just
days before they were to approve the smoking ban in August, the
County Legislature took the unprecedented step of voting to revoke
their authority over such rules. The legislative measure was
introduced by the majority leader, Mark Sheedy, who later
acknowledged that it was based on a draft provided by Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie identified himself to lawmakers as a lobbyist for the
Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, a trade group
worried that a ban would drive away patrons. He did not volunteer
that his primary client was Philip Morris, the world's largest
cigarette maker, which has paid him as much as $4,000 a month to
fight local smoking restrictions in the region north of New York
City, according to company documents.
</P>
<P>
   Local legislative bodies have become a crucial arena in the
debate over smoking in New York, and Philip Morris has responded
with a costly lobbying campaign, deploying a squad of lobbyists
across the state, including three former state assemblymen. At the
same time, the company is increasingly trying to keep its
activities out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is a part of the tentacles of the tobacco
industry,'' Dr. Michael C. Caldwell, the Dutchess health
commissioner, said after learning of Gillespie's ties to Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris has often been able to challenge such proposed
smoking restrictions without drawing attention to itself because
most localities do not require the disclosure of lobbying expenses,
as is mandated at state and federal levels. But Philip Morris'
internal documents, which were revealed in litigation over smokers'
damages, detail some of its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   New York has historically had more grass-roots antismoking
advocacy than the rest of the country, and the antismoking groups,
emboldened by recent defeats of the tobacco industry nationally,
are renewing their campaign for more local restrictions. Philip
Morris, despite seeking to change its image recently by
acknowledging links between smoking and cancer, is not backing
down. Still, the company is shunning the spotlight, as it did when
it helped defeat a ban on smoking in restaurants earlier this year
in Wayne County, near Rochester, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very careful about his presence,'' Michael Santelli,
the leader of the Wayne County restaurant owners, said of the
Philip Morris lobbyist there, former Assemblyman James Nagle. ``He
basically attended each meeting, but kept his mouth shut. He wanted
to give us the tools to fight the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, which makes
Marlboro and other brands, declined to comment on individual
lobbyists. But she said Philip Morris was not trying to conceal its
lobbying. ``You would have to be not paying much attention to think
that we don't have a position in this area,'' she said. ``We are
very, very active, and openly so.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's internal documents show that Philip Morris has
been spending at least $40,000 a month on local lobbying in New
York _ and sometimes much more. Few companies have ever spent that
much on lobbying in Albany or at the local level, where
professional lobbyists are uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   In Niagara County, the National Smokers Alliance, an advocacy
group set up and largely financed by Philip Morris, paid for
mailings by restaurateurs, as well as a suit in which a ban on
smoking in restaurants adopted by county health officials was
overturned on the grounds that the officials had overstepped their
authority. The county then put in place more lenient rules based on
a model used in Spokane, Wash. _ an idea urged by a Philip Morris
lobbyist, Matthew Murphy, another former assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, Philip Morris worked closely with the
Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, the same group
linked to the company in the current fight in Dutchess County. The
company paid the group to hire an influential local lobbyist,
Albert J. Pirro Jr., in an unsuccessful bid to defeat a ban on
smoking in restaurants in the county, according to the group's
executive director, Scott Wexler.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most populous counties have snubbed the company on
some issues and enacted measures _ from bans on smoking in
restaurants to restrictions on cigarette displays and advertising _
that are more restrictive than state laws. Still, most counties and
localities in the state have not imposed such rules, in part
because of the company's lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The antismoking groups have focused on regulating smoking at the
local level because Philip Morris, a prominent player in Albany,
has blocked tougher statewide restrictions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Philip Morris' activities in the state capital was
revealed in a recent investigation of the company by the Temporary
State Commission on Lobbying. Philip Morris admitted that Sharon T.
Portnoy, its chief New York lobbyist, had underreported her state
lobbying expenditures on mandatory disclosure records by hundreds
of thousands of dollars. Such oversight does not exist on the local
level.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strategy was laid out in a speech that an
executive, Tina A. Walls, gave to its lobbyists in 1993. According
to her text, she emphasized that Philip Morris had to be well
versed in local politics. Ms. Walls said the company's lobbyists
should keep the company out of the media; create coalitions with
other groups, such as restaurant associations, to ``carry our
baggage on issues;'' and ``try to change the focus'' of debates on
proposed restrictions by, for example, stressing freedom of speech
and of choice rather than smokers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Those guidelines seem evident in the work of Gillespie, the
Philip Morris lobbyist in Dutchess County. He apparently first
played an important role for Philip Morris when the company
successfully worked to derail a proposed ban on smoking in
restaurants in Rockland County in 1994. At the time, Gillespie
handed out business cards identifying himself as president of the
Restaurant and Hospitality Association of Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie and the restaurant owners are continuing to fight the
ban in Dutchess County, which applies to restaurants and other
public places. After the vote by the Republican-controlled
Legislature limiting their power to restrict smoking, in August,
health officials approved the ban anyway. The county executive,
William R. Steinhaus, a Republican, then vetoed the Legislature's
measure, allowing the ban to stand. It is not yet being enforced,
and talks are being held on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone interview, Gillespie said he represented
the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, not Philip
Morris. But he also acknowledged that he worked for a lobbying firm
called Statewide Corporate Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The internal documents revealed in the smoking litigation show
that since the early 1990s, Gillespie has either been paid directly
by Philip Morris or by Statewide Corporate Strategies, which is
retained by Philip Morris to oversee most of its local lobbying in
the state and is run by Arthur J. Kremer, a powerful former
assemblyman from Long Island. In recent years, Philip Morris has
paid Statewide roughly $37,500 a month, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone for a follow-up interview, Gillespie
declined to comment further.

CHARGES DROPPED IN DEALER'S BULLET EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charges were dismissed Monday against a prominent
Manhattan art dealer who was arrested two months ago after
displaying a sculpture of shotguns and pistols in her gallery and
having a vase full of live 9 mm cartridges for visitors to take
home.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, Mary Boone, who called her brush with the criminal
justice system ``an adventure,'' had been charged with unlawful
distribution of ammunition. At the time, a police official said it
was ``irresponsible, at the very least'' for Ms. Boone to be
distributing the live ammunition to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, said that Morgenthau asked the
judge to drop the charges ``based on the facts of the case and a
review of the criminal evidence.'' If Ms. Boone does not break the
law in the next six months, the charges will be dropped and her
case sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Boone called the judge's decision ``a win
for the First Amendment'' and said that the night and day she was
held in the Manhattan Detention Complex was a ``kind of interesting
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is the only thing I believe in, and I'm glad to be
arrested over it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's battle with the Brooklyn
Museum of Art over the ``Sensation'' exhibition amounted to saying
that art is ``dangerous and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken decades to make people feel safe and interested to
come to art galleries, and I want that to continue,'' Ms. Boone
said. She also said that what she called the mayor's censorship has
``strengthened the art world.'' Ms. Boone was arrested and the guns
and ammunition were confiscated after a New York Post reporter
questioned the police about them, officials said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone said that the artwork, by Tom Sachs, was a statement
against the commonness of violence and weapons. Visitors could take
the ammunition home in orange air-sickness bags as souvenirs. ``The
irony was the artist was making a statement against the
accessibility of guns and bullets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, while praising Morgenthau for moving to drop the
charges, said Ms. Boone's arrest was not necessarily a First
Amendment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very possible that she cannot display live bullets,'' he
said, but he added that he thought ``dragging her off, putting her
in jail,'' instead of simply warning her, was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the art in Brooklyn were not such a controversy, it would
have been handled in a low-key way,'' he said. ``The mayor is
creating a climate in New York that is chilling to expressive
people, to creativity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Amy Adler, a New York University professor who teaches First
Amendment and art law, agreed that the arrest of Ms. Boone might
have been based on a bias against art or intellectuals. But Ms.
Boone was arrested because the artworks violated public-safety
standards, not because of their content or meaning, and so the
First Amendment protection of free expression would not protect the
display, Ms. Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the police nor the mayor's office responded to telephone
calls on Monday asking for their comments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone said she did not expect the current display at the
Mary Boone Gallery to draw any visits from the police. It shows
photographs of 700 artists and art dealers, collectors and critics,
and she has included a portrait of Giuliani among the critics.

BORDERS EVENTS TO GO DIGITAL IN DEAL WITH CENTERSEAT.COM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Borders.com, the online spinoff of Borders Group, the nation's
No. 2 bookseller behind Barnes &AMP; Noble, has struck an alliance with
an Internet start-up to create virtual entertainment from thousands
of author lectures and appearances at Borders bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Called Borders Vision, the bookstore events will become video
material for Centerseat, a digital company based in New York that
was founded in the spring and is developing Internet programming
that will mix filmed scenes with opportunities to order products.
</P>
<P>
   For example, filmed segments of a Borders appearance by J.K.
Rowling, the author of the popular Harry Potter children's books,
will be shown online along with separate promotions for the books,
which can be ordered at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about moving the Borders brand name into an
entirely new arena,'' said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for Borders.com.
``I don't know where this will go, but we're creating a digital
media version of Borders that we're pretty excited about.'' He
estimated that Borders holds as many as 90,000 events featuring
authors and artists.
</P>
<P>
   Centerseat is preparing to introduce its new Web site,
Centerseat.com, which it calls ``an integrated entertainment,
information and commerce experience,'' early next year. Over the
last few months, the company has been signing deals with an
eclectic assortment of personalities to develop its Internet
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Prague Symphony Orchestra and the State Opera of Prague
agreed in October to create programming for Centerseat, as did Ken
Robinson, host of the Travel Minute radio show. In November,
Centerseat announced programming deals with George Hirsch, a chef
who was also the host of a series on grilling for PBS, and James
Hong, an Asian-American actor who will be the host of a martial
arts show and a celebrity cooking show, ``In the Kitchen with James
Hong.''
</P>
<P>
   Centerseat was founded by its chief executive, Scott Harmolin,
who sold his company, Icon CMT, to Qwest Communications last
September in a $185 million stock trade.

BALLET AND STRIKING ORCHESTRA REACH TENTATIVE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A tentative agreement has been reached between the
New York City Ballet and its orchestra, which has been on strike
for two weeks over proposed new work rules.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet has performed its traditional holiday offering, ``The
Nutcracker,'' to taped music in the orchestra's absence.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached on Friday between the ballet
management and a negotiating team from Local 802 of the American
Federation of Musicians. Before the agreement can take effect, it
must be ratified by the orchestra's 70 members. A vote began Monday
and is expected to conclude Tuesday afternoon, when the tally will
be announced.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company said it hoped the musicians would
return to work in time for Tuesday night's performance at the New
York State Theater at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has had little effect on ticket sales, which are
always strong for this perennial seasonal classic.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue in the negotiations, which began early last
month, was a demand by City Ballet for more stringent attendance
rules at rehearsals and performances. Musicians and management were
said to have agreed on attendance rules that would apply to all
members of the orchestra, rather than to new members only, as the
ballet had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The union had feared that two sets of work rules would divide
its membership and weaken the union.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would divulge details of the settlement before the
conclusion of the ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   The company wanted newly hired musicians to play six
performances a week and rehearse twice weekly. There is no
rehearsal requirement now. Under the company's original plan,
current orchestra members could voluntarily accept the new rules
and receive pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet had also offered the musicians a 3.7 percent
increase in the first year of a multiyear contract. The musicians
are under contract to play 23 weeks a year, with a base salary of
$35,000. The ballet said orchestra members earn an average of
$66,000 a year when seniority and benefits are included.
</P>
<P>
   For years, union musicians playing for City Ballet and other
dance troupes have been allowed unpaid leaves from rehearsals and
performances if qualified substitutes could be found. Christopher
Ramsey, the company's director of external affairs, said the new
attendance rules were ``to ensure the highest possible level of
quality for our performances.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Macourt, a bassoonist, said the company's scheduling created
problems for musicians with other commitments, particularly since
rehearsal schedules are announced just before the start of each
season. By that time the musicians have often booked other
engagements. ``Other jobs don't fit neatly into holes in the New
York City Ballet schedule,'' Macourt said.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians walked out on the evening of the company's
opening-night gala performance, which was canceled. Management
turned down a musicians' offer to continue performing for six
months under an extended contract during negotiations, with a 4.5
percent wage increase. Both sides agreed that the musicians would
play through holiday performances of ``The Nutcracker,'' which
opened on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   But the musicians refused to play through the spring if
negotiations were not concluded. City Ballet then said it would
perform ``The Nutcracker'' to taped music, an action that the
musicians said amounted to a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers, represented by the American Guild of Musical
Artists, and the stagehands, members of Local One of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, have
continued to work.

10 ARRESTED AT RALLY AGAINST CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying they wanted to test the mayor's pledge that
homeless people would not be arrested merely for being homeless, 10
people, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, were arrested Monday night
after they spread tents and tarps and sat down on a wet concrete
patch of City Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the protesters were arrested because they had
broken Parks Department rules by trying to camp. One by one, the
three women and seven men were handcuffed and led to a police van
on Broadway. A clutch of other protesters, who seemed to be
outnumbered by police officers, kept up a steady refrain. ``No
housing, no peace,'' they chanted. ``No jobs, no peace. No justice,
no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, part of larger rally that police say drew about 50
people, took no more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Vincent Gravelli, a police spokesman, said the
protesters were cited for unlawful camping, erecting a structure in
a park, demonstrating with more than 20 people without a permit,
and failing to comply with police orders.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the protesters, Michael Hardy, said camping was not
part of their plans. ``They took the tarpaulins to sit on because
the ground was wet,'' he said. ``They weren't trying to camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest Monday night was the latest display of public outcry
directed at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent initiatives against
homelessness. Giuliani has said he will require the homeless to
work for their shelter, and the police have begun to arrest
homeless people who refuse shelter and insist instead on sleeping
on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, protesters led by the Coalition for the Homeless, a
citywide advocacy group, held a rally and an all-night vigil in
Union Square Park. The police warned that the protesters would be
arrested if they fell asleep or lay down on the ground. With the
help of coffee and conversation and a man who sang Neil Young
tunes, they managed to stay awake and avoid arrest. Organizers said
the vigil drew about 90 people. Between 2:30 and 3 a.m., a renegade
group of six men and women walked across the street and lay down on
the sidewalk. They were issued summonses for disorderly conduct and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir had warned that
protesters who planned to erect what they described as a ``a tent
city'' at City Hall Park would be arrested. ``If you do set up a
structure, you are violating city regulations,'' Safir said at his
daily news briefing. ``If someone attempts to do that they will be
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating the administration's position, Safir said that since
the heightened enforcement against homelessness, police officers
have arrested only those homeless people who break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not arrest people for being homeless; we arrest people
who commit crimes,'' he said. ``Our people approach the homeless
and offer them assistance, offer to take them to a hospital, offer
to take them to a shelter. They are only arrested if they are
committing a separate crime which has nothing to do with the fact
that they are homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Sharpton said he wanted to test the Mayor's promise.
``He said he's not arresting people for sleeping in the streets,''
Sharpton said of Giuliani. ``Only for breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Blumberg, who lives nearby, brought his 9-year-old son and
another child to watch the protests Monday night. It was not only
outrage at the mayor's crackdown on the homeless that brought him,
he said, but also his support for public protest in the newly
refurbished and sealed-off City Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who was in Rochester Monday for a fund-raiser for his
potential United States Senate bid, said that in recent weeks, the
police had ``approached'' about 2,000 people who appeared to be
homeless and that 190 of them had been arrested. The charges
against them ranged from disorderly conduct and urinating in
public, to robbery and trespassing. He did not speak specifically
about the City Hall Park protest.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Hyatt Hotel in Rochester, a circle of nine
protesters greeted Giuliani with messages resembling those he has
heard in the city. They chanted, ``Stop picking on the homeless,
Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign read, ``Giuliani kicks people when they're down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard terrible things from people in New York City,''
said one protester, Sister Rita Lewis, of the House of Mercy, a
religious group that works with the homeless in Rochester. ``We
don't want him representing us. He's just too mean, too mean to
poor people.''

AT JOEY ADAMS MEMORIAL, A FEW MORE LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So there was this state senator who had to introduce
the other speakers at a memorial service, see. So to get things
going, he read a passage not from the Bible, but from Chapter 32 of
the bible of that club for aging comedians, the Friars.
</P>
<P>
   With not one but two jokes _ and an explanation, State Sen. Roy
M. Goodman began Sunday's service for Joey Adams, the borscht belt
comedian and humor columnist who died last week at 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy was Joey's mantra,'' said Goodman, a Republican from
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Half the pews in the second-floor chapel had been set aside for
Friars Club members, and among the Friars who attended were Alan
King, the group's abbot, and Freddie Roman, its dean.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the crowd was a blend of figures from entertainment,
politics and the news media, including the New York City police
commissioner, Howard Safir, and Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and
chief executive of the News Corp., which owns the New York Post,
where Adams had worked.
</P>
<P>
   Others who attended the service included the actors Danny
Aiello, Alan Alda, Anthony Quinn, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara; the
talk-show hosts Joan Rivers and Joe Franklin; the comedian Pat
Cooper; the theatrical producer Martin Richards; former Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato and Imelda Marcos, the widow of the dictator
Ferdinand E. Marcos. Mrs. Marcos had sung ``Happy Birthday'' to
Adams when he turned 80.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Goodman also quoted from a book by Adams, ``The God Bit''
(Manor Books, 1974). ``For a funny guy, there's a lot of theology
in there,'' Goodman said later. ``I actually found myself reading
it as a theological tract.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage he read from ``The God Bit'' was about a trip to
Indonesia _ where Adams said the temperature had been 105 degrees,
but his wife, Cindy, had had a fever that was higher. Then in a
torrent Adams remembered and recited all the spiritually based
one-liners that she had pasted on the refrigerator, her night table
and the bathroom mirror back home. They sang a few hymns, and she
got better.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Mrs. Adams, a celebrity columnist for the Post, said she
could not cry, explaining, ``I have false eyelashes on.'' She also
said that after her husband died, the first two calls she received
were from ``Rudy and Hillary'' _ in that order _ referring to Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, two likely
opponents in next year's race for the United States Senate seat
being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She added, ``I don't know
whether it's anything about the polls, but it was first Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Riverside Memorial Chapel laughed, as it did
often during the 45-minute service. After another joke or two,
Goodman introduced Rabbi Joseph Potasnik _ ``the radio rabbi,''
Goodman called him, referring to his appearances on a local news
station _ who led the crowd in reciting the 23rd Psalm. ``I don't
know if it's in the Friars' bible,'' Rabbi Potasnik said, ``but I
suppose the Friars know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani said that Adams ``loved people and he knew how to
make them laugh.'' Referring to Adams and his reverence for
Fiorello H. La Guardia, whom Giuliani called ``the legendary
greatest mayor,'' Giuliani suggested he might name the next airport
after Joey Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adams talked about how Adams had introduced her to
celebrities and their world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything for me,'' she said, including starting her
on her career _ ``he gave me the Rolodex,'' she said at one point.
``And then I began to do everything for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. David James Randolph, a former pastor of Christ
United Methodist Church in Manhattan, said Adams was ``the only
person I know who sang with Al Jolson, marched with Martin Luther
King and seemed to have lunch every day at the Friars Club.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw him, he was sitting up, a nurse at each
side,'' Dr. Randolph went on. ``I said, `Joey, are you
comfortable?' One beat and he said, `I make a living.'''

N.Y. UNIVERSITY SYSTEM PICKS PATAKI'S BUDGET CHIEF   AS
CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling with a large deficit, the State University of New
York, the nation's largest university, is on the verge of choosing
Gov. George E. Pataki's budget director as the next chancellor of
the 64-campus system.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of the budget director, Robert L. King, announced
Monday by a search committee headed by the chairman of SUNY's
trustees, strengthens Pataki's influence at the university. Since
he took office, several former officials and allies have taken jobs
there.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Egan, SUNY's chairman and head of the search
committee, said he thought King had the skills to work with the
campuses and to advance SUNY ``to the front ranks of American
public higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics have questioned whether the appointment of
leaders linked to the governor has politicized the university. They
say they fear that Pataki's intention is to install administrators
who will stress budget-cutting and efficiency, rather than academic
quality, and raise tuition while reducing the share of the budget
carried by taxpayers. Students at the four-year colleges pay $3,400
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The search committee voted unanimously to recommend King to the
full board of trustees, which is expected to approve the
appointment when it meets Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   King will replace John W. Ryan, an experienced educator and
longtime president of Indiana University, who started as interim
chancellor in 1996 and became permanent chancellor the next year.
He will remain a consultant and chancellor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   The selection comes at a time when the university, which has
370,000 students and 27,000 faculty members, is facing a $77
million deficit in its $1.65 billion annual budget, caused by the
impact of the managed care era on teaching hospitals affiliated
with SUNY campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The State University is a sprawling archipelago of campuses in
virtually every corner of the state. It includes four research
universities _ in Binghamton, Stony Brook, Albany and Buffalo _ as
well as four-year colleges, community colleges and specialized
agricultural and technical colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But to the frustration of its own officials, none of the
campuses have the reputation of the great flagship campuses in
state systems like those in California, Texas and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   King, 52, has little experience in higher education other than
his work as a trustee for the Monroe County Community College
Foundation. But he is well versed in politics, finance and
administration, having served as a state assemblyman, the county
executive of Monroe County and, most recently, as state budget
director.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Daniels, a trustee who served on the search committee,
said King's extensive knowledge of the state and its budgetary and
political environment were significant factors in his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, said King had
``played an important role in the changes Governor Pataki has
brought about in this state over the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, King, who describes himself as a strict
conservative politically and fiscally, said he thought his
friendship with the governor would be an asset for SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone can persuade the governor about the rightness of
something for the university, it is me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that relationship might give the governor a
greater chance to shape SUNY policy, rather than the other way
around, King answered, ``Whatever it is I've been asked to do or
chosen to do, I've done with the guideposts of the best interests
of the people I'm serving.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The last thing that he would want or that I would
want at the end of the day is for someone to say, `These are the
guys who ruined the university.'''
</P>
<P>
   King will be SUNY's first chancellor appointed from outside the
academic life, at a time when universities and higher education
systems in states like Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Ohio have
increasingly looked outside their own ranks for top administrators
to bring managerial skills and a sense of accountability.

THE HEALTH PROFESSION IS HIS WORST PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the dozen years he worked in emergency rooms,
Dr. Mark Chassin must have won high marks for his bedside manner.
Because even when he is agitated, his voice rarely registers above
a reassuring whisper, the kind you hear on classical radio stations
in the middle of the night when the DJ is introducing Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   The voice comes in especially handy these days, as Chassin finds
himself attending to another kind of patient, one that can be
notoriously resistant to treatment: the health profession itself.
</P>
<P>
   Chassin was one of a group of researchers who helped write a
recent report that gave credence to the worst fears of everyone who
has ever seen a loved one wheeled into an emergency room. The
report, issued by the Institute of Medicine, found that 44,000 to
98,000 hospital patients die every year from medical mistakes like
prescription mix-ups, misuse of equipment or surgical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths outnumber those caused by highway accidents or by
breast cancer or by AIDS. As if the number needed to be further
underscored, another author said it was comparable to the death
toll from three jumbo jets filled with patients crashing every two
days.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the medical profession, it was a stunning
revelation. But it did not surprise Chassin, a former New York
state health commissioner and now a professor of health policy at
Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It has been his calling, his obsession and, off and on through
the years, his paying job to serve as a kind of industrial engineer
for the medical profession, asking the same questions that airlines
ask of their pilots or even _ doctors might want to skip the rest
of this sentence _ carmakers of their assembly-line workers.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that Chassin and others in the field have reached
is that medicine, the quintessential life-and-death business, lags
dangerously behind many other industries in its approach to errors.
While individual doctors are, by and large, zealously committed to
the safety of their patients, they work in a pressure-filled
environment with not enough thinking about how to ensure safety for
all patients.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Chassin put it the other day in his office: ``For years,
if quality ever came up, it was something like `We got rid of Dr.
Jones because he was drunk all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Manhasset as the grandson of a general
practitioner, the son of a general surgeon and the nephew of an
internist _ ``I've always had a stethoscope around my neck _ I
should have brought the baby pictures to prove it,'' he says _
Chassin was wondering about these issues by the time he was a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   On rounds with his father at the old Booth Memorial Hospital in
Queens, he would ask: ``What happens when someone isn't so good?
How do you fix that?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a doctor himself, in emergency rooms in
Southern California, he discovered that the problem was about much
more than questions of a doctor's competence.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled an incident he witnessed while on duty in which a
patient needed a dose of lidocaine to treat an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   A surgical intern quickly grabbed a vial of the drug from the
emergency-room crash cart. Thinking that it would take too long to
inject it with a needle, he squirted it directly into the patient's
intravenous tube. But instead of the 100 milligrams he thought he
was using, the intern had grabbed a vial containing 2 grams of
undiluted lidocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he killed the patient,'' Chassin said.
</P>
<P>
   The story is the stuff of television dramas, but he tells it to
make a less dramatic point: ``This thing was sitting there, and it
was physically possible for it to be manipulated to connect it to
the wrong thing.'' After the mistake, he said, no one thought to
take the vial containing the higher dosage off the cart, and the
same mistake could have been repeated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, Chassin, 52, has often been the bearer of
warnings that some in the medical establishment would rather not
hear.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he believes that traditional one- and two-doctor
medical practices are obsolete because most do not have the capital
to buy computers and other equipment needed to remain current with
rapidly changing medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that many medical schools are not preparing students
for a world in which scientific knowledge is expanding too quickly
for them to memorize even a fraction of it.
</P>
<P>
   Most strongly, he believes that the reluctance of hospitals to
admit and monitor mistakes must change if the system is going to
change. Borrowing from W. Edwards Deming, the late management guru,
he said, ``The guys don't come to the assembly line in the morning
wanting to screw up the parts as they go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the more complicated the systems are that we put people
in, the more liable they are to have circumstances where it's hard
to do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a long interview in which Chassin expounds on
these issues in his soothing exam-room voice, a question naturally
comes up. What does his father, who recently retired, think of his
role as a kind of doctor to the doctors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should not tell you this,'' he says, ``because I
don't think he'd like to see it in print, but he said he never
thought I'd make a living at it.''

LEGAL SYSTEM IS FAULTED IN PAST DEALINGS WITH BRICK CASE SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID ROHDE and SOMINI SENGUPTA    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judges, prosecutors and legal experts say last week's
arrest of Paris Drake, the man accused of bashing a woman with a
brick in Midtown, starkly revealed the inability of New York's
courts, prisons and parole system either to rehabilitate
drug-addicted petty criminals or to get them off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, 32, had been jailed nearly two dozen times since he was a
teenager, racking up a lengthy criminal record as a burglar, fare
beater and small-time drug dealer with a penchant for brawling. In
the past eight years, the longest he stayed out of jail was 17
days.
</P>
<P>
   As the extent of his record emerged in recent days, those most
familiar with New York's criminal justice system said in interviews
that it lacked the tools for dealing with low-level career
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, portraying
Drake as a dangerous predator who received too many slaps on the
wrist from judges, have proposed legislation that would sharply
increase the penalties for chronic low-level offenders. Robert M.
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, and others have called
for the appointment of more Criminal Court judges, so that the
overburdened system would rely less on plea bargains in misdemeanor
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Others have pointed to the system's failure to address what
could have been the engine of Drake's criminal career _ his drug
addiction. Two of the three felony convictions that landed Drake in
state prison were for drug sales. He was caught with drugs in
prison during his most recent stint. Almost every time he came up
for parole, he was ordered to seek substance abuse treatment. He
never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly would appear to be a candidate for drug
treatment,'' said Tom Grant, a spokesman for the state parole
board. ``Except he didn't cooperate one iota.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake's first drug arrest came in 1991. By then, he already had
two felony convictions _ for attempted assault in 1987 and burglary
in 1988. Under the state's mandatory sentencing guidelines, he had
effectively forgone his chance at drug treatment as an alternative
to prison. Prisoners' advocates have called for the scrapping of
such mandatory sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, the
country's largest drug treatment agency, said Drake's punishment
should have included treatment based on his ``total state of
dysfunction.'' But only during his third and latest stint in state
prison was Drake ordered into substance abuse treatment. James
Flateau, a spokesman for the State Department of Corrections, could
not provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator,
said the laws proposed last week by the mayor and governor for
repeat misdemeanor offenders would remove chronic criminals like
Drake from the street. But Morgenthau, judges and the city bar
association have long said that the best way to ensure longer jail
terms for petty criminals is to pressure the state legislature to
appoint more Criminal Court judges.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, court officials have asked the
legislature to create 23 more Criminal Court judgeships in the
city, but disputes over political patronage have repeatedly
scuttled a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that New York's criminal courts, overwhelmed by
the crush of cases generated by the mayor's crackdown on quality of
life crimes, have been granting plea bargains in 99 percent of
misdemeanor cases in part because there are so few judges available
for trials.

DAIGLE SETS THE TABLE FOR RANGERS' REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one thing that has hurt the New York
Rangers more than anything else this season, it has been their
inability to score on the power play. But the Rangers can score on
occasion with their goaltender pulled for an extra skater.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened Monday night at Madison Square Garden,
where Adam Graves tapped in a perfect pass from Alexandre Daigle
with 35.2 seconds left in regulation, enabling the Rangers to force
overtime against the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Just 32 seconds into overtime, another pass from Daigle set up
Tim Taylor for the goal and a 3-2 Rangers victory. For Daigle, it
was his third assist of the game.
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, who snapped Daigle's pass past Calgary goaltender
Fred Brathwaite, it was a vindication of sorts after the Flames had
nearly knocked him out of the game in the first minute.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Flames, who had been 5-0-2 in the overtime session
before Monday night, it was not only their first overtime loss of
the season, but it also prevented them from becoming the first
National Hockey League team to sweep the three metropolitan area
teams _ the Islanders, Devils and Rangers _ in successive road
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 29 seconds away from entering the third period
with a two-goal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mathieu Schneider scored on a power play, it not only
halved Calgary's 2-0 deficit, but also marked the Rangers' first
goal this season with a five-to-three manpower advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the Rangers' seventh power play of the game, and it
came after the Rangers had gone 0 for 6 with a man advantage,
dropping them to 8 for 109 on the power play this season.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's third goal of the season came with Bobby Dollas in
the penalty box for interfering with Michael York at 18:56 of the
second period, just 14 seconds after Jarome Iginla had given
Calgary a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dollas' penalty was compounded by one the Flames took at 19:35,
when they were caught with too many men on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   York won the ensuing face-off from Clarke Wilm. And after Wilm
slipped, the Rangers essentially had a 5-on-2 advantage, which
enabled Schneider a clear look at the net when Fleury slid a pass
to him at the top of the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's one-timer eluded Calgary goaltender Fred Brathwaite,
stick-side, at 19:41. And the Rangers were back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleury, hounded by his former teammates all game, took a bad
penalty after the buzzer sounded to end the period. That offset the
final 1:25 of the the Flames had drawn for having too players on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The call against Fleury was for high sticking Martin St. Louis
well after the period had ended. St. Louis, a 5-foot-9-inch rookie
center, had gotten under Fleury's skin midway through the first
period, after Calgary defenseman Denis Gauthier had ridden Fleury
into the glass. Fleury was apparently going for a bit of revenge
when Referee Blaine Angus whistled him.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as St. Louis was bothering Fleury, Gauthier was
bothering the Rangers even more. He entered the gamet with only 16
penalty minutes in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   But 34 seconds into the game, he leveled Taylor, who had his
head down along the right boards in the Calgary zone, with a
leaping left elbow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   That check went unpenalized. But when Darren Langdon retaliated
against Gauthier for the hit on Taylor at 2:42, Angus called it.
When Adam Graves retaliated against Gauthier for the clean hit on
Fleury at 10:28, Angus called that one, too. And when the Rangers
could not clear the puck from their zone for nearly a minute after
the double minor to Graves ended, the Flames scored the first goal
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   A former Ranger got it: Marc Savard, who poked a loose puck past
Mike Richter at 13:10 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor came back for the second period after sitting out the
final 19:26 of the first. He too went after Gauthier, and drew a
double minor at 2:01. But the Flames came up empty; they went 0 for
4 on their power plays over the first two periods.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will order federal agencies that
provide or finance health care to take steps to reduce medical
errors blamed for tens of thousands of deaths, administration
officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The order would require pharmacists to take more precautions to
avoid dispensing the wrong drugs and would encourage hospitals to
investigate errors that cause serious injuries or deaths and to
report their findings to state health agencies. The standards would
apply to health-care providers under direct federal control, but
would serve as an example for the rest of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House ceremony on Tuesday, the officials said,
Clinton will instruct the agencies, which deal with the health care
of 85 million people, to adopt all feasible techniques for reducing
medical errors. In so doing, the officials said, Clinton is
recognizing medical mistakes as a serious problem in the
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Clinton has decided to accept major recommendations
from a report issued last week by a panel of the National Academy
of Sciences. The report said that the medical mistakes that cause
tens of thousands of deaths each year could be reduced by half in
the next five years if health-care providers collected and analyzed
data on unsafe practices, as the aviation industry does.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has immense leverage over the health care
industry because it buys or subsidizes large amounts of health care
and regulates hospitals, nursing homes and many other health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has the authority to make some changes unilaterally.
Thus, White House officials said, any health insurance plan that
wants to cover federal employees in 2001 will have to take steps to
reduce medical errors and protect patients, as recommended by the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   This directive will affect more than 300 private health plans
that insure nine million Americans through the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will order other federal agencies that provide or
finance health care to ``evaluate and, where feasible, implement
the latest error-reduction techniques,'' a White House document
says.
</P>
<P>
   This instruction will be addressed to the Department of Health
and Human Services, which runs Medicare and Medicaid; the
Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides medical care to
millions of veterans, and the Defense Department, which provides
health care to military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said the federal government would try to use its leverage as
the nation's biggest purchaser of health care to improve the
quality of care for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Clinton created a task force of federal agencies
to find ways of measuring and improving the quality of health care.
On Tuesday, officials said, Clinton will order this interagency
group to report back to him within 60 days on ways to carry out
recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The interagency group will develop proposals that can be
included in the president's next budget, which he intends to submit
to Congress in late January or early February, administration
offic)als said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they had not figured out how
Clinton's new initiative would deal with the concerns of health
care providers who fear they will be more exposed to lawsuits for
medical malpractice if they openly acknowledge more of their
mistakes. The Clinton administration has generally opposed efforts
by health care providers to limit the damages they may be required
to pay in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday signed a bill expanding the mission of the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a unit of the Public
Health Service. One of the agency's new roles is to ``identify the
causes of preventable health care errors'' and to find ways of
curtailing such mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the health care industry, including leaders
of the American Hospital Associat)on, will meet with the president
at the White House on Tuesday, to signal their support for some of
the academy's recommendations.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The hospital association is sending a list of error-reduction
techniques to each of its 5,000 hospitals. Richard H. Wade, senior
vice president of the association, said his group was forming a
partnership with the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a
nonprofit organization based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., to reduce
errors in the prescribing and dispensing of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The institute reviews medication errors reported by doctors and
nurses across the country, and it advises drug companies how to
change the labeling or packaging of products to prevent such
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will praise the hospital association for its efforts to
prevent medication errors, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said on Monday that he would
introduce a bill to carry out all the recommendations of the
National Academy of Sciences, including ``mandatory reporting'' of
serious errors and creation of a new Center for Patient Safety in
the federal government. The center would have an annual budget of
$30 million, rising to $100 million in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 20 states require hospitals or other health
care providers to report their mistakes, but compliance is uneven,
and many states have no such requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that his effort would be bipartisan and that he
intended to work with two Republican senators, James Jeffords of
Vermont and Bill Frist of Tennessee, as well as with Sen/ Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's bill would require hospitals and nursing homes to
adopt policies to reduce medical errors as a condition of
participating in Medicare or Medicaid, just as many Clinton
administration officials want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, which finances health care for 39 million people who
are elderly or disabled, and Medicaid, which insures a similar
number of low-income people, provide more than 40 percent of the
revenues for hospitals and nursing homes. So standards for these
two programs become virtual mandates for the entire health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering Cabinet officers to evaluate the recommendations of
the National Academy of Sciences, Clinton is following a pattern he
established in 1997 and 1998. He appointed a panel of experts to
draft a ``bill of rights'' for patients, and he embraced its
recommendations eight months later. He ordered federal agencies to
grant such rights to people enrolled in federal health programs,
and he urged Congress to enact similar standards for private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and the House of Representatives have passed
different versions of the legislation, and they will try to
negotiate a compromise after Congress reconvenes in January.

AT LEAST FOR ONE NIGHT, NETS SHOW HOW THEY CAN WIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N. J. _ For one night, the New Jersey Nets
finally got it right. They did not self-destruct when victory was
at hand. They did not let an early 10-0 deficit doom them for 48
minutes. And when Monday night's game was over, the Nets looked at
the final score and actually liked what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Winning for only the third time this season, and ending a
five-game losing streak, the Nets defeated the Sacramento Kings,
109-95. The victory put New Jersey's record at a still-dismal 3-15,
but the team hoped Monday night's victory would be the start of
better things to come.
</P>
<P>
   There were many positives for the Nets, beginning with their two
best players, Stephon Marbury and Keith Van Horn, who led the way,
but who also received plenty of help. Van Horn led all scorers 27
points, 21 of them coming in the second half, while Marbury was
sensational throughout the night with 26 points and 14 assists.
Meanwhile, the Nets received key contributions from the bench, led
by forward-center Jamie Feick (16 rebounds), guard Lucious Harris
(14 points), and forward Scott Burrell, (9 points, three
3-pointers). This was how they Nets envisioned themselves when this
nightmarish season, but as injuries and losses snowballed, their
psyche took a beating. The Nets needed a victory against anyone,
anywhere. And Monday night, they finally got one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how I thought we would play every game,'' said
Marbury, who has been openly frustrated much of season, but who had
reason to smile Monday night. ``We got loose balls. We played
harder than them and wanted the game more. Any win is a plus,
because I hate losing. Tonight I can sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber led Sacramento with 25 points and 14 rebounds,
while Vlade Divac added 21 points, but Corliss Williamson (12
points) was the only other Sacramento player in double figures.
Trailing 54-52 at halftime, the Nets took control in the third
quarter, outscoring the Kings, 30-15, to take an 82-69 lead into
the fourth quarter. And instead of finishing with a fourth-quarter
fold, the Nets never wavered. Sacramento never got closer than 12
points thereafter, and the Nets showed character early, erasing
deficits of 10-0 and 34-24 and changing the momentum in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, that's when we put our heads down,'' said Marbury of
the early deficits. ``That's when the other team smells blood. But
tonight, we played scrappy. It was a total team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets caught Sacramento at a good time, at the end of a
five-game trip. Yet, the outcome had more to do with New Jersey's
play rather than Sacramento's fatigue. The Nets can be difficult to
handle when Marbury and Van Horn play well together, but Van Horn
has struggled with his shot and his confidence most of the year.
But in the second half, Van Horn was aggressive with his moves and
accurate with his shot, and with Marbury orchestrating the game's
flow, the Kings had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   `Stephon did a great job controlling the game,'' said Van Horn,
who was 9 for 17 from the field, and 6 for 6 from the line. ``I
played looser. I played more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the Nets lost by 13 points to the Kings, an
exciting, up-tempo team that is capable of scoring in bunches and
providing must-see highlights. But New Jersey's defense kept
Sacramento in check, and Marbury badly outplayed Jason Williams,
Sacramento's flashy point guard, who finished with just two points
and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   The first half set the tone, when Sacramento raced to a 10-0
lead, only to see the Nets bounce back quickly, tying the game at
20. Then when the Kings pushed their lead to 34-24 late in the
first quarter, the Nets had their most impressive spurt of the
season, scoring the next 15 points to take a 39-34 lead. Feick and
Marbury were the catalysts during that stretch, and while the Nets
trailed at halftime, 54-52, they had sent a message that they would
not be pushovers. The Kings were flustered into 24 turnovers, which
the Nets turned into numerous fast break opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense was the key,'' said Feick, who had seven offensive
rebounds, nine defensive rebounds, 8 points, and several floor
burns. ``Guys were flying around out there creating turnovers, and
that starts our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who shot 12 for 22 from the field, was solid from start
to finish, and while he committed seven turnovers, he also had four
steals. This was Marbury at his most effective, creating offense
not only for himself, but for others. And the opposition was
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a lot of credit to Stephon,'' said Webber. ``I still
think he's one of the best guards in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory stopped a six-game home losing streak for the Nets,
who will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night to end a
five-game home stand. It remained to be seen whether the Nets would
build on Monday night's effort, or whether it was just a one-game
reprieve. But at least for one night, the smiling faces in the
locker room represented a welcome change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' said Nets coach Don Casey.
``The way Stephon moved the ball around and the way Keith got back
his confidence back was a really good sign.''

BRYANT COULD START BY END OF WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant's first start of the season is coming
sooner rather than later _ probably by the end of the week _ but
Bryant is the first to admit he's needed time to re-acclimate to
his Los Angeles Lakers teammates while playing off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   By all outward appearances, Bryant has hardly missed a beat
after sitting seven weeks with a broken right hand. In three games
back, he's averaged 19.0 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much to criticize there, though Bryant said he's far
from playing at his peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really pleased at all,'' he said Monday. ``I feel I
can play much, much, much better. Just an overall game _
rebounding, passing, steals, setting picks, timing of the offense.
Just feeling the rhythm of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been away from it for quite a time. The team has figured
out their own type of rhythm. You're stepping in, you're trying to
see, OK, what type of rhythm are they going with tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, Bryant will rejoin the starting lineup soon. Coach
Phil Jackson won't specify a date but said, ``I think it's
reasonable to tell you that probably within the week, he'll
probably start.... Right now, there's still kind of an adjustment
to playing ball with him and without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Jackson is enjoying Bryant's return as much as anyone.
While Bryant's improvisation still gets him in trouble now and
then, Jackson loves the added threat those one-on-one skills
provide the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the energy is so good for us, to have that kind of
just good energy on the floor. It's quick-hit,'' he said.
``(Sunday) night for us, it just jumped the (lead) from 12 to 20
points. He just moved the game up another eight points and
stretched our lead. So I'm not going to try to harness him in that
regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that energy, I like that unbounded sense of optimism
that he brings to his game. Just trying to get him to do the
combination of attack, both off the pass and in the offense and off
the dribble ... the possibility of carrying that threat of scoring
but actually not trying to score every time he touches the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant can hardly wait to do all that from the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm eager to get back into the flow of things,'' he said of
starting. ``I've been pressing really, really hard with my game,
trying to learn the team, trying to get back as fast as I possibly
can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll provide those bursts off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now I'm just takin' it back to 1996,'' he joked, referring
to his rookie year. ``All I need is the bald head.''
</P>
<P>
   Honored again: Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's player of the month
for November, was named the league's first player of the week in
December.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal averaged 25.9 points, 14.8 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 3.0
blocks in 38.8 minutes for the week of Nov. 29 through Dec. 5. The
Lakers went 4-0 in that span.

MCCAIN KEEPS A DEBATE DATE BY SATELLITE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERTOWN, Mass. _ Sen. John McCain was a little bit like the
virtual candidate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was not noticeable on television, thanks to matching
backdrops. But as the five other Republican contenders for
president debated in the Orpheum Theater in McCain's home state,
Arizona, the senator stood at a lectern across the country in a
television studio in the Boston suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   He was beamed into the event by satellite, as Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas chose to remind everyone when he tossed a question to
McCain ``wherever you are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With  &LR; McCain running even in the polls with Bush in the first
primary state of New Hampshire, both men were under pressure to put
on a commanding performance Monday night, four days after the first
encounter among all six Republican candidates, in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And one unknown was just how the satellite hookup would affect
public perceptions. Joking before the debate, McCain told reporters
that perhaps he could be beamed in as a large backdrop, towering
above the other candidates like Big Brother. He also tried to
minimize the significance of the evening, saying, ``I don't think
any single debate is of great importance.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to maneuver with a television camera to one side of him.
A television monitor brought in the events in Arizona with a
several-second time delay. And McCain's aides fretted about
microphone feedback.
</P>
<P>
   The night's odd format was indicative of the jousting that has
gone on as five contenders have sought to share the stage with
Bush. The Texas governor skipped an earlier debate in Arizona. So
the party arranged a new one.
</P>
<P>
   This time, McCain, who participated in the earlier matchup, had
campaign events in New Hampshire and New York that he refused to
cancel, and he initially said he would not participate. Then the
debate sponsors agreed to the satellite hookup.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the senator's day was consumed with town meetings in New
Hampshire. In Farmington's Town Hall, McCain vowed that as
president he would push for an overhaul of the campaign finance law
and veto every measure containing pork-barrel special-interest
projects. If Congress overrode his veto, he said, he would use the
president's bully pulpit to publicize which members of Congress
were pushing such projects.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he would veto such spending bills and risk a
government shutdown, he said, ``Sure I would, because if we don't
change business as usual in Washington, more and more people will
be deprived of their representation.''

ARIZONA'S PRINCE CHARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reporter from Atlanta wanted to know what the problem was
between Arizona Sen. John McCain and ``The Arizona Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain's campaign people told him not to talk to
reporters in Arizona, not if he wanted to get to know the ``real''
McCain. Instead, the writer from Georgia was advised to speak with
reporters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would the McCain folks say that?'' he asked me.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're smart, I told him.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any member of the Washington press corps will be able
to reel off three things about Sen. McCain:
</P>
<P>
   1) He's a war hero, having suffered through 5{ years in a North
Vietnamese prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   2) He's a maverick who's taken on his own political party in
fights with Big Tobacco and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   3) He's a straight-shooter, a lovable rogue who admits raising
hell as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   The boys from Washington will also tell you McCain has learned
from his mistakes. They'll tell you he's tough, funny, even a
little bawdy at times. And they're correct.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the most attractive political candidate in America, on
the surface. And that's exactly where McCain's presidential
campaign wants to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Hero worship
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and elsewhere, reporters seem happy to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esquire'' magazine printed a profile of McCain under the
headline, ``John McCain Walks on Water.'' The senator has been
fawned over in the ``New York'' ``Times,'' the ``Boston Globe,''
the ``Wall Street Journal,'' the ``Washington Post'' and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' star Mike Wallace once said, ``I'm thinking I may
quit my job if (McCain) gets the nomination. I'm impressed by his
independence, by his willingness to take on the tough ones. By his
honesty about himself. As I look at the current crop, there's
something authentic about this man.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I envy Mike Wallace and the writers for ``Esquire'' and the
``Times'' and the ``Post'' and all the other journalists from
outside Arizona who are covering McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He's new to them, mysterious, tough, attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Every reporter outside of Arizona wants to date John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   We're married to him.
</P>
<P>
   They're infatuated with the image. We're stuck with the man.
</P>
<P>
   They're head over heels for a guy who seems to be the opposite
of the guy currently in the White House. They don't want to know
what Arizona reporters could tell them about McCain's political
table manners, or where he leaves his dirty socks, or how he treats
the family dog when no one's looking.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Gwen Ifill told one newspaper, ``John McCain intrigues
reporters because he seems to be a maverick. He takes on popular
issues that can't necessarily pass, and we like that. Plus he's a
war hero, and we're kind of desperate for heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch and learn
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was for us in the 1980s, when McCain was first
elected to Congress in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, contradictions surfaced. The campaign
reformer cozied up to bigwigs he's supposed to regulate. The
iconoclast trashed Big Tobacco but not Big Alcohol, financing
campaigns with money from a beer distributorship owned by his
wife's family.
</P>
<P>
   There were stories of his temper, of occasional cruelties. (No
one mentions anymore the nasty joke he told about Chelsea Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   For us in Arizona, it's become a marriage of convenience. We
give McCain a platform; he gives the state some national exposure.
But, Prince Charming has turned back into a frog. McCain didn't
even come home for Monday's presidential debate in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's people don't want out-of-town reporters to hear
that stuff. They want allure, romance.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted a reporter to hear only good things about a guy,
who would you send him to?
</P>
<P>
   The wife, or the mistress? &QL;

RESEARCHERS CLAIM TO HAVE BROKEN PRIVACY CODE FOR WIRELESS PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)  (Eds: Story rewritten throughout.) 
(lb) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two Israeli researchers say they have found an
efficient way to crack the encryption scheme that protects the
privacy of conversations and data transmissions over a type of
wireless phone used by more than 215 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The encryption method, known as A5/1, is part of the GSM
wireless phone standard. Although not dominant in the United
States, GSM is the world's most widely used cellular technology. It
is employed in more than 215 million digital phones worldwide,
including about 5 million in the United States and more than 100
million in Europe. Analog cellular phones do not encrypt
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cell phones in the United States are based on a
variety of other wireless technologies, but a number of American
cellular phone companies, including Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC
Communications Inc., and Omnipoint Corp., use the GSM standard.
</P>
<P>
   The code that the researchers say they cracked is known as the
A5/1 algorithm, which is supposed to protect calls from being
intercepted by electronic eavesdroppers. It is not an
authentication code, which prevents detecting a phone's number and
``cloning'' it in another phone to bill calls fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   While cell phone encryption has been cracked before, the new
method is significant because it requires very little computer
power; an eavesdropper with just a PC could break into a
conversation in less than a second, its developers said. Several
methods of attacking the GSM algorithms have been announced before,
but most were impractical, requiring several hours and a network of
computers to intercept a single conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers who say they discovered the latest method are
Alex Biryukov and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot,
Israel. The men said they were able to break the code using a
computer with 128 megabytes of RAM and two 73 gigabyte hard disks.
The computer is used to analyze the A5/1 algorithm in the first two
minutes of the conversation, which is intercepted using a digital
scanner. Once that data is gathered, the eavesdropper can listen to
the entire conversation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the new cracking method requires resources not
available to most individuals. Before intercepting phone
conversations, an eavesdropper must make one-time sophisticated
computations that demand significant computer power. Once that is
completed, though, all GSM-protected conversations are easily
accessible, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   An eavesdropper must also have access to a digital scanner,
which can intercept wireless calls within a radius of several
miles. Such devices cost thousands of dollars and are illegal in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the finding was not formally announced, it was
confirmed Monday by one of the researchers after word spread
quickly among encryption experts on Internet mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Omnipoint on Monday called the researchers'
claims ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're describing is an academic exercise that would
never work in the real world,'' said the spokesman, Terry Phillips.
``What's more, it doesn't take into account the fact that GSM calls
shift frequency continually, so even if they broke into a call, a
second later it would shift to another frequency, and they'd lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Wagner, a computer security researcher at the
University of California at Berkeley, insisted the discovery was
significant. ``This is big,'' he said. ``I don't think that the
frequency hopping will be a major barrier.'' He added that it put
the interception of GSM calls ``within the reach of corporate
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer security researchers continually attempt to break
cryptographic codes because the measure of any code-scrambling
scheme is how much time and computing power are needed to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Wagner and Ian Goldberg, also at Berkeley, and Marc
Briceno of the Smart Card Developers Association demonstrated that
they could crack an authentication method associated with GSM in a
matter of hours on a single PC.
</P>
<P>
   In their research, they found that the A5/1 algorithm used keys,
which are used to scramble and unscramble the data, that were much
shorter than advertised and thus much easier to break. That
prompted speculation that the algorithm had been deliberately
weakened to allow for government eavesdropping
</P>
<P>
   In August, Wagner, Goldberg and Briceno developed a method for
breaking into calls protected by weak versions of the A5/1
algorithm used in parts of Asia and Australia. Their method could
break into a conversation in a fraction of a second with a single
PC.

 &HT;    Candidates question each other but avoid pit-bull politics

<P>
   PHOENIX - The six GOP presidential contenders mixed it up Monday
night, albeit cordially, taking advantage of a debate format that
allowed them to question each other.
</P>
<P>
   The event was televised nationwide, with Arizona Sen. John
McCain participating by satellite from Boston, near where he has
been campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The event marked Gov. George W. Bush's second debate of the
season. He skipped several debates prior to showing up last
Thursday in Manchester, N.H. for a forum that was more simultaneous
news conference than debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of Monday night's debate at a Phoenix theater,
each candidate had two chances to question an opponent of his
choice. But in each round, each candidate could be targeted only
once.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the candidates to question each other hardly produced
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laid out their own positions, and they were all very safe
questions,'' said Diana Carlin, a professor of communication
studies at the University of Kansas, who serves on an advisory
board on presidential debates. ``I was disappointed. I expected a
little bit more of going after what the other people are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In both rounds, the first questioner chose to question
front-runner Bush. Gary Bauer challenged him on China. Publisher
Steve Forbes challenged him on rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants the World Trade Organization to accept China. Bauer
said China, because of human rights abuses, has not earned it. The
governor wouldn't budge from his belief that trade leads to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we trade with China and give people a taste of freedom, I
think you will be amazed, Gary, at how soon democracy will come,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes got to ask the first question in the second round,
challenging Bush to come up with a plan to reverse recent increases
in oil prices triggered by production cuts from the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would ``encourage exploration'' and has great hope
for the continued expansion of natural gas use.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used his two questions to elicit praise of his programs. In
the first round, Bush opted to ask Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch what Hatch
would do to help the GOP draw more minority votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve a lot of credit,'' Hatch told Bush. ``You are one
of the Republicans who reached out to women and minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Bush asked McCain what he would do to
encourage faith-based organizations to provide social services, a
key plank in the Bush platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are on the right track, governor or George or W.
Bush,'' replied McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain took advantage of a Bush follow-up question to
challenge the Texan's contention that continuing surpluses will pay
for his proposed $483 billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not envision surpluses forever,'' said McCain. ``I take
the money for tax breaks out of wasteful spending and corporate
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes drew some of the loudest applause of the evening,
particularly when he went after the current income tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worse off than the serfs,'' he said. ``The serfs used
to pay their masters after they were fed and clothed. We have to
pay our masters before we are fed and clothed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch also came on strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been a great governor,'' Hatch told Bush, adding,
however, that a term and a half as governor does not qualify Bush
for the White House. ``I should be president and you should have
eight years with me,'' Hatch said. ``And, boy, you'd make a heck of
a president after eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did Thursday in New Hampshire, Bush played it close to the
vest, dishing out sound-bite-size chunks of his stump speech
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are saying that he's just reciting lines from his
speeches aren't being fair. Yes, he's doing that, but so are the
others,'' said Dartmouth government professor Linda Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, McCain even pulled a line out of a Forbes speech
and asked, with a sly grin, ``Where have I heard that before?''
</P>
<P>
   Polls here have shown Bush in second place in Arizona, within
striking distance, of McCain. Arizona Republicans, who backed Steve
Forbes in the 1996 primary, will vote Feb. 22. McCain has been a
ballot-box monster in his Senate races, grabbing 70 percent of the
vote in his 1998 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Since the New Hampshire debate, where his temperament came under
question, McCain has released more than 1,000 pages of medical
records related to treatment after his five years of captivity in
North Vietnam. The records show no reason why McCain, who
acknowledges he has a temper, can't serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who says she has seen McCain's
temper in action, is a Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also was noted for his temper when he was an aide to
his father, although he hasn't lost his cool as governor. Fowler
said she detected signs of his old testiness during an exchange
with Forbes in Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the warmth and personal charm that he's noted for
simply doesn't come across on television,'' she said. ``People may
start to tease him about his temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate came as polls continued to show Bush with a
substantial lead nationwide, but in a neck-and-neck battle with
McCain in New Hampshire, where the Arizona senator hopes to turn a
Feb. 1 victory into a springboard to an upset.
