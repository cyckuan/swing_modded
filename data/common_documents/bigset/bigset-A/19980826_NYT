CALIFORNIA HOUSING MARKET ON RECORD PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Low mortgage rates and a vibrant economy
propelled California's home sales and prices to record levels
during July, a trade group reported.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide sales of existing homes soared 20.3 percent last month
from the year-ago level and the median price hit $211,780, up 11
percent from July 1997, the California Association of Realtors said
Tuesday. That's $780 higher than the previous record set in May
1991.
</P>
<P>
   As for sales volume, if home sales for the last five months of
the year proceed at July's pace, escrow would close on 677,110.
That would surpass the record 604,950 homes sold during 1978, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County turned in an especially strong showing during
July, with sales jumping 20 percent from a year ago and the median
price -- the point at which half the homes sold for more and half
for less -- making a leap of 16 percent, to $204,570. The median
price, though is still well below the high of $229,260 reached in
May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Home sales and price data were compiled from a survey of 90 real
estate associations across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and analysts concurred that Tuesday's report shows
that a combination of attractive interest rates, a robust economy
and gains in personal income are fueling the home-buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are low and prices are going up, so people seem
more comfortable about making an investment. And the economy is
still very strong despite the storm clouds that are gathering
because of the Asian crisis,'' said G.U. Krueger, deputy chief
economist for the California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates averaged 6.95
percent during July 1998, down from 7.47 percent in July 1997,
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Adjustable
mortgage interest rates averaged 5.63 percent in July 1998, up
slightly from 5.56 percent in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of a robust housing market: Homes are staying
on the market for a shorter period of time this year: 37 days vs.
47 days in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the association's unsold inventory index for
single-family homes last month was just 4.2 months, down from 6.7
months for the same period a year ago. July marked the first time
since the summer of 1988 that the index, which indicates the number
of months needed to sell off the available housing supply, has
fallen below five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me at all that home sales are way up,''
said Michael Carney, executive director of the Real Estate Research
Council at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   He said the year-over-year sales gains could range from 20
percent to 30 percent in various markets across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some nine years' worth of extremely slow real estate
activity,'' Carney said. ``California has lagged the nation, so
part of this is catch-up. And prices have clearly turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 10 communities with the biggest gains in the median
price were Sherman Oaks and Sylmar, in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
The median price in Sherman Oaks last month was $286,000, up 36.8
percent. It was $131,250 in Sylmar, up 35.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't put much emphasis on these kinds of percentage
gains though because of the small sample size.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, an economist at the California Department of
Finance, said the Asian financial crisis's potential impact on
California might make it hard to keep sales this high but that
demand for housing will continue to drive prices up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in our second year of very large real income
increases,'' Smith said. ``Consumers are confident, and pent-up
demand is there.''

COMPANY GETS OK TO TEST INTERNET-BASED POSTAGE METER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Giving new meaning to the term e-mail, the U.S.
Postal Service has approved testing computer-based postage-metering
technology developed by a small, privately held company in suburban
Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   StampMaster Inc., the second company to gain such approval, won
it Tuesday. In March, Palo Alto-based E-Stamp Inc., which is
partially owned by Microsoft Corp. and Compaq Computers, began
testing a system for buying and printing postage with a personal
computer printer.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike E-Stamp's system, which requires users to buy
additional hardware to plug into their machines, the StampMaster
system is Internet-based. Because of that, some analysts say
StampMaster has a temporary advantage over competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardwareless solution will appeal to consumers for the
lower cost and easier setup, but E-Stamp will eventually have it
too,'' said analyst Vernon Keenan at San Francisco-based Keenan
Vision Inc. And because of E-Stamp's Microsoft and Compaq
connections, Keenan said, it has a long-term competitive advantage
in distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-Stamp overall is in stronger position because of its
partnerships,'' he said. ``Any neat new technology is dependent on
a good distribution strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan predicts the electronic postage market will total just
$18.5 million next year, but balloon to $2.1 billion by 2003. In
addition to StampMaster and E-Stamp, postage giant Pitney Bowes,
which now controls more than 80 percent of the postage-metering
market, is developing an Internet-based postage system.
</P>
<P>
   To its advantage, StampMaster is the furthest along in what its
president and chief operating officer, John Payne, describes as the
long and arduous process of getting Postal Service approval to
operate an Internet-based system.
</P>
<P>
   StampMaster has begun testing its service among 25 individuals
and businesses in the Washington, D.C., area. In three or four
months, the testing will be expanded to about 500 customers in the
Washington area and in San Francisco, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, he said, the StampMaster system could be
available to consumers by the first quarter of 1999.

 McGWIRE'S EARLY SHOW IS NIGHT'S ONLY THRILL  
 (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire returned home Tuesday night to the
Cardinals' nest, Busch Stadium, after a nine-game road trip and a
giant step toward reaching the home run record for a season. He
departed with 47 home runs, and returned with 53, two in front of
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and eight short of the record of 61
set by Roger Maris 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He remained eight behind Maris, with 32 games left, after going
0 for 4 with a walk Tuesday night against the Florida Marlins, who
beat the Cardinals, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire left St. Louis for the road, there was no
controversy about muscle-building supplements. When he returned,
Tuesday morning's front-page headline in The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch read, ``Effects of Andro are Hotly Debated.'' The
subhead read, ``Not much is known about the supplement McGwire is
taking _ studies are unclear, doctors say.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement, has been a
muscle-builder of choice this year for McGwire. It is legal in
baseball and in the National Basketball Association, illegal in the
National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and in the eyes of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems people are always trying to discredit legitimate
achievement,'' said Marlins manager Jim Leyland. ``I don't care
what anyone takes, guys just don't hit 93-mile-an-hour sliders like
he does.'' This seems to echo the general sentiment of baseball
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In his first trip to the plate Tuesday night, McGwire faced the
right-hander Rafael Medina. With the home crowd in a rhythmic chant
filled with expectation, McGwire belted a long drive to center
field. But it was caught near the 402-foot marker. It was his best
shot of the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, McGwire reached first base on a fielder's
choice. In the fourth, he batted with the bases loaded, two out and
the Cardinals leading by 1-0. McGwire has 11 grand slams in his
career, two this season. But after several foul balls and extending
the count to 3-2, he walked. The fans, as has become customary in
such an eventuality, booed with conviction, even though McGwire was
credited with driving in a run to increase the home team's lead to
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, with a man on third and two out, he grounded out
to third, and in the eighth, with Florida leading by 4-3, McGwire
grounded out with a man on first to end the inning. At that point,
many among the crowd of 29,130 got up and headed for home. So did
McGwire after the game, fulfilling a pre-game stance that he would
not speak with reporters if he did nothing noteworthy in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opener of this six-game homestand, McGwire began with
what has become one of most appealing and spectacular acts in
sports: his batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark feels an obligation to perform,'' said Tony La Russa, the
Cardinals' manager. ``He knows fans are coming to the ball park
early just to see him bat. Not just to bat, but hit the ball into
the stands. It's like playing a doubleheader. He's told me he feels
less pressure in the actual game. At least, a single or double
isn't a disappointment, as anything less than a ball hit into the
outfield stands is in batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a few thousand fans stood along the Cardinals'
dugout and filled sections of the lower and upper left-field decks,
lustily cheering McGwire when he came to bat about an hour and a
half before the game.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman held up a poster: ``When I grow up I want to be
just like Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Marlins stopped their activities, whether it was
stretching in front of their dugout or playing catch, and watched,
just like the fans. Derrek Lee, a rookie infielder for the Marlins,
edged forward on the dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   The park grew silent at 5:46 p.m. as McGwire waved his bat in
anticipation. He swung at the first batting-practice pitch and sent
it soaring into the lower left-field deck. The crowed oohed. He hit
the second and third pitches into the upper deck. He failed to
homer on the next three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:47, he hit one homer in four swings. At 5:48, he went one
homer for three. At 5:49, it was 1 for 2, and, in his last trip
into the batting cage, at 5:50, getting one swing, he provided the
fans with one more treat to remember by lofting a pitch deep into
the upper deck, above the neon sign that says ``BigMac Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Applause rang around the stadium as he moved to the dugout.
McGwire's homer stat: 7 for 16.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Lee took the field, he shook his head. ``That was
awesome,'' he said. ``You've got to watch him _ he's the best.
That's incredible what he just did.''  &QL;

NEW MARKETSPAN LEADERSHIP INCLUDES 9 OF LILCO'S TOP 26
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HICKSVILLE, N.Y. _ Marketspan announced a new management team
Tuesday, and it includes only nine of 26 former officers of the
Long Island Lighting Company. The others chose to leave the company
rather than return lucrative severance checks or were not asked to
stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan officials said that they hoped the announcement would
help to calm Wall Street concerns about the company's focus and
direction, which intensified during the bitter dispute over the
severance checks that the 26 top Lilco executives received when
Lilco merged with Brooklyn Union Gas to create Marketspan in May.
</P>
<P>
   The severance packages totaled $67 million, with most of the
money _ $42 million _ going to Dr. William J. Catacosinos, the
former Lilco chairman, who was forced to resign on July 31 under
pressure from stockholders and state officials who said Catacosinos
misled them about the severance payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said that all the members of Marketspan's new
management team shared the same basic benefits package, including
stock options and other longterm benefits, but that each package
was ultimately based on the individual officer's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create a team and have everyone going forward on
the same basis,'' said Robert Catell, who became Marketspan's
chairman and chief executive after Catacosinos' resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who chose to leave was Michael Bray, a senior vice
president for electrical operations who opted not to return his
$800,000 severance check. But Bray agreed to remain on the job
until a replacement could be found and trained, according to Robert
Mahony, a spokesman for Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bray's decision to stay on and help us out, especially through
the hurricane season, speaks well of his relationship with the
company,'' Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan, which is based in Hicksville, has a long-term
contract with the Long Island Power Authority to manage the
authority's electric service operations. LIPA Chairman Richard
Kessel recently expressed concern about the possibility of Bray's
departure, noting that during the hurricane season, ``the loss of
experienced people is a very serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony said that Marketspan hoped Bray's agreement to remain, if
only temporarily, would help allay such fears. Bray did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of Marketspan's management team, and the
return of the severance payouts by some of Lilco's former
executives, was welcome news to Kessel, who noted that he and Gov.
George Pataki had been highly critical of the payouts.

 SCHUMER PROPOSALS AIMED AT POOR, MIDDLE CLASS  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asserting that Wall Street's wave of prosperity had
failed to lift most inner-city neighborhoods in New York, Charles
Schumer, a Democratic candidate for Senate, proposed a series of
federal spending programs Tuesday to encourage development in
downtrodden cities and to raise the incomes and savings of the poor
and middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn, urged a sharp increase in
the minimum wage, tax credits for first-time home buyers who move
into designated urban neighborhoods and a new tax-free savings
account program in which the government would partially match
savings that low-income families put aside for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer framed his proposals, which he gave in a speech in
Jamaica, Queens, as a specific appeal to minority voters, who tend
to make up a significant proportion of the turnout in Democratic
primaries. Schumer _ one of three Democrats seeking the nomination
to challenge Sen. Alfonse D'Amato _ said that poor minority
neighborhoods had failed to share in Wall Street's good fortune,
producing what he warned was a dangerous imbalance in the state's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the '20s,'' Schumer said, referring to the decade
leading up to the Great Depression. ``If the prosperity and the
wealth is concentrated at the very top, sooner or later there's not
enough buying power in the rest of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted that New York has ranked near the bottom of the 50
states in job creation. ``That's unacceptable,'' he said. ``When
you consider how much the bull market on Wall Street has done to
help our economy, you realize just how poorly the rest of New York
is faring.''
</P>
<P>
   The representative, who has proposed a variety of spending
programs in this campaign _ including making college tuition
deductible _ said the cost of his latest proposal would be less
than $1 billion. He added that he would pay for the proposal by
cutting defense spending or agriculture subsidies. ``I think we can
easily find a billion dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came after a period in which Schumer had kept a
relatively low-profile public campaign schedule, possibly
reflecting the fact that candidates in all the major races this
year have found it difficult to compete for attention with
President Clinton's legal difficulties and the bombings in Africa.
Schumer, however, has been running a heavy schedule of campaign
advertisements, unlike either of his rivals, Mark Green, the New
York City Public Advocate, and Geraldine Ferraro, the former Queens
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer delivered his speech at the Jamaica Business Resource
Center, a nonprofit organization that assists minority and
small-business owners. The congressman sat at one end of a table,
addressing an audience of just 15 people, including his mother and
father, who were in the neighborhood and stopped by to hear their
son speak.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the details of Schumer's proposals, which he described
as a ``major policy address,'' appeared to be falling into place as
the day went on. Asked after his address if interest earned on his
proposed savings account would be tax-exempt, Schumer responded:
``You know, that's a good question. I don't think it would be
tax-free, but maybe it should be. Making it tax-free would be a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also proposed raising the minimum wage, now $5.15 an
hour, to $7.50 by 2002, and linking it after that to inflation.
Efforts to raise the minimum wage have been strongly resisted by
Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also proposed that first-time home buyers get a $2,000
tax credit when they buy homes in low-income neighborhoods
designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And
he said that nonprofit groups, like churches and hospitals, should
get the same payroll-tax credit for hiring people on welfare that
is currently awarded to private business.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of what I talked about today constitutes a handout,''
Schumer said. ``A handout is temporary.''

POST-FUHRMAN REFORMS IN PLACE AT LAPD, CHIEF SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Three years after audiotapes of LAPD Detective
Mark Fuhrman shocked the nation with descriptions of officer
brutality, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said his agency has taken
significant steps to make sure bad cops are rooted out.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Police Commission on the status of 26
recommendations that came out of the Fuhrman investigation, Parks
said more than half have been put in place, including creation of a
system to identify patterns of officer misconduct that are to be
considered in weighing discipline and officer credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report stated that related recommendations by the
inspector general to reform the Los Angeles Police Department's
disciplinary system are 95 percent completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two reports particularly challenged the department to
examine its personnel systems and ensure they not only performed
the purpose for which they were intended, but generate public
confidence in its Police Department as well,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuhrman tapes, made by aspiring screenwriter Laura McKinney,
were used by defense attorneys for O.J. Simpson to discredit the
LAPD and win acquittal of the former football star on charges of
killing one of his ex-wives and another man.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman was taped recounting incidents where he and other
officers allegedly beat and framed minority suspects and referred
to them with racial epithets. He also described mistreatment of
women officers at the West Los Angeles Division, where he claimed
to be part of a group called Men Against Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations contained in those tapes described egregious,
systemic misconduct,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fuhrman later said he was exaggerating, and an LAPD
investigation failed to substantiate much of the misconduct Fuhrman
spoke of, although it sharply criticized the former detective for
his racist comments and aleged biased treatment of women at the
division.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's report said his department has implemented
recommendations in the Fuhrman investigation aimed at eliminating
hostile work environments, including the deployment of female
sergeants to the West Los Angeles Division. The department has also
provided in-service training classes that mix command officers and
line officers to improve human relations.
</P>
<P>
   Parks added that the LAPD is using mental health experts to
screen out recruits who might share Fuhrman's traits of dishonesty
and racial and gender bias.
</P>
<P>
   The department has not completed implementation of
recommendations to hold command officers accountable for systemic
misconduct by officers under their command. Parks said his agency
also is still developing a mediation program to resolve internal
disputes between officers.
</P>
<P>
   The only recommendation by the inspector general that has not
been put in place is to tape-record all complaints made by
telephone to the front desks of police stations.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the department is still trying to find money to pay
for the taping system.

   ATTACK-SUDAN (Khartoum, Sudan) _ At the end of the Persian Gulf
war in 1991, when Sudan was one of Iraq's few remaining friends in
the world, the government here struck a bargain with Baghdad,
foreign diplomats and Sudanese said Tuesday. In return for Iraqi
financial help and assistance by military and civilian experts,
Sudan agreed to allow its installations to be used by Iraqi
technicians for steps in the production of chemical weapons, they

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
There she stood, hoisting another Most Valuable Player trophy to an
ovation from the 11,901 gathered at Compaq Center to watch a WNBA
semifinal playoff game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Cynthia Cooper soaked up the atmosphere, a million thoughts
raced through her mind.
</P>
<P>
   She thought of how fortunate she was to be voted the best in the
WNBA for the second time; of how much it meant to her, her mother
and family.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper thought about how the trophy was partial repayment, a
thanks of sorts, to the thousands of fans throughout the Houston
area who have supported the Comets and made her feel so warm and at
home the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like I've been blessed throughout my whole
(12-year professional) career,'' Cooper said Tuesday. ``But I never
imagined it would be this way, this special, and that I would have
an opportunity to live a dream like I'm living right now, to be a
part of something so unique and so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were the Comets' 27-3 record, their 15-game winning
streak and their 10-game home winning streak, all of which were
WNBA records. And Cooper this season became the first player to
reach 1,000 career points in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   She set a basketful of other records and is often referred to as
the best female player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awesome,'' Cooper, 35, said. ``I've always thought I
have a very good game. I've always thought I was a hard worker. But
I never thought I would be in position to be named or titled `the
best female basketball player in the world.' Never, ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a goal of mine, but you never think you're
going to arrive at that goal. When I say it's a dream come true, it
really is. And I really feel like I'm living a dream. It's
something very special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper then thought of some moments that might best be
forgotten. There were the physical hurdles _ a mild concussion, a
bruised knee, a scratched eyeball, a bruised thigh and a
hyperextended elbow. And there was what Cooper perceived as a lack
of respect, in some instances, by some players and officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of different emotions going through me that
I'm still trying to harness, put them on the back burner and just
concentrate on the second WNBA championship,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   As the applause and screams of the fans became louder and
longer, Cooper considered the day-to-day grind that accompanies
being the head of a vast household and caretaker for her ailing
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper is ``mom'' to seven nieces and nephews who reside at the
family home in Sugar Land. She is constant companion, overseer and
comforter to her mother, Mary Cobbs, who single-handedly raised
eight children but is locked in a battle with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says Cobbs is doing well but every so often has some
rough days.
</P>
<P>
   During ceremonies before the Comets eliminated the Charlotte
Sting 77-61 on Monday night and advanced to the WNBA finals a
second time, Cooper was on the floor for about five minutes as she
accepted the MVP trophy from WNBA president Val Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   Brief. But it was time enough for the flood of thoughts, for the
rush of emotion that had characterized her day of honor to be
revisited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, during the ceremony and even at the news conference
earlier in the day, I thought about all of the sacrifices I had to
make personally, that my teammates had to make for me and for other
players on the team,'' Cooper said. ``I thought about all of the
ups and downs, the very tense moments at practice, the intense
moments during a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been really tough, mentally and physically.
Mentally, you never knew from day to day who was going to do what
out here, what personality they were going to come with.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think my teammates have been committed to putting team
first. So that's made it all better, made it all work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to write a book about this experience when
it's over. I'm going to tell of how you've got to persevere through
the hard times, that even though it gets tough, something good is
going to come of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MVP awards, the first-team WNBA honors, winning that first
WNBA title, and hopefully a second, and even that we had the
opportunity to fight for a second championship. These are all
special moments that other teams don't have and other women don't
have. So we should feel very fortunate that we're even in this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride, Cooper said, has been exciting and often bumpy. But
it's one she would like to take again next season. Like all
second-year players in the WNBA, Cooper's contract expires in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I want to play with Tina (Thompson) and Kim
(Perrot) and I want coach (Van) Chancellor to be my coach,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, without fanfare, she walked away.

COWBOYS ROOKIE ELLIS LEARNING AS HE GOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Ellis wants at end of line 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I told Walter to go out and jump him a little bit because I
knew he wasn't used to it; we wanted Walter to take his moves away
right away. If anything, that seemed to bother Greg. The thing he
needs most work on is stopping the run. ... I think he has a chance
to be a really good player.'' _ Gregg Smith, Seahawks offensive
line coach
</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Seattle offensive line coach Gregg Smith was
talking about Cowboys defensive end Greg Ellis, the club's
first-round draft choice who lined up against Seahawks offensive
tackle Walter Jones, an all-rookie selection in 1997, in a
preseason game July 31.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Cowboys' first preseason game, and Ellis was limited
to one solo tackle and no quarterback sacks or pressures. Smith's
comments could have applied to Ellis' play in each of the next two
games. Spending time at both left and right end, he had one solo
stop against Patriots tackles Bruce Armstrong and Zefross Moss.
Ellis did not even appear on the stat sheet against Raiders tackles
Pat Harlow and Lincoln Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina, Ellis was used to overpowering people or
beating them with his quickness. But he acknowledged that the pro
game is totally different, and he said he was having a hard time
adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (veteran tackles) are smart,'' he was saying, with a
sigh, at his locker the other day, ``They are big and strong, and
they can be physical and hit you in the mouth if they have to. But
they are excellent technicians. The way they block you, sometimes
they let you go where you want to go and use your own momentum and
ride you right out of the play. That's something I'd never seen in
college. Hey, these are smart guys. They are not just big bulky
guys that can't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Ellis said he might have been thinking too much in
the Cowboys' first three games. He just decided to play with
reckless abandon in the game against St. Louis last week, and he
had three tackles and two quarterback pressures against the
formidable Orlando Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches said it was Ellis' best game, and Ellis was all
smiles in the locker room Monday as he talked about his play. More
than anything, though, Ellis knows he'll have to continue to
improve to quiet questions about whether the Cowboys did the right
thing by drafting him with the eighth overall selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want people to know that you can play football,''
Ellis said. ``I can't please everybody. I'm aware that some people
wished the Cowboys would have picked Randy Moss. Had they done
that, I think the fans would find something wrong with him. I've
just got to play, that's all. I'm just going to play.''

LAPD OFFICER JAILED IN EVIDENCE THEFT OF 6 POUNDS OF COCAINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A police officer was arrested on suspicion of
stealing 6 pounds of cocaine, with a street value of $800,000, from
an evidence storage area at Los Angeles Police Department
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Rafael Antonio Perez, 31, who allegedly forged another
officer's signature to remove the cocaine, faces felony charges of
grand theft, fraud and possession of cocaine with intent to sell,
LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we announce something that is very sad and tragic in the
fact that we've had to arrest one of our own for being involved in
very serious criminal activity,'' Parks said at a news conference
in front of Parker Center.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a nine-year veteran of the department, was assigned to
the Rampart Division's anti-gang unit until his arrest at his home
in the Wilshire area, near downtown Los Angeles. Last year, Perez
spent six months on loan to a narcotics investigation unit.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said search warrants were obtained for inspections of
Perez's police locker, car and home. The searches did not turn up
any cocaine but produced other evidence helpful to the
investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea what he's done with the narcotics,'' Parks
said. ``Our assumption is that he sold the narcotics, but we cannot
validate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief said two civilians not employed by the department have
been arrested on separate charges and may have helped the officer
sell the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in March when the cocaine was determined
to be missing. The officer who supposedly last checked out the
cocaine for use in court denied that he did so, and he said someone
else must have used his identification card. Prosecutors said the
cocaine already had been used in court, in a case that had been
prosecuted two weeks earlier. Perez was not involved in that case.
</P>
<P>
   An audit of 100,000 pieces of evidence confirmed that the
cocaine was missing, and an investigation focused on Perez, Parks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office filed three felony counts
Tuesday, and Perez was being held in lieu of $550,000 bail, the
chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Richard Rosenthal said Perez is
expected to be arraigned this afternoon in Los Angeles Municipal
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said Perez faces a maximum prison sentence of eight
years and four months if convicted on all charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   An audit earlier this year by the City Controller's Office
criticized the LAPD for lax controls over evidence storage.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the allegation against Perez is harmful to the image
of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel somewhat concerned that it does tarnish the badge of
the Los Angeles Police Department, that an individual would
basically violate their code of ethics and the trust given to them
by the public and commit this kind of act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Parks, the LAPD has been tightening discipline. So far
this year, the department has fired more officers than were
dismissed during all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' supporters say he is appropriately a tougher
disciplinarian than his predecessor, Willie L. Williams. But his
approach has led to complaints from the Los Angeles Police
Protective League, which is the police officers union.

ANGELS TOP YANKEES, 7-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there has been anything more magical than the New
York Yankees' season, it has been the magic with which the Anaheim
Angels have mesmerized the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time in eight games this season, the Angels
defeated the Yankees on Tuesday night, this time 7-6 behind a
four-run flurry in the seventh inning against two members of the
Yankees' incendiary relief corps, Mike Stanton and Mike Buddie.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus, a rookie, who was hitting .209 at game time, drove
in the final two runs in the seventh with a double against Buddie
after the pitcher had knocked him down with his first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' five games to three edge is unique in this season in
which the Yankees are threatening to set a major league record for
most victories. None of the other 17 teams the Yankees have played
this season has even a .500 record against them.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this game also gave the Yankees their first
three-game losing streak since the first three games of the season.
The Angels, who lead the American League West, have been
responsible for two-thirds of each streak.
</P>
<P>
   To salvage their latest victory, the Angels needed a good
late-inning relief effort from their closer, Troy Percival, and
they got it. Relieving with one out and two on in the eighth after
Paul O'Neill's single reduced the Angels' lead to a run, Percival
struck out Bernie Williams and retired Tino Martinez on a grounder
to second base on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in the remaining three games of the
five-game series. two games on Wednesday and one on Thursday, the
Angels have already succeeded in making a point _ to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for our guys to find out they can play with
them,'' Terry Collins, the Angels' manager, said before the game at
Yankee Stadium. ``Absolutely, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' ability to beat the Yankees is important because the
teams could meet in the playoffs, either in the division series or
in the league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Results in the regular season often have no bearing on the
outcome of a post-season series, but if the Angels had been blown
away by the Yankees during the season, they might have a
post-season problem.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing that issue, Collins said: ``When you're a young team
like we are still _ and I know we have some guys that have four or
five years in the big leagues, but age-wise they're fairly young _
to be able to walk out there and say we can compete with the New
York Yankees in the year they're having, yeah, I think it will be
important. If it gets to that point where we have to play them,
certainly it can only help us have more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hideki Irabu continuing his two-month streak of
inconsistent pitching, the Yankees couldn't be certain whether they
were watching the Perils of Pauline or the Pearls of Hideki. Irabu
kept getting into trouble, then escaping the danger he had created.
</P>
<P>
   He executed his most noteworthy escapes in the fourth inning and
the sixth. Clinging by his fingernails to the sheer cliff he had
created for himself, Irabu emerged unscathed after loading the
bases with one out in the fourth, then survived with a one-run lead
after allowing two runs with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But when Irabu walked Randy Velarde at the start of the seventh
inning, the director of the Yankees' huge hit of a show, Joe Torre,
decided his stomach had been subjected to enough abuse for one
evening. Before him, after all, lay a day-night doubleheader on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Torre's move settled his stomach. He summoned Mike
Stanton, who all too often has played firebug rather than fireman.
Stanton wasted no time unsettling Torre further, as well as
provoking frequent outbursts of boos from the spectators. Before he
had tossed a pitch in his attempted preservation of a 4-3 lead,
Stanton threw to first base; that is, he threw somewhere in the
vicinity of first base. Nowhere that Tino Martinez could have
caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde went to second on the error and promptly scored the
tying run as Darin Erstad drilled a double along the right-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad moved to third on Tim Salmon's fly to right, then scored
the lead run as Garret Anderson rapped a hard grounder through an
infield playing in hoping to cut Erstad off at the plate. When Jim
Edmonds followed with a single to right, Torre extinguished Stanton
for the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that Mike Buddie couldn't extricate the
Yankees from the mess Stanton had got them into. After Edmonds
stole second, Troy Glaus, the Angels' rookie third baseman, who was
hitting .209 at game time, lashed his second successive
run-producing hit.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus had singled home a run in the previous inning, and this
time he cracked a line drive to left field for a two-run double and
a 7-4 lead. Interestingly, on his first pitch to Glaus, Buddie
might have been sending a message from his fellow rookie pitcher,
Ryan Bradley.

   Buddie's pitch was high and inside, knocking Glaus down, and it
was reminiscent of the encounters Glaus had with Bradley when
Bradley played at Arizona State and Glaus at UCLA. The pitch,
however, didn't intimidate Glaus, and it made no impression either
on Matt Walbeck, who singled Glaus to third. But Buddie finally
ended the madness, inducing Gary DiSarcina to ground into an
inning-ending double play.

   ``I told Walter to go out and jump him a little bit because I
knew he wasn't used to it; we wanted Walter to take his moves away
right away. If anything, that seemed to bother Greg. The thing he
needs most work on is stopping the run. ... I think he has a chance
to be a really good player.'' _ Gregg Smith, Seahawks offensive
line coach
</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Seattle offensive line coach Gregg Smith was
talking about Cowboys defensive end Greg Ellis, the club's
first-round draft choice who lined up against Seahawks offensive
tackle Walter Jones, an all-rookie selection in 1997, in a
preseason game July 31.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Cowboys' first preseason game, and Ellis was limited
to one solo tackle and no quarterback sacks or pressures. Smith's
comments could have applied to Ellis' play in each of the next two
games. Spending time at both left and right end, he had one solo
stop against Patriots tackles Bruce Armstrong and Zefross Moss.
Ellis did not even appear on the stat sheet against Raiders tackles
Pat Harlow and Lincoln Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina, Ellis was used to overpowering people or
beating them with his quickness. But he acknowledged that the pro
game is totally different, and he said he was having a hard time
adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (veteran tackles) are smart,'' he was saying, with a
sigh, at his locker the other day, ``They are big and strong, and
they can be physical and hit you in the mouth if they have to. But
they are excellent technicians. The way they block you, sometimes
they let you go where you want to go and use your own momentum and
ride you right out of the play. That's something I'd never seen in
college. Hey, these are smart guys. They are not just big bulky
guys that can't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Ellis said he might have been thinking too much in
the Cowboys' first three games. He just decided to play with
reckless abandon in the game against St. Louis last week, and he
had three tackles and two quarterback pressures against the
formidable Orlando Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches said it was Ellis' best game, and Ellis was all
smiles in the locker room Monday as he talked about his play. More
than anything, though, Ellis knows he'll have to continue to
improve to quiet questions about whether the Cowboys did the right
thing by drafting him with the eighth overall selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want people to know that you can play football,''
Ellis said. ``I can't please everybody. I'm aware that some people
wished the Cowboys would have picked Randy Moss. Had they done
that, I think the fans would find something wrong with him. I've
just got to play, that's all. I'm just going to play.''

IT'S OFFICIAL: BATES NO LONGER A PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Forty-one days after an emotional news
conference to announce the end of his playing career, Bill Bates'
retirement finally became official Tuesday when Dallas Cowboys
management decided not to add the 15-year veteran to the club's
active roster.
</P>
<P>
   Bates had hoped he could serve as an assistant coach and play
with the club in emergency situations. But he learned Tuesday that
the team needed his roster spot to groom younger players. He will
continue to serve as an assistant coach, helping Joe Avezzano on
special teams and Mike Zimmer with the defensive backs. But in the
next few days, Bates will finally clean out a locker he has owned
since 1983. With that, he'll presumably get a full-time office and
a phone number in the coaches' wing of Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the door to be opened to play was enough, but this
decision lingered on as long as my career,'' Bates said. ``There's
a finality to this and that's good. Another door has been opened.
This door \Rplaying\S is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said deciding Bates' status was a ``hard
decision. The challenge for him now is to bring the same stuff he
showed on the field to his coaching. And I think he's done that.''
MORE ROSTER MOVES
</P>
<P>
   To get to the 60-man roster limit, the Cowboys released
linebacker K.D. Williams and fullback Dwayne Chandler. They also
reached an injury settlement with tight end Sean Simms (broken
jaw). BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said that right tackle Erik Williams
will miss Thursday's preseason game against Jacksonville with a
sprained right foot. Williams will be replaced in the starting
lineup by Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys began the indoctrination of cornerback Deion
Sanders to the new offense. Sanders, who has been out for the past
few weeks with a broken rib, returned to limited workouts Monday,
worked on some plays and pass routes, Gailey said, and he might see
some time at cornerback Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said recently acquired defensive
tackle Artie Smith, whom the Cowboys acquired from New England for
a conditional draft pick, was expected to arrive at Valley Ranch
last night. Jones said Smith should see some action in Thursday's
game against the Jaguars.

LEADING TERRORIST KNOWN AS ABU NIDAL IS HELD IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 10th graf with statement by Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering) (See also: ATTACK-U.S., ATTACK-SUDAN, ATTACK-NIDAL) 
(sw) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ One of the world's most wanted terrorists, the
Palestinian guerrilla chief, Sabri al-Banna, better known as Abu
Nidal, is being held by the Egyptian authorities in Cairo,
according to an Arab intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, 61, is accused by Washington of having killed or
injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974. He is
wanted in the United States, Great Britain and Italy and was
condemned to death by the Palestine Liberation Organization, from
which he broke in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his capture after years in which he had seemed to
vanish began emerging last week in the Arabic press and was as hard
to pin down as the man himself. The convoluted account is woven of
rumors of double-crosses, mysterious illnesses and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official, who spoke Tuesday on the
condition of anonymity, said Abu Nidal was arrested two months ago
in Egypt but had actually been there for nine months. The official
said Adu Nidal had been cooperating with Egyptian intelligence
agents who wanted to use his information to target terrorist groups
planning bombings and assassinations in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement collapsed, the official said, when Egyptian
agents actually infiltrated the Abu Nidal group and started using
his own op- eratives against Egypt's militant fundamentalist
enemies. When Abu Nidal realized this, the official said, he
stopped cooperating and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One report suggested that Abu Nidal operatives killed a chief
planner for the Islamic Group a few weeks ago in Yemen. The Islamic
Group killed 58 tourists in an attack on Luxor, the Egyptian
pyramid site, last November.
</P>
<P>
   The official's account could not be independently confirmed, but
it was supported on some points by a PLO official.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Egyptian officials denied that Abu Nidalwas on
Egyptian territory after two Arabic newspapers asserted he was
under arrest in Egypt. On Tuesday, Egyptian officials reached in
Cairo refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   PLO officials said Egypt would not confirm these reports to
them, but left open the possibility the arrest may have taken
place. Abu Nidal who has accused the group of betraying the
Palestinian cause by negotiating peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, Thomas Pickering, undersecretary of
state, said he did not have ``any determinative information'' to
provide on the reported arrest, and said questions should be
addressed to the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the arrest first surfaced last week in London in two
Saudi-owned Arabic dailies. Al Sharq al-Awsat reported that he was
dying of cancer in an Egyptian hospital. Al Hayat asserted on its
front page last week that he had been arrested in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that Abu Nidal had
been arrested by Egyptian authorities as he crossed into Egypt from
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official speculated on Tuesday that
Egyptian intelligence planted the story of his terminal illness in
anticipation of getting rid of him, saying, ``he is bound to
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, whose name means ``Father of Struggle,'' is the
founder of the Palestinian opposition Fatah Revolutionary Council,
which has claimed responsibility for lethal attacks around the
world, mostly against Israelis and PLO leaders and partisans, but
also against Jews in Western Europe and moderate Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of 12 whose assets were frozen by President
Clinton in 1995 for waging campaigns to undermine the Middle East
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Abu Nidal group is smaller now than it had been in
the past, it continues to have cells in Lebanon, where it is said
to command several hundred members, as well as in Syria, Libya,
Iraq and several dormant organizations in Europe, according to
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear where Abu Nidal was staying before traveling to
Egypt or why he would accept an arrangement to provide information
to Egypt, but it is known that he was unwelcome almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri al-Banna was born in Jaffa in 1937, and at various points
he operated out of Libya, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. In the last few
years his whereabouts were unknown. Over the years he is said to
have ordered the killing of 150 of his own operatives on suspicion
of treason, and the elimination of his potential enemies accounts
for his ability to elude authorities around the world for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO condemned Abu Nidal to death in 1974. Over the years,
his death has been reported widely in accounts often spun by the
man himself.

SWITZER OVERLOOKED KEY FACTS BEFORE MAKING DIRE PREDICTION
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Same players, same result.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys couldn't keep Barry Switzer quiet when he was
the coach. And it seems he won't be quiet now that he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer has been telling anybody who will listen that the
Cowboys won't be much better than they were last season when they
went 6-10 and sent him packing.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer reasons that the Cowboys made no major off-season
additions. He wasn't trying to be malicious, just honest _ in his
usual politically incorrect way.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case at times last year, Switzer has read the Cowboys
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman and his mates are no longer among the NFL's elite,
but Saturday's first-half performance against the Rams also proved
that the Cowboys are not at the bottom of the barrel, either.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the season, there are three elite teams in the NFC:
the Packers, the 49ers and the Buccaneers. And there are three
patsies: the Saints, Bears and Rams.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the Cowboys in the middle of the pack, which
fortunately for them is where most of the NFC East sits as well.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer obviously didn't notice that running back Chris Warren,
who played in Seattle last season, is a great improvement over
Sherman Williams. And Switzer also didn't take the Cowboys'
schedule into account.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's fourth-place finish rewarded the Cowboys with the
NFL's eighth-weakest schedule in 1998. Their opponents were a
combined 119-131-6 last season. Only seven had records better than
.500 and only five made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the schedule are the Packers and the 49ers, who
were replaced by the Saints and the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are still looking for a pass rusher and they must
find a way to create turnovers on defense. However, with an
improved offensive line and supposedly better organization and
stricter discipline at the top, why shouldn't the Cowboys at least
compete for a playoff spot? MOOSE BACK ON THE LOOSE
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Daryl Johnston entered training camp as a question
mark. He's heading into the regular season as an exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys coaches say Johnston, who has battled back from
career-threatening neck surgery, has been the team's best offensive
player in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston has the new offense down so cold that he often makes up
for other players' mistakes in the blocking game, and some Cowboys
believe he is blocking better than he did all of last season. MOSS
WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys passed up Minnesota receiver Randy Moss in the draft
because they believed they needed a defensive end and because of
questions about Moss' off-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   The early results are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are still looking for a pass rusher, they are still
working on the No. 2 receiver and they still had off-field problems
with the Everett McIver-Michael Irvin incident. Meanwhile, NFL
scouts say Moss could end up as an all-time great. He has toyed
with NFL cornerbacks in the preseason with 10 catches for 164 yards
and two touchdowns. INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if former Steelers quarterback Jim Miller
gets a call from the Cowboys to compete with struggling Jason
Garrett at No. 2 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who was cut by the Lions, knows coach Chan Gailey's
offense. And the Cowboys coaches have been quietly talking about
him for a few weeks. Former Bills starter Todd Collins is also a
possibility. ... Based on his play the past two weeks, Billy Davis
probably has won the starting job at No. 2 receiver. By the way,
the blond-haired Davis said he will change his hair color several
times throughout the season. ... This week's game will be big for
1997 rookies wide receiver Macey Brooks and offensive lineman Steve
Scifres, who have had rough training camps and might be on the
verge of losing roster spots.

NFL OFFENSES IN A RUSH TO EMBRACE LATEST TREND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it is the vision of Denver running back Terrell Davis
slashing through the Green Bay defense in last season's Super Bowl.
It could be that John Elway's 22 passes were the fewest by a
winning Super Bowl team in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it is another telling statistic: NFL teams that
attempted more rushing plays than passes during 1997's regular
season won a whopping 69 percent of their games.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is prompting the talk, the word is out that the run is
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things go in cycles in sports and music,'' said Dallas Cowboys
defensive coordinator Dave Campo. ``And right now, the trend
definitely seems to be coming back around to the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Barry Sanders can be considered the trendsetters after
their run at the 2,000-yard mark last season. Sanders posted the
third 2,000-plus season in league history with a total of 2,053
yards in leading his team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis ran for 1,750 yards last season and ran off with the Super
Bowl most valuable player award after gaining 150 yards and rushing
for three touchdowns against the Packers. During the regular
season, NFL running backs topped the 200-yard mark a record seven
times and the 100-yard mark 121 times, the most since the 1970
AFL-NFL merger.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Francisco coach Bill Walsh, widely credited with
introducing to the NFL what has come to be known as the ``West
Coast offense,'' says he believes teams are beginning to turn away
from the trendy run-and-shoot offensive formations with three and
four wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-back offense with a tight end gives you much more
versatility,'' Walsh said. ``I think we'll see more of a return to
that, and that probably means a greater emphasis on running.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Coast offense, high-percentage short passes and runs
are typically used for ball control, and to set up the long pass.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco team of 1994, coached by George Seifert, used
that offense nearly to perfection and was almost invincible. The
49ers blew out San Diego, 49-26, in a Super Bowl in which a record
93 passes were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the next year the run slipped a notch in
priority leaguewide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 43.3 percent of the NFC's offensive plays from
scrimmage (excluding punts and field goals) were runs, compared to
45.1 and 47.5 percent the previous two seasons. The AFC dropped to
44.9 percent that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, we're all copycats,'' admits Miami offensive
coordinator Kippy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But not every pass has Steve Young on one end and Jerry Rice on
the other, Brown points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had to ask themselves, `Do I have the people to do
that?' And the truth is, a lot of teams don't,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   With that realization, the percentage of runs in the NFC
rebounded to 45.7 in 1996 and again to 46.8 percent last year. The
AFC was at 46.1 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum could swing further toward running this year, many
are predicting.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campo, defenses across the league have begun to
adapt to the West Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Coast offense uses the short pass as a running play,
and that's fine,'' Campo said. ``But it also limits the different
types of passes a team throws, and what has happened is that
defenses will catch up to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's like playing against the wishbone, with only so
many running plays you have to stop. When there are only so many
pass patterns to defend, teams get used to that, and the defense
has a chance to control it a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, New York Jets coach Bill Parcells has pledged to
reemphasize the run.
</P>
<P>
   So has Brown's boss, Dolphins head coach Jimmy Johnson, who won
three Super Bowls at Dallas with the kind of balanced offense he
hasn't had at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years,'' Brown said, ``statistics have proven that
teams that have a certain number of running attempts win a certain
percentage of their games, regardless of yards per carry. People
are really starting to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only seven NFL teams ran the ball more than they threw
it. Topping the AFC in run percentage were Tennessee, Pittsburgh,
Kansas City and Denver. They went a combined 44-20 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC leader in run percentage? None other the 49ers, who
without injured Jerry Rice still finished with a 13-3 record by
running the ball 54.7 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Other NFC teams on the short list were the surprising Tampa Bay
and New York Giants, who along with San Francisco logged a combined
33-14-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   None of that surprises Walsh, who points out that although his
1984 championship team - regarded as one of the NFL's all-time
greatest - is best remembered for Joe Montana and Rice, it also was
among the league leaders in rushing with two 1,000-yard backs in
Roger Craig and Wendell Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game goes in cycles, to a certain extent,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The current run cycle includes young rushers such as Tennessee's
Eddie George, Cincinnati's Corey Dillon and Oakland's Napoleon
Kaufman, who each had 200-yard games last season.
</P>
<P>
   However, Walsh cautions not to expect any dramatic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're likely to see more running, but make no mistake, this is
still going to be a game of the forward pass,'' he said. ``The
forward pass typically dominates in the NFL, and the teams that do
it most effectively are the ones that consistently win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm expecting more teams to try to it from the framework
of a more balanced attack. That's the direction the league seems to
be headed again.''

LEWIS RESCUES RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-ATHLETICS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the schedule in their favor and the home crowd at their
backs, the Red Sox lopped another day of summer off a calendar
shrinking ever closer to a playoff date in fall.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis, whose personal history is linked to another Red
Sox outfielder who always will be remembered for his autumn
splendor, Dave Henderson, hit a tie-breaking home run into the
left-field screen in the seventh inning that lifted the Red Sox to
a 3-2 win Tuesday night over the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The win went to lefty reliever Greg Swindell, his first with the
Red Sox, and was saved by Tom Gordon, whose league-leading 37th
save (34th in a row) assured the Red Sox of gaining another game in
the wild-card race on the Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers, who
trail by nine games with 4 1/2 weeks to play. The Red Sox, who have
won eight of nine from the A's this season and four of their last
six overall, are a season-best 25 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, whose big-league career began with Oakland almost eight
years ago to the day (Aug. 21, 1990) because Henderson went down
with a knee injury, was hitless in 18 previous at-bats before he
connected off lefthander Kenny Rogers before a sweating crowd of
28,366 in Fenway Park, site of 20 of the Red Sox' final 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I've learned as I've gotten older? That's the
way it goes,'' said Lewis of his extended drought, which he failed
to break with a first-inning bunt and a fourth-inning line drive
over the head of right fielder Ben Grieve, which the rookie ran
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn as you get older not to fight yourself. You keep
working, and most important, you relax. You don't get down on
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's home run was his seventh of the year, one more than he
has had in the last three seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't analyze,'' Lewis said, as lockermate Darren Bragg
turned and showed off a T-shirt that read: ``Play Hard and Go
Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen. You hope you stay healthy, are blessed with
strength, and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't start patting yourself on the back, because the
minute you do that, you find yourself out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, who had been summoned into the game after Rickey
Henderson banged a single off the leg of reliever Derek Lowe and
stole second base, gave up a tying single to Jason Giambi on the
first pitch he threw in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Swindell, who came to the Sox in a trading-deadline deal
with the Twins, picked up the win after Lewis homered and he
pitched a scoreless eighth inning, abetted by a nice catch by left
fielder Troy O'Leary. With one out in the ninth, Gordon gave up a
pinch single to Bip Roberts, who promptly stole second, but Gordon
left him there by retiring pinch hitter Ed Sprague and Rickey
Henderson on ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Swindell has pitched for a team with a playoff
spot at stake?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said. ``I've never been in a pennant race. When I
was with Cincinnati, we were nine games ahead at the break and won
92 games, but the Braves beat us by eight games. I hadn't been in a
game that meant much this late in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox starter Tim Wakefield, who as a Pirates rookie in 1992
pitched in playoff games that meant even more, gave up only a home
run to Mike Blowers in the sixth, his last inning of work after
throwing 106 pitches. Wakefield was denied his 16th win on a night
he gave up four hits, walked four, and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   But he left an Oakland runner on third base in the second when
he struck out Miguel Tejada, and left the bases loaded in the fifth
when he induced Matt Stairs to pop out to Mike Benjamin in short
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, meanwhile, spotted the Sox a 2-0 lead in the first on a
bases-loaded walk to Mike Stanley and an RBI single by O'Leary, but
he also showed a knack for dodging danger, inducing Damon Buford to
ground out with the bases still loaded in the first, and pitching
out of a second-and-third, no-out situation in the second.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers had no answer for Nomar Garciaparra, who went 4 for 4
with three singles and a double, and he couldn't stop Lewis from
lofting his 2-and-2 fastball into a southwest breeze that dropped
the ball safely into the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get caught up in that,'' Lewis said when asked if this
nine-game homestand was the start of a stretch in which the Sox
could perhaps build an insurmountable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day means too much to start looking ahead. Oakland is a
good ball club, but we still should beat them. You can slip up if
you don't concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has never been a problem for Garciaparra. Three
times this season, Garciaparra has had games in which he went
hitless in five at-bats (including one 0 for 6). Each time, he has
followed with huge games. Three hits, including two home runs and
five RBIs, the first time. Three hits, including a triple and two
RBIs, the second time. Tuesday night, his third four-hit game of
the season and seventh of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try to shake it off,'' Garciaparra said of his rare
off-nights. ``You understand that the game can knock you down, but
you go out there knowing that tomorrow, you can pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was a nice day, but then again tomorrow it can knock
you down again.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon the leaves will turn, and look who's still standing.
``It's simple,'' manager Jimy Williams said. ``You go out and
compete. There's no magic potion.''

M'S BULLPEN TO BLAME FOR LACK OF ONE-RUN WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mike Timlin was in a mildly defiant mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people write us off,'' he said after Monday's 11-10
win over Chicago, a game that featured more weirdness than Mark
McGwire's medicine cabinet. ``Please. Go ahead. Write us off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might come up and bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of attitude a pitcher can take when he gives up
a grand slam and still gets a save. The Mariners have not been
blessed with such serendipity this season, so Timlin can be
forgiven his misplaced swagger.
</P>
<P>
   It's the club owners who wrote off Timlin and his pals when they
dealt Randy Johnson for nothing that will help in 1998. But that
dead horse has been pummeled into Big Unit dog food, so we won't go
there again this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Of more curiosity was the four straight wins by one run over the
White Sox, after the Mariners went the previous 125 games with four
single-digit wins.
</P>
<P>
   The major league record for fewest one-run wins in a season is
10, so the Mariners are still capable of reaching a team mark as
dubious as the home-run chase is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   The potential Mariner achievement might be even more amazing,
since most clubs via the law of averages will win a half-dozen
games a season like the Mariners did Monday. As manager Lou
Piniella dryly put it: ``We put up a lot of runs, and one more than
they scored.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to win a fair number of one-run games, just
because of baseball's virtue of balance between offense and
defense. Over the last seven years, bad teams and good, the
Mariners have averaged about 20 one-run wins.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like David Segui, are prone to dismiss the development as
another irrelevant statistical anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks about that in here,'' the Mariner first baseman
said in the clubhouse. ``That's for you guys to write. The way
we've played, it's not surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, except that a reversal of a half-dozen of those
close losses would have the Mariners locked into contention. The
8-20 ledger is not a cause but a symptom of what ails a team that
should be biting.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella listed the lamentable litany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relief pitching, defensive execution, and men left on base,''
he said. ``Most of that came early. June was the worst. Since the
All-Star break, we've been doing better. Early in the year we
didn't add runs, and other teams crept back into games.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four games against the White Sox, the Mariners corrected
nearly all of those deficiencies, and covered up the one mess _
seven runs surrendered by the pen in Monday's last two innings _
with prodigious offense and consecutive run-scoring wild pitches by
the AL's rottenest veteran pitcher, Jamie Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Mariners won a lot in that fashion (25-21 in
one-run games) on the way to a club-record 90 regular-season wins.
As the Baltimore Orioles pointed out, that kind of style doesn't
work so well in the postseason. But it was certainly better than
this season's woefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's litany pointed out the deadly combination that has
brought down the club this season. And while the most egregious
evidence is third baseman Russ Davis's 33 errors, which continue to
bury the club record of 29 set by shortstop Craig Reynolds in 1978,
the bullpen's profound ineptness has helped corrupt the club's one
major asset _ offense.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner hitters over the last three years have become so twitchy
over the fact that too many runs are never enough that they are
locked into a head game of one-swing solutions. A macho bunch to
begin with, they remain so addicted to the low-percentage trick of
the home run that they are on the verge of setting a club mark for
men left on base.
</P>
<P>
   They are averaging 7.5 runners left on per game, up from the
mark of 7.1 of 1996, a tell-tale sign with so few one-run wins. So
many times hitters have found themselves with just three or six
at-bats to recover from a sudden deficit created by the Gasoline
Gang that the desperation plays into the group's greatest
collective weakness.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-year Mariner coming from the National League, where
small-ball prevails, Segui is hip to the consequences of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about that, and it's the only thing that might be
right,'' he said. ``We have so many guys who can hit home runs, we
try to roll the dice all at once, instead of the higher percentage
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing I can think of. It might help to change
the approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough to do, since the habit here runs so deep, notwithstanding
the streak over the Weak Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The John Dalys of baseball will lead the game in home runs for a
second consecutive year and will have a single post-season win,
Game 3 in Baltimore last October, to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-salaried bullpen in baseball is even more costly
than the payroll shows.

PERSECUTION OF McGWIRE A CRIME 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Dan Shaughnessy 
c.1998 The Boston Globe
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wonder ballplayers loathe the media. Mark McGwire is stalking
one of baseball's most cherished records _ until now the feel-good
story of the baseball summer _ and suddenly he's engaged in a
tabloid-driven controversy that's painting him as a cheater and a
bad role model.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair.
</P>
<P>
   If you just dropped in from a two-week trip to Guam, here's the
background: An Associated Press reporter noticed a jar of
androstenedione in McGwire's locker last week. He asked the slugger
about the stuff, did some homework, and wrote about it.
Androstenedione, known in baseball clubhouses as ``andro,'' is an
all-natural, over-the-counter steroid (not of the dangerous
anabolic steroid family) that is used to help an athlete train
harder and recover faster. It is banned by the NFL, the NCAA, and
the Olympics, but allowed by the NHL, NBA, and Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   There. McGwire takes something that can be sold at any drugstore
and is permitted by his sport, and suddenly he's lumped with
Olympic swimmer Michelle Smith and sprinter Ben Johnson, a couple
of champs who got the gold using illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, America. The IOC has limits on caffeine intake. Juan
Antonio Samaranch would strip McGwire's medal if he went to the
plate after consuming eight cups of Maxwell House.
</P>
<P>
   The story of McGwire's historic home run chase is being
tarnished because folks are hearing bits of stories and reading
wild headlines and concluding that Big Mac is a pharmaceutical
creation.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is not some 98-pound weakling who went on the juice and
came back as Rambo. He is a huge, muscular man, who hit 49 home
runs in his first big league season 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's Globe, a doctor claims that andro is part of
McGwire's success. This makes it sound as if the substance is
adding 40 feet to McGwire's long fly balls. This is ridiculous.
Andro might help McGwire stay healthy and aid his recovery time
from injuries, but the same could be said about aspirin, or any
other pain reliever.
</P>
<P>
   If a slugger eats Wheaties (sold over the counter, not banned by
MLB) wouldn't it be true that Wheaties are part of his success?
What about steak? Is prime rib part of McGwire's success?
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's case, it is misleading to write that he's using a
``performance-enhancing drug.'' He's a baseball player, not an
Olympic sprinter. There's nothing sold at drugstores that would
help any of us hit a home run in the big leagues (unless the store
has a book on hitting written by Ted Williams). Facing Randy
Johnson and hitting a ball over the fence requires bravery, timing,
hand-eye coordination, reflexes, leverage, and strength. Most of
all, it requires practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, how many other baseball players are taking the same
stuff? McGwire probably doesn't go more than a couple of days
without hitting against a pitcher who uses andro. While we're at
it, what about creatine, another dietary supplement sold over the
counter, also used by McGwire? What about MET-Rx (endorsed on radio
and in print by Mo Vaughn)?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's been a good citizen, never one to disgrace the
uniform. Most recently he's dedicated his charity efforts to
awareness and funding for abused children. And now he's got to read
that he's a bad example to young athletes? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps andro will be proven unsafe. That is an issue for the
Food and Drug Administration and for Major League Baseball and its
Players Association. In the meantime, McGwire should be left alone
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. We've all heard the stories about Roger Maris's hair
falling out from stress when he chased Babe Ruth's record in the
summer of 1961. Turns out Roger was lucky. He didn't play in 1998
when you can do something legal and be painted as a cheater.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Babe? The Bambino hit 60 homers in 1927, the
seventh year of prohibition. Think he might have had a little
bathtub gin coursing through his veins at any point during the '27
season?
</P>
<P>
   Hope not. After all, it would have been a bad message for
America's youth.

PITCHERS WARY OF BEING McGWIRE'S CHUMP 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 11 biggest Mark McGwire fans on the continent
are in town this week. And they're easy to pick out of the general
population. They're wearing Montreal Expos uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's rooting harder for McGwire to break the home run
record, the sooner the better, than Expos pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   They'd ship him enough Androstenedione to fill a kitchen
cabinet, if that would help him get home run No.62 out of the way
before Sept. 25. And if McGwire doesn't have a kitchen cabinet,
they'd build him one.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 25 is the Friday night the Expos go to Busch Stadium to
begin the final, three-game series of the season, against McGwire
and the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it won't mean anything,'' Expos pitching coach Bobby
Cuellar said at Dodger Stadium, where the Expos are facing the
Dodgers. ``Hey, it might rain for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' Cuellar said, hopefully, over his
shoulder as he ran onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that series might make the difference between
McGwire breaking Roger Maris' 37-year-old record and not, and it
might make one of the Expos' young pitchers an indelible footnote
in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   For every historic homer, there's been a chump. Maris had Tracy
Stallard, a Boston Red Sox right-hander who did nothing more
distinctive in a seven-year career. Hank Aaron, for No. 715 in
1974, had Al Downing, a left-hander of note who, unfortunately, is
best known for his appearance on that videotape. Reggie Jackson,
hitting his third homer of the New York Yankees' clinching victory
over the Dodgers in the 1978 World Series, had Charlie Hough.
</P>
<P>
   Who will it be for McGwire? Mike Thurman, the Expos right-hander
who started against the Dodgers on Tuesday? Ugueth Urbina, the only
Expos All-Star. Anthony Telford, the Expos workhorse?
</P>
<P>
   How about you, Javier Vazquez?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be happier if he hits 62 before he faces us,'' said the
22-year-old, who is 4-13 this season. ``I'm not looking for any
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   And you, Steve Kline?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he does it before we get to town,'' said Kline,
who, as a left-handed reliever, is unlikely to face the
right-handed McGwire in any case.
</P>
<P>
   They might get their wish. McGwire, homerless Tuesday night
against Florida, has 53 in the Cardinals' 132 games. At that pace,
he'd hit his 61st in the team's 152nd game, Tuesday, Sept. 15
against Pittsburgh, and his 62nd in the team's 155th game,
Saturday, Sept. 19 at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't take much of a change of pace, though, to give the
Expos a real big headache.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for them: They're talking tough. They realize there
would be no shame in giving up No. 62. There would be shame only in
being too chicken to throw McGwire a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will pitch to him,'' said Carl Pavano, one of
six rookie pitchers on the Expos roster. ``It's part of the game.
He deserves (the chance to swing).''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a competitor, you want to challenge him,'' said
Jeremy Powell. ``Personally, for the good of the game, I'd like to
see him (get the record). If he hits it off me, it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving him anything,'' reliever Miguel Batista said.
``If he hits it, I'll be the first to say, `He did it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have given up only one McGwire homer this season. The
pitcher, Trey Moore, is on the disabled list now.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the final weekend, McGwire is still ahead of Sammy Sosa
and the record is on the line, everybody will deal with it in his
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody will make like Denny McLain, who, in his 31st
victory of 1968, gave up Mickey Mantle's 535th home run, good for
third place on the all-time list. Mantle had motioned for a
fastball across the letters. McLain had thrown it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give up a lot of home runs,'' McLain was quoted as saying.
``I don't think one more makes any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one way of looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have a novel way of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we dread it?'' said Pavano. ``A lot of people know
our pitching staff for being rookies. I think it would be kind of
cool if McGwire came into (the Expos series) with 61, and our staff
of rookies shut him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, 36{ games out of first place, haven't had much at
stake this year. And they haven't been on national TV in the United
States, as they will be if McGwire's bid comes down to the final
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe they're dreaming of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know. They seem genuinely fond of McGwire, and
they'd like to see history made. They'd just prefer not to watch
from the pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   So are they telling McGwire to break a leg or just sprain it?

DID M'S LOSE? 10-4, GOOD BUDDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ This is where Stan Williams came in. The Mariner
pitching coach noticed the similarity Tuesday and was neither
amused nor happy.
</P>
<P>
   He was more upset than at any time during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going in there and apologizing to the team,''
Williams said after Bobby Ayala blew another gasket and two
subsequent relievers were nearly as ineffective in Seattle's
11-walk, 10-4 loss to the Cleveland Indians before 43,113 fans at
Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the opener of a grueling nine-game road trip
against the three best teams in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Although starter Bill Swift absorbed a large portion of an
Indians assault led by Manny Ramirez, who went 4-for-4 and drove in
five runs, Williams directed his postgame wrath at the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed,'' he said. ``The (relief) staff didn't give
the club a chance to win the game after we battled back. This was a
big game for the team, an important road trip for us. I'm very
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 free passes issued by Seattle pitchers were the most in
one game since the 10 walks given to the Indians on April 14,
Williams' first game after replacing Nardi Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for that, not this late in the season,'' he
said. ``I don't blame Swifty as much as the others. I didn't like
what I saw (from the relievers).''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said there are games when the starter is going to
struggle, as Swift did last night. In those games, he believes the
relievers must step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to come in, show some pride and get the job done,''
he bristled. ``I'm more than a little disgusted. More than I've
been, or at least shown, all season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who had their four-game winning streak end with a
resounding thud, took a 1-0 in the first inning on Alex Rodriguez's
RBI double, but fell behind in the fourth when Cleveland scored
five two-out runs.
</P>
<P>
   Down but not out, the Mariners scored twice in the fifth and
once in the sixth, on David Segui's 17th homer of the season,
slicing the deficit to two runs. They never got closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to get back in the game and then had no
chance,'' Williams added.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala pitched a scoreless fifth inning, but got hammered for
three hits and three runs in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We closed the gap, but couldn't hold the game in check,''
manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, changing the subject somewhat, he said, ``I'm looking
forward to seeing some of our young pitchers, I can tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen for another week, when rosters can be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki will join the team from Class AAA Tacoma. So will
Brett Hinchcliffe and perhaps Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happens to Ayala is anyone's guess, but Piniella
seems to be running out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his record (1-9 with a 7.16 ERA) speaks for itself,''
Piniella said. ``It hasn't been the best of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, however, is signed through next season.
</P>
<P>
   Swift doesn't have the luxury of a contract beyond this season
and several of his recent starts have been clunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' the right-hander said. ``I
pitch well for three or four innings then all hell breaks loose.
It's hard to say what is happening, but I'm not really
concentrating the way I should.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he has an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight start, Swift (10-8) had to contend with
the after-effects of Benadryl, a medication he needed to combat two
outbreaks of hives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's the reason, but my energy level has
been down,'' he said. ``(The medication) makes me drowsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians pounded him with two-out thunder.
</P>
<P>
   The American League Central Division leaders scored their first
run with two outs in the third inning _ after Swift retired the
first two batters _ and erupted for five more runs in the fourth.
This time, they had two outs and one runner on base before Kenny
Lofton doubled over Ken Griffey Jr.'s head, Omar Vizquel and Brian
Giles singled and Ramirez drove his 31st homer of the season into
the left-center field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they had a lot of two-out hits,'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight to be precise and nearly as many two-out walks _ six.
</P>
<P>
   The last two, compliments of Heathcliff Slocumb in the seventh,
forced in Cleveland's final run and put the Indians into
double-digits in runs for the first time in its past 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   But they paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Travis Fryman, who went 0-for-5, tried to help
with his defense in the eighth inning. He raced toward the stands
attempting to snag Joey Cora's pop fly, but went head-over-heels
after colliding with the rolled-up tarp, suffering a broken nose
and a cut above his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a local hospital for precaution.

GRAY LOST AMONG COLORFUL SIGNEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Chris Gray could be called the forgotten
Seahawk.
</P>
<P>
   That's unremembered as in this year's free-agent addition who
became a footnote because was he signed the same day as Pro Bowl
center Kevin Glover.
</P>
<P>
   That's forgettable because Gray is the only member of this
year's free-agent class who is not starting, a 305-pound runt in a
pick-of-the-litter group that includes running back Ricky Watters,
linebacker Darrin Smith, guard Brian Habib, punter Jeff Feagles and
Glover.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten. Forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   That could sum up Gray, a journeyman guard who started 25 games
in five previous NFL seasons with the Miami Dolphins and Chicago
Bears. Except, that is, for one small detail: He just keeps doing
things that make it impossible to overlook him.
</P>
<P>
   Not the types of things that send fans into a frenzy or have
reporters hanging on his every word. But the types of things that
endure a player to his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Like when backup centers Greg Bloedorn and Frank Beede went down
with knee injuries six days apart early in training camp. Gray was
pushed into the position during the preseason opener at Dallas and
has held it.
</P>
<P>
   Or like when Washington State rookie Jason McEndoo was
struggling with the snapping for field goals and PATs. The coaches
handed the ball to Gray and he hasn't given it back _ a big factor
in McEndoo being released this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started working with Chris, he was kind of
shaky,'' special teams coach Pete Rodriguez said Tuesday. ``He got
progressively better. And last week, all of a sudden, it was like
the light bulb went on and he snapped perfect in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray has taken it all in stride, and with a somewhat whimsical
outlook:
</P>
<P>
   -- On being the team's other free-agent signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After me, all the big-time guys signed,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been the allure of getting to play with Chris Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``That must be what it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   -- On becoming a center out of necessity in the middle of a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of surprised,'' he said. ``I have a new respect for
the center position, I'll tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm pretty well suited to play center.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On inheriting the snapping job after not doing it since his
second season with the Dolphins in 1994. If Gray had not snapped up
the job, the Seahawks would have been forced to use linebacker
Jason Kyle, a 242-pounder who does the long snapping for punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had worked on it in Miami,'' Gray said. ``But they had a guy
there they signed just to snap. So I worked on it during the
offseason and in minicamps. I got fairly good at it then, but that
was a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On playing with a large gash on the bridge of his nose _ the
one that develops from his helmet being pushed into face and finds
a way to bleed despite being covered by an extra-large protective
strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing started back in college,'' said Gray, who was a
second-team All-American his senior season at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to show his profile and emphasis the lump on his nose,
Gray offered, ``I guess you could call it a Seahawk beak.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a badge of honor for a lineman who plays the game with as
much intensity and tenacity as Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``On game day when it gets busted open, it looks pretty good,''
Gray said. ``You should see some of the looks I get from defensive
linemen when they look up and see this thing all bloody.''
</P>
<P>
   In a word, it's unforgettable.

AT LONG LAST, AN UPGRADE AT SHORTSTOP FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Far back in the franchise annals, as far back
as the Benji Gils and the Jeff Kunkels, as distant as the Dickie
Thon era and the Bucky Dent era, and even traversing in time past
the infamous Mendoza Line, the Texas Rangers have had this thing
with shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   As great a career as Bert Campaneris had, Campy hit only .230
when he played shortstop for the Rangers in the late 1970s. Kunkel,
a No. 1 draft pick, spent parts of seven seasons at short here and
batted .224.
</P>
<P>
   The Mendoza Line, baseball's benchmark of hitting futility, as
originally defined by George Brett, was based on Mario Mendoza,
Rangers shortstop, 1981-82.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respects, therefore, to Dent and to Toby Harrah,
who both manned the position with distinction while here, it's not
exactly like Royce Clayton has a rich legacy to follow.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason, however, to marvel at Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   The newest of the Rangers shortstops has quickness. He has a
cannon of a throwing arm. He has the range of a guard dog. He has a
lively bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the time he's been here,'' general manager Doug Melvin
said, opting for understatement, ``I think you can say he's done
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   You can say more, but anything Melvin says might be held against
him when he sits down with Clayton's agent after the season. Free
agent-eligible Clayton is a keeper, and at such a talent-thin
position, the Rangers need to make signing him a foremost
off-season priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want energy at that position,'' continued Melvin, who made
the trade with St. Louis that brought Clayton and (wince) Todd
Stottlemyre. ``Not to take anything away from Kevin Elster, who did
a great job for us in '96, but Royce brings that level of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only Melvin and Rangers fans who have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have been in town and they say they haven't seen me
smile like this in an awfully long time,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in Royce Clayton's eight-year big-league career was
that he had grown up always wanting to be like Ozzie Smith. His
bedroom back in Southern California had an Ozzie poster on the
wall. Ozzie is why he became a shortstop, Royce says.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin remembers going to Playa del Rey, Calif., to scout the
young St. Bernard High School prospect. When the team took the
field, Clayton raced out to shortstop and duplicated Ozzie's
trademark flip.
</P>
<P>
   In Clayton's ninth professional season, however, the dream
turned into an ugly reality. The great Jim Murray, who passed away
last week, wrote about it once under the headline, ``Be careful
what you wish for.''
</P>
<P>
   It chronicled the trade that sent young Clayton from the San
Francisco Giants to the Cardinals. Clayton was anointed Smith's
successor. The problem was, Ozzie wasn't ready to go anywhere,
especially quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man should be put in that position,'' Clayton told Murray
back then. ``The crowds were the worst. You expect to be booed on
the road. But I was getting booed at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith turned an obvious chilly shoulder to his announced
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy,'' Clayton says now. ``It was tough on
everybody, including my family and fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been something that really set my career back.
But I was able to battle through it. I think, in the end, I really
grew up as a person and as a player by having to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, Clayton, now 28, bridged the transition more
than capably for the Cardinals. After a .277 average in his first
season, Clayton made the National League All-Star team in 1997. No
NL shortstop fielded more chances (699).
</P>
<P>
   That one statistic says all that Rangers fans need to know about
Clayton. Elster, his predecessor, alas, will be remembered here
more for the ground balls he didn't get to, rather than the ones he
did.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade is startling. Nary a home night has gone by where
stadium announcer Chuck Morgan hasn't toasted a Clayton defensive
play with the ``SportsCenter'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The talk in St. Louis was that Clayton was still pressing, that
he was hurrying plays and that he wasn't going to be worth what he
would be asking for in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to comment on anything Tony La Russa might have
said,'' Clayton says, simply. ``If the Cardinals feel they were
doing me a favor by trading me, then I thank them very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, though, that it's been a blessing to be here in a
place where I feel I'm needed and where the fans have welcomed me
so graciously.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, for obvious reasons, Clayton never got to repeat
his high school Ozzie Smith flip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he helps us win the division,'' GM Melvin said, ``maybe
I'll do the flip.''

BIGWIGS COURTED IN SEARCH FOR GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers' search for a new general
manager has stepped up, with GMs from the past two World Series
champions part of the interview process.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Watson, who helped lead the New York Yankees to a title in
1996 despite the presence of high-profile owner George
Steinbrenner, met with Dodgers president Bob Graziano Tuesday and
watched the game against Montreal in the private box of interim GM
Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who resigned from his Yankees position before this
season, refused to discuss the interview with Graziano and Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Graziano will meet with Dave Dombrowski, general manager
of the Florida Marlins, who won the World Series last year. During
the Dodgers' visit to Florida last week, Lasorda met informally
with Dombrowski, a favorite of the team's new owners at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson brought excellent credentials to the interview. He is
a Los Angeles-area native and has run the baseball operation in New
York, the No.1 market in major-league baseball. He is a longtime
major-leaguer who began his post-playing career as an assistant GM
with the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is also the only African-American to have interviewed.
Another candidate, Omar Minaya, the assistant GM and head of
international scouting for the New York Mets, is Latino.
</P>
<P>
   __ Valdes update: Injured right-hander Ismael Valdes will make a
second rehabilitation start Thursday at Class-A San Bernardino
against the Lancaster JetHawks.
</P>
<P>
   The club hopes Valdes would be ready to join the rotation after
missing a month with a strained muscle in his left side. However,
during his first rehab start last Friday for Class-A Vero Beach,
Fla., Valdes developed a blister on the index finger of his
pitching hand and was limited to 47 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't in good conscience put him in a big-league game
after just 47 pitches,'' said Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman. ``He
is pain-free, but we need to get a better look at the total
picture. We need to see him pitch out of certain situations, throw
all his pitches in tough spots. You can't just figure he will do
all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot Hubbard: After going 4 for 9 on the recent trip, Trenidad
Hubbard was given the start in left field Tuesday night against
right-hander Mike Thurman. Matt Luke, who normally would start in
left as part of a lefty/righty platoon, batted .091 (1 for 11) on
the trip. Since Luke's season average peaked at .337 at July 4, he
has gone 13 for 96 (.135) with five homers and 10 RBI.

STOTTLEMYRE STRUGGLES AGAIN IN RANGERS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
described right-hander Todd Stottlemyre as a ``bulldog'' upon
acquiring the 33-year-old pitcher on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers await Stottlemyre's bite.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who earlier this season served as the anchor of the
Cardinals' rotation before a five-player trade delivered him to
Arlington, recorded only 10 outs before his early dismissal during
the Rangers' 8-7 defeat to the Tigers on Tuesday night at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (3-2) surrendered five runs on eight hits _ six of
those for extra bases _ during 3 1/3 innings and shackled the
Rangers with a four-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers nearly overcame Stottlemyre's performance and a
costly, seventh-inning mistake on the bases by second baseman Luis
Alicea with a three-run ninth inning. Tigers right-hander Doug
Jones, though, induced a game-ending ground ball from third baseman
Todd Zeile to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers will enter Wednesday's game with a 3 1/2-game
deficit to the American League West-leading Angels, who defeated
the Yankees, 7-6, Tuesday night in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at tape,'' said Stottlemyre, who entered Tuesday
night's appearance with a 3-1 record largely on the strength of 43
runs scored by the Rangers during his previous four starts. ``It's
nothing mechanical. It's nothing physical. It's just a matter of
making the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is more frustrated than I am right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's most significant achievement of the evening
occurred during the third inning. The right-hander retired
designated hitter Frank Catalanotto, second baseman Damion Easley
and first baseman Tony Clark in order. It represented only the
second time in the 26 innings started by Stottlemyre that the
opponent did not produce a base runner.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre continues to throw well during his bullpen sessions
between starts, yet it does not translate into success when it
matters most. Nevertheless, manager Johnny Oates remains
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect his next start to be outstanding,'' Oates said.
``I've seen him pitch before. I've seen him get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers tagged Stottlemyre for three first-inning runs as
four of the first five batters reached on doubles. Catcher Paul
Bako's fourth-inning, run-scoring triple represented the end of the
line for Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug a hole and couldn't get out of it,'' Oates said. ``We
did some things wrong. We had a couple of mental mistakes out there
and missed a couple of signs that hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no mental mistake hurt more than Alicea's.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the bottom of the seventh inning staring at
an 8-2 deficit, but Tigers manager Buddy Bell removed right-hander
Brian Powell (3-4) after shortstop Royce Clayton and center fielder
Tom Goodwin reached safely.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Matt Anderson promptly issued a walk to Alicea to
load the bases, and left fielder Rusty Greer followed with a
two-run single. Anderson, though, retired right fielder Juan
Gonzalez on strikes for the inning's first out, which brought first
baseman Will Clark to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Bell summoned left-hander Sean Runyan from the bullpen for the
lefty-lefty matchup, and Clark responded with a well-hit ball. The
line drive, though, found the glove of right fielder Juan
Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea, the runner at second, did not expect the ball to be
caught and became easy prey for the inning-ending, rally-killing
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a chance where I shouldn't have,'' Alicea said. ``We
were down four runs there. I was too aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored three times during their final at-bat, which
included a sacrifice fly by Gonzalez and a two-run homer by Clark.
Yet, Jones and the Tigers survived.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers await the time when Stottlemyre will
pitch more like a No. 1 starter than a journeyman toting a 7.03
earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the next one,'' Oates said, ``will be the one
where he goes out and pitches a masterpiece.''

PETTITTE TIPOFF?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jim Kaat, an announcer for the MSG network which
broadcasts New York Yankees games, said Monday night during the
telecast he thought Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte might have been
tipping his pitches in the Angels' five-run seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees scoffed but not ex-Angel Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camera panned in on (hitting coach) Rod (Carew) and showed
him talking to hitters and making a motion with his hand like he
was pitching,'' Davis said. ``Rod's very good at doing that.
They've got a couple guys over there that are very smart like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, said that if the Angels were picking something
up with Pettitte, there was nothing wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not considered cheating,'' he said. ``Whatever experience
you have, you should use to your advantage. If I was good at
picking up pitches, believe me, my hitters would know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Vintage McDowell: &UR; !off! &LR;  Pitcher Jack McDowell is 2-0
with a 1.29 ERA since his return from the disabled list, including
Monday's victory over the Yankees. Is he a different pitcher?
</P>
<P>
   He's says no, that he still throws the same pitches. The
difference is in his approach, now that his elbow allows him only
to do so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a maximum-effort pitcher,'' McDowell said. ``I
would throw every ball as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, McDowell has to locate his pitches accurately and pitch
through the pain, so he doesn't throw as hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't know he had arm problems, you'd think he's 100
percent healthy,'' shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``He's out there
pitching on guts, determination and guile. We have a lot of guys on
this team like that. Tim Salmon, guys that put whatever they have
on the line. It's been productive and inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Playing with pain: &UR; !off! &LR;  The welt DiSarcina suffered on
his left shin Monday was as big as a golf ball and hurt so bad
DiSarcina said he thought he broke his leg.
</P>
<P>
   But it was news to Angels manager Terry Collins. Before
Tuesday's game against the Yankees, Collins was asked how
DiSarcina's shin was, and he looked puzzled. When told that
DiSarcina fouled a ball off his leg in batting practice Monday,
Collins said: ``He disguised it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina said Tuesday his shin felt like ``somebody hit me with
a sledgehammer,'' but it didn't keep him out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Positive sign: &UR; !off! &LR;  Pitcher Ken Hill threw 40 pitches
in a two-inning simulated game Tuesday and felt no problems with
his surgically repaired right elbow. He's scheduled to start Friday
in Boston.

RANGERS CLAIM CADARET FROM ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 BULLPEN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers got the second left-hander
they wanted for the bullpen, claiming veteran Greg Cadaret on
waivers from the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret is expected to join the Rangers on Wednesday. He teams
with Eric Gunderson to give the club two left-handed relievers for
the first time since Scott Bailes went on the disabled list on Aug.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Bailes' injury made us look for a left-hander,'' general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``It's evident the teams we just played _
Cleveland, Boston and New York _ have some key left-handed
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't have a left-handed reliever who could get
them out on a consistent basis. Left-handed batters are hitting
.317 (39-for-123) against Gunderson.
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret, 36, was attractive because he held left-handers to a
.230 (14-for-61) average while with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a low left-handed batting average,'' Melvin said.
``He's got a good arm, he's durable, and he can fill a couple of
roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret, who will be owed almost $47,000 of his $250,000 salary
by the Rangers, is 38-32 with a 3.98 earned-run average in a
10-year career with seven teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadaret is one of those guys who hangs around for a reason,''
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He gets people out. He's a veteran who
knows how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates hasn't decided what role Cadaret will fill, whether he'll
be the late-inning left-handed specialist or if he'll enter the
game sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what works out for us,'' Oates said. ``We'll play it
by ear for a few days and see what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates is glad to have Cadaret because his moves were limited
with one left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certain things you can't do,'' Oates said. ``You've
only got so many bullets to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret was released even though he pitched effectively for the
Angels. He was 1-2 with a 4.14 ERA and one save in 39 games when he
was designated for assignment on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, because of the waiver process, he now could help the
team trying to catch the Angels in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control who a player goes to,'' Melvin said.
``That's just a gamble you take.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he believed the Rangers had a good chance to acquire
Cadaret when the Angels placed him on unconditional release
waivers. If more than one team claims a player, he goes to the team
with the worse record, and Texas has the worst mark among teams in
serious playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the last potential playoff team,'' Melvin said. ``I
didn't think there would be a team behind us that would claim
him.''  &LR; tagtop:Simon Gonzalez, (817) 390-7760

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros have been waiting for the Mike Hampton of old to
resurface, and maybe they still are. In the meantime, they'll be
more than happy to settle for performances like the one they
received from the player wearing No. 10 on Tuesday night at the
Astrodome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The finesse-pitching ground-ball artist turned into a miniature
version of Randy Johnson, striking out a career-high 12 batters and
seemingly willing the Astros to a 3-2 victory over the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who was hardly wild despite walking five batters, kept
the Braves off-balance with a brilliant array of pitches, most of
which had dazzling movement. The nifty performance helped the
Astros extend their winning streak to five games and snapped a
four-game streak for the Braves, whom the Astros are chasing along
with San Diego for the best record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you beat the Braves, it's never easy,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``This was a good win for our team but
especially for Mike Hampton. He had extra-good stuff and a lot of
movement on his pitches. He pitched a really powerful game.
Hopefully, this will start him on a streak of good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, Hampton's best streak had been for no-decisions
_ three in a row and six in his past nine starts. To his credit,
Hampton has pitched well enough to keep the Astros in most of his
starts (the Astros are 17-9 in games he has started), but he hasn't
always been able to hang around long enough to reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case Tuesday, when he delivered a workhorse
effort, lasting eight innings and throwing a season-high 130
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care if I get a win as long as the team wins,''
said Hampton (10-6). ``There have been times when I felt like I've
let the lead slip away because I wasn't maintaining my focus, and
that's something that upset me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was able to stay focused (Tuesday), and I felt good even
after I left the game. I didn't know how many pitches I had thrown
until they told me. This is a good feeling; I'm not going to lie
and say it isn't. Any time you go eight innings and the team wins,
you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   And as if the Braves hadn't struck out enough, Dierker brought
extra-fresh closer Billy Wagner from the bullpen to pitch the ninth
inning. Wagner, who hadn't pitched in five days, punched out three
of the four batters he faced to earn his 25th save. The 15 combined
strikeouts were the most in a game by the Astros this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I probably would have walked a couple of guys if I
had gone this long without pitching,'' Wagner said. ``I guess
getting hit in the head has made me focus a little more on where
I'm throwing those pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 60 runs in their previous nine games, the Astros'
offense cranked out a mere three, but that was enough to put
Hampton back in the win column.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did too well for us to let him down,'' Astros center
fielder Carl Everett said. ``He did an outstanding job. It was
unbelievable watching the way his ball moved from center field. If
we had lost this game for him and gave him another no-decision, it
would have looked bad on our part (as hitters).''
</P>
<P>
   So Everett took matters into his own hands in the sixth. His RBI
double off Braves starter Kevin Millwood (14-8) broke a tie at 2
and gave the Astros a final push toward their 15th victory in their
past 19 games. Everett's clutch double scored Jeff Bagwell, who
singled to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who began the season as the Astros' fourth outfielder,
has become one of the best run producers on the team. The talented
center fielder has 68 RBIs, 11 more than his previous career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like pressure,'' Everett said. ``A lot of guys don't, but I
do. Whether I succeed or fail, I enjoy being in those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   As fluid as the Astros' offense was during their three-game romp
in Chicago, it didn't flow from all faucets. Derek Bell and
Bagwell, who were a combined 3-for-24 against the Cubs, opened
their offensive valves in the first inning of Tuesday's game to
give the Astros an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bell whacked a two-out double into the left-center-field gap,
and Bagwell drove him home with a single up the middle. The Astros
have scored in the first inning in each of their past four games.
</P>
<P>
   They added a run in the second when Ricky Gutierrez hit a
leadoff single, advanced to third and scored when Hampton grounded
into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everyone played well in Chicago except Derek and
I,'' said Bagwell, who was 2-for-4 on Tuesday. ``But that's just
the way this team is. There's a different hero every night, and
that's what makes us so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton struck out five in the first three innings, but the
Braves struck back in the fourth. Catcher Javy Lopez blasted a
leadoff homer into the center-field seats to pull the visitors to
within a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made that pitch where I wanted to make it,'' Hampton said.
``But Javy's a good hitter, and he was able to get the good part of
the bat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who has a .346 career batting average against Hampton,
drew a leadoff walk in the sixth and scored on a double by Michael
Tucker, who was a late lineup replacement for left fielder Danny
Bautista.
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much the end of the Braves' offensive
production. They managed only a pair of infield singles after
Tucker's double, and five of the six Braves went down swinging _
three courtesy of Wagner, who didn't even have to unveil his new
and improved slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Catcher) Brad (Ausmus) felt that I had a good fastball and
that I was locating it really well, and he didn't see any reason to
mess around with anything else,'' Wagner said. ``I was happy with
the way I threw the ball. I wasn't hitting 100 mph (on the radar
gun), but I had good location.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as good as the Astros, who are in the process of
establishing themselves as perhaps the team to beat in the NL.

RANGERS MANAGER GOING WITH `HOT-HAND' THEORY
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The at-bats normally reserved for injured
designated hitter Lee Stevens will continue to be distributed to
``the hot hand until you get burned,'' Texas Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the presence of reserve outfielder Roberto Kelly
in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who Tuesday night drove in the Rangers' first run with
his second-inning double, entered the game hitting .500 (10-for-20)
with four home runs and nine runs batted in during his past seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly became the player of choice as reserve outfielder Mike
Simms began to slide. Simms entered Tuesday night's game hitless in
his past 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly replaced right fielder Juan Gonzalez in the outfield, and
the latter served as the designated hitter because of tightness in
his right calf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly is hot right now, so he's getting the playing time,''
Oates said. ``That's usually the way the manager goes. Simms was
probably the MVP during our last road trip. Since then, he's cooled
off a little bit.'' BAILES HAS TORN ROTATOR CUFF
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic resonance imaging test of Scott Bailes' left
shoulder revealed a partial tear of left-hander's rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Bailes, who went on the 15-day disabled list Aug. 1 with
bursitis in the shoulder, will continue his rehabilitation program.
Bailes received a cortisone shot yesterday and does not plan to
throw again until Friday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's confusing to me is that my arm feels great today,''
Bailes said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expressed hope that rest and rehabilitation will
allow Bailes to pitch by early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scott would like to get through September without
surgery,'' Oates said. SEARCHING FOR ANGELS
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charlie O'Brien (fracture, right thumb) began his
medical rehabilitation assignment Tuesday night with Double-A
Midland of the Texas League.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels expect to reinstate O'Brien by Sept. 1, although the
catcher could rejoin the team before then. The Angels acquired
O'Brien July 30 from the White Sox. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers' 12-10 victory Sunday against the Yankees scored
the highest Nielsen rating for Fox Sports Southwest in the Fort
Worth/Dallas area since the network began tracking the figures. The
telecast registered a 6.2 total television rating and an 11.9 cable
television rating. That surpassed the previous mark of 5.9 total
television rating (11.3 cable rating), established Aug. 4 when
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre made his debut with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers scheduled shortstop Royce Clayton as the guest for
Friday's ``Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' Chat Room. The session,
scheduled for 2-2:15 p.m., can be accessed through the Rangers'
Internet Web site at www.texasrangers.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ The organization promoted right-hander David Manning to
Triple-A Oklahoma from Class-A Charlotte. Manning replaces
right-hander Terry Clark in the RedHawks' rotation. Clark went on
the disabled list this week. FARM REPORT
</P>
<P>
   _ Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): Left-hander Ricky
Pickett, a product of Eastern Hills High School, earned his fourth
victory in five decisions as the RedHawks (72-58) defeated Omaha,
9-8, on Monday. Pickett (6-4, 3.13) surrendered four runs on nine
hits and recorded four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): The Drillers (74-61) defeated
Shreveport, 8-5, as shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt went 3-for-4 with a
home run and two runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-A Charlotte (Florida State League): Left fielder Craig
Monroe went 2-for-4 with his 15th home run and drove in two runs as
the Rangers (74-50) beat Sarasota, 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): Third baseman Travis
Hafner hit his 16th home run and drove in two runs, but the Sand
Gnats (62-74) lost to Augusta, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pulaski (Appalachian League, rookie): Right-hander Daniel
Boublis (4-7, 4.74) allowed one unearned run on four hits in seven
innings as the Rangers (28-36) defeated Bluefield, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gulf Coast (Gulf Coast League): Catcher Fredrick Torres threw
out three of four attempting to steal, but the Rangers (32-25) lost

ANGELS FEEL RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been a storybook season for the New York
Yankees in 1998, but Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium the Anaheim
Angels stole a bit of their thunder.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had one of their stars at the plate in Derek Jeter
with the bases loaded and two out in the bottom of the ninth
inning, trailing the Angels by one. But Angels closer Troy Percival
snared a chopper hit to the right of the mound and threw out Jeter
to preserve a 7-6 victory before 30,422.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second win in a row for the Angels in the Bronx,
their fourth consecutive overall. Because Texas lost, the Angels
increased their lead in the AL West to 3{ games.
</P>
<P>
   For the once seemingly invincible Yankees, the loss was their
third in a row and fifth in their past seven games. They had not
lost three straight since dropping the first three games of the
season _ two to the Angels and one to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   There were many big performances by the Angels on this night,
but what stands out is the way the Angels won, and how they're
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we can do is go out and play our game,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``We know exactly how good (the
Yankees) are. We are as amazed as everybody how good a season
they're having. But we can't come in here and not play the game the
way we know how.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows (the Yankees) are the most talented team in
baseball,'' said Percival, whose 36th save tied his career high.
``Well, we've got the best grinders in baseball. When you put those
two together, it's fun baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson (6-7) got the win in relief of starter Omar
Olivares. Watson gave up one run and four hits in three innings.
Mike Stanton (4-1) got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had plenty of offensive stars Tuesday, but they got
off to a late start. They entered the sixth inning trailing Yankees
starter Hideki Irabu 4-1. But they scored twice in the sixth and
four times in the seventh to take a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds had three hits, and Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus and
Matt Walbeck each had two hits to lead the offense. Garret
Anderson's RBI single in the seventh gave the Angels the lead for
good at 5-4, and Glaus' two-run double _ after he nearly getting
beaned _ gave the Angels a cushion at 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Yankees did not go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis' pinch single off the left-field fence made it 7-5
in the seventh and the Yankees tried to make the most out of little
in the eighth. They turned two infield hits and a line-drive single
by Paul O'Neill into a run, cutting the Angels' lead to 7-6.
Collins went to Percival with runners on first and second and one
out and Percival responded by striking out Bernie Williams, then
getting Tino Martinez on a grounder to second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easier in the ninth. Percival walked the bases loaded
but got Jeter when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at Texas and say we're hanging on,''
Percival said. ``We're not hanging on, we're running away.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, though, warned that the Angels haven't won anything
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got three more to go (against the Yankees in the
series),'' Collins said. ``Believe me, we're not satisfied yet. We
need to get out of here in good shape. Just because we've won two
games here doesn't mean we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   But they will take the first two, even if it meant sweating it
out to the very end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of nail-biters this year,'' Angels designated
hitter Tim Salmon said. ``It's what this team is all about. Very
rarely do we get an easy win. It always seems to come down to the
ninth inning with Percy on the hump.''

GIANTS DEFEAT METS, 7-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Starting pitching is supposed to separate the
Mets from the Giants and the Cubs in the National League wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Reed, one of the team's most reliable starters, is
struggling, and that's trouble for a team trying to reach the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was hit hard again on Tuesday night in the New York Mets'
7-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants. It was the third consecutive
loss for the Mets, who lead Chicago and San Francisco by a game in
the wild-card race with eight games left on this West Coast trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reed (15-8) could not hold the three-run lead Mike Piazza had
given him with a first-inning home run. Reed would allow two homers
himself, not to mention seven runs in five-plus innings, and would
wind up being outpitched by the 24-year-old right-hander Russ Ortiz
(2-3), who now has two major league victories _ both against the
the Mets in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's home run was his third in the last six days and his
24th of the season. It followed an error by the former Met Jeff
Kent, whose misplay on a hard-hit John Olerud grounder turned a
potential inning-ending double play into a big rally.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Reed has 15 victories this season, he has been
struggling. In his last three starts _ all victories _ Reed had
allowed 13 runs and 26 hits in 20 innings, for an earned run
average of 5.85. More alarming, the veteran right-hander had
surrendered five home runs in those three starts.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was not all that surprising when Barry Bonds _ the first
player in major league history to record 400 homers to go with 400
stolen bases _ launched No. 401 to deep right-center in the bottom
of the first to make the score 3-1. It could have been 3-2 if
Piazza had not thrown out Marvin Benard trying to steal second one
batter earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Giants began to chip away at the Mets lead. Benard
(who had hits in his first three at-bats) doubled home a run in the
third with a little help from Todd Hundley, who bobbled the ball in
left-center field, to make it 3-2. Then Ellis Burks drove home the
tying run in the fourth with a sacrifice fly after back to back
singles from Jeff Kent and Charlie Hayes. And the score was tied,
3-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fifth, the Giants took the lead on a Kent
sacrifice fly, which followed an infield single by Benard that Reed
could not come up with along the first-base line, a hit batsman
(Rich Aurilia) and a Bonds groundout.
</P>
<P>
   On Reed's first pitch in the sixth, Ellis Burks launched his
18th homer of the season _ and just his second with the Giants _
for a 5-3 lead. After allowing back to back singles to the next two
batters, Bill Mueller and Brian Johnson, Reed bounced a throw to
first on an Ortiz sacrifice, Carlos Baerga could not make the pick,
the bases were loaded and Reed was headed for the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was charged with 10 hits and 7 runs in five-plus innings.
He has now allowed seven homers in his last four starts, and has an
era of 7.20 over that span.
</P>
<P>
   Benard greeted the left-hander Dennis Cook with a sacrifice fly
for a 6-3 lead. Then, Cook walked Aurilia to load the bases for
Bonds, who lined a hard single to right on a 1-0 pitch for another
run to make it 7-3. And, even though Cook eventually left the bases
loaded, the Mets were about to squander a solid opportunity in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule does not favor the Mets. They have only 9 of their
30 remaining games at home, compared to 11 of 30 for Chicago and 18
of 30 for San Francisco. Also, the Mets have seven games left with
the first-place Braves, a team they have not beaten this season,
including the final three of the season in Atlanta. The Cubs,
meanwhile, finish the season with three games in Houston, the team
they trail in the N.L. Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will play their final three games on the road, too,
but in Colorado against the struggling Rockies. Meanwhile, the
Giants play only four more games with teams over .500, while the
Mets have 15 and the Cubs just 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City said on
Tuesday night that the Republican Party should not try to
capitalize on the moral implications of President Clinton's
relationship with a White House intern, and he expressed his hope
that the affair would not injure the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks, at a fundraising event sponsored by
Wisconsin's Republican Party, drew applause from just 2 of about
100 people present, and then only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came up after the mayor, who is in the Midwest to
raise his national profile, had finished his familiar account of
the resurrection of New York City under his watch and offered to
answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he thought that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, was right to focus on accusations of
obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think that it's our role to get involved in the
president's private life,'' the mayor said. ``And I think that as a
political party it would be a very big mistake if we emphasized
that.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HE liked winning a division in his first try, but Larry Dierker
didn't especially like how he won it. Last year's Central Division
champion Astros were only 84-78, hardly a record worthy of playoff
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, as old-school as they come when it comes to baseball,
wasn't comfortable backing in with a record that in the old days
could have relegated the Astros to second-division status. Bogus
was bogus, and he knew it, although he was careful not to denigrate
his team's accomplishments publicly.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Astros hadn't won anything in 11 seasons. Bogus
would be better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   These Astros, in contrast, needn't worry about the skipper's
sense of propriety or aesthetics. They are going to repeat as
division champions with a record eminently worthy of such a
distinction. A second victory over the Braves tonight, after
Tuesday's 3-2 beaut, and they will be 84-50, meaning they could
blow 27 of the last 28 and still improve on their finish of a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I sort of like their chances.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, I like their chances of winning 100, something
they have never done before.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop there? There's only one truly magic number left.
From this day forward, the Astros' primary, all-consuming goal
should be to win exactly one more game than the Braves. Just on
principle, to show they can. The home-field advantage in baseball
isn't that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   While this would have been an absurd objective when the season
began, a lot has changed since then. As highly regarded as Moises
Alou was when he arrived, lugging his world-championship ring and
RBI-laden bat, who could have imagined that he would whack 38 home
runs _ before September? As for Randy Johnson's coming, that was
out there somewhere beyond unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his five starts, I'm not sure I fully believe he's
here.
</P>
<P>
   No, opportunities such as the current season presents don't come
along very often. In Houston's case, they apparently come along
once every 37 years. So the moment must be seized, and that means
not only winning the Central, which is already a foregone
conclusion, or chasing down the Padres but catching _ and passing _
Atlanta, too.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they've got four games left against the Braves.
They're four wins behind the Braves. Nothing complicated about the
math, is there? It ain't calculus.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have Atlanta's undivided attention, believe me. The
way the playoffs shake down today, with the Astros having buried
the Cubs over the weekend, thereby giving the Mets a leg up in the
wild-card chase, an Atlanta-Houston rematch in the first round
beckons, and Mister Johnson will have had five days to rest up
before the opener.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. could probably pitch Game 5 as well, if necessary. Don't
think the Braves haven't already begun to contemplate same. And
they don't relish the scenario one bit.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta is always the team to beat, it almost always gets
beat at some point in the playoffs. The ``Team of the Nineties''
has won one World Series. Although this bunch of underachieving
Braves has yet to succumb in the preliminary round, they have also
never faced a team as armed and dangerous as Houston's straight out
of the chute.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect they'll be Cubs fans from here on out. They would
rather let San Diego worry about the Astros first.
</P>
<P>
   While the sweet-strokin' 'Stros weren't trying to send any loud
messages Atlanta's way _ or so they say _ they delivered one
anyway. Mike Hampton, Houston's self-proclaimed Little Unit, has
been the weakest link in the starting rotation of late, but he came
out with a serious mad on for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   If his six-hit, career-high 12-whiff semi-masterpiece _
punctuated neatly by Billy Wagner's three-K ninth for his 25th save
_ is proof positive that Hampy has righted himself, the Astros
appear to have no obvious weakness. They're in good health and a
confident frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   They know they are good. Damn good. It's not speculation,
conjecture or wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing at a level we're capable of,'' Dierker said. ``I
don't think Atlanta is over there worrying too much right now about
losing one game, but I'm sure they realize we've improved a lot
since they knocked us out last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-game, over-almost-before-it-was-over division-series
sweep was indicative of the two teams' relative strengths in 1997.
Those Astros barely belonged on the same field with the Braves.
These Astros? They can beat Atlanta. They might not, but they can.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The reign of ``Czar'' Boris Yeltsin has entered its
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   His television appearance Monday to explain why he had
reappointed a prime minister whom he sacked only five months ago
was not quite as humiliating as a prime-time confession to an
affair with a White House intern. But it was bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of a premier who is widely disliked, and whose name
is associated with fudge, economic decline, and cronyism, is a
personal defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin knows he will be seen as having buckled under the
pressure of a narrow clique of oligarchs who exploited the
privatization of state assets to build vast fortunes _ and
subsequently used them to pressure the Kremlin to defend their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last 48 hours may also mark a larger
watershed in the rule of Boris Yeltsin, a seven year helter-skelter
ride in which he has veered across the political spectrum, from
autocrat to rough-hewn democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The snowy-haired man who in 1991 stood on a tank outside the
White House, flourishing his democratic credentials in the face of
drunken Communist coup plotters, also launched war in Chechnya,
surrounded himself with hard-liners, and used tanks to bombard a
recalcitrant parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted by hard-living, heart trouble and the sheer enormity
of the task of trying to pilot the country through the post-Soviet
chaos, this same contradictory man may now have concluded that it
is time to ease his way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the president is starting to withdraw from
office step by step, handing over power to the heir,'' said his
arch-enemy Mikhail Gorbachev. For once, the former Soviet leader's
views did not sound purely like sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin loves power, and is a master at centralizing it on
the Kremlin. He is also incorrigibly unpredictable, whether it be
his ludicrous exploits _ drunkenly conducting an orchestra in
Berlin, pinching a secretary _ or in politics.
</P>
<P>
   He proved that yet again on Sunday, sacking his government at
the height of a fiscal crisis, adding political chaos and limbo to
the economic maelstrom. What he does today, he can _ and often does
_ undo tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the case of Anatoly Chubais, his financial
troubleshooter whom he has sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the zealous Sergei Kiriyenko was almost certainly
fired because he was construed as a threat to the oligarchs'
empires _ which are rooted in energy, banking and the media.
Several of them feared his government would allow their banks to
collapse, unable to pay vast foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   But, having bankrolled Yeltsin's election campaign in 1996, they
appear to have called in the favor by demanding _ and getting _ a
compliant prime minister. (The country's most prominent oligarch,
Boris Berezovsky, Monday warmly welcomed the appointment of
Chernomyrdin, a development which his own newspaper _ Nezavisimaya
Gazeta _ foresaw with suspicious accuracy last week.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet signs are beginning to surface which suggest Yeltsin may now
have accepted his rule is winding down.
</P>
<P>
   The well-connected Ekho Moskvi radio station quoted sources
saying Chernomyrdin had insisted, as a condition of his return to
office, that he has the right to appoint the head of the ``power
ministries'' _ the Interior Ministry, the Federal Security
Services, and the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands the importance of retaining control over the
security forces better than Yeltsin. If the story is true, then it
amounts to a significant reduction of his sweeping powers.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the nation Monday, the President clearly
anointed Chernomyrdin as his preferred successor in the election of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   His departure cannot come too soon for his growing army of
critics, whose ranks embrace the majority of Russians, almost all
the lower house of parliament, and plenty of enraged international
investors, who view Chernomyrdin's appointment as the kiss of death
to Russia's efforts to make the transition to a healthy market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the evidence that Yeltsin is no longer up to the
job. Although he appeared to recover well from the quintuple
coronary bypass surgery in late 1996, questions have repeatedly
arisen over Yeltsin's mental state.
</P>
<P>
   This is theme which has a bleak familiarity for the Siberian
former construction boss who these days appears far older than his
67 years. He has long been prone to bouts of depression and
withdrawal, and has openly admitted to ``dark thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling kiss'n'tell by his former bodyguard and estranged
friend Alexander Korzhakov claimed that in past years Yeltsin twice
tried to commit suicide by leaping into the Moscow River and
locking himself in a steam baths.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly little doubt that he had a nervous breakdown
when he was banished by Mikhail Gorbachev to the Soviet
construction ministry in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has retained a gift for springing political
surprises, as he demonstrated by his brilliantly judged last-minute
appearance at the reburial of the last czar, Nicholas, in St.
Petersburg last month, the number of embarrassments has grown with
the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Sweden late last year, he appeared unsure of
where he was, and seemed to think Germany and Japan possessed
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he blotted his copybook again by appearing to refer
to the U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan as an ``act of
terrorism.'' (His spokesman hastily offered a watered-down version
of Russia's position).
</P>
<P>
   And only three days before the government announced its decision
to devalue the ruble last Monday, Yeltsin was publicly declaring
that devaluation ``won't happen... It is not a question of what I
think, of my own fantasies, of what I do or do not want to see. It
is all calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   True, this may have been a last-ditch _ and, as it turned out,
vain _ attempt to build confidence in the beleaguered currency; but
it is as likely that he was simply out of touch. After all, he had
been on vacation for five weeks despite a rapidly worsening
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How long he will stay in the Kremlin now depends on several
factors.
</P>
<P>
   He is mindful of his place in history which, while recognizing
his faults, will at least give him credit for holding the first
democratic transfer of power in Russia for 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he will want to be sure that Chernomyrdin (or a
similar ally) stands a strong chance of succeeding him, and will
defend the interests of the ruling elite that has evolved during
the Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   This could conceivably mean striking a deal with the
Communist-nationalist opposition which includes rewriting the
constitution to allow the president to be appointed not by popular
vote, but by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And much rests on the advice of the so-called Kremlin ``Family''
_ dominated by his daughter and image-maker, Tatyana, and his chief
of staff, Valentin Yumashev.
</P>
<P>
   As Russians look on with bewilderment as the Kremlin staggers
from one disaster to another, there are plenty who hope that the
old man's aides will now gently tap him on the shoulder, and point
to the door. &QL;

MISCUES HELP DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in the worst of seasons, the Los Angeles
Dodgers can always count on the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Expos in Montreal, the same team that swept the Dodgers
earlier this month. The Expos who rarely get it right when they
play in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took advantage of several Expos blunders Tuesday
night to open a 12-game homestand with a 4-3 victory in front of
30,183 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young scored the winning run on a wild pitch in the seventh
inning that helped the Dodgers snap a three-game winning streak. It
also raised their record to 113-61 against the Expos at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers even picked up a game on the New York Mets in the
wild card, drawing within seven games with 29 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki (7-6) pitched 62/3 innings to move his record over
.500 for the first time this season. Former Dodger Wilton Guerrero
probably had the worst 4-for-5 game ever.
</P>
<P>
   For Guerrero, acquired by the Expos July 31 in the trade that
also sent three minor-league prospects to Montreal for left-hander
Carlos Perez and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, the game started
badly. All could have been forgotten when Guerrero doubled off the
glove of left-fielder Trenidad Hubbard with one out in the ninth
off reliever Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw, who allowed two ninth-inning homers in Atlanta the day
before, retired the final two batters to get his 38th save and 15th
as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's brother Vladimir hit his 32nd home run off Mlicki in
the fourth. And Grudzielanek made two errors at short after making
just two in his first 22 games with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero opened the first inning with a single but immediately
got doubled off first on F.P. Santangelo. In the third, he stole
second, but when Charles Johnson's throw sailed into center, Raul
Mondesi already had the ball when Guerrero took off for third. He
was thrown out easily.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, with Hubbard at first, Mondesi flied to
left. Hubbard tagged and raced to second. F.P. Santangelo's throw
had Hubbard beaten, but Guerrero failed to apply the tag in time.
</P>
<P>
   And with two outs in the same inning, Guerrero failed to catch
Johnson's pop-up to shallow right field that enabled the Dodgers'
third run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was no longer one of their own, Dodgers fans cheered
Guerrero all night.
</P>
<P>
   But they found a target in Bobby Bonilla, who should have scored
from second on the pop-up. He was booed the rest of the night,
except for when he was lifted for pinch-runner Roger Cedeno after
walking with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were coming off a 2-5 road trip to Pittsburgh,
Florida and Atlanta and needed this kind of help.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's baseball instincts were criticized during his time
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal manager Felipe Alou was far more interested in getting
the prospects acquiring Guerrero. He entered the game with a .239
average in 22 games since joining the Expos. He went 3 for 4. He
had an RBI single in the seventh that cut the Dodgers lead to 4-2.
Mlicki walked the next batter Santangelo and Scott Radinsky entered
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Shane Bennett popped to short to end the inning.

the lower house of parliament, and plenty of enraged international
investors, who view Chernomyrdin's appointment as the kiss of death
to Russia's efforts to make the transition to a healthy market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the evidence that Yeltsin is no longer up to the
job. Although he appeared to recover well from the quintuple
coronary bypass surgery in late 1996, questions have repeatedly
arisen over Yeltsin's mental state.
</P>
<P>
   This is theme which has a bleak familiarity for the Siberian
former construction boss who these days appears far older than his
67 years. He has long been prone to bouts of depression and
withdrawal, and has openly admitted to ``dark thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling kiss'n'tell by his former bodyguard and estranged
friend Alexander Korzhakov claimed that in past years Yeltsin twice
tried to commit suicide by leaping into the Moscow River and
locking himself in a steam baths.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly little doubt that he had a nervous breakdown
when he was banished by Mikhail Gorbachev to the Soviet
construction ministry in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has retained a gift for springing political
surprises, as he demonstrated by his brilliantly judged last-minute
appearance at the reburial of the last czar, Nicholas, in St.
Petersburg last month, the number of embarrassments has grown with
the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Sweden late last year, he appeared unsure of
where he was, and seemed to think Germany and Japan possessed
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he blotted his copybook again by appearing to refer
to the U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan as an ``act of
terrorism.'' (His spokesman hastily offered a watered-down version
of Russia's position).
</P>
<P>
   And only three days before the government announced its decision
to devalue the ruble last Monday, Yeltsin was publicly declaring
that devaluation ``won't happen... It is not a question of what I
think, of my own fantasies, of what I do or do not want to see. It
is all calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   True, this may have been a last-ditch _ and, as it turned out,
vain _ attempt to build confidence in the beleaguered currency; but
it is as likely that he was simply out of touch. After all, he had
been on vacation for five weeks despite a rapidly worsening
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How long he will stay in the Kremlin now depends on several
factors.
</P>
<P>
   He is mindful of his place in history which, while recognizing
his faults, will at least give him credit for holding the first
democratic transfer of power in Russia for 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he will want to be sure that Chernomyrdin (or a
similar ally) stands a strong chance of succeeding him, and will
defend the interests of the ruling elite that has evolved during
the Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   This could conceivably mean striking a deal with the
Communist-nationalist opposition which includes rewriting the
constitution to allow the president to be appointed not by popular
vote, but by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And much rests on the advice of the so-called Kremlin ``Family''
_ dominated by his daughter and image-maker, Tatyana, and his chief
of staff, Valentin Yumashev.
</P>
<P>
   As Russians look on with bewilderment as the Kremlin staggers
from one disaster to another, there are plenty who hope that the
old man's aides will now gently tap him on the shoulder, and point
to the door. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
WITH BISHOP, LOSING PASSE FOR KANSAS STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A native Texan and infrequent follower of college football
during his formative years, Michael Bishop knew nothing of Kansas
State's dismal success rate preceding coach Bill Snyder's arrival
in Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   He had no clue that, in Snyder's initial season, a 20-17 victory
against North Texas triggered a toppling of goal posts at KSU
Stadium because it ended a 30-game winless streak. It also marked
the Wildcats' lone victory of 1989, a season that ended with Kansas
State sporting the lowest winning percentage in the history of
Division I-A football (.380), with a career record of 299-501-39.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bishop finished leading Blinn College to its second
consecutive junior college national championship in 1996, however,
such numbers seemed moot. Snyder provided his future quarterback
all the history lesson he would need by pointing to the Wildcats'
projected vacancy at the position, as well as a rapidly expanding
trophy case to house mementos from recent bowl excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew for the past couple of years, they'd had nine-win
seasons,'' Bishop said, reflecting on his initial reaction to being
courted by Kansas State. ``I knew coach Snyder would give me a
chance to play right away. Other than that, I didn't know all that
much. I just knew that, if I joined a competitive team, we'd have a
chance to win 10 or more games if we took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop and the Wildcats did that in 1997, setting a school
record for victories during an 11-1 season. Now, the Willis High
School graduate is considered the focal point of a Kansas State
team that returns 18 starters and is considered a contender for its
first national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a pretty special season for us. The anticipation
hasn't always been there,'' said linebacker Travis Ochs, a
fifth-year senior. ``But everyone is excited knowing what this team
is capable of. And Michael Bishop is a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bishop's arrival, Snyder has tweaked his pro-style offense
to add more rollout passes and option plays. Receivers run deeper
routes in dropback situations, taking advantage of Bishop's arm
strength (19.5 yards per completion last season) and opening the
field for potential scrambles by the school's single-season record
holder for rushing yards (566) and rushing touchdowns (9) by a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   More important, in Snyder's estimation, is his quarterback's
mental make-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Bishop is extremely competitive in everything he
does,'' Snyder said. ``He wants to be the best player that he can
conceivably be, and that attitude rubs off on the team. Plus, he
can run and throw with the best of them. Those are the things I
love about Michael Bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop capped his first season in Division I-A by throwing for
317 yards and four touchdowns, as well as rushing for 73 yards, in
a 35-18 victory against Syracuse in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. The
performance earned him offensive player of the game honors and
improved his record to 35-1 as a college quarterback (24-0 at
Blinn, 11-1 at Kansas State).
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, however, views it as a tease for what is about to happen
now that he has a better grasp of the Wildcats' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a whole lot better than I was last year,'' Bishop
said. ``A year ago at this time, I was just playing on enthusiasm.
I hadn't learned the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've been through spring (drills), I feel like I know
everything that I need to know to go out and lead my team. I feel I
have a great amount of talent and can make some key plays to take
my team to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's rapid emergence netted second-team all-conference
honors in 1997. It also earned him favorable comparisons to
Missouri quarterback Corby Jones, who rushed for 887 yards and
threw for 1,658 while being chosen by coaches as the league's top
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Both players return this season. Both are seniors. Who is
better?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask me that,'' said Bishop, who ran for a
season-high 196 yards during last year's 41-11 rout of Missouri.
``I'd say we're equal until the Saturday we play each other (Nov.
21). Then we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri coach Larry Smith hedged, saying both players can
dominate a game with their arms, legs or leadership abilities. He
termed a comparison between Bishop and Jones ``about as close a
parallel as you can run between two players.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed, but pointed to advantages on both sides of the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the Division I game longer than Bishop. I've
captured the speed of the game better,'' Jones said. ``But he's
definitely got the edge in arm strength. He told me he can throw
the ball 93 yards in the air, and I'm lucky if I can get to 75. I
don't know how to compare and contrast us beyond that. I just know
he's fun to watch when he's not playing us.''

 By PHIL REEVES  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The chief mastermind of the firing of the Russian
government, heralding the beginning of the end for Boris Yeltsin,
has emerged as a 51-year-old tycoon, who made his fortune as a car
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the country's most prominent oligarch, is the
principle broker in a deal which restored the sacked Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister and established himself as the power
behind the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Moscow say the billionaire businessman recently
secretly met the premier and a senior Kremlin official _ deputy
chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasalov _ in the French resort of
Cannes, thousands of miles from the economic maelstrom which was
engulfing Russia, shaking the empires of its new oligarchs to their
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting proposal to replace the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko, after only four months in office, was relayed to Boris
Yeltsin by his younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and chief of
staff, Valentin Yumashev, both friends of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The key question now taxing the minds of Russia's political
supporters and creditors in the West is the nature of the influence
that Berezovsky, and a coterie of other tycoons, will undoubtedly
wield in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernomyrdin's past record suggests he broadly favors
market economics, he is also a former chief executive of the gas
giant Gazprom, and tends to protect the interests of his chums in
business and the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
   It says much about the entwined nature of power and cronyism in
Russia that Gazprom shares rocketed by 20 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The signs so far are ominous. Chernomyrdin has told a newspaper
he wants to concentrate on ``industrial policy, since purely
monetary measures have not pulled Russia out of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been carefully courting the major parliamentary
groups (who have yet to confirm him in post) and has talked about
creating a ``broad-based government of accord,'' raising the
possibility of a coalition government, including the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   To the ears of advocates of market reforms, such words are
anathema, and spell a rise in government interventionism and
spending. One of their camp, Anders Asland, a former adviser to
Russia, has described Chernomyrdin's return as ``a total
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, tasks regarded as crucial by the IMF _ like raising
Russia's lamentable tax revenues and cutting the state's huge
subsidies to energy and housing _ can be expected to lose what
little momentum they have.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be one of the reasons why Berezovksky has anointed
Chernomyrdin both as the premier and, it is safe to assume, the man
whom he sees as heir to Boris Yelstin's throne.
</P>
<P>
   Czar-making is a role which he has long cultivated. In 1996,
fearful of a Communist victory, he and six other magnates paid $3
million towards the Yeltsin reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was rewarded with a government job _ deputy secretary of the
Security Council, from which he was later removed. But he fought
his way back.
</P>
<P>
   His success was acknowledged, bitterly, by Russki Telegraf, a
hostile newspaper. ``Berezovsky Is Now Our President,'' said the
headline.
</P>
<P>
   His rise owes much to ruthlessness, wheeler-dealing skills, and
opportunism honed in the lethal new world of Russian business.
</P>
<P>
   A former math professor, he was shrewd enough to seize the
moneymaking chances that arose in the lawless aftermath of Soviet
collapse, parleying a car dealership into an empire which include
oil, industrial and property interests.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, he was deeply enough immersed in the business world to
become the target of an assassination attempt; a car bomb blew off
the head of his driver.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred (and protected by a 150-strong security contigent,
many ex-KGB), he rose steadily upwards, becoming the most prominent
member of a group of oligarchs who have long sought to control the
Kremlin from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how wealthy he is (his own assessment, last
year, of $23,000 was greeted with mirth in Russia), but he has all
the ``new Russian'' accoutrements: apartments abroad, at least
three properties in Russia, Cambridge-educated children.
</P>
<P>
   He has had occasional spats with the authorities _ rows, for
instance, with the government's so-called ``young reformers,''
Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, over the spoils of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, over the sell-off of the state telecommunications
giant Svyazinvest, became so serious that Boris Yeltsin personally
had to intervene. But the tycoon assiduously mended his fences.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Berezovsky, a small, balding man with a penchant for
check jackets, is calling the shots in Russia. The clues were
there, before the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Like any player with serious ambitions to wield power in Russia,
Berezovsky has sizeable media holdings, which he brazenly uses to
his ends. This includes a controlling stake in the national TV
network ORT, and proprietorship of the newspaper Nezavisimaya
Gazeta (The Independent _ no relation).
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the newspaper all but predicted Chernomyrdin's return
to the top. It was not a coincidence. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The chief mastermind of the firing of the Russian
government, heralding the beginning of the end for Boris Yeltsin,
has emerged as a 51-year-old tycoon who made his fortune as a car
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the country's most prominent oligarch, is the
principle broker in a deal which restored the sacked Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister and established himself as the power
behind the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Moscow say the billionaire businessman recently
secretly met the premier and a senior Kremlin official _ deputy
chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasalov _ in the French resort of
Cannes, thousands of miles from the economic maelstrom which was
engulfing Russia, shaking the empires of its new oligarchs to their
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting proposal to replace the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko, after only four months in office, was relayed to Boris
Yeltsin by his younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and chief of
staff, Valentin Yumashev, both friends of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The key question now taxing the minds of Russia's political
supporters and creditors in the West is the nature of the influence
that Berezovsky, and a coterie of other tycoons, will undoubtedly
wield in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernomyrdin's past record suggests he broadly favors
market economics, he is also a former chief executive of the gas
giant Gazprom, and tends to protect the interests of his chums in
business and the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
   It says much about the entwined nature of power and cronyism in
Russia that Gazprom shares rocketed by 20 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The signs so far are ominous. Chernomyrdin has told a newspaper
he wants to concentrate on ``industrial policy, since purely
monetary measures have not pulled Russia out of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been carefully courting the major parliamentary
groups (who have yet to confirm him in post) and has talked about
creating a ``broad-based government of accord,'' raising the
possibility of a coalition government, including the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   To the ears of advocates of market reforms, such words are
anathema, and spell a rise in government interventionism and
spending. One of their camp, Anders Asland, a former adviser to
Russia, has described Chernomyrdin's return as ``a total
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, tasks regarded as crucial by the IMF _ like raising
Russia's lamentable tax revenues and cutting the state's huge
subsidies to energy and housing _ can be expected to lose what
little momentum they have.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be one of the reasons why Berezovksky has anointed
Chernomyrdin both as the premier and, it is safe to assume, the man
whom he sees as heir to Boris Yelstin's throne.
</P>
<P>
   Czar-making is a role which he has long cultivated. In 1996,
fearful of a Communist victory, he and six other magnates paid $3
million towards the Yeltsin reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was rewarded with a government job _ deputy secretary of the
Security Council, from which he was later removed. But he fought
his way back.
</P>
<P>
   His success was acknowledged, bitterly, by Russki Telegraf, a
hostile newspaper. ``Berezovsky Is Now Our President,'' said the
headline.
</P>
<P>
   His rise owes much to ruthlessness, wheeler-dealing skills, and
opportunism honed in the lethal new world of Russian business.
</P>
<P>
   A former math professor, he was shrewd enough to seize the
moneymaking chances that arose in the lawless aftermath of Soviet
collapse, parleying a car dealership into an empire which include
oil, industrial and property interests.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, he was deeply enough immersed in the business world to
become the target of an assassination attempt; a car bomb blew off
the head of his driver.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred (and protected by a 150-strong security contigent,
many ex-KGB), he rose steadily upwards, becoming the most prominent
member of a group of oligarchs who have long sought to control the
Kremlin from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how wealthy he is (his own assessment, last
year, of $23,000 was greeted with mirth in Russia), but he has all
the ``new Russian'' accoutrements: apartments abroad, at least
three properties in Russia, Cambridge-educated children.
</P>
<P>
   He has had occasional spats with the authorities _ rows, for
instance, with the government's so-called ``young reformers,''
Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, over the spoils of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, over the sell-off of the state telecommunications
giant Svyazinvest, became so serious that Boris Yeltsin personally
had to intervene. But the tycoon assiduously mended his fences.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Berezovsky, a small, balding man with a penchant for
check jackets, is calling the shots in Russia. The clues were
there, before the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Like any player with serious ambitions to wield power in Russia,
Berezovsky has sizeable media holdings, which he brazenly uses to
his ends. This includes a controlling stake in the national TV
network ORT, and proprietorship of the newspaper Nezavisimaya
Gazeta (The Independent _ no relation).
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the newspaper all but predicted Chernomyrdin's return
to the top. It was not a coincidence. &QL;

 STEPANOVA'S LIFT OFF BENCH HELPS CLINCH BERTH IN FINALS

   CLEVELAND _ The ruble might be rubble elsewhere, but in Phoenix
today, anything Russian is highly prized.
</P>
<P>
   Because a little-used Russian teenager came up as big as her
6-foot-8 future suggests and because Bridget Pettis gave Jennifer
Gillom a night off, the Mercury (21-12) ravaged the Cleveland
Rockers with a 25-4 second-half start Tuesday in advancing to the
WNBA championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Houston Comets (29-3) come to the scene
of one of their rare regular season losses, America West Arena, for
the opener at 5 p.m. Thursday. Games 2 is on Saturday in Houston
and Game 3, if necessary, is on Tuesday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked our chances physically in a back-to-back
because we have so many big bodies,'' said Mercury Coach Cheryl
Miller, who on a hunch selected the biggest, Stepanova, to replace
Michelle Griffiths when she signaled for a breather a little more
than four minutes after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old, a spectator in Games 1 and 2 of the series,
responded with six points, two rebounds, a block, a steal and an
assist before returning to the bench for good with six fouls in
nine minutes. By then, the job was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting, always waiting,'' Stepanova, who had not played
since Aug. 14, said through her interpreter, Irina Viktorova. ``I
accumulated the anger and the enthusiasm, the energy. I was more
than ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Within its 25-4 run, the Mercury scored 19 consecutive points in
transforming a 35-32 halftime deficit into a 57-39 lead with 10:15
remaining. Stepanova fouled out with the lead still at 11, and the
Eastern Conference champion Rockers (21-12) could get no closer
than seven before falling 71-60, its fifth loss in six tries vs.
Phoenix this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most effective nine minutes that I've seen,'' said
Miller, who has lost sleep recently trying to figure how to get the
raw but conscientious rookie into a game. ``Rebounding, scoring,
putting the pressure on. Maria's presence really allowed us to
relax offensively because all of a sudden, Cleveland is looking at
the 6-8 kid and she's mobile and she's moving around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlies (Askamp, 6-5 backup center) has been playing well for
us, but the last couple of days, Maria's practice regimen has been
so good, I just couldn't waste it. To see that big grin on her
face, she was the absolute difference, her and Bridget Pettis.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Stepanova in the short term, Pettis was from the
opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-9 shooting guard, who emerged from a midseason patch of 11
games in which she averaged only 6.5 points to score at 15.1 clip
in the regular season stretch, dropped a career-high-tying 27 on
Cleveland. She added a career-high 11 rebounds for her first WNBA
double-double, not to mention five assists, two steals and a block.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Pettis throttled Michelle Edwards, whose 18 points
Monday were critical to a 67-66 Cleveland win. Edwards scored only
five, and 6-5 center Isabelle Fijalkowski (17) was the only Rocker
to reach double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backcourt needed to step up,'' Pettis said. ``Edwards did
a great job (Monday), and all I was thinking was contain them
defensively first, and then if I find my shot, knock it down. I
guess I was in a zone. Even the trainer said, `You look like kind
of dazed,' so I must have been zoning.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pettis, Stepanova and Griffiths (14 points, 9 rebounds)
silencing Gund Arena, the crowd of 8,420 forgot about its worst
nightmare before Tuesday. Jennifer Gillom, who averaged 28.2 points
in the first five games vs. the Rockers, was relatively quiet (11
points, 7 rebounds), usually the first clue to a Mercury loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really so proud of Bridget,'' Gillom said. ``I was
double-teamed, triple-teamed, and she came out and did her job. And
what a great job she's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at halftime, the Mercury had positive signs, especially its
17-14 lead on the boards that stretched to 38-29 by game's end.
Phoenix was outrebounded in the first two games of the series and
was embarrassed, 16-7, on the offensive boards in the first half
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury beat the Comets, 69-66, on June 24, then Houston
rebounded with three-, 10- and 11-point wins en route to taking the
Western Conference title away from the Mercury. The teams last met
Aug. 6, and Phoenix is 8-2 since then in clinching a playoff berth
on the final day of the regular season and advancing to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, we were content to sit up there when the lights
go out and the popping and the bells and the whistles and the
fireworks,'' Miller said. ``We were just happy to be there. This
season, we wanted to be in the finals. We didn't want to just be 11
players that were overachievers. We wanted people to recognize
we're a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   With a secret Russian weapon. &QL;

<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates were thoughtful enough to give
Diamondbacks pitcher and former teammate Clint Sodowsky a couple of
team jerseys before Tuesday night's game at Bank One Ballpark. The
kindness ended there.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates knocked Sodowsky out of the game in the fifth inning
and went on to beat the Diamondbacks, 9-6, before a season-low
crowd of 38,960.
</P>
<P>
   With a bunch of young and/or inexperienced players not generally
known outside of Pittsburgh (nor within the much of the city's
environs, for that matter), the Pirates aren't exactly a hot
ticket. But they are a team with promise. They also are the hottest
team in the majors after winning their eighth straight.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of rookies led Pittsburgh. Third baseman Freddy Garcia's
three-run homer in the seventh off Aaron Small broke open the game
after the Diamondbacks made it close. And Sean Lawrence, a
27-year-old left-hander making his major-league debut, got the
victory. Lawrence worked five innings, giving up two runs and four
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Sodowsky, who was 2-2 in 45 games with the Pirates last year
before the Diamondbacks took him in the second round of the
expansion draft, encountered his defining moment in the top of the
fifth with the score tied at 2, two outs, runners on second and
third and Jason Kendall at the plate. Kendall began the evening
fourth in the National League in hitting, at .336. But Sodowsky
took the initiative, working the count to 1-2. Then Kendall, the
Pirates' lone representative on the NL All-Star team, lined a
single to left to score Lou Collier and Tony Womack for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a promising evening for Sodowsky deteriorated
further. Kendall stole his 18th base and Kevin Young reached first
on a single that would have scored Kendall had third baseman Matt
Williams not made a terrific play to keep the ball from reaching
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Sodowsky, who gave up just a walk in the first
three innings and tied his career high for strikeouts, six, which
he set last year with the Pirates. Ben Ford came in with runners on
first and third and got out of the jam by retiring Jose Guillen on
a soft liner to second baseman Tony Batista.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks opened the scoring in the first on Bernard
Gilkey's lead-off single, a single by Jay Bell and Devon White's
sacrifice fly. They made it 2-0 in the second when Damian Miller
hit his third homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh tied the score in the fourth when Adrian Brown led
off with a triple and scored on Kendall's double. One out later,
Guillen's single sent Kendall home.
</P>
<P>
   After Kendall broke the tie in the fifth, the Pirates went up,
6-2, in the sixth against reliever Chris Michalak on pinch-hitter
Manny Martinez's run-scoring force out and Tony Womack's single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had been sent up to bat for Lawrence, and the
Diamondbacks immediately took advantage of the rookie's absence,
scoring three runs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   White led off with his 19th homer, off reliever Jeff McCurry.
Williams struck out, Lee singled, and after Batista flied out,
Miller blooped a double that scored Lee. Yamil Benitez walked, and
pinch-hitter David Dellucci singled to make it 6-5. But the rally
ended when Gilkey hit into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia then settled things in the seventh with his sixth homer
of the year, his fourth since being recalled from Triple-A
Nashville on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's sacrifice fly in the eighth provided the Diamondbacks
their final run. &QL;

<P>
   One summer night in 1992, I interviewed Sudan's President Omar
el-Bashir in the mud fortress in Khartoum that passes for a
``presidential palace.'' It was guarded by dozens of Islamic
boy-soldiers with automatic weapons and faulty walkie-talkies. One
was so defective that it almost got my Sudanese escort and I shot
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When their officer couldn't raise the security staff inside, two
soldiers suddenly dropped to their knees in the glare of our
headlamps. I stared through the windscreen for minutes at their
knuckles on the triggers, until my Sudanese friend persuaded them
to borrow his own mobile phone. Finally, we were waved through the
gate into a dark medieval casbah.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after the cruise missiles hit Khartoum, Sandy
Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, said that the
destroyed factory was part of Sudan's military-industrial complex.
That's an audacious piece of spin.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week in the heart of Sudan's ``military-industrial
complex,'' with its malarial mosquitoes, streets covered in sand
and relics of Britain's colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is the largest country in Africa and one of the poorest,
paralyzed by years of civil war and corruption. When Brigadier
el-Bashir staged his military coup in 1989, the country was in
total chaos and the central bank had just $25,000 in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   I met President el-Bashir in a lounge full of old sofas where he
sat surrounded by half a dozen men. The president is a tall,
fiercely dignified man. He was dressed, like all his aides, in the
flowing white desert robes and turbans that the stylish hog farmers
of Arkansas disdain.
</P>
<P>
   In short, el-Bashir and his men were all ``towel heads.'' One, a
ferocious-looking young Nubian, told me that he'd recently
graduated from Harvard. Considering how he was dressed, I figured
he must be a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is one of the few modern republics where the legal and
economic system is based on Islamic sharia law. Knowing this, you'd
imagine that its president is a dangerous lunatic, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize that terrorism is something
completely alien to Islam,'' President el-Bashir told me, in a deep
rolling voice. ``Islam does not condone it, does not approve of it.
Human life is sacred to Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Did this fundamentalist leader of Sudan's
``military-industrial'' complex really expect me to believe him?
</P>
<P>
   A year after my visit to Khartoum, the State Department put
Sudan on its list of nations who support international terrorism.
The justification? ``There is no evidence that the Government of
Sudan conducted or sponsored a specific terrorist attack in the
past year, and the Government denies supporting any form of
terrorism activity,'' said the State Department report at the time.
Confused? Not me, I was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   But former president Jimmy Carter was not. He criticized the
listing of Sudan at the time, saying there was no evidence to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is too much of an inclination in this country to
look on Muslims as inherently terrorist or inherently against the
West,'' Carter said in this newspaper in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that Sudan showed ``a disturbing
pattern of relationships with international terrorist groups.''
That means, as one Hamas official said in 1995, that Sudan is where
you come when you've got nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, Sudan naively allowed any Arabs to enter without a
visa, seeing itself as an oasis of pure Islamic faith, unlike
neighbor Saudi Arabia, which they regarded as too close to the
non-Muslim Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   President el-Bashir ended Sudan's non-visa entry policy in May
1996. At the same time, notorious Saudi terrorist Osama bin-Laden
was booted out of Sudan. (That didn't fool me.)
</P>
<P>
   His expulsion came a year after the Sudanese government had
arrested and extradited Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as the
terrorist ``Carlos the Jackal,'' to France. (I wasn't impressed by
that either.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a man from the U.S. State Department,'' el-Bashir
told me. ``I said if you know of any terrorist training camps, then
bring your elite forces and we'll bring our special forces and
we'll go together to eliminate these camps, if they really exist.''
You'd expect a towel-head to say something like that.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in Sunday's Observer, U.S. intelligence
told the President Clinton that there were no traces of nerve gas
production in the factory his missiles were going to hit. He fired
them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger explained that Clinton acted in order to enhance
``the psychological dimension of power'' against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Bill Clinton is a good and courageous leader, not a
liar and a bully. I mean, look at what nice ties he wears. &QL;

   Heisman Trophy campaigns are mapped out during the summer. A
school publicist interviews the team's star athlete. His job is to
profile the young man's life.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting he is, the more hardships he has endured,
the better his story.

   ``Where are they now. Prison?''

   As a small child, ASU's J.R. Redmond wore shoes with steel

an elementary school teacher. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Take a picture &QL;

West Virginia has a Heisman Trophy candidate. ``Famous'' Amos
Zereoue came from the Ivory Coast to America with his father, a

   Wisconsin tank Ron Dayne is another Heisman hopeful. He is one
of 12 children.
</P>
<P>
   But the best story has to be that of Daunte Culpepper. Daunte
was born in a Florida prison. He was conceived during a visit by
the mother's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The mother begged a prison employee, Emma Culpepper, to care for
the child.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ms. Culpepper was 62 years old. She already had
raised 14 kids: her brother's four children, seven by her
sister-in-law and three others she adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The boy grew to become a multisport star in high school. The New
York Yankees drafted him as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Daunte Culpepper, 6 feet 4, 235 pounds, is the star
quarterback for the Central Florida Golden Knights. A future
first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   A student on the dean's list, he is on schedule to earn his
college degree and fulfill the promise he made to an 83-year-old
woman to whom he owes everything. &QL;

WADSWORTH HOLDOUT FAMILIAR TO CARDINALS' DEFENSIVE PAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Holdout'' is now in its 36th day, and even if Andre
Wadsworth is signed tonight _ which, of course, he won't be _ it's
becoming less and less likely he can be an effective force in the
Cardinals season opener at Dallas in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective on the Wadsworth predicament, the Cardinals have
two experts in outside linebacker Jamir Miller and defensive end
Simeon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice shares much in common with Wadsworth. Not only do they
employ the same agents, Eugene Parker and Roosevelt Barnes, but
Tuesday was the anniversary of the day on which Rice's celebrated
rookie holdout ended two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, too, was a late arrival who didn't come to terms with
the team until two days before the second preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the opportunity to learn the defense, and if
you don't know the defense, then you can't really be a factor,''
Miller said. ``It really depends on how fast a learner he is. We
don't run a very difficult scheme, but it still will set him back
quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Rice was in a more difficult position than
Wadsworth is now. The team was against the wall with the salary
cap, and to sign Rice it had to waive Garrison Hearst, who was
extremely popular among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Andre, it won't be hard for him,'' Rice said. ``But in
terms of football shape, you have to get used to contact and
running off contact. It's a different type of shape. You've got to
be able to go full speed and give a hit that takes a lot out of you
_ that sort of oomph with your body _ and still come back and play
hard and do it for four quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feat. I'm not going to lie, but you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Each also knows the anxiety that Wadsworth is undergoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what he's going through,'' Miller said.
``This is a business, which is something people often lose sight
of. But to be honest, I'm tired of hearing about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of sight, out of mind. He can't do anything to help me get
through the day, and he can't help me get through tomorrow. Until
he's here and is my teammate, I don't want to hear about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it is a product of his relationship with the
agents, Rice has a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get it over with. You can't wait,'' he said.
``There's a lot of anticipation. But you also have to allow the
people you hired to represent you to do it right. Make sure
everything goes right for you and the Cardinals. There has to be
common ground so everything is behind you when you come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired Eugene and Roosevelt for their integrity and
competency. One thing about Eugene is he looks out for his clients
and takes care of them. He's a good buffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the longer Wadsworth sits, impatience grows among coaches
and teammates, who have undergone two-a-days and practices in
Valley heat. Rice, even in the face of Hearst's departure, was
fortunate to be accepted as soon as he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two sacks and made some plays in my first preseason
game, which shocked some people,'' he said. ``In the first regular
season game, I tackled (the Colts') Marshall Faulk in the backfield
on the first play and did some things to pressure Jim Harbaugh. It
got some to open their eyes and say, `This kid can play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre will have to be in shape and come in with a reason and a
goal on his mind.'' &QL;

HEX BITES EXPOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in the worst of seasons, the Los Angeles
Dodgers can always count on the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Expos in Montreal, the same team that swept the Dodgers
earlier this month. The Expos who rarely get it right when they
play in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took advantage of several Expos blunders Tuesday
night to open a 12-game homestand with a 4-3 victory in front of
30,183 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that happened to us in the past is over,'' Dodgers manager
Glenn Hoffman said. ``We're home for 20 of the last 30 games. WE
still have a chance.'' Eric Young scored the winning run on a wild
pitch in the seventh inning that helped the Dodgers snap a losing
streak at three games. It also raised their record to 113-61
against the Expos at Dodger Stadium. And Dave Mlicki (7-6) pitched
62/3 innings to move his record over .500 for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect when you have a bunch of kids playing one
of the richest teams in baseball,'' said Expos manager Felipe Alou,
whose team has a $9 million payroll compared to the Dodgers $61
million. ``We play hard; that's all I ask....''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers even picked up a game on the New York Mets in the
wild card, drawing within seven games with 29 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodger Wilton Guerrero probably had the worst 4-for-5
game ever.
</P>
<P>
   For Guerrero, acquired by the Expos July 31 in the trade that
also sent three minor-league prospects to Montreal for left-hander
Carlos Perez and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, the game started
badly.
</P>
<P>
   All could have been forgotten when Guerrero doubled off the
glove of left-fielder Trenidad Hubbard with one out in the ninth
off releiver Jeff Shaw. But Shaw, who allowed two ninth-inning
homers in Atlanta the day before, retired the final two batters to
earn his 38th save and 15th as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's brother Vladimir hit his 32nd home run off Mlicki in
the fourth. And Grudzielanek made two errors at short after making
just two in his first 22 games with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilton is doing okay,'' Alou said. ``If he was polished as a
second baseman or as a basestealer, he wouldn't be here. He's not
Craig Biggio. Guys like that cost $8-10 million a year. Guys like
that don't play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero opened the first inning with a single but immediately
got doubled off first on F.P. Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, he stole second but when Charles Johnson's throw
sailed into center, Raul Mondesi already had the ball when Guerrero
took off for third. He was thrown out easily.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning with Hubbard at first, Mondesi flied to
left. Hubbard tagged and raced to second. F.P. Santangelo's throw
had Hubbard beat, but Guerrero failed to apply the tag in time. And
with two outs in the same inning, Guerrero failed to catch
Johnson's pop up to shallow right field that enabled the Dodgers
third run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was no longer one of their own, Dodger fans cheered
Guerrero all night.
</P>
<P>
   But they found a target in Bobby Bonilla, who should have to
scored from second on the pop up. He was booed the rest of the
night, except for when he was lifted for pinch runner Roger Cedeno
after walking with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me afterward and apologized,'' Hoffman said of
Bonilla. ``He just lost track of the outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were coming off a 2-5 road trip to Pittsburgh,
Florida and Atlanta and needed this kind of help.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's baseball instincts were criticized during his time
with the Dodgers. He entered the game with a .239 average in 22
games since joining the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   He went 3 for 4 with an RBI single in the seventh that cut the
Dodgers lead to 4-2. Mlicki walked the next batter Santangelo and
Scott Radinsky entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Shane Bennett popped to short to end the inning.

OLSON'S WIFE BEING TREATED FOR CANCER  
 PROGNOSIS GOOD; COACH WON'T QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona basketball Coach Lute Olson on Tuesday confirmed that
his wife, Bobbi, is being treated for ovarian cancer but denied
rumors that he plans to step down as coach of the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many rumors flying around,'' said Olson, the UA
coach since 1983. ``There is so much stuff out there. But Bobbi is
doing fine. She has regained about 18 of the 25 pounds that she
lost. She still has her good days and her bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was made in Tucson in June, shortly after the
Olsons returned abruptly from Hungary, where Olson was conducting a
coaching clinic. Bobbi Olson underwent emergency surgery in Hungary
and then was referred to the Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson upon
their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery in Hungary was related to this,'' said Dr. David
S. Alberts, an oncologist at the Arizona Cancer Center who is
treating her. ``They saw a pelvic mass, but they did not make the
diagnosis there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberts said Bobbi Olson, 63, has Stage 3 cancer in the pelvis
and upper abdomen and that her prognosis ``is outstanding,'' based
on initial response to treatment indicated by CA-125 blood
readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most accurate prognostic factor,'' Alberts said.
``After four courses of chemotherapy, we have normalized all
markers of ovarian cancer. She has normalized CA-125, which is as
low as we see in normal women. These results are correlated with
very, very long survival, well in advance of five years. In fact,
these results are correlated highly with long-term cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lute Olson, who will be 64 next month, did not attend the annual
summer circuit of basketball camps for the first time in his
head-coaching career. Instead, the Wildcats received an NCAA
exemption that allowed Olson to turn over off-season, off-campus
recruiting duties to associate head coach Jim Rosborough, while
Olson stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I plan to retire? No. Am I planning to leave the program?
No,'' said Olson, who guided Arizona to the national championship
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi Olson has been almost as much a part of the Wildcats as
Olson himself, the matriarch of the winningest program in NCAA
Division I over the past decade, characterized by her outgoing
personality and warmth. She accompanies her husband worldwide to
every game or coaching clinic. The Olsons have been married for 45
years and have five children.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday by Olson, he said he wanted to
end the rumors and confirm that his wife has been treated for
ovarian cancer at the Arizona Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our desire for privacy, we hesitated making her
condition public until we as a family understood the implications
of this disease and what we are facing,'' Olson said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobbi and I want to assure everyone that she is doing great,
and we have every reason to believe that her prognosis is
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are dealing with a serious diagnosis, the good news
is that Bobbi's disease is very treatable, and her response to only
four courses of chemotherapy has demonstrated remarkable results.
Our medical team has developed a course of treatment for her over
several months that includes both chemotherapy and routine surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very grateful for the thoughtfulness and concern that
everyone has expressed over the summer. We also appreciate the
respect for our privacy and hope this will continue as we move
forward with further treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberts said the treatment will include another surgery next
month and additional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ovarian cancer is curable today, even in advanced stages,''
Alberts said. ``Bobbi is in outstanding health. She has regained
normal weight and normal physical activity. She is asymptomatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberts said the survival rate for the average woman has gone
from one year in the 1960s to five in recent studies, and that
predates the use of the drug Taxol (paclitaxel), which is delivered
directly to the intra-abdominal space through a surgically
implanted catheter. Bobbi Olson will be receiving that treatment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxol is a wonder drug of the early 1990s,'' Alberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to inject the drug directly onto the tumor makes it
1,000 times more effective than intravenous chemotherapy, Alberts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get the tumor to a small size, this technique can
be used to kill off the last tumor cell,'' Alberts said. ``You can
pour the drug directly onto the tumor cell like salt on a steak and
dissolve the tumor layer by layer. That's a tremendous advance in
the treatment of ovarian cancer.'' &QL;

EDWARDS NOT READY TO GIVE UP ROSTER SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Edwards has been in the Turk's shadow before _ many
times _ and used his guile to wriggle away and survive. He has
persevered through two knee surgeries, dozens of young hotshots and
never-ending skepticism that a given season is going to be his last
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But this might be the biggest challenge ever for Edwards, who is
trying to make it with the Cardinals in his 10th season as a
receiver and special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards returned to practice Tuesday, less than a month after he
underwent his latest knee surgery, and on the day the Cardinals
trimmed their roster from 76 to 60 players. Edwards survived that
cut. The next one is Sunday. Seven more players must go.
</P>
<P>
   The Casa Grande native is convinced he still has what it takes
to squeeze onto a roster after a decade in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go compete these next five days and do what I need to do
and prove I can still do the things I've done in the past, I'm not
on the bubble,'' said Edwards, who appeared in every game the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the injury, his age (32) and another group of young
challengers who have shown in preseason action that they can do the
one thing that always has been Edwards' forte: special teams.
Edwards led Cardinals special teams with 20 tackles on coverage and
69 blocks on returns last season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin said Edwards still has ``the wherewithal to
make a lot of teams and be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony realizes it's been a challenge for him to stick for
the last 10 years,'' Tobin said. ``Come Sunday, we have to make a
decision on who we think are our five best receivers, so it was
good to have him back out here practicing to see how much his knee
injury has hurt or helped him. Getting it cleaned out might have
helped him run better.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Cut to chase &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only surprises among the Tuesday roster reductions was that
veteran running back Ron Moore went and free agent offensive
lineman Jon Clark stayed. Moore, who rushed for 1,898 yards during
his first two seasons for the Cardinals (1993-94), was released
early because ``I owed it to him to give him the opportunity to
possibly land with another team,'' Tobin said. ``And he probably
will catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was behind Adrian Murrell, Mario Bates and Michael
Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Clark (6 feet 6, 345 pounds), in his third pro season from
Temple, stuck because of injuries to linemen Anthony Clement and
Jerome Daniels, and because ``he's a young player on the come who
has gotten better,'' Tobin said. &QL;  &QL; 
Cornerback acquired &QL;  &QL; 
Later in the afternoon, after the initial roster moves were
announced, the Cardinals acquired veteran cornerback J.B. Brown
from the Pittsburgh Steelers for an undisclosed draft choice. To
make room on the 60-man roster, the Cardinals waived rookie wide
receiver Phil Savoy, a seventh-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 31, was a 12th-round draft pick in 1989 who played with
the Miami Dolphins for eight seasons before being signed by the
Steelers last year. He has appeared in 135 games, starting 88, and
intercepted 16 passes during his nine-year career. Brown is an
insurance policy at right corner with Tom Knight, the projected
starter, and backups J.J. McCleskey and Ty Howard all coming off
injuries that severely restricted their preseason action. &QL;  &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL;  &QL; 
Clement, Daniels, Eric Metcalf, Edwards and Knight returned to
practice but none has completely recovered from injuries. Sitting
out were defensive tackle Mark Smith (ribs), lineman Allen
DeGraffenreid (knee), wide receiver Frank Sanders (back) and
defensive end Brad Ottis (foot).
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nedney made a 53-yard field goal under pressure during the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith hurting, the first defensive line had Jerry Drake at
left end, Eric Swann at left tackle, Bernard Wilson at Smith's
right tackle, and Simeon Rice at right end.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, who was ejected from Saturday's game when officials
charged him with kicking a Seattle player who was down, denied it:
``Truthfully, I didn't do it. We're reviewing game films now. If
the league fines me, I'll appeal. I'm not in the habit of giving
away free money.'' &QL;  &QL;

FOX'S REST RETURNS GILKEY TO FAMILIAR ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey hit leadoff for the Diamondbacks on Tuesday night
for the first time since the outfielder was acquired from the New
York Mets on July 31. Andy Fox has virtually owned the slot,
leading off in 80 games this season, but Manager Buck Showalter
gave Fox the night off against Pittsburgh Pirates starter Sean
Lawrence, who was making his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence is a lefty and Fox bats left-handed, but that wasn't
the primary reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been beat up and banged up, he's been hit by pitches. I
think he's up in the league leaders in that,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has been hit 13 times, fifth in the National League and
three times in his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had just 20 leadoff at-bats with the Mets this year,
Gilkey is accustomed to the job. Going into the game, he was a
career .297 hitter in 343 at-bats hitting out of the No. 1
position. The only other spot in the order in which he has batted
more is third.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off instantly against the Pirates when Gilkey
lined a single to start the first inning and scored the first run
of the game on Devon White's sacrifice fly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lee fights slump &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rookie Diamondbacks first baseman Travis Lee entered the game in a
7-for-59 skid since coming off the disabled list on Aug. 7. But he
singled off Lawrence in his first at-bat and singled again off
reliever Jeff McCurry in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said before the game that the manner in which Lee has
dealt with all the hype and expectations is perhaps the most
pleasant surprise of the season. During tough times such as these,
Lee outwardly maintains an even keel. But don't be fooled.
Sometimes he leaves the dugout and ventures up the clubhouse runway
to let off steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's human,'' Showalter said. ``Sometimes with his
personality, people don't realize how competitive he is, how much
of a perfectionist he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't handle success well. Some people don't
handle failure well. He's been able to handle both.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short stops &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Tuesday's attendance of 38,960 the lowest of the
season, it was the third time in their past four games the
Diamondbacks drew fewer than 40,000. The club had exceeded the
figure in each of its first 56 home games.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks might be at or near the bottom of the league in
several offensive categories, but no team in the majors has hit
more triples. The club had 36 going into Tuesday's game. Next were
Pittsburgh, Boston and Tampa Bay with 31.
</P>
<P>
   Runs might be at a premium, but at least the Diamondbacks know
what to do when they get them most of the time. They are 46-29
(.613) when scoring at least four runs in a game, compared with
4-54 (.069) when held to three or fewer runs. &QL;

   TAULIGNAN, France _ Yet another huge IMF-sponsored rescue
package has promptly fizzled out. Billions of dollars have been
spent to no avail. Disasters of this magnitude occur far too often
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Russian meltdown is a tale of bad economic and
political judgment, in the West and in the East.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing deeply wrong with the ruble. True, the fall in
oil prices has hurt Russia badly, and a moderate depreciation could
have helped. But the problem is elsewhere, and everybody knows it:
The federal government is increasingly unable to collect taxes,
which have fallen from 20 percent of GDP in 1992 to 8 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have managed to contain the budget deficit,
but they have done it the wrong way, by not paying what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Russia nobody feels that dues must be paid, not the
government and not the taxpayers. Why pay if there is no sanction?
</P>
<P>
   From headquarters just as lavish as those in New York or London,
Russian banks and corporations engage in big commercial deals, make
their top executives immensely rich, they claim that they cough up
a few kopecks and carry on.
</P>
<P>
   If tax collection goes on declining, there is no way the
government can service its debt. This is what triggered the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign investors alike scrambled to the exit door.
Pundits certified that the ruble was not overvalued, but there were
no takers. Self-interested financiers convinced the authorities to
buy those rubles, and when the stock of dollars dried out in July,
the IMF provided a new pile which just went down the same tube.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the IMF conditions for the loan could have solved the
problem. But half of the required measures had to be approved by
the Communist-controlled Duma, which has never passed any
legislation without crippling it.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the other half, the government would have had to get
tough with bad taxpayers, but these are all the president's
friends, and the prime minister (now replaced) was patently weak.
The IMF conditions never had a fighting chance. That was mistake
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake No. 2 was not to request that the embattled ruble be
allowed to float. Same mistake as in Mexico, as in Asia, and soon
in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's main shareholder, the United States, committed mistake
No. 3. It decided that Boris Yeltsin's political fate was vital to
the U.S. national interest, and ordered the IMF to undertake yet
another expensive and predictably doomed rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here we are. Basic principles of economics have defeated
the might of top guns in Washington. Yeltsin and his friends have
sunk with the ruble, and the bottom has not been reached. What can
be done?
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the Russian authorities have suspended servicing their
debt. They had to pay enormous interest, which can only be
explained by the expectation of a forthcoming default.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who now complain about debt suspension are less than
candid. Even if they end up with half of what they were promised,
it will still turn out to be the best deal of the year, courtesy of
millions of impoverished Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities must also stop fixing the exchange rate. Their
stubborn defense of the ruble was really a guarantee offered to
Russian banks which had borrowed heavily in dollars. The price tag
is in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If banks fail, this will only be fair. Failed banks can be sold,
and there will be plenty of takers from the West if they are not
kept out by powerful lobbies and if the price is right. At last
Russia will have banks which resemble those that you find
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the essential part: collection of taxes. Until
this is done, Russia will go on from crisis to crisis, gradually
imploding in the way Latin America did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way: Apply the law. But this requires cutting
the link between politics, business and finance. Yeltsin has shown
over and over again that he will not do that. He backed Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on many tough decisions but he did not
let him touch big business.
</P>
<P>
   He has now brought back Viktor Chernomyrdin, whose main
political asset is immobilism. Too bad. Someone else will have to
do the job of establishing a market economy, one where either you
pay your dues or you go to jail. It's as simple as that. All the
rest is pie in the sky. &QL;

   STRASBOURG _ There are of course great differences between
Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo, but there are also
similarities. In each case, ethnic or religious frictions have been
exploited and aggravated through a sadly familiar chain of events.
</P>
<P>
   When moderate political forces have failed to deliver, radicals
have gained ground, weapons have flowed in from sympathizers
abroad, attacks have been followed by revenge, and extremist
positions have further hardened.
</P>
<P>
   The way out of such evil spirals is arduous and complex, as we
know from both Dayton and Belfast. Substantial international
pressures and support are no less vital than an inclusive
constitutional framework for domestic peace-building.
</P>
<P>
   For far too long, the Belgrade authorities have rejected
international involvement in what they regard as their own internal
affair. This position is untenable for at least three reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, it reflects an antiquated notion of sovereignty. In the
Council of Europe _ to which Yugoslavia aspires to belong _ we are
deeply convinced that human rights issues are our common concern
and not the exclusive domain of any one state.
</P>
<P>
   This conviction, which underlies the European Convention of
Human Rights, is based not only on idealism but also on
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Europe, no country can feel safe with chauvinist and
authoritarian neighbors. That is why common values lie at the very
core of the new security system that Europeans are trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   Second, repression in Kosovo had a significant impact on other
European states long before the recent violence started. Several
hundred thousand Kosovars reside outside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Third, autarky is no realistic option for Belgrade. To find a
way out of Yugoslavia's poverty and self-isolation, its leaders
cannot merely pretend to accept fundamental standards. They must do
so also in practice.
</P>
<P>
   After the end of the Cold War, intra-national conflicts and
minority problems have surged onto the European political agenda as
the main threat to the continent's security. If identified in good
time, such dangers can be met with a panoply of civilian measures.
</P>
<P>
   The most important defense is to reinforce the basic instruments
of ``democratic security.'' Strengthening the rule of law,
promoting transparency and accountable governance at all levels and
building an independent judiciary are indispensable and
indissociable elements in that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But more specific measures are also required to satisfy the
legitimate needs of various minorities. With the mosaic of ethnic
and linguistic groups in Europe, few, if any, states are entirely
homogeneous. A country that cannot cope with this diversity and
integrate its citizens in a respectful manner may sooner or later
face disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vienna summit in 1993, the Council of Europe received a
mandate from its member states to address this problem. Two new
treaties have been developed: the European Charter on Regional and
Minority Languages and the Framework Convention on the Protection
of National Minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both go into effect this year, with the implementation to be
supervised by independent experts.
</P>
<P>
   But many states have yet to join these conventions. The issue is
a touchy one, sometimes affecting, or so it is felt, the
established conception of the country as a nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to combat xenophobia and distrust between
traditionally antagonistic peoples, and to strengthen cross-border
cooperation as well as local and regional democracy. An important
task is to make history education an eye-opener and not a
mind-closer.
</P>
<P>
   Many European states have resorted to constitutional engineering
to grant a special status to particular regions or minorities.
Several of the newly established democracies have been assisted by
the Council of Europe's Venice Commission on Democracy Through law,
a panel of constitutional law experts with advisory competence.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo struggle revolves around the issue of
self-government. For the Kosovo Albanians, restored autonomy is no
longer enough. For the Serbs, independence is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between these two seemingly irreconcilable positions
is not unbridgeable. Recent European experience, from Northern
Ireland to Moldova, shows that tailor-made solutions can be
painstakingly developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leaders may be about to crush the resistance on the
battlefield, but can they ever regain the cohesion of their
country?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond human casualties, the main losses of a war are mental and
moral. Restoring trust and respect for human rights must be the
cardinal aims of any strategy for recovery. &QL;

<P>
   Is Russia all right? Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed
Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, as prime minister in March, then replaced him
this week by reappointing his old ally Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that whenever Yeltsin makes a radical change in his
inner circle of government, his ratings tank.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's economic crisis worsened in March, Yeltsin chose
Kiriyenko, the young banker, as prime minister. But the president
was blamed for the devaluation of the ruble in the aftermath of
stock market price plunges, falling currency exchange rates and a
drop in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was brought back five months after being sacked.
Yeltsin probably could not find anyone else as reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But why was the government changed in the first place? It was no
surprise the Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament,
advocated Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiriyenko administration had just begun making progress with
collecting taxes _ the biggest challenge the Russian government
faces right now. But his impetuousness stirred discontent among
former colleagues in banking and business.
</P>
<P>
   He had to rely upon short-term government bonds and loans
arranged through the International Monetary Fund to cover the
budget deficit, but that could not be expected to permanently
resolve the fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis worsened, in part because of the government's
precarious position on the edge of default and coal miner strikes,
ruble devaluation was forced three days after Yeltsin had ruled it
out.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not only a devaluation of confidence in Yeltsin
but a loss of faith in all of Russian politics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no warm welcome for the ousted prime minister.
Chernomyrdin oversaw economic policy until a few months ago, and is
thus responsible for the present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His strong point, if indeed he has one, is his link to the
financial oligarchy, based on his former position as head of
Gazprom, the national gas utility monopoly, and association with
the opposition in Parliament and among local and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Can Chernomyrdin stabilize Russia's politics by using such
assets?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's appointment of Chernomyrdin to be his political
successor reflects recent developments in Russia's politics and its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Russia's political realignment has begun in earnest in
anticipation of the parliamentary election next year and the
presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential hopeful Chernomyrdin is leaning toward an alliance
with Aleksandr Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk. This is leading to a
three-way political race that involves the Lebed-Chernomyrdin
alliance, a group headed by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and a third
group led by Communist Party chief Gennadi Zhuganov. Yeltsin must
back Chernomyrdin to save himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Russia needs political stability if it is to obtain an
urgently needed $22.6 billion (3.277 trillion yen) IMF loan.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the opposition parties, especially the Communists, the
largest parliamentary opposition, have become ambiguous. Observers
of Russian politics suggest that the recommendation for Yeltsin's
resignation came because the Communist Party and Chernomyrdin's
supporters have become closer.
</P>
<P>
   Could such cooperation between Chernomyrdin and the Communists
result in greater emphasis on industrial policy?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin must clearly show where their new
regime is headed. If they become caught up in a power and money
struggle rather than wrestling with revival of the economy of
Russia, further sell-offs are unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin wormed his way out of previous repeated economic crises
by changing his aides. This time, he has even hinted at his
potential successor. If he resorts to the same method over and
over, however, he faces the growing problem of being held
accountable, both at home and abroad, for Russia's mess. &QL;

<P>
   Is Russia all right? Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed
Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, as prime minister in March, then replaced him
this week by reappointing his old ally Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that whenever Yeltsin makes a radical change in his
inner circle of government, his ratings tank.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's economic crisis worsened in March, Yeltsin chose
Kiriyenko, the young banker, as prime minister. But the president
was blamed for the devaluation of the ruble in the aftermath of
stock market price plunges, falling currency exchange rates and a
drop in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was brought back five months after being sacked.
Yeltsin probably could not find anyone else as reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But why was the government changed in the first place? It was no
surprise the Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament,
advocated Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiriyenko administration had just begun making progress with
collecting taxes _ the biggest challenge the Russian government
faces right now. But his impetuousness stirred discontent among
former colleagues in banking and business.
</P>
<P>
   He had to rely upon short-term government bonds and loans
arranged through the International Monetary Fund to cover the
budget deficit, but that could not be expected to permanently
resolve the fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis worsened, in part because of the government's
precarious position on the edge of default and coal miner strikes,
ruble devaluation was forced three days after Yeltsin had ruled it
out.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not only a devaluation of confidence in Yeltsin
but a loss of faith in all of Russian politics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no warm welcome for the ousted prime minister.
Chernomyrdin oversaw economic policy until a few months ago, and is
thus responsible for the present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His strong point, if indeed he has one, is his link to the
financial oligarchy, based on his former position as head of
Gazprom, the national gas utility monopoly, and association with
the opposition in Parliament and among local and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Can Chernomyrdin stabilize Russia's politics by using such
assets?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's appointment of Chernomyrdin to be his political
successor reflects recent developments in Russia's politics and its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Russia's political realignment has begun in earnest in
anticipation of the parliamentary election next year and the
presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential hopeful Chernomyrdin is leaning toward an alliance
with Aleksandr Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk. This is leading to a
three-way political race that involves the Lebed-Chernomyrdin
alliance, a group headed by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and a third
group led by Communist Party chief Gennadi Zhuganov. Yeltsin must
back Chernomyrdin to save himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Russia needs political stability if it is to obtain an
urgently needed $22.6 billion (3.277 trillion yen) IMF loan.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the opposition parties, especially the Communists, the
largest parliamentary opposition, have become ambiguous. Observers
of Russian politics suggest that the recommendation for Yeltsin's
resignation came because the Communist Party and Chernomyrdin's
supporters have become closer.
</P>
<P>
   Could such cooperation between Chernomyrdin and the Communists
result in greater emphasis on industrial policy?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin must clearly show where their new
regime is headed. If they become caught up in a power and money
struggle rather than wrestling with revival of the economy of
Russia, further sell-offs are unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin wormed his way out of previous repeated economic crises
by changing his aides. This time, he has even hinted at his
potential successor. If he resorts to the same method over and
over, however, he faces the growing problem of being held
accountable, both at home and abroad, for Russia's mess. &QL;

   Russian President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 was ostensibly a move to take
responsibility for the financial crisis the country faces.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the crisis is a legacy of Kiriyenko's
predecessor, Victor Chernomyrdin, who has been reappointed as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of manager decides to pull a pitcher off the field in
a huff, only to return him when his replacement was also battered
by hits?
</P>
<P>
   Making no clear explanations for his move, Yeltsin has only
succeeded in revealing the instability of his presidency, which has
less than two years left.
</P>
<P>
   The current financial crisis is rooted in Russia's decision in
1995, when Chernomyrdin was in charge, to switch from a policy of
extending government loans aimed at covering the large fiscal
deficit, to the issuance of high-interest short-term bonds. The
plan was endorsed by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   While the move was aimed at reducing inflation, the bonds
snowballed. By the end of this year, over $18 billion in bonds are
expected to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks that rushed to borrow huge amounts of U.S.
currency to invest in the bonds are now struggling to repay the
loans, resulting in the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, the Russian government also failed to deal
with the drop in industrial production, evident in the mining
industry, which saw a plunge in production in 1996 to 44 percent of
its 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
   It was also under Chernomyrdin that the government failed to
create a proper taxation system, despite the obvious need to
increase state income.
</P>
<P>
   When Kiriyenko was appointed five months ago, it was in the
expectation that he would deal with the aftermath of Chernomyrdin's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in the value of the ruble, in Russian loans and in
the country's stocks can be attributed to structural distortion in
the Russian economy, the retreat of capital from new markets _
triggered by the Asian currency crisis _ and falling oil and
natural gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some also point out the lack of political clout held by the
36-year-old prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   However, compared with Chernomyrdin's unclear policies, which
focused on encouraging a balance among the military-industrial
complex, energy companies and new business plutocracies,
Kiriyenko's stance was clear as daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko managed to get major portions of his economic
stability bill, which outlined measures to collect taxes and reduce
government spending, passed in the State Duma last month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kiriyenko attempted to break the strong ties
between the government and wealthy business plutocracies. He
focused on finding deputies who could get the job done, introducing
reformists such as Boris Nemtsov into his Cabinet and appointing
Communist Party member Yury Maslyukov as industry and trade
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic crisis has not resulted only from
mismanagement of the economy _ no, this crisis is on a different
plane. It is a result of a distorted structure that has seen no
increase in investments for productive activities.
</P>
<P>
   The reappointment of Chernomyrdin, who could be seen as the
cause of this problem, cannot possibly help solve the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When one considers that Chernomyrdin is a possible candidate for
presidency in the year 2000, a more radical but unpopular solution
to the situation would be difficult to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Yeltsin has dismissed deputies whenever his abilities
have come into question.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Yeltsin merely wanted to fend off a political
crisis brewing over the ruble's devaluation one day earlier, which
could have precipitated a vote of non-confidence in the Duma?
Chernomyrdin is, after all, popular with the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this latest move will rescue Yeltsin _ and Russia _ in
the end remains to be seen. &QL;

 &HT;    Edwards Aquifer rising after heavy rains
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Remnants of Tropical Storm Charley dumped more
rain on the western edge of the Hill Country, adding 12 inches to
the western portion of the Edwards Aquifer and boosting estimates
of water level increases at Lake Travis.
</P>
<P>
   The aquifer already saw a 6.3-foot rise over the weekend, and
the recent addition of several inches of rain continued to brighten
the outlook for San Antonio's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at 661 feet now,'' said Jeanne Jones, a spokeswoman for
the Edwards Aquifer Authority in San Antonio. ``It's a much better
picture than it was as recently as August 4th, when we had a low of
639.5 feet.'' The extra rain also led the Lower Colorado River
Authority to revise its estimates of the effect on Lake Travis. The
authority forecasts an additional 3-foot rise in the lake, from 663
feet above sea level to 666 feet by Labor Day. The lake is
considered full at 682 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   The additional rains had little effect on rivers, creeks and
streams in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe and Blanco rivers continued to recede from Monday
morning's flood stages, and the southern branch of the Llano River,
although swollen by Tuesday's additional rain, funneled only minor
amounts of new water into the Highland Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two waves came down the Llano, but it was less than what we
had Monday,'' said Bob Rose, a meteorologist with the Lower
Colorado River Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain north of the Llano's southern branch could put some
water into dry stretches of the San Saba River today, but much of
it is expected to sink into the ground, Rose said.

 &HT;    This much fun's gotta be criminal
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Crime. If you conducted a poll, most people
would come out against it. But let's be honest. People love to
watch crime being fought because, gosh darn it, it's fun, cheap
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Toni Hinojosa's big day.
</P>
<P>
   It was around 5 Monday morning when Toni, who lives on South
Trace Drive in South Austin, left her house to walk Hercules, her
Shih Tzu, which means ``rat on steroids'' in Chinese. ``As I opened
the door I saw all these cop cars pointing their lights at the
house across from us,'' Toni recalled. ``I couldn't figure out what
was going on. They were all lined up there like oh my gawd, there's
some crazy criminal around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni says there were about 50 cop cars up and down her street.
Toni didn't know this at the time. But shortly before 4 a.m., the
cops had gone to the house across the street from Toni's to arrest
a suspected parole violator, who had locked himself inside and
refused to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was having a ball watching all this,'' said Armando,
Toni's husband, a retired Air Force staff sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so exciting to me that I couldn't believe it,'' Toni
said.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Toni, out on her front lawn around 5 a.m., walking
Hercules, the Shih Tzu. And now here came this nice policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A policeman came over and said, 'Ma'am, would you please go
inside?' `` Toni recalled. ``I said, 'Why?' and and he said,
'There's a subject in the house. And a SWAT team is coming. So you
have to go inside.' ``
</P>
<P>
   A real, live SWAT team. Wow. Coming to this neighborhood. Toni
wasn't about to miss the chance to catch an actual SWAT team in
action. `` wanted to watch,'' she said. ``I'd never seen a SWAT
team.''
</P>
<P>
   So after Toni took Hercules back into the house and dumped him
off, she craftily snuck back outside, and hid behind the ornamental
bush near her front door _ ``so I could see what the SWAT team was
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This move proved to be a disappointment. Toni hunkered down
behind the bush for ``probably an hour and a half. I was getting
tired, believe it or not. I was kind of squatting.'' But other than
sore joints, nothing much had happened _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun came up, Toni left her spot behind the bush and
went back into her house. ``I thought they (the cops) might see me
and tell me to go away,'' she explained. But she wasn't giving up.
This could still get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   So she went into her kitchen and began watching through her
front window with her binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   So Toni's persistence paid off. ``Finally they (the cops)
started talking to him on that loudspeaker. I even heard a
helicopter go by over the house. It was like in the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-hour standoff ended around 9 a.m. after the cops shot
tear gas into the house across the street from Toni's and rousted
out Martin Lee Kennedy, 38, for a parole violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when he came out with his hands up,'' Toni said. ``Boy,
what an exciting morning I had.''

 &HT;    Talking back about school, reunions
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On school vacations, TAAS tests and family
reunions, readers respond:
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the basic premise of your (Aug. 16) article _
that summer ends too early and that we should not be starting
school so early, (but) there are two points you made to which I
feel compelled to respond. The first was the suggestion that the
first month of school consists of mainly review of old material.
Not true. Due to changes in the school schedule and an increase in
the material we are expected to cover, I am doing new material (as
a teacher at Taylor High School) from the very first bell of
school. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The other comment had to do with schools being `geared to
passing that silly TAAS test.' There is a tremendous pressure from
the administrators to do that (in some schools, not necessarily
mine), but there are a lot of very dedicated, hard-working teachers
who are resisting that trend. We teach well above TAAS, and those
scores should take care of themselves. I would have to ask you,
`How much does the media contribute to the emphasis on TAAS
scores?' How many times has your newspaper done a story on any of
the other (academic) indicators? OK, SAT scores also get some
press, too, but TAAS always makes the front page. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not trying to be a wise guy. It's just very frustrating
that some of the great things we are doing that go well beyond TAAS
never get any coverage.'' _ Dixie Ross
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids started at Casis, but we gave up there when the
5th-grade creative-writing unit was dropped to allow for more
TAAS-preparation time. Talk about `Wag the Dog!' We're at the
Austin Waldorf School now, which opens humanely in early September,
usually the Tuesday after Labor Day, and which gives not a fig for
the TAAS and its self-reinforcing dumbing-down of curricula
everywhere.''_ Michael DiLeo
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a teacher at Austin High School. As you stated, the
rationale for the August school opening was to end the semester
before Christmas. The important point here, however, is so that
secondary school students could take their exams before the long
break and not forget too much. Well, the surprise for us this year
was that, due to most courses being year-long, we may not be giving
semester exams any more. Therefore, the whole reason for the
pre-Labor Day opening will be moot!'' _ Mary Nichols
</P>
<P>
   ''Except for running out of space, why did you stop giving
reasons why the schools should not start until after Labor Day? . .
. What does it take to get a taxpayer revolt that demands common
sense and responsibility about the way our school tax dollars are
spent?'' _ Elizabeth A. Strohm
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel exactly the same way about (family) reunions. And, as
an old rock 'n' roller who could hardly wait to move away from
home, I surprised everyone as being the one who loves the reunions
the most (but only once a year!).'' _ Tim Basham
</P>
<P>
   ''After reading your column, I had to chuckle. You mentioned a
`big' family of four siblings and a reunion of 19. Imagine this: A
four-day event, lodging spread out in five hotel rooms and three
private homes. . . . Do you know how much brisket, coleslaw, potato
salad, baked beans, banana pudding and ice tea it takes to feed 52
people?'' _ Liz McIntyre Don McLeese writes Sundays and Tuesdays in
Metro &AMP; State. He can be reached at dmcleesestatesman.com or at

 &HT;    Blake booted by Bengals?
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Deposed quarterback Jeff Blake slipped into his
sneakers, fastened the belt on his blue jean shorts, tugged on the
bill of his white New York Yankees cap and headed for the door at
Spinney Field.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't speak with reporters, but you could see intense pride
in the man who threw 74 touchdown passes for the Bengals from
1994-97. And you couldn't help but wonder: Will his next exit be
permanent . . . before the first snap of the 1998 regular season?
</P>
<P>
   Team president and general manager Mike Brown refused to confirm
if he has asked Blake to renegotiate a contract that calls for $1.9
million in '98 and $2.65 million in '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into that right now,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's ideal scenario would be a one-year deal that would cut
him loose in February and turn him onto the free-agent market. But
a two-year deal? To be the Bengals' backup? No way will he accept
that.
</P>
<P>
   It's already difficult enough for him to stomach the fact he's
No. 2 behind starter Neil O'Donnell and possibly No. 3 behind Paul
Justin.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown stands firm on the two-year offer and Blake doesn't
accept a lower salary, he could be among the final casualties
Sunday, when the NFL's 53-man rosters are set.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals without Blake as insurance is a scary thought.
O'Donnell has played well enough to deserve the starting
assignment, but he's in his ninth NFL season and has yet to play a
full 16 games in any year.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is a talented backup, but can you trust him at the wheel
of the offense if O'Donnell gets hurt? That's a huge risk. A major
gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he senses that he's the top backup to O'Donnell, Justin
said: ``I have no sense. I don't know where it's going or what's
happening. I wish I did, but I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Bruce Coslet was asked how Blake is holding up. ``I'm
not going to speak for him,'' Coslet said. ``I can't. All I can do
is tell you what I expect from him. I expect him to come in,
prepare like he's the starter, go out and practice hard and get
ready to play Friday night. Case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   With trade prospects dwindling _ reports out of Atlanta and St.
Louis say the Falcons and Rams aren't interested in a trade, but
may look into grabbing him if he's cut _ keeping Blake and his hurt
feelings on the sidelines could be an unsavory distraction for a
team rebuilding with a full-throttle youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he may be let go.

 &HT;    So you think your family is dysfunctional?
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gather the spouse, kids and Lassie and write a mission or vision
statement.
</P>
<P>
   What is the purpose of your family? What are your core values?
Where do you want to be in five years?
</P>
<P>
   Mission statement? Core values? Sounds more like running a
business than a family, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, according to motivational guru Stephen R. Covey. The
author of the highly acclaimed management bestseller The 7 Habits
of Highly Effective People told more than 2,300 people at Ohio's
Memorial Hall recently that they can apply similar habits to forge
a happy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, parents have be proactive'' in their approach to family
problems, said Covey who in 1997 wrote The 7 Habits of Highly
Effective Families (Golden Books, $25) . ``Don't blame your past.
It isn't nature. It isn't nurture. It's the power to choose, the
moral agency to choose your response to anything that happens. What
does that mean to a family?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we can become the agent of change in our own
family,'' he said. ``Even though we were abused as a child, we
don't have to abuse our own children. Even if we were raised in a
family that had no vision about the worth of people. Or we may have
been in a contentious family with fighting, use of survival
tactics, infidelity and extreme brokenness.''

   No telling where it will end

<P>
   GLEN ROSE, Texas _ Like turtles on a log, the men sat side by
side on park benches.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe across the street was still serving breakfast, but the
morning sun kept the men tucked together in the shade cast by big
pecan trees on
</P>
<P>
   the west side of the courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   The old Somervell County Courthouse faces south, which probably
is no accident. Wherever statues honor Confederate veterans,
courthouses often
</P>
<P>
   moon the north.
</P>
<P>
   The men were in a perfect spot to track all the comings and
goings in their 2,000-population community 50 or so miles southwest
of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   We parked our motorcycles next to an old pickup that had the
tailgate down to show off a nice load of watermelons. We nodded at
the men and
</P>
<P>
   crossed the street for a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned, we decided to sit a while with the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``You boys with all those motorcycles down by the river?'' asked
one of the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Don't know anything about them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big group. Vietnam veterans. Supposed to be 2,000 or more this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get near that much,'' offered another man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not with them. We're just riding around. We came north
because it's raining south of Waco. We're from Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't rained here all summer. It's rained all around us.
But it hasn't rained here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's that nuclear power plant they built near here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe. If that's it, I wish they'd turn it off long enough to
get a good rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to Waco once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you need to or not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the annual statewide convention of the Masonic Grand Lodge
in December. We nearly quit going to Waco. They jacked up the rates
on us.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked the man at my motel why he charged me $80 when the
card on the back of the door said $40. He said they double the
prices when the
</P>
<P>
   Masons come to town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least those Baptists are honest. They may charge double,
but they don't lie about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The men watched the traffic as they talked. They had been born
and reared right there in Glen Rose and Somervell County.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out where the 10-cent picture show used to be and
where the drug store with the marble counter and the honky tonk
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the remark about Waco ethics, we watched a blue
pickup pulling a trailer loaded with hay swing wide to make a left
turn where
</P>
<P>
   the old drug store used to be. A bale fell off.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the pickup with the trailer disappeared than
another man stopped to remove the hay bale from the street. He put
it on the
</P>
<P>
   sidewalk and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   The lost hay bale and the thoughtfulness of the passing stranger
were still being discussed when another man in a new white pickup
pulled to a
</P>
<P>
   stop next to the hay bale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look. Look at this,'' someone said as we watched the driver
put the bale in the back of his pickup.
</P>
<P>
   The watermelon man gave a sharp yell that froze the hay thief in
his tracks. He stared in our direction, noticing for the first time
that men
</P>
<P>
   were watching him from the shade of the pecan trees.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he didn't know what to do next. Finally, he made up his
mind. The thief made his getaway.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later the man in the blue pickup returned looking
for his hay bale. But it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hay bale didn't sit there more than six minutes. In Glen
Rose, I figured that hay bale would sit there at least a day before
anyone took
</P>
<P>
   it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep. First the nuclear power plant stops the rain and now this.
Glen Rose is changing fast.

 &HT;    Floods highlight need for weather warnings
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The deadly floods on the Texas-Mexico border
point out an old problem for Texans: the need for timely warning of
severe weather while there's still a chance to get out of its way.
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio, Texas, ironically, had a few unusual advantages. It has
an Air Force training base with weather watchers and a weather
radar, an additional federal weather radar to the north in San
Angelo and one to the southeast in Brackettville, and two automated
observation sites that report conditions hourly to the National
Weather Service's forecast center in New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   So the forecast center was able to issue its first flood
warnings for Del Rio at 9:10 a.m. Sunday, based on reports of
swamped low-water crossings, and to extend them with ever stronger
language about evacuations and life-threatening conditions until
well after midnight. National Weather Service officials said the
worst of the flooding began between 9 and 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Most places in Texas have far fewer means of escaping disaster.
Only 45 of the state's 254 counties have federal weather
observation sites, either staffed or automated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas scientists hope to begin changing that this week,
when they ask the state Public Utility Commission to raise electric
rates to pay for the first complete statewide weather monitoring
system by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be at least one automated weather instrument site
in every county,'' said John Nielsen-Gammon, an associate professor
of meteorology at Texas A&AMP;M University and one of the organizers of
the proposed system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too expensive to put a radar in every county, but you can
augment the ones we have with (automated) observations,''
Nielsen-Gammon said. ``The National Weather Service would love to
do it, but they have to scramble for money from Congress just to
maintain the current setup.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed weather network is called the Texas MesoNet, a
reference to mesoscale, a meteorological term meaning a weather
event extending from 1 to 1,000 kilometers in area.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, which arose in 1995 at the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, when officials watched Oklahoma put in a
similar system, is being pushed by the Lower Colorado River
Authority and coordinated by meteorologists at Texas A&AMP;M and Texas
Tech University in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Weather Service finds commendable the idea of
one or more weather observation sites in every Texas county to
monitor air temperature, humidity, precipitation, prevailing winds,
amount of sunlight, ground temperatures and moisture content of the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The automated sites would report the information hourly, as
federal observation sites do now, to regional centers where the
data could be analyzed and passed on to whoever needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the system was up and running, its information would be
free to the weather service and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have a system with that kind of dense
information,'' said Larry Eblin, a meteorologist with the weather
service's Austin and San Antonio Forecast Office in New Braunfels.
``Our forecast models would be far better than they are right now,
especially in areas where there's not so many gauges or people to
call for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Eblin said the weather service now relies in many places on
volunteers such as ham radio operators and police and sheriff's
deputies to add additional visual information to what regional
radar and instruments can gather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bigger than other states and we have more Nexrad radars
than any other state,'' Nielsen-Gammon said. ``But the coverage
tends to be better where the population is denser.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen-Gammon said the weather service operates nine Nexrad
weather radars in Texas and has information-sharing agreements with
additional radars at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their impressive television performance, radars
can't do it alone. Scientists say automated instruments such as
rain gauges are necessary to augment even Nexrad radar estimates of
rainfall rates. Research has found that intervening terrain may
block the radars and rain often occurs at lower levels of the
atmosphere than those at which the radars are aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The primary beneficiaries of a Texas MesoNet are expected to be
farmers and other agriculture producers. The information would help
their planning for planting, irrigating and harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Local power companies also would be able to better determine the
power consumption needs of a region by pinpointing hotter or colder
areas. It's the potential power company savings, as well as the
benefits to agriculture, that the scientists expect to convince the
Public Utility Commission to use electric rates to finance the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost would be a few pennies more on utility bills,''
Nielsen-Gammon said. ``But we fully expect it to save energy costs
in the long run, improve food production and improve public
safety.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Baseball again simple pastime when you're 6
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I got a different view of a baseball game the other
day. The eyes were 6 years old. I borrowed them for a few innings.
They belonged to my grandson, just catching on to the tricks of
life, like finding that if he goes to the ballpark, he can order
pizza and a thing called a slushy, and peanuts, which he doesn't
care for a lot. Too much work.
</P>
<P>
   What you go to a game with a 6-year-old it's a trip back to
basics. It turns into a review of all the things you've taken for
granted. Like when a batter is out at first. He hits the ball, a
fielder throws him out. James the Third wanted an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, when the batter hits the ball, the fielder must throw
it to first before the batter gets there, and the batter is out,''
his father explained.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'd just never thought of it that way. It does make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were playing the Dodgers, and naturally the Dodgers
wore gray road uniforms. Little James wanted to know why. His
father came through again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players in the gray uniforms,'' he said, ``they are the
bad guys, the Dodgers. The team in white are the good guys. They're
the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, no Dodger pitcher hit Andres Galarraga and started a
brawl, for I don't know how he'd have explained that. The
6-year-old had met ``Mr. Galarraga'' before the game and considered
him a close personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time I'd sat in one of the pews at Turner
Field, so most of it was as new to me as it was to him. We did all
the things tourists do. I'd never been closer to the big Coke
bottle than the press box. I didn't realize it's made of bases,
gloves, bats, balls, chest protectors and all kinds of equipment.
Little James took one look at the little patch of infield and
stepped into the batter's box. He took a big imaginary swing and
tore out for first base. Obviously he was safe, and thereupon
celebrated his triumph with a loud, ``Yay!''
</P>
<P>
   He inherited something from old grandad. He has a distinct
respect for heights. He showed no interest in looking over the side
at the field below. He sat in the fake dugout and crossed his legs
like Casey Stengel used to do. Once his tour was done, he took the
misty walk back, cooling his fevered brow, and there was triumph in
his stride.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was next, presided over by Carolyn Serra. He didn't
tarry long at the silver shovel old grandad had helped break ground
with at the old stadium, or at the Cracker uniform out of his
gallery at home. But there was joy at the sight of the Pullman car,
the way the Braves had traveled in olden days. He romped up and
down and in and out and played conductor, then it was time for
pizza, slushy and the game. Oh, and of course, the essential
tomahawk, which can be endangering to anybody near a free swinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a strike, Granddaddy?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   That caught me tongue-tied. I'd been trying to decide what one
was since each umpire decided on his own. I stammered, then said,
``It's when a batter swings at a ball and misses, and sometimes
when he doesn't swing.''
</P>
<P>
   That quieted the curiosity for a few minutes, until he finished
his pizza. Then a Dodger fouled off a pitch, and of course, the
umpire signaled strike. He looked at me with a question in his
eyes, but finished his slushy and let me off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   We were leaving, still taking in all the glitter, remembering
back to Ponce de Leon Park, where his father was almost born.
``They've taken a plain old game,'' his father said, ``and turned
it into an experience.''

 &HT;    Laredo bridge closures could affect trade
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins and Ben Wear
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Business people on both sides of the border
waited nervously this week to hear whether the Laredo bridge
closings would be a small inconvenience or a big financial blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad it is depends on how long the bridges are closed,''
said Sylvia Segovia, a traffic supervisor at Express Carriers, a
Laredo trucking company. ``The longer we have to wait, the more
money we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials closed commercial traffic over the two international
bridges connecting Laredo's downtown to that of Nuevo Laredo in
Mexico. When they will reopen depends on the Rio Grande. Crossings
at Del Rio and Colombia are also closed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the loss of one day's operations we're talking about
millions of dollars lost,'' said Miguel Conchas, president and
chief executive of the Laredo Chamber of Commerce. ``We expect we
will see it return to normal (on Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Laredo is the largest inland crossing between the United States
and Mexico in terms of freight. Last year, 1.2 million trucks
entered the United States at Laredo, and 5.4 million people crossed
on foot to shop and to work. Total trade at the Laredo crossing
reached $50 billion in 1997, according to the Bureau of
Transportation Statistics and the Border Trade Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name the product, and it's going to be crossing at
Laredo,'' said Brennar Stewart, research team director at the Texas
Department of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks loaded with electronic components and car parts are
shipped from the United States to assembly plants called
maquiladoras on the Mexican side of the border. Cars, consumer
electronics, furniture and food are shipped both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Mayor Betty Flores acknowledged that closing the bridges
will make the area's shared international economy take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the economic impact is hard to tell,'' Flores said. ``One
day is not that much. Believe me, they (truckers) know how to make
it up and they will.''
</P>
<P>
   The same types of goods move back and forth the Del Rio
crossing, but on a much smaller scale. Last year, 71,000 trucks and
262,000 pedestrians crossed into the United States through Del Rio.
Trade totalled $2.3 billion for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Segovia's company, which ships car parts to maquiladoras and
ships assembled parts back to the United States, decided against
rerouting trucks as a result of the Laredo bridge closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much of a hassle to reroute, so we're just going to
sweat it out for a little bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, Express Carriers receives 56 trailers carrying
goods from Mexico. On Tuesday, it received 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each load generates at least $1,500 worth of freight income,''
she said. ``That's a lot of money lost. And no one knows for sure
what will happen on Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Flores said that lives are more important than
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse thing we can have is a death on our hands,'' she
said. ``If people need to stay to go to work, then they need to
find some way to stay in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Reinigio Rodriguez, Jr., headed home to Mexico Tuesday evening
to his wife and two young sons and away from his job installing and
repairing air conditioners in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, I won't be able to work,'' he said. ``One day of
rest won't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it turns into several days because of lingering high
water? No problem, at least for Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss is my dad,'' he said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Survey of kids say, Clinton should remain in office
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the 12-year-old boys polled in my most recent survey of the
American people who live at my house regarding President Clinton's
television revelations Monday, 100 percent of respondents said,
``He didn't say he was sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The five of us watched together, and no one had much comment
immediately afterward. Maybe we were hoping it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, the Walker respondents were ready to
talk and that's when our son made his pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   Of the male heads of household who are parents of two daughters,
ages 20 and 16, 100 percent said he fervently hopes that the
president knows that his stature has shrunk to the size of a
thimble in his daughter Chelsea's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16-year-old female respondents, 100 percent said Clinton
shouldn't leave office. ``They knew what he was like when they
elected him.'' Of his admitted ``inappropriate'' behavior: ``That
was stupid on his part, like he wasn't gonna get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The more politically seasoned 20-year-old female responded very
strongly that the president should not leave office but her remarks
were not completely supportive, either. A summer employee at a
local restaurant, she has conversations with many members of the
public. She spoke of one agitated mother who said she did not want
her 9-year-old child to hear anymore about ``that dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just embarrassing,'' the 20-year-old said, probably
putting her finger on the reason most Americans seem to want the
whole mess to just go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing to watch the president talk about that on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the female heads of household who live at our address, 100
percent feels relieved that her son knows that you're not only
supposed to feel remorse, you are supposed to express it.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to believe that if the president's mom were alive, she
would have throttled him.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes Hillary's mom does.
</P>
<P>
   She knows if Monica were her daughter, the young woman would
have been throttled years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She's troubled because a 21-year-old girl became involved in a
relationship with a 50-year-old married man. She worries about that
girl's seeming lack of self-worth. She's angry because the
50-year-old man should have had the maturity and the sense to help
the girl or get someone else to help her.
</P>
<P>
   She's very angry, not just because he is the president, but
because the ``take it if it's there for the taking'' attitude has
been accepted and encouraged for generations.
</P>
<P>
   And she's angrier still because even after the Bill/Monica
whirlpool has fizzled, that attitude will go on.

 &HT;    Making a Long Story Short
 &HT;    with three sidebars
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For every bleary-eyed student who tried to hack through the
cluttered verbiage of Othello with the goal of finishing a term
paper before sunrise, this anniversary is for you.
</P>
<P>
   Your buddy Cliffs Notes has turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, it's the big 4-0 for those handy study guides with
the black-striped covers in a shade of yellow normally reserved for
signs that read ``BIOHAZARD.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln, Neb., company that publishes the pamphlets is
celebrating the milestone in a big way. High school and college
students returning to campus this fall will spot Cliffs commercials
on TV and hear radio ads promoting such offers as free music CDs in
return for buying a quantity of the study guides. And there's a new
Web site that touts real-life stories of how Cliffs saved the day
(www.cliffs.com).
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty to celebrate: Besides selling as many as 5
million copies of the pamphlets annually, along with other test
preparation aids, Cliffs Notes has become part of the American
lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   On TV's Friends, when the rather dense Joey doesn't get the
point of something obvious, his exasperated buddy Chandler
admonishes him, ``Read the Cliffs Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the staff of The Harvard Lampoon used the familiar
Cliffs format _ biography of author, chapter-by-chapter plot
summaries, character lists and sample essay questions _ to Guide
began as Shakespeare digest parody the novels of Bret Easton Ellis,
Jay McInerney and Tama Janowitz. The publisher wasn't amused, but
the point was made: Cliffs is a household name.
</P>
<P>
   How did the company get to the head of its class? Here's the
Cliffs Notes version of the Cliffs Notes' story:
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, at the suggestion of a friend in Canada who wrote study
guides, book salesman Cliff Hillegass (yes, there really is a Cliff
behind Cliffs), decided to publish his own package of pamphlets
condensing Shakespeare's major works. Writing the texts in his
spare time and operating from the basement of his home in Lincoln,
Neb., he borrowed $4,000 to print 32,000 copies. Within a year, he
sold them all.
</P>
<P>
   Despite battling dozens of competitors and copy cat study guides
through the years, Cliffs has maintained its No. 1 status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it for a long time and we're extremely good at what
we do,'' said company president Robert Kovolik.

 &HT;    Did you ignore Bonnie, or are you one of them?
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm thankful for Bonnie, the hurricane that doesn't affect me,
me, me anymore, not just because she came and went so
unceremoniously. Bonnie, as it turns out, had a big effect on my
life.
</P>
<P>
   She gave me the thinking time to advance a new theory I have
about human behavior in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   You see, folks, there are two kinds of people driving around out
there on I-95. You can call them Type A's and Type B's if you want.
But here on the coast, where six months out of the year the world
revolves around coordinates and categorized wind speeds, I suggest
we break life into something a little more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Like people who have candles, D batteries, bottled water and
Ravioli in their cupboards, and people who do not.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to hurricane unpreparedness, I guess you could
call me a Category 5. I used to have all the stuff. The sterno. The
stick matches. The jugs of purified water. Then one day my kid had
some friends over, and I found myself standing at the kitchen sink
pouring all the Zephyrhills down the drain so we could take the
Exacto knife and turn the jugs into giant sand shovels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool, Mom. Thanks,'' the 7-year-old said, which was nice to
hear, but you can't exactly quench your post-storm thirst with a
kid's compliment, can you?
</P>
<P>
   Please understand, though, I am not a complete loser. After all,
I have a child to think of. And even though I ate all the Dinty
Moore's Beef Stew one night after too many beers at the baseball
game, I know exactly where all seven of our flashlights are.
</P>
<P>
   They're right there where I last saw them, in the treehouse,
adrift in brown rain water.
</P>
<P>
   If you are like me, which at least half of you must be _
otherwise all those hurricane supplies I saw at the grocery store
last night would have been gone by now _ you might be surprised to
know there are some people out there who are not like us.
</P>
<P>
   I guess you could call them the other half.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people who have a cabinet set aside for storm
supplies and, if I were a betting woman, I'd say five bucks
everything is labeled, maybe even with glow-in-the-dark tape. I
suspect my neighbor falls into this category. In the preparedness
division, she is probably, no, definitely, a Category 1.
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful, caring woman who is raising a nice playmate
for my son. But she has this buying habit that shocks me.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that she is shopping for school clothes in June and
let's say she sees something on sale, a bargain. Well, she buys it
and stashes it away for a Christmas present.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that I live next to a woman who could handle
a hurricane and Christmas without a trip to the store.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, wait until that nutty pilot flies through
the eye and comes out crying before I think, `Hmm, maybe that storm
is going to come this way.' I, on the other hand, crave disaster,
which probably explains my votes for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So, call me a Type A. Call me a procrastinator. Call me a big,
lazy drama queen. Just don't call me this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That's the night I'm having the neighbors over for a candlelight
Ravioli dinner.

 &HT;    Teacher's pet peeve
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because Cliff Hillegass himself writes on the inside cover
of every pamphlet that ``a thorough appreciation of literature
allows no short cuts'' doesn't mean students don't dodge Moby Dick
and run straight for the Cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Or that teachers don't know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``English teachers love to hate Cliffs Notes,'' said Carol Jago,
who served on the National Council of Teachers of English's
literature commission. A high school English teacher for 25 years
in Santa Monica, Calif., Jago says the ``truth of it is, they are
good study aids.''
</P>
<P>
   Jago relied on Cliffs to help her tackle Tom Jones when she
attended St. Louis University. She had read only about 150 pages of
the book and had a paper due the next day. ``I tell the students
this story all the time to show that even good students get into a
bind,'' she said. ``I would have to be a moron to think that (all)
of my students get through the books I assign.''
</P>
<P>
   Jago believes Cliffs Notes should be used as ``scaffolding'' for
those reading the classics. In California, for example, where
English is a second language for large numbers of students, Cliffs
can be crucial for navigating tougher texts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those who try to skate by on Cliffs Notes
alone. Some go as far as quoting patches of the pamplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same student profile as always, the lazy students who
can't be bothered,'' Jago said. ``Let's face it, a rigorous high
school curriculum is hard work and high school students do not like
hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Rinear, a retired English teacher who taught at Martin
County High School in Stuart for 27 years, said she had students
try to pull the same trick on her, too. She thinks that high school
is no place for Cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a positive place for college students, but for high
school, you want to teach them critiquing skills that go beyond
more than just using the resources that are available,'' Rinear
said. ``I tried to steer my students away from them and get them to
read as great a variety as possible so that they could form an
opinion about a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Standley, chairman of Florida State University's English
department, said students need to be aware of a couple other
factors. Some texts include inaccuracies, such as dates of works
and plot summaries _ although Standley couldn't cite any
specifically. He also said that they might give readers a false
sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always warn students not to assume that since they've read a
summary that they've read the novel, because there will be varying
interpretations,'' Standley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he holds his nose up at the product. About
four years ago Cliffs asked him to pen an analysis of James
Baldwin's Go Tell it on the Mountain for the tidy sum of $1,400.
Standley seriously considered the offer but declined because he had
a full plate of other literary obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do write one, you do it for the money,'' he said. ``Who
knows? I might do it if I get desperate for the money.''

 &HT;    Where's the apostrophe?
 &HT;    Sidebar to CLIFFNOTES-MAIN
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does it bug you that that there is no apostrophe in Cliffs Notes
even though there should be? Well, for a long time there was, but
the possessive punctuation was later dropped. What's the story
behind the change? ``No particular reason,'' was Notes founder
Cliff Hillegass' brief explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 Cliffs Notes

 &HT;    The odyssey of Cliff Hillegass, in brief
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the millions of copies of pamphlets with his name on them
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Hillegass, 81, is awed by the impact his Cliffs Notes
study aids have had on education and American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use his words, he is very humbled,'' said Robert Covolik,
the president of Cliffs Notes in Lincoln, Neb., and a longtime
friend of Hillegass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always classified Cliff as a people person,'' Covolik
said. ``He has a great deal of warmth.'' (He does not, however,
give interviews. ``He's retired here in Lincoln and he hasn't done
an interview in about three years,'' said one company spokesman.)
</P>
<P>
   Born in rural Nebraska, Hillegass grew up with a love of
literature, especially after an operation when he was 7 left him
bedridden for two months. The only thing he could do was read, so
he devoured book after book.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, he had a milk route, two paper routes and also sold
magazines. By 14, he saved a sizable sum of money, but lost it all
when the local bank closed during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuilt the sum by the time he went to Midland College in
1934. He graduated in 1937 and after attending graduate school at
the University of Nebraska _ where he studied physics and geology _
he took a sales job at the Nebraska Book Company.
</P>
<P>
   His career was interrupted when he served in the Army Air Corps
during World War II. When he returned to his job, he got to know
most of the country's college bookstore managers during sales
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cole, a friend who owned the largest bookstore chain in
Canada and developed and sold a line of study guides called Coles
Notes, encouraged Hillegass to produce a similar line in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nebraska Book Company declined to publish the study
guides, Hillegass got approval to work on the line in his spare
time. Working out of his basement and borrowing money to start the
venture, he printed 32,000 copies of 16 Major Plays of Shakespeare.
They sold out within a year.
</P>
<P>
   By 1961, he sold 129,000 copies and sales doubled each of the
next four years. Sales have continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Hillegass knows what some kids are up to when they use his
product. Not everyone reads the classics and Cliffs. His hope, he
says, is that if they read the notes instead of the novel now, one
day they will go back to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes,'' Hillegass told the Arizona Republic
in 1994. Students ``get cornered on time, or just plain don't like
to read.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: Has there ever been a first lady who filed for
divorce while her husband was in office?
</P>
<P>
   Q: A member of Congress can get a pension after five years of
service. What is the amount of that pension? If it's a range, what
is the minimum and maximum? And when can they start collecting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lawmakers are vested after five years and can begin
collecting upon retirement from the government if at least age 50,
said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va.
The fewer the years of service, the later members have to wait;
those with five years must wait until 62. They're entitled to 2.5
percent of their salaries per year of service, capped at 80 percent
of the final year's pay, with subsequent cost-of-living increases
(current salaries for members of Congress are $133,600 a year).
</P>
<P>
   The pension plan for members of Congress is part of the civil
service retirement system, but the formula used for computing their
benefits is more generous than the one rank-and-file federal
employees normally would have, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If fugitive bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph were hiding
within the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina, could he be
apprehended? From what I understand, law enforcement officers
cannot go in there.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so. There's a federal warrant out for Rudolph's arrest.
If he's hiding anywhere in the United States, that warrant gives
the FBI jurisdiction. If Rudolph is hiding on an Indian reservation
_ or if someone there is harboring him _ the FBI still has the
primary investigative jurisdiction, said agency spokeswoman
Celestine Armstead, and agents would be allowed to go on the
property ``and do whatever is necessary'' to apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Everyone's talking about Kenneth Starr's investigation
costing the taxpayers $40 million. How much would that amount to,
per person, if it were divided among everyone living in the United
States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Based on the Census Bureau's projection of a resident
population of the United States of 270.4 million, each of us would
cough up just under 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time I ask my bank for Susan B. Anthony dollar coins,
I'm told that there are very few left, or none at all. Is the
government trying to take them out of circulation? Also, I've never
seen any that were not minted in 1979 or 1980. Were these the only
two years they were made?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was minted for circulation
only in '79 and '80, said Michael White of the U.S. Mint; a small
number was minted in '81, but only for uncirculated sets.
</P>
<P>
   The probable reason your bank doesn't have the coins is that
there's so little customer demand for them, White said. But a bank
can order them from the Mint if it chooses. As of July 31, 83.3
million of the Anthony coins were still in the Mint's inventory and
available to banks.
</P>
<P>
   The government is not trying to take them out of circulation,
and in fact the Mint would like to see all of them in the
possession of the public in the next year or two. If everything
goes according to plan, the stock of Anthony coins should be
depleted by the time a new dollar coin becomes available in 2000,
White said.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, stamp vending machines in many post offices return
the Anthony dollars in change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm very annoyed at Sen. Orrin Hatch because of his negative
comments about President Clinton, and I want to tell him so. How
can I write him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address for the lawmaker from Utah: Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,
Russell Senate Office Building, 131, 1st and C streets NE,
Washington, DC 20510.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the Republican or Whig party member who voted against
impeaching Andrew Johnson, the Democratic vice president who became
president when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved the Tenure of Office Act of March 2, 1867,
which prohibited the president from removing without Senate
approval any presidential appointee who had been confirmed by the
Senate. On Aug. 12, 1867, in defiance of this act, Johnson
dismissed a Cabinet officer, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   That move led to a showdown between the president and Congress,
and on Feb. 24, 1868, the House voted 126-47 to impeach Johnson.
His fate then was in the hands of the Senate, which could remove
him from office with a two-thirds vote. On March 13, Johnson's
trial began in the Senate chambers, with Chief Justice Salmon Chase
presiding. Two months later, the Senate voted 35-19 for the
impeachment articles, one vote short of the necessary number needed
for conviction. Although Johnson's radical Republican opponents
controlled the Senate, seven believed that the charges didn't
warrant his removal and voted against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive not-guilty vote that acquitted Johnson belonged to
freshman Sen. Edmund G. Ross (R-Kan.), and the proceedings
terminated May 26.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Billy Mayfair won the Buick Classic golf tournament
recently, he dedicated his victory to the wife of Stuart Appleby.
What happened to her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Renay Appleby, 25, was killed July 23 in a freak accident in
London. A cab driver mistakenly thought he was in reverse, and
instead lunged forward into her, crushing her between his car and
another car.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Barney Kessel was one of the greatest jazz guitarists of the
'50s and early '60s. I know he continued to record into the '80s,
and a lot of his albums are now being rereleased on CDs. The last
interview of his that I saw was in 1991. Is he still alive and
playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kessel, 74, is still living, but was sidelined by a stroke
several years ago. Along with jazz legends James Moody, Billy May
and Johnny Best, he was honored in May by a benefit, ``Four
Generations of Jazz,'' in San Diego, Kessel's home since 1989.
Proceeds from the concert went to the emergency relief fund of the
Musicians Association of San Diego County. Kessel, who established
his reputation working with Billie Holliday, Charlie Parker, Oscar
Peterson and other jazz greats, was awarded an honorary doctorate
in 1996 from the University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard Myanmar, which used to be called Burma,
pronounced in many different ways on the local news. What is
correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each ``a'' should be pronounced like the a in father; the
emphasis is on ``mar.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Director Steven Spielberg seems to be a convenient target for
criticism, most recently because he didn't include any sight or
mention of African-Americans in ``Saving Private Ryan.'' As I
recall, Spielberg and his company were sued for copyright
infringement in a case involving the film ``Amistad.'' What is the
status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Barbara Chase-Riboud, the author who accused Spielberg and
his production company, DreamWorks SKG, of ``brazenly'' stealing
from her work to make ``Amistad,'' dropped her plagiarism suit
against the company in February. Chase-Riboud is the author of such
novels as ``Echo of Lions'' and ``Sally Hemings.'' Her $10 million
copyright infringement lawsuit against DreamWorks said the company
had taken material from ``Echo of Lions'' for ``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks lawyers contended that Chase-Riboud had ``lifted
entire passages'' and ``directly taken'' from a book by William
Owens about the Amistad uprising, a true-life revolt in 1839 of
Africans on a slave ship in Cuban waters.
</P>
<P>
   In December, The New York Times published an article saying
Chase-Riboud's 1986 novel ``Valide: A Novel of the Harem''
contained entire passages that appeared in a scholarly book
published 50 years earlier. Chase-Riboud admitted that she had used
the material from the earlier book without attribution, but
asserted she had done nothing wrong. She said DreamWorks was
conducting a ``smear campaign'' against her.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Chase-Riboud's suit was dropped, this statement
attributed to her was released by DreamWorks: ``After my lawyers
had a chance to review DreamWorks' files and other documents and
evidence, my lawyers and I concluded that neither Steven Spielberg
nor DreamWorks did anything improper, and I instructed my lawyers
to conclude this matter in a timely and amicable fashion.''

</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen frequent references to Jane's Intelligence Review
in the news lately in connection with the bombings in Africa and
retaliatory U.S. attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan. Where is this
review based? What is the format? How can I obtain it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The review is one of the enterprises of Jane's Information
Group Ltd., based on Coulsdon, England. It's a monthly magazine
providing what a Jane's spokesman called ``a global view on
security, terrorism and geopolitics'' and deals with worldwide
issues including the recent U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and
subsequent U.S. cruise missile attacks.

various Jane's magazines, products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton resigns, would he still be eligible for
a pension?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. He would get $151,000 a year, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. The only way Clinton would lose the
pension would be if he is impeached or convicted under
constitutional procedures, Sepp added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been told that when Bill Clinton was running for
Congress in the 1970s, he said something to the effect that if
President Richard Nixon had lied to the government, he should
resign. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1974, Clinton, a junior faculty member at the University
of Arkansas law school and Democratic nominee to represent
Arkansas' Third Congressional District, called for Nixon's
resignation with this statement: ``There's not any point in putting
the country through an impeachment since he (Nixon) isn't making
any pretense of innocence now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had surrendered the famous ``smoking gun'' tape in which
he virtually confessed to obstructing justice in the Watergate
affair, which is what Clinton meant by ``now.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If China's Yangtze is the third-longest in the world. What
are first and second?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Nile, in Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan and Egypt, is No. 1 at
4,145 miles; the Amazon, in Peru and Brazil, is No. 2 at 4,007
miles. The Yangtze-Kiang is 3,915 miles long. For the record, these
are the other rivers and combined rivers making the world's top 10
longest, with lengths in miles: Mississippi-Missouri-Red Rock,
3,710; Yenisey-Angara-Selenga, in Mongolia and Russia, 3,442; Huang
Ho (Yellow River), China, 3,395; Ob'-Irtysh, Mongolia, Kazakhstan
and Russia, 3,362; Zaire (or Congo), Zaire, 2,920; Lena-Kirenga,
Russia, 2,734; Mekong, Tibet, China, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and
Vietnam, 2,703.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a dog show in which it was stated that in Britain,
German shepherds are known as ``Alsatians.'' My husband said he had
heard that people in Britain changed the name of the breed as a
result of World War II. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The names indeed are different on either side of the
Atlantic. The Encyclopedia of American Dogs lists the breed under
the name German shepherd, with the subtitle Alsatian. It then goes
on to say the breed is ``in the English-speaking world often
incorrectly called the Alsatian.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillian Cooper of the British Consulate in Atlanta said she
had never heard the breed called German shepherd until she moved to
the United States. She cited Concise Oxford Dictionary as defining
Alsatian, in reference to dogs, as ``a large breed used as a guard
dog,'' with the name traced to Alsace, a region of eastern France.
The use of the word Alsatian instead of German shepherd ``has
nothing to do with the German people or World War II,'' she added.
``The dogs of that breed have always been called Alsatians in the
United Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Bo Gritz, leader of that volunteer search
for Eric Rudolph in the mountains of western North Carolina, once
ran for president. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: James G. ``Bo'' Gritz, highly decorated Special Forces
veteran and former Green Beret lieutenant colonel, ran as a
Populist Party candidate for president in 1992. He was on the
ballot in 18 states and was a write-in candidate in 24 others,
either as a candidate of the Populists or the America First
Coalition. His slogan: ``God, Guns and Gritz.'' According to
statistics from the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, he received 106,911 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, he was a vice presidential candidate on the
Populist Party ticket, but he withdrew when the Populists nominated
former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and Nazi sympathizer David Duke as
presidential candidate. Also in 1988, Gritz sought California's
American Independent Party nomination for president, receiving
5,401 votes statewide. And in that same year he unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination for a Nevada seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Roger Maris hit his 61 home runs in 1961, what was his
batting average and how many RBIs did he have that year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Batting average, .269; runs batted in, 141.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton were to resign with more than half of
his second term remaining, and Al Gore became president, would Gore
be eligible to serve two more full terms of his own, or only one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution (1951), which
prohibits any person from being elected president more than two
times, also addresses this situation. It says: ``. . . no person
who has acted as president for more than two years of a term to
which some other person was elected president shall be elected to
the office of the president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read months ago that people can buy pieces of coal salvaged
from the wreckage of the Titanic. How can we do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact RMS Titanic, which describes itself as ``the only
company legally entitled to recover objects from the Titanic,'' at
1-800-274-5568 or at www.titanic-online.com if you have Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the quarter-size pieces of coal is $14.99, plus
shipping and handling, with a limit of two per order. The coal is
sealed in a plastic bag and has a certificate of origin, according
to the company. It's packaged in a box similar to what earrings
come in, with the name Titanic on the cover, a company spokeswoman
said. Other Titanic-related memorabilia, such as replicas of cups
and jewely discovered at the wreck site, also are available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``Saving Private Ryan'' based on a true story? Were there
really four soldier brothers in the war? I have a bet riding on
this. I say it's true, but I was told that it's Hollywood fiction.
</P>
<P>
   A: There was no Ryan family. But perhaps the closest thing to
the movie's account is the case of the Niland family, as documented
by author Stephen Ambrose, an expert on World War II. Ambrose wrote
about Pvt. Fritz Niland of Tonawanda, N.Y. Two of Niland's brothers
were killed in the D-Day invasion, and a third was killed in Burma.
Their mother received three telegrams from the War Department
within a short time frame notifying her of her sons' deaths. Her
fourth son, fighting in France, was snatched out of the front line
by the Army and was sent home.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of several members of one family being killed in
combat was a real issue during World War II. The most famous
example of losses to one family was that of the five Sullivan
brothers, who were serving aboard the same Navy vessel and died in
a single engagement. A movie about them was released during World
War II and celebrated the loss as heroic. Many Americans were
appalled that such a thing had been allowed to happen, and the
government stepped up efforts to avoid such situations in the
future. That provided the basic inspiration for ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw a TV program about a giant dam being built on
the Yangtze River in China. Was it damaged by the floods this
summer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The worst flooding is along the 1,000-plus-mile stretch of
the Yangtze downriver from the famous Three Gorges landmark. The
dam, scheduled to be completed in 2003, is said to be the biggest
and most technologically challenging in the world. The devastation
downriver occurred because crude earthen dikes, devised thousands
of years ago, failed to stem the surging waters of the world's
third-largest river. Entire counties were submerged and thousands
of homes swept away, with an enormous loss of lives, but the $20
billion dam project wasn't seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm trying to help someone who wants to visit the gravesite
of a relative, a World War I veteran buried at Arlington National
Cemetery. Is there a way to locate a particular grave? What are the
hours when the cemetery is open?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just inside the cemetery gates, on Memorial Drive and just
across the Memorial Bridge from Washington, you'll find the Visitor
Center. Free maps are available, and the staff can provide
information about the location of specific gravesites. Cemetery
hours: 8 a.m.-7 p.m. April 1-Sept. 30; 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Oct. 1-March
31.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton resigns or is impeached, and Vice
President Al Gore succeeds to the presidency, who becomes the new
vice president?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no automatic person or office in that situation. No
provision was made in the original Constitution to fill vacancies
in the office of vice president. But in 1965, Congress passed the
25th Amendment, part of which established a mechanism for replacing
departed vice presidents, not by succession but by presidential
appointment and congressional confirmation. The amendment was
ratified by the states and became part of the Constitution in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   So in your scenario, Gore would nominate someone to fill his
previous office after he became president, and the nominee would
take office when confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned a security system for automobiles
called LoJack. It helps police find stolen vehicles. Where can I
get more information about LoJack?
</P>
<P>
   A: LoJack is available through many auto dealerships. If you
have Internet access, the LoJack site _ www.lojack.com _ lets you
enter your state and type of vehicle, and then it will list
appropriate dealers. If you don't have Internet access, write
LoJack, 333 Elm St., Dedham, MA 02026, or call 781-326-4700.
</P>
<P>
   LoJack transmitters cost about $595. The device, about the size
of a deck of cars, is placed somewhere in the vehicle. If the
vehicle is reported stolen, it can be tracked by police using
high-tech tracking equipment. The company reports about a 90
percent recovery rate nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there ever been a first lady who filed for divorce while
her husband was in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: No ``first couple'' has been divorced while the husband was
president.

 &HT;    Banks facing difficult times
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- After three years of record profits, Texas banks may
be headed for some turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were still good for the state's 855 banks in the first
quarter 1998, according to the latest figures from Austin-based
bank research company Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But banks' net interest margins _ the difference between what
banks charge for loans and what they pay for deposits _ took a
nosedive during the quarter, according to Sheshunoff.
</P>
<P>
   Banks typically derive most of their profits from two sources,
fee income and interest income. The declining interest income could
be a harbinger for lower profits, said Bob Colvin, Sheshunoff's
managing director of community banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indication of weakness may point to more difficult times
ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The net interest margin at Texas banks dropped 40 basis points,
from 4.43 percent to 4.03 percent, in the first quarter from the
fourth quarter 1997, according to Sheshunoff.
</P>
<P>
   The margin is the lowest in the last five years, Colvin said. It
continues a steady quarterly decline since the second quarter of
1997, when Texas banks reported their third straight record
earnings at $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net interest margin has declined since,'' Colvin said.
``While it was steady most of last year in the 4.40 percent to 4.50
percent range, it looks as if we have moved to another range.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 basis point decline was even greater than the decline of
33 basis points for all banks in the nation in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in interest spreads is indicative of banks'
increasing reliance on fees for everything from checking accounts
to use of tellers.
</P>
<P>
   But with more competition, some doubt whether banks can continue
to raise fees to offset the declines in interest income.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more competition, and shrinking margins, can these fees
continue to rise at a pace to offset any future declines in the net
interest margin?'' Colvin asked. ``Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Banking Commissioner Catherine Ghiglieri agreed that banks
are ``under a lot of pressure to reduce fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers also have a ``sense of urgency trying to book loans and
they are squeezing their margins down to almost nothing,''
Ghiglieri said. ``They are not leaving any room for any costs they
may incur in the future in terms of collection or any kind of cost
of care. So it is a problem.''
</P>

   As mergers and acquisitions give larger banks in Texas a larger
share of the market, pricing policies will have a depressing effect
on the rest of on the rest of the banking industry, said Steve
Scurlock, senior vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing from our community banks that some of the
larger banks are doing some fairly aggressive pricing on some
lending,'' Scurlock said. ``I guess they feel like they can make up
for a loss in spread, or net interest margin, by volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Rates on loans and long term investments rates have inched
downward as deposit rates stayed steady, said Hartland Bank
Chairman David Hartman, partly the result of heightened competition
between banks. ``It's basically the state of the monetary market
and increased competition,'' said Hartman. ``Banking is always most
profitable when there is a steep yield curve, and short term rates
are low and long term rates are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into the exact opposite situation right now.''

<P>
   Q: I've seen frequent references to Jane's Intelligence Review
in the news lately in connection with the bombings in Africa and
retaliatory U.S. attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan. Where is this
review based? What is the format? How can I obtain it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The review is one of the enterprises of Jane's Information
Group Ltd., based on Coulsdon, England. It's a monthly magazine
providing what a Jane's spokesman called ``a global view on
security, terrorism and geopolitics'' and deals with worldwide
issues including the recent U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and
subsequent U.S. cruise missile attacks.

</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton resigns, would he still be eligible for
a pension?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. He would get $151,000 a year, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. The only way Clinton would lose the
pension would be if he is impeached or convicted under
constitutional procedures, Sepp added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been told that when Bill Clinton was running for
Congress in the 1970s, he said something to the effect that if
President Richard Nixon had lied to the government, he should
resign. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1974, Clinton, a junior faculty member at the University
of Arkansas law school and Democratic nominee to represent
Arkansas' Third Congressional District, called for Nixon's
resignation with this statement: ``There's not any point in putting
the country through an impeachment since he (Nixon) isn't making
any pretense of innocence now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had surrendered the famous ``smoking gun'' tape in which
he virtually confessed to obstructing justice in the Watergate
affair, which is what Clinton meant by ``now.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If China's Yangtze is the third-longest in the world. What
are first and second?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Nile, in Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan and Egypt, is No. 1 at
4,145 miles; the Amazon, in Peru and Brazil, is No. 2 at 4,007
miles. The Yangtze-Kiang is 3,915 miles long. For the record, these
are the other rivers and combined rivers making the world's top 10
longest, with lengths in miles: Mississippi-Missouri-Red Rock,
3,710; Yenisey-Angara-Selenga, in Mongolia and Russia, 3,442; Huang
Ho (Yellow River), China, 3,395; Ob'-Irtysh, Mongolia, Kazakhstan
and Russia, 3,362; Zaire (or Congo), Zaire, 2,920; Lena-Kirenga,
Russia, 2,734; Mekong, Tibet, China, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and
Vietnam, 2,703.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a dog show in which it was stated that in Britain,
German shepherds are known as ``Alsatians.'' My husband said he had
heard that people in Britain changed the name of the breed as a
result of World War II. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The names indeed are different on either side of the
Atlantic. The Encyclopedia of American Dogs lists the breed under
the name German shepherd, with the subtitle Alsatian. It then goes
on to say the breed is ``in the English-speaking world often
incorrectly called the Alsatian.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillian Cooper of the British Consulate in Atlanta said she
had never heard the breed called German shepherd until she moved to
the United States. She cited Concise Oxford Dictionary as defining
Alsatian, in reference to dogs, as ``a large breed used as a guard
dog,'' with the name traced to Alsace, a region of eastern France.
The use of the word Alsatian instead of German shepherd ``has
nothing to do with the German people or World War II,'' she added.
``The dogs of that breed have always been called Alsatians in the
United Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Bo Gritz, leader of that volunteer search
for Eric Rudolph in the mountains of western North Carolina, once
ran for president. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: James G. ``Bo'' Gritz, highly decorated Special Forces
veteran and former Green Beret lieutenant colonel, ran as a
Populist Party candidate for president in 1992. He was on the
ballot in 18 states and was a write-in candidate in 24 others,
either as a candidate of the Populists or the America First
Coalition. His slogan: ``God, Guns and Gritz.'' According to
statistics from the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, he received 106,911 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, he was a vice presidential candidate on the
Populist Party ticket, but he withdrew when the Populists nominated
former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and Nazi sympathizer David Duke as
presidential candidate. Also in 1988, Gritz sought California's
American Independent Party nomination for president, receiving
5,401 votes statewide. And in that same year he unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination for a Nevada seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Roger Maris hit his 61 home runs in 1961, what was his
batting average and how many RBIs did he have that year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Batting average, .269; runs batted in, 141.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton were to resign with more than half of
his second term remaining, and Al Gore became president, would Gore
be eligible to serve two more full terms of his own, or only one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution (1951), which
prohibits any person from being elected president more than two
times, also addresses this situation. It says: ``. . . no person
who has acted as president for more than two years of a term to
which some other person was elected president shall be elected to
the office of the president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read months ago that people can buy pieces of coal salvaged
from the wreckage of the Titanic. How can we do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact RMS Titanic, which describes itself as ``the only
company legally entitled to recover objects from the Titanic,'' at
1-800-274-5568 or at www.titanic-online.com if you have Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the quarter-size pieces of coal is $14.99, plus
shipping and handling, with a limit of two per order. The coal is
sealed in a plastic bag and has a certificate of origin, according
to the company. It's packaged in a box similar to what earrings
come in, with the name Titanic on the cover, a company spokeswoman
said. Other Titanic-related memorabilia, such as replicas of cups
and jewely discovered at the wreck site, also are available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``Saving Private Ryan'' based on a true story? Were there
really four soldier brothers in the war? I have a bet riding on
this. I say it's true, but I was told that it's Hollywood fiction.
</P>
<P>
   A: There was no Ryan family. But perhaps the closest thing to
the movie's account is the case of the Niland family, as documented
by author Stephen Ambrose, an expert on World War II. Ambrose wrote
about Pvt. Fritz Niland of Tonawanda, N.Y. Two of Niland's brothers
were killed in the D-Day invasion, and a third was killed in Burma.
Their mother received three telegrams from the War Department
within a short time frame notifying her of her sons' deaths. Her
fourth son, fighting in France, was snatched out of the front line
by the Army and was sent home.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of several members of one family being killed in
combat was a real issue during World War II. The most famous
example of losses to one family was that of the five Sullivan
brothers, who were serving aboard the same Navy vessel and died in
a single engagement. A movie about them was released during World
War II and celebrated the loss as heroic. Many Americans were
appalled that such a thing had been allowed to happen, and the
government stepped up efforts to avoid such situations in the
future. That provided the basic inspiration for ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw a TV program about a giant dam being built on
the Yangtze River in China. Was it damaged by the floods this
summer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The worst flooding is along the 1,000-plus-mile stretch of
the Yangtze downriver from the famous Three Gorges landmark. The
dam, scheduled to be completed in 2003, is said to be the biggest
and most technologically challenging in the world. The devastation
downriver occurred because crude earthen dikes, devised thousands
of years ago, failed to stem the surging waters of the world's
third-largest river. Entire counties were submerged and thousands
of homes swept away, with an enormous loss of lives, but the $20
billion dam project wasn't seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm trying to help someone who wants to visit the gravesite
of a relative, a World War I veteran buried at Arlington National
Cemetery. Is there a way to locate a particular grave? What are the
hours when the cemetery is open?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just inside the cemetery gates, on Memorial Drive and just
across the Memorial Bridge from Washington, you'll find the Visitor
Center. Free maps are available, and the staff can provide
information about the location of specific gravesites. Cemetery
hours: 8 a.m.-7 p.m. April 1-Sept. 30; 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Oct. 1-March
31.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton resigns or is impeached, and Vice
President Al Gore succeeds to the presidency, who becomes the new
vice president?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no automatic person or office in that situation. No
provision was made in the original Constitution to fill vacancies
in the office of vice president. But in 1965, Congress passed the
25th Amendment, part of which established a mechanism for replacing
departed vice presidents, not by succession but by presidential
appointment and congressional confirmation. The amendment was
ratified by the states and became part of the Constitution in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   So in your scenario, Gore would nominate someone to fill his
previous office after he became president, and the nominee would
take office when confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned a security system for automobiles
called LoJack. It helps police find stolen vehicles. Where can I
get more information about LoJack?
</P>
<P>
   A: LoJack is available through many auto dealerships. If you
have Internet access, the LoJack site _ www.lojack.com _ lets you
enter your state and type of vehicle, and then it will list
appropriate dealers. If you don't have Internet access, write
LoJack, 333 Elm St., Dedham, MA 02026, or call 781-326-4700.
</P>
<P>
   LoJack transmitters cost about $595. The device, about the size
of a deck of cars, is placed somewhere in the vehicle. If the
vehicle is reported stolen, it can be tracked by police using
high-tech tracking equipment. The company reports about a 90
percent recovery rate nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there ever been a first lady who filed for divorce while
her husband was in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: No ``first couple'' has been divorced while the husband was
president.

Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: Has there ever been a first lady who filed for
divorce while her husband was in office?
</P>
<P>
   Q: A member of Congress can get a pension after five years of
service. What is the amount of that pension? If it's a range, what
is the minimum and maximum? And when can they start collecting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lawmakers are vested after five years and can begin
collecting upon retirement from the government if at least age 50,
said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va.
The fewer the years of service, the later members have to wait;
those with five years must wait until 62. They're entitled to 2.5
percent of their salaries per year of service, capped at 80 percent
of the final year's pay, with subsequent cost-of-living increases
(current salaries for members of Congress are $133,600 a year).
</P>
<P>
   The pension plan for members of Congress is part of the civil
service retirement system, but the formula used for computing their
benefits is more generous than the one rank-and-file federal
employees normally would have, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If fugitive bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph were hiding
within the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina, could he be
apprehended? From what I understand, law enforcement officers
cannot go in there.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so. There's a federal warrant out for Rudolph's arrest.
If he's hiding anywhere in the United States, that warrant gives
the FBI jurisdiction. If Rudolph is hiding on an Indian reservation
_ or if someone there is harboring him _ the FBI still has the
primary investigative jurisdiction, said agency spokeswoman
Celestine Armstead, and agents would be allowed to go on the
property ``and do whatever is necessary'' to apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Everyone's talking about Kenneth Starr's investigation
costing the taxpayers $40 million. How much would that amount to,
per person, if it were divided among everyone living in the United
States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Based on the Census Bureau's projection of a resident
population of the United States of 270.4 million, each of us would
cough up just under 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time I ask my bank for Susan B. Anthony dollar coins,
I'm told that there are very few left, or none at all. Is the
government trying to take them out of circulation? Also, I've never
seen any that were not minted in 1979 or 1980. Were these the only
two years they were made?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was minted for circulation
only in '79 and '80, said Michael White of the U.S. Mint; a small
number was minted in '81, but only for uncirculated sets.
</P>
<P>
   The probable reason your bank doesn't have the coins is that
there's so little customer demand for them, White said. But a bank
can order them from the Mint if it chooses. As of July 31, 83.3
million of the Anthony coins were still in the Mint's inventory and
available to banks.
</P>
<P>
   The government is not trying to take them out of circulation,
and in fact the Mint would like to see all of them in the
possession of the public in the next year or two. If everything
goes according to plan, the stock of Anthony coins should be
depleted by the time a new dollar coin becomes available in 2000,
White said.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, stamp vending machines in many post offices return
the Anthony dollars in change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm very annoyed at Sen. Orrin Hatch because of his negative
comments about President Clinton, and I want to tell him so. How
can I write him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address for the lawmaker from Utah: Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,
Russell Senate Office Building, 131, 1st and C streets NE,
Washington, DC 20510.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the Republican or Whig party member who voted against
impeaching Andrew Johnson, the Democratic vice president who became
president when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved the Tenure of Office Act of March 2, 1867,
which prohibited the president from removing without Senate
approval any presidential appointee who had been confirmed by the
Senate. On Aug. 12, 1867, in defiance of this act, Johnson
dismissed a Cabinet officer, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   That move led to a showdown between the president and Congress,
and on Feb. 24, 1868, the House voted 126-47 to impeach Johnson.
His fate then was in the hands of the Senate, which could remove
him from office with a two-thirds vote. On March 13, Johnson's
trial began in the Senate chambers, with Chief Justice Salmon Chase
presiding. Two months later, the Senate voted 35-19 for the
impeachment articles, one vote short of the necessary number needed
for conviction. Although Johnson's radical Republican opponents
controlled the Senate, seven believed that the charges didn't
warrant his removal and voted against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive not-guilty vote that acquitted Johnson belonged to
freshman Sen. Edmund G. Ross (R-Kan.), and the proceedings
terminated May 26.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Billy Mayfair won the Buick Classic golf tournament
recently, he dedicated his victory to the wife of Stuart Appleby.
What happened to her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Renay Appleby, 25, was killed July 23 in a freak accident in
London. A cab driver mistakenly thought he was in reverse, and
instead lunged forward into her, crushing her between his car and
another car.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Barney Kessel was one of the greatest jazz guitarists of the
'50s and early '60s. I know he continued to record into the '80s,
and a lot of his albums are now being rereleased on CDs. The last
interview of his that I saw was in 1991. Is he still alive and
playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kessel, 74, is still living, but was sidelined by a stroke
several years ago. Along with jazz legends James Moody, Billy May
and Johnny Best, he was honored in May by a benefit, ``Four
Generations of Jazz,'' in San Diego, Kessel's home since 1989.
Proceeds from the concert went to the emergency relief fund of the
Musicians Association of San Diego County. Kessel, who established
his reputation working with Billie Holliday, Charlie Parker, Oscar
Peterson and other jazz greats, was awarded an honorary doctorate
in 1996 from the University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard Myanmar, which used to be called Burma,
pronounced in many different ways on the local news. What is
correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each ``a'' should be pronounced like the a in father; the
emphasis is on ``mar.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Director Steven Spielberg seems to be a convenient target for
criticism, most recently because he didn't include any sight or
mention of African-Americans in ``Saving Private Ryan.'' As I
recall, Spielberg and his company were sued for copyright
infringement in a case involving the film ``Amistad.'' What is the
status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Barbara Chase-Riboud, the author who accused Spielberg and
his production company, DreamWorks SKG, of ``brazenly'' stealing
from her work to make ``Amistad,'' dropped her plagiarism suit
against the company in February. Chase-Riboud is the author of such
novels as ``Echo of Lions'' and ``Sally Hemings.'' Her $10 million
copyright infringement lawsuit against DreamWorks said the company
had taken material from ``Echo of Lions'' for ``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks lawyers contended that Chase-Riboud had ``lifted
entire passages'' and ``directly taken'' from a book by William
Owens about the Amistad uprising, a true-life revolt in 1839 of
Africans on a slave ship in Cuban waters.
</P>
<P>
   In December, The New York Times published an article saying
Chase-Riboud's 1986 novel ``Valide: A Novel of the Harem''
contained entire passages that appeared in a scholarly book
published 50 years earlier. Chase-Riboud admitted that she had used
the material from the earlier book without attribution, but
asserted she had done nothing wrong. She said DreamWorks was
conducting a ``smear campaign'' against her.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Chase-Riboud's suit was dropped, this statement
attributed to her was released by DreamWorks: ``After my lawyers
had a chance to review DreamWorks' files and other documents and
evidence, my lawyers and I concluded that neither Steven Spielberg
nor DreamWorks did anything improper, and I instructed my lawyers
to conclude this matter in a timely and amicable fashion.''

<P>
   JOHNSON-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Since I challenged the right-wing
hate mongers a few years ago concerning their character
assassinations of all who disagree with them, I have been deemed by
some a ``bleeding-heart liberal.'' How did I get this way? When I
removed all the ``teaching of men'' as instructed by Jesus's
teaching, and revisited his words, it was obvious. (Johnson, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ GLEN ROSE, Texas _ Like turtles on a log, the
men sat side by side on park benches. We parked our motorcycles
next to an old pickup that had the tailgate down to show off a nice
load of watermelons. We nodded at the men and crossed the street
for a cup of coffee. When we returned, we decided to sit a while
with the men. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-COLUMN _ Of the 12-year-old boys polled in my most recent
survey of the American people who live at my house regarding
President Clinton's television revelations Monday, 100 percent of
respondents said, ``He didn't say he was sorry.'' The five of us
watched together, and no one had much comment immediately
afterward. Maybe we were hoping it was all over. (Walker, Longview
News-Journal) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Crime. If you conducted a poll,
most people would come out against it. But let's be honest. People
love to watch crime being fought because, gosh darn it, it's fun,
cheap entertainment.

``Simple Abundance: A Day Book of Comfort and Joy.'' The pages she
sent me are about the pleasure of old books. She wrote that she
sent different pages to different friends, but knowing my pleasure
in old books, she sacrificed and tore the pages right out. (Sibley,

   MINOR-COLUMN _ I'm thankful for Bonnie, the hurricane that
doesn't affect me, me, me anymore, not just because she came and
went so unceremoniously. Bonnie, as it turns out, had a big effect
on my life.
</P>
<P>
   She gave me the thinking time to advance a new theory I have

   BRIDGE-CLOSING _ LAREDO, Texas _ Business people on both sides
of the border waited nervously this week to hear whether the Laredo

Laredo in Mexico. When they will reopen depends on the Rio Grande.
Crossings at Del Rio and Colombia are also closed indefinitely.

Stephen King novel and directed by Brian De Palma before he went

assassinations of all who disagree with them, I have been deemed by

   1. TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT FACTORY One writer adds
a few jokes, another beefs up romance, still another polishes
dialogue - these days, a big budget movie travels an ever-growing
conveyor belt of specialists to production. By Jaime Wolf. From The
New York Times Magazine. 2,000 words. 2. THE UNSINKABLE CELINE DION
The ``Titanic'' soundtrack has sold 25 million copies. It's the
top-selling soundtrack of all time and the best-selling record of
the year. It's the fuel that has propelled Canadian singer Celine
Dion into a Streisand-like stratosphere, from which she will mount
a two-year world tour. In this interview she says the
emotion-drenched song ``My Heart Will Go On'' was recorded in just
one take. By Steve Morse. BPI. 1,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
'CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH' CATCHES ON MTV has found a hit in
``Celebrity Deathmatch.'' Using clay figures, it matches
celebrities on screen in combat. The animated half-hour shows drop
news makers into a wrestling ring, where they can pulverize each
other. (Hillary Rodham Clinton hammering away at a certain ex-White
House intern, for instance, is a scene unlikely to be realized
anywhere else but here.) Matthew Phenix looks at this phenomenon
and talks to the show's creator. From The New York Times. 800 words
+ photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
WESLEY SNIPES SHARPENS ``BLADE'' ``Blade'' is not for the squeamish
- the vampire-action movie spills buckets of blood. Wesley Snipes
is both star and producer of the film, which delivers a visceral
punch both as a horror movie and as a mystery. One of the first
African-American comic-book heroes, ``Blade'' is a human with the
characteristics of a vampire. (The superhero dispatches an
ever-growing legion of the undead whose goal is to take over the
planet.) `` 'Blade' gave me an opportunity to pay homage to some of
the classic Asian films,'' says Snipes, who is trained in the
martial arts. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   5. DANCES WITH RANDA HAINES Randa Haines is the seemingly
mild-mannered director of films like ``Children Of A Lesser God''
and ``The Doctor'' - emotional dramas about people struggling to
communicate. Her latest film is set in the rhythm-heavy world of
professional salsa dancing and, in the end, this film too is about
communication. Haines is passionate about salsa, ever since she
went to a salsa club by accident a few years ago, where she met a
dancer who had an idea for a screenplay. The result is ``Dance With
Me,'' starring Vanessa Williams and Puerto Rican music sensation
Chayanne. The moves and music are hot, while the film itself is
old-fashioned. (Haines says she even took out a love scene to put
in more dancing.) By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
KELSEY GRAMMER Kelsey Grammer's acclaimed TV comedy series
``Frasier'' is in its sixth season. Grammer talks about his demons
and how he puts pressure on himself in the role of a psychiatrist.
By Ian Spelling. 1,200 words + photo. 7. FACE VALUE : SHRINKING
GRAMMER In this new cartoon feature, cartoonist Ricardo Castaneda
offers a view of Kelsey Grammer in his hit TV comedy show
``Frasier.''
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
LARENZ TATE HAS THREE WIVES AT THE SAME TIME - ON
</P>
<P>
   FILM, OF COURSE Larenz Tate is fairly unknown, but in the
upcoming movie ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' he plays a 1950's
black singer who marries three women at the same time. Only they
don't know about each other. Discussing his first starring role,
Tate talks about what it was like to marry three women, and
describes his climb up the Hollywood ladder. By Cindy Pearlman.
1,400 words + photo
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
THE STRANGE WORLD OF TRIBUTE BANDS Low-grade acts have ruined the
reputation of many tribute bands, but in many respects they do have
a head start over groups who are agonizing over original material.
They play familiar songs and have a ready-made fan base. Some
hard-working groups have earned their own share of fame through
paying tribute to someone else. There is even a website which
provides information and links tribute bands all over the world.
Perhaps one of the most famous tribute groups is ``Bjorn Again,''
(Abba,) which has played at concerts in more than 30 countries. By
Jason Zasky. From Musician magazine. 1,800 words.

ADOBE'S HEAD HONCHOS TAKE A TURN IN CORPORATE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM ABATE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of last week's layoffs at Adobe Systems, some in
Silicon Valley are wondering whether the cuts should have started
at the top, with co-founders John Warnock and Chuck Geschke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you go through this kind of thing, you ask, `Am I the
problem? Is it time?' '' Warnock said.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has gone through two executive shakeups in 10 months. Last
fall, Warnock and Geschke, who are co-chairmen, ousted former Chief
Operating Officer Dave Pratt, a nine-year Adobe veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they forced out three execs hired after Pratt
departed: Chief Financial Officer Jack Bell, marketing czar Robert
Roblin and product manager Ross Bott.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, you could look at multiple executive changes
and conclude the problem was at the top,'' Warnock admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he and Geschke finally have an executive team, with
new CFO Harold Covert and marketer Bruce Chizen, to turn the
graphics-software giant around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand this business as well as anybody on the
planet,'' he said. ``What we've had is an execution problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Adobe's problems began long before the earnings
disappointment that preceded last week's shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company whose stock has gone nowhere for two
years,'' said one Silicon Valley insider. ``John and Chuck are nice
guys, but their hanging around just prevents the company from
bringing in someone who can turn the situation around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic says that Adobe, though master in print
publishing, has let Microsoft, Sun and Netscape set standards in
Web publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Says a third source in the venture capital community: ``I don't
see John or Chuck at the front of the (industry) parade like they
were 10 or 12 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnock disputes each barb. Adobe may yet create a standard
around its Acrobat software for sending documents over the Web.
It's working on new software tools that will let people author
content once and publish it in any medium _ paper, disk or Web.
</P>
<P>
   He says critics will see the first signs of progress in better
financials. ``We'll know within 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Warnock counters any suggestion that it's time for
the inventors of desktop publishing software to go out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and I understand the publishing market and have defended
it for 15 years,'' he said. ``We're not living in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   _ BANKING BLUES? Like the air shimmering over hot asphalt,
rumors are emanating from the offices of NationsBank Montgomery
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the situation said Montgomery CEO Thom Weisel
and his managing directors have been meeting over the last few days
to discuss whether the ``golden handcuffs'' _ financial inducements
to keep top managers in place after NationsBank acquired Montgomery
last year _ should be loosened to allow execs to depart sooner than
the two or three years they were supposed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   A Montgomery representative declined comment on the rumor that
Jerry Markowitz, a Weisel ally, and another top director might make
an early exit if the cuffs were loosened &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of Montgomery's 150 research analysts are
venting over other concerns. They used to get paid from a pot of
money, half of which came from investment banking profits, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, word is analysts will only get a 20 percent slice of
that banking fat. Moreover, analysts have supposedly been told to
spend more time covering the stocks of the larger firms in their
industries and less time doting on startups.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Ruth, co-director of research at Montgomery, wouldn't
discuss compensation rumors, but tried to put the coverage question
into context. As Montgomery continues its drive to challenge
top-tier investment banks _ such as Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley _ it wants to make sure its analysts have struck
the proper balance between covering small, fast-growing startups
and larger publicly held firms.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the investment banking world say that as
Montgomery _ and its rival Robertson, Stephens _ become part of
larger banks and step up to challenge New York-based investment
firms, they grow more distant from the Silicon Valley high-tech and
biomedical startups that used to butter their bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent comments from VCs indicate that they are starting to
see signs of these changes and are not happy about it,'' said a
Montgomery rival.

runs the Northern California operation, told me about the nonprofit

WHY YOU DON'T NEED A LAPTOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it's the season for confessions, here's mine: I, Hiawatha
Bray, technology reporter, don't own a laptop. Never have, and with
luck, never will.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against laptops, you understand. They're pretty cool _
until you switch one on and the red-hot Pentium chip inside sets
your lap on fire. And then there's the misery of running through
airports with 10 pounds of dead weight slung over your shoulder,
and the bother of turning it on under the suspicious eye of the
ladies at the metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   And heaven help you if you put the computer down for a moment
and turn your back. According to Safeware, a Columbus, Ohio,
insurer, thieves made off with over a billion dollars' worth of
laptops last year. That's not as remarkable a number as it sounds.
Laptops generally cost two or three times as much as an equivalent
desktop machine.
</P>
<P>
   I've been known to borrow a laptop from the Globe for a road
trip. Frankly, it's one reason I avoid road trips. And when I do
ship out, I look for excuses not to take a computer.
</P>
<P>
   I wish more of my guests would do the same. Several times a
month, computer executives drop into the Globe, laptops in tow, to
inflict a uniquely modern method of torture _ the PowerPoint slide
show. PowerPoint is a presentation graphics program that comes
along with the more useful parts of the Microsoft Office software
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that they're stuck with it anyway, some people can't bear
to let PowerPoint sit idle. Instead they waste hours of their time
whipping up a couple dozen tedious slides, and a half-hour of mine
showing them off.
</P>
<P>
   PowerPoint shows have their uses _ they're helpful when
addressing large groups, for instance. But more often than not,
they're a waste of good electrons. Next time you go to pitch a
client, print out your notes and charts on a few sheets of paper,
and leave the laptop behind.
</P>
<P>
   A computer also makes a handy way to carry around your address
book and appointment list, if you don't mind booting up every time
you have to check. Better to tote one of those pocket-sized digital
assistants for that purpose. There's the 3Com PalmPilot for around
$300, or the Franklin Rex, for as little as $129.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you don't have to carry your contact information at
all. Store it on the Internet, and it'll be available to you from
any Web site. The Cambridge-based PlanetAll Internet community
offers just such a service free of charge. It'll accept data from
Microsoft's Outlook information manager, or a PalmPilot, and links
to other information managers are under development.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to use your PlanetAll contact data, you need access
to the Web. But that's a mighty strange reason to haul a $4,000
gadget around. If you need a computer, use somebody else's. It's
taking long enough, but public Internet access points are gradually
popping up throughout the country. Alas, they're not always easy to
find. That's a good excuse to bookmark an impressive Internet site,
the Internet Cafe Guide at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.netcafeguide.com. Here you can find listings of 1,700
Internet cafes in 98 countries, and Internet kiosks in hotels and
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercafes come and go, and you might not want to bet your
livelihood on one of them. The business services firm Kinko's is
another matter. There are 900 Kinko's shops in the United States,
with Internet-linked computers in every one. Expect to pay about
$12 an hour to use them, with extra charges for printouts.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're on line, you shouldn't have any trouble getting your
e-mail, as long as your company's mail server uses the standard
POP3 protocol. You can hardly visit a Web site without seeing an
offer for free e-mail service. Say you sign up for a free account
at Microsoft's HotMail site. You get yet another e-mail address to
play with. But you can also set it up to act as a mailbox for any
POP3 account you may have. Now you can get your e-mail wherever
there's a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters to some of you _ the engineers and such who
have to lug their high-tech firepower wherever they go. But amateur
gearheads like me can do without. And very likely, so can you.
</P>

GETTING PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOUG BAILEY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't really believe I'm smarter than the average Macintosh
loyalist, but I remember being at MacWorld several years ago when
Apple introduced the Newton Personal Digital Assistant and thinking
that all the enthusiastic attendees shelling out hundreds of
dollars for the little device were wasting their money.
</P>
<P>
   I never caught the Newton bug. It was a great idea but the thing
was too big, too dim, and the handwriting recognition program left
much to be desired. I first picked one up at a 1990 Apple
conference in San Jose and wrote ``hello'' on the screen in
longhand, which the computer translated as ``little.'' Beyond the
fun of some comically erotic translations of my scrawl, I could
find no practical use for the Newton. And when Apple folded the
Newton experiment last year, I resisted the temptation to say I
told you so and forgot about PDAs all together.
</P>
<P>
   Even when my brother showed up one day with a PalmPilot by 3Com,
I scoffed. ``What do you do with it?'' I asked. Mostly it seemed to
be an electronic Rolodex that also played Space Invaders. I need
this? And when he told a story of being in a recent meeting when
seven people around the table all suddenly pulled out their
PalmPilots, I roared. How geeky can you get?
</P>
<P>
   Then a few weeks ago a friend of mine who works at Lotus
Development Corp. was seriously extolling the virtues of the
PalmPilot, and this time I listened. Her husband said he was
getting one too. Some quick research and I realized I was way
behind the PalmPilot curve. And, of course, I can't have that.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has sold more than 1 million PalmPilots in the last two
years, making it the most successful pocket-sized computer on the
market. Casio, Hewlett-Packard, Phillips, and even Microsoft all
sell handhelds or will soon, but clearly the business belongs to
3Com at moment. It holds about a 65 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking I had perhaps underestimated the device's attraction, I
recently bought a PalmIII, 3Com's third generation Pilot that was
released earlier this year. I can't say that owning one has been a
life-changing experience, but I am a convert. The PalmIII now holds
my contacts, phone numbers, appointments, memos, e-mail, and
miscellaneous scrawlings.
</P>
<P>
   With the optional modem, I can send and receive e-mail and even
surf the Web when I'm away from the office or home.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot's best feature is the ability to instantly
synchronize data between your home and office computer. In fact,
it's easier to input data to your desktop and transfer it to the
PalmPilot with a push of a button. It supports Lotus Notes and
desktop organizers. 3Com also intends to make the PalmIII double as
a pager, a feature already available in earlier PalmPilot models.
</P>
<P>
   The best news for Mac users is that the PalmPilot is about to
become more compatible with their home and office machines. Later
this summer 3Com plans to release a new MacPac system to improve
connections between the PalmPilots and Macs as well as a version of
Claris Organizer software. 3Com bought Claris Organizer from Apple
last year. The program integrates calendar, contacts, tasks, notes,
and intelligent features such as drag-and-drop scheduling, custom
views, and printing options in one application.
</P>
<P>
   All current Macintosh users of the Palm III, like me, who bought
the original MacPac version 1.0, will qualify for a free upgrade to
the new Palm MacPac software. The free upgrade can be downloaded
from the company's We bsite for 60 days after the product is
released, at http://www.palm.com.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to support. Unlike the Newton, which was
virtually orphaned by software developers _ and eventually by Apple
itself _ the PalmPilot benefits from scads of support, not just
from 3Com but from third-party producers, shareware developers, and
other sources. The best sites can be found at the palm.com site.
One of the new sites is Ziff-Davis's at
http://www.hotfiles.com/pilotsoftware.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Addendum: I've heard all the news stories about Apple's new iMac
being a likely hit, but now I'm sure of it. My 68 year-old mother
bought one Wednesday.

<P>
   PEPPER-SPRAY (San Francisco) _ The forewoman of the jury that
deadlocked on whether sheriff's deputies used excessive force by
daubing pepper spray around the eyes of non-violent protesters
called the police action disturbing. The federal jury of 6 men and
two women deadlocked 4-4 Tuesday, and U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker set Nov. 16 for a new trial. By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION (San Francisco) _ San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown, brushing aside the threat of lawsuits, is backing an effort
to keep San Francisco's affirmative action program in place for
another five years despite California's Proposition 209 that barred
race and gender preferences for government contracts. By GREGORY
LEWIS.
</P>
<P>
   DESTROYER-VET (Albany, N.Y.) _ It had been 53 years since Ed
Whitmore stood on the deck of a World War II destroyer escort, 53
years since he'd hunted German U-boats. He was among 510 members of
the Destroyer Escort Sailors Association and their spouses who came
to Albany to visit the USS Slater, the last destroyer escort still
afloat in the United States. By EDWARD FITZPATRICK.
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICIANS-EXECUTION (San Francisco) _ A lawsuit seeking to bar
doctors from participating in executions may be an attempt to stop
something that isn't happening. A spokeswoman for the California
Department of Corrections said technicians, not doctors, insert the
intravenous line that delivers the lethal drugs to the condemned
prisoner. By ULYSSES TORASSA.
</P>

   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CAREERS (San Francisco) _ As far as Eric Douglas is concerned,
good communication is a matter of style. The author of the recently
published ``Straight Talk'' believes that people will do better in
work and in life if they understand not only their own
communication style, but the styles of associates. By DAVE MURPHY.

aren't just for the refrigerator anymore. Suffer from lower back
pain? There's a magnetic seat cushion. Have a headache? Try a
magnetic headband. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-MAGAZINES (Undated) _ If anyone wonders what is one of the
fastest-growing segments in the publishing industry, take a look at
your local newsstands. You will find more and more titles dealing
with herbs, tea, beer and the various ethnic cuisines. By WILLIAM
M. DOWD.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-HILLS (Undated) _ Tamara Jenkins' new movie, ``Slums
of Beverly Hills,'' is sneaky. Disguised as a comedy, the film
tackles such weighty subjects as the sexual objectification of
women and the effects of class consciousness on a decidedly
downwardly mobile family. Thank God none of that is evident in the
advance publicity or people would likely stay away from this movie
in droves, which would be a shame. By CRAIG MARINE.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-CUTRUFELLO-REVIEW (Houston) _ Mary Cutrufello, 27, is on
the edge of living out her dream. Her major-label debut, ``When the
Night Is Through,'' was released Tuesday on Mercury Records, and
she'll appear on ``The Tonight Show'' Thursday. Says her manager,
Holly Gleason: ``To Mercury, it's `This is a great record,' not
`This is a great record for a black woman from Yale with dreadlocks
playing guitar.''' By RICK MITCHELL.

</P>
<P>
   BBN-McGWIRE-SUPPLEMENT (Albany, N.Y.) _ The man must bring the
national nightmare to an end so that we can all get on with our
lives. It's time. The man needs to throw himself on the mercy of
the court of public opinion. He doesn't have a private life. He
belongs to the American people. Mark McGwire needs to say: ``All
the reports and rumors are true. I'm guilty of using a dietary
supplement in conjunction with my exercise program.'' By STEVE
CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Here's where I hit the wall on
President Clinton and his problems. I was reading the transcript of
Monday's White House briefing by press secretary Mike McCurry. I
read these to congratulate myself on not being a White House
reporter. I wouldn't even accept the Martha's Vineyard beach beat.
By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Schenectady, N.Y.) _ Despite efforts by the city
to shut down strip joints, a federal judge has ruled that stripping
to some music is a form of expression protected by the
Constitution. The battle will cost taxpayers a few hundred grand.
This is what happens when politicians try to impose their visions
of morality and art appreciation on everybody else. By DAN LYNCH.

COMPUTER FIRMS SPEND $3 MILLION ON CHAT-NOW, PAY-LATER POLITICKING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW MOLLISON  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The Sunday after Congress began its August recess,
two senators led eight House members and four House candidates on a
sweep through Silicon Valley and Seattle in search of enlightenment
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, they sat through intense briefings on economics,
technology and political desires by very rich computer gurus and
venture capitalists from such firms as CNet, Yahoo!, Applied
Materials, Affymetrix, ETrade, Sun, USWeb, NetNoir,
Hewlett-Packard, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, E-Loan and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this sense that this is the New World, and we want to
learn about it, `` Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said in a statement
about the West Coast swing arranged by him and Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In between the briefings, they squeezed in social events at
which the briefers and their friends gave $150,000 to the New
Democrat Network, a Washington-based fund-raising group that raises
money for pro-business Democrats in tough races.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the many mechanisms that Democrats and Republicans
alike have used to raise more than $3 million since January 1997
from the nation's 50 most generous computer companies. The
technology leaders, once disparaged by politicians as people ``with
deep pockets and short arms,'' are being courted more than ever
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rosenberg, who runs the New Democrat Network, said, ``In
many ways we represent what (top computer executives) want:
fiscally responsible fiscal policies and socially tolerant social
policies. ``
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also mine for the computer industry's gold. Senate
Banking Chairman Al D'Amato, R-N.Y., collected 39 contributions
worth $37,500 on a similar visit last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which gave $511,899, topped the list of generous
computer companies compiled by the non-partisan Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Others investing at least $100,000 include Electronic Data
Systems of Plano, Texas; Oracle of Redwood Shores, Calif.; Gateway
2000 of North Sioux City, S.D.; Cisco Systems of San Jose; J.D.
Edwards of Denver, and CDB Infotek, a California firm which has
since been acquired by ChoicePoint of Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On a monthly basis, contributions from the top 50 computer firms
are averaging more than $195,000. That's less than the
record-setting $211,000 monthly average for 1995-96, but a big jump
over other non-presidential election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, before the global explosion of the World Wide
Web created a new generation of WWWillionaires with a new set of
political concerns, the monthly average for the top 50 was below
$118,000.
</P>
<P>
   The best known political buddies of generous high tech tycoons
are two veteran Democratic schmoozers, President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, who are utterly at home with the industry's
chat-now, pay-later approach.
</P>
<P>
   But the nonpartisan center's studies indicate that Republicans
have gotten about 58 cents out of every political dollar the top 50
companies have handed out since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the GOP is doing better than ever at convincing
computer executives to donate the kind of unregulated ``soft
money'' contributions that would be outlawed under a House-passed
bill pending before the Senate. The Republican share has ballooned
from 33 percent of the $1.3 million given by computer companies in
1995-96 to 54 percent of $1.5 million raised in 1997 and early
1998.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who was briefed in Silicon
Valley in June, is expected back later in August to collect some of
the $20 million he wants the nation's businesses to pony up for the
GOP's fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, an alliance of 150 technology
executives who call their group TechNet has briefed more than 50
members of Congress and raised funds for at least 18 of the
Democrats and 10 of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take it for granted that political figures
who didn't grow up in the technology industry understand how
important it is, how fragile it is, how complex,'' said Reed
Hastings, president of TechNet. ``We're bringing them to Palo Alto,
to Seattle, to Boston, to Virginia. A similar effort is being
organized in Austin. High tech is much broader than Silicon Valley,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they give the office-holders money because ``after you
make an investment of time in having them understand the issues . .
.you want to keep them elected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every special interest group feels that way,'' said analyst
Jennifer Schechter at the Center for Responsive Politics. ``What
about the people who disagree with (the computer executives) but
can't afford to pay for face time with policy-makers?''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings responded, ``We're not trying to differentiate on the
basis that (because) we give more money, you pay attention to us.
That's a pretty shallow way of viewing the political process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADDS FOLLOW)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Accountants and trial lawyers and banks and the securities
industry all give tons more money than we do,'' said Wade Randlett,
TechNet's Democratic liaison. ``People come and take part because
it takes a lot of time, words, questions, to discuss the change
from the old economy to the new economy, and (its significance) for
everything from rural development to organ transplants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty sophisticated dialogue, not at all partisan, not
just a one-way lecture,'' said Lezlee Westine, TechNet's GOP
liaison. But she was unable to recall any occasion in which a
public official had changed a high tech executive's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Polese, the CEO of Marimba Inc., a software startup in
Mountain View, Calif., said she finds time for the sessions because
``the high technology industry and our country's future (depend on)
issues such as Internet access for all citizens, individual
privacy, secure communications, and a well-educated,
technology-savvy workforce.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD , WHICH COULD RUN AS A
</ANNOTATION>
SIDEBAR, FOLLOWS)
<P>
   In California, technology executives who were appalled by the
state's school system won widespread credit this year for a $3
million effort that resulted in passage of a law that will increase
the number of public charter schools in their state.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, the influence of the industry's investment is
harder to measure, mostly because Congress and the Clinton
administration have put off deal-making compromises on many bills
until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   It looks now as if the industry will win its battles for a law
making it harder for disappointed shareholders to use state courts
to sue companies that issued overly optimistic business
projections. Congress is expected to preserve federal subsidies for
Internet links to schools and libraries, though with a requirement
that the institutions install obscenity-blocking software for
optional use.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the industry's adoption of voluntary
privacy-protection codes has convinced Congress and Clinton to wait
and see whether the policies make it unnecessary to use new laws to
protect children and shoppers from exploitation by Internet-using
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to order some loosening of export
controls on software that uses powerful data-scrambling codes. And
he is expected to compromise with congressional Republicans on
higher immigration quotas for highly skilled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year or three-year ban on new state or local taxes on
Internet use has better than a 50-50 chance to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But final action this year is less likely on the industry's
proposals for lower capital gains taxes, federal standards on
legally binding digital signatures, a new policy on commercial use
of public data bases, much higher spending on university-based
research, enhanced patent protection laws and extra support for the
International Monetary Fund's efforts to salvage the economies of
the high tech industry's Asian customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects are dimming for passage of anti-spamming laws
to protect Internet users from unwanted e-mail and anti-slamming
laws to protect telephone users from phone-service swindlers. Those
popular proposals are in legislation that is blocked by a dispute
within Congress over whether to use telephone taxes or general
revenues to pay for making the Internet available to students and
library patrons.

EDITORIAL: ACCESS FEES AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court decision this week should benefit
Internet users and the fast-growing electronic information industry
by holding down connection costs. The decision upheld the authority
of the Federal Communications Commission to exempt Internet service
providers from interstate access charges paid to local phone
companies. The issue was raised in a lawsuit by telecommunications
companies challenging federal regulations intended to deregulate
the industry. The lengthy decision by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals allows the agency to get on with that task without
dampening growth in the electronic information sector.
</P>
<P>
   The local phone companies have argued that Internet services
should have to pay the same access fees that long-distance carriers
pay for using the local phone lines. But the FCC contends that
Internet services are not equivalent to long-distance carriers and
do not use local systems in the same way. Imposing access fees
would very likely have caused online services to raise their rates,
and perhaps abandon the flat-fee structure that has attracted
millions of customers to online services.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC policy was created in 1983, recognizing that the nascent
electronic information industry needed breathing room to develop.
Last year the FCC decided that keeping the access fee exemption for
online services was still appropriate to avoid disrupting the
still-evolving industry. The agency also is not convinced that
Internet services impose uncompensated costs on the local phone
companies or that congestion on local phone lines warrants the
imposition of new charges. That judgment may change in the future _
but it is one for the agency to make without judicial interference.

   ATLANTA _ Americans glued to CNN, MSNBC or ABCNews.com can get
another perspective on the cruise missile strikes by visiting
international news and information Web sites and chat areas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's possible to get a glimpse of how the United States
and its foreign policy are perceived around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the English-language information is a few days old, but
it provides insight on American relations with Sudan and
Afghanistan before Thursday's strikes.
</P>
<P>
   An interview with Osama bin Laden, whose network was the target
of the strikes, appears on the Web site of the fundamentalist
Islamic Azzam Publications, http://www.
</P>
<P>
   webstorage.com/(tilde)azzam/html/.usamahbinladin.html). The site
is devoted to advancing the cause of Islamic holy war. Other
articles talk about fragile relations between the United States and
Afghanistan before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time chats are another way to gauge world reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, shock and stunned amazement were the Islamic world's
online reactions to the U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are American acts not terrorist when they kill civilians
in Iraq or anyplace else?'' asked one chat participant in a
Muslim-oriented chat room sponsored by Taliban Online.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban Online, http://www.taliban.com, the English-language Web
site of the controversial fundamentalist group, had a small but
passionate group discussion about the action and U.S. foreign
policy in general.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was not a unilateral call for a jihad or
terrorist acts against the United States. Rather, it was a
thoughtful discussion of how the Islamic world should respond to
U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has become clear that terrorism is a U.S. policy,''
said one chat room participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (terrorism) is the only language they will understand,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   The few Americans in the chat room seemed as puzzled as their
international counterparts about the motivation behind the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Afghans living abroad reported news they had received from
their families at home. One participant claimed 900 civilians were
killed. Another simply logged on to say none of their family
members was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in the Taliban chat were primarily Europeans,
Afghans or Pakistanis living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There were some tense moments when one American entered into a
heated debate with another chat room member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters that brothers allow the slaughter of other
brothers, and that should not be allowed,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you support killing Americans, but not Muslims?'' asked
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the participants in this chat spent more
time wondering what motivated the attacks than how or when to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Most chat room members were interested in discussing peace
rather than war. Much of the discussion centered around whether the
United States or any nation could solve anything through terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for what the U.S. or any nation is
doing,'' said one person.
</P>
<P>
   Added another, ``Somebody has to break the circle of violence.''

TIME TO GO BACK TO `SWEAR' ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Not long after I installed Win95 on my PC this
spring (after a memory upgrade), it refused to start up correctly.
About halfway through the startup cycle, I get a recurring message,
``Unable to read Drive C: Abort, Retry, Ignore.'' Is this
catastrophic?
</P>
<P>
   _ Breakdown
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BREAK: You are, to use a technical term, hosed.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of reasons you may be getting that error
message. Most of them are pretty grim, but don't give up. The first
thing you should do is dig back into the computer's innards to make
sure everything is hooked up correctly. Doublecheck the big flat
cable that hooks the drive to your motherboard or drive controller
card. Some have special tabs that will only allow a correct
connection and keep you from being a dunce; some don't. If you have
one that doesn't, look for a red stripe on one side of the cable
and make sure it goes to the same number pin on either end.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more than one place to plug the cable in, so dig
through the trash until you find the instruction manual, which
should have a motherboard diagram. Now, make sure the four-wire
power connector is tightly in its socket on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Also check the drive for a little jumper that should be set to
the ``master'' position instead of ``slave.'' Do you think the guy
who dreamed that up was feeling lonely?
</P>
<P>
   Assuming everything's hooked up right and that you didn't at
some point spill your tropical drink into the computer so that the
little paper umbrella is jamming the works, try booting again.
Didn't work? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Sorry. Just my cruel little joke. I
didn't think all that would work, but you never know.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you've got the case open, take out the memory you
added. I don't think that will work either, but we need to try and
get things back to the way they were before the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   Now try starting your computer's built-in setup program. It's
possible a bad battery caused the PC to forget what sort of hard
drive it had. You'll have to dig out the books to figure out all
the gibberish it's asking for, but if it indicates that you
currently have no hard drive, there's your problem. Of course, if
that really were the case, it should also be forgetting things like
the correct time or whether you have a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, you have a physically corrupted hard drive. No,
that's not Freudian. It just means something's goobered up on your
disk. Make yourself a boot floppy disk (oh, just find a geek at
work who knows how to do it) with Scandisk.exe on it. Start things
up, then run Scandisk on your hard drive to repair things. Didn't
work? I'm not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   There are about a hundred other things you can try, but stop
making yourself crazy. Nuke the drive. Reformat it and start over.
It's not doing you any good like it is. And get your geek buddy to
help. That way you can blame him if anything else goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If things still aren't working, then the drive is probably
cratered. New ones are cheap and not that hard to install, but have
the store do the work anyway. If the real culprit is a bad
motherboard, you won't have to mess with returning the drive. All
you'll have to do is figure out how to pay for a new computer. And
this time, don't buy the cheapest one in the store.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, you can try replacing the motherboard first. I was just
trying to save you some frustration. And, no, I don't get a
kickback from the store. We're still negotiating that.

BETTER FEATURES, ACCESS HAS CUSTOMERS BANKING ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER SINTON   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online banking has a growing number of fans but it has yet to
become a favorite indoor pastime.
</P>
<P>
   That could soon change as more financial institutions let
customers bank with ease over the Internet and work out ways for
customers to get their bills as well as pay them online.
</P>
<P>
   Just 3 percent of U.S. households now use their home computers
to transfer money between accounts and pay bills, according to
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. However, this is expected to
jump to 20 percent of households within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving this growth are falling computer prices, better
encryption systems to protect online privacy, more online banking
features and easier access.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, banks have been touting the virtues of
banking online _ checking balances, transferring funds between
accounts and paying bills without the bother of writing a check,
sticking a stamp on the envelope and trotting to the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Online banking was supposed to save both banks and their
customers untold millions of dollars and hours of time. But
economic benefits have been hard to measure.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, home banking was cumbersome. Customers had to
load their computers with special software and dial toll-free
numbers. Often, they were told the service was down.
</P>
<P>
   But things are getting better. About 80 percent of the top 100
banks now offer online banking over the Internet, making it much
easier for consumers to access their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest innovations are happening right here in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is the nation's best Internet bank and Wells
Fargo ranks No. 3, according to Gomez Advisors, which tracks online
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   BofA ranks best in two of five categories: customer confidence
and relationship services (which covers the number of products that
can be accessed online).
</P>
<P>
   In another ranking,SmartMoney magazine in June declared
Citibank, BofA, BankBoston and Wells Fargo the top four cyberbanks.
</P>
<P>
   PC-savvy consumers are particularly keen on online banking. ``I
do pretty much everything online but get cash,'' said Niall McKay,
an Irish journalist who banks with Wells Fargo. ``It beats dealing
with a teller. Since decisions are made by computers anyway, it's
better to deal with the computer itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time consumers like McKay pay a bill online, they
usually have to type in the name, address and phone number of the
payee as well as their account number. The next time the same bill
comes, however, all they have to do is enter the amount and the
date they want the payment sent. If they want to pay the same
amount on the same date each month (for mortgage or cable TV
bills), they can schedule these payments for up to a year with just
one click.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only negative is that they should pay me for using the
service,'' said McKay. ``Like booking cinema tickets over the
phone, it saves time and is cheaper for everyone, so I don't see
why the bank should charge $5 a month (for bill payment services)
unless you have a $5,000 balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fees for those who don't meet minimum balance requirements or
have their paychecks deposited automatically have kept some
potential online customers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, though, not only provide online banking for free,
they offer incentives to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank, for example, is offering $25 cash to new customers who
use its Direct Access Internet banking service to pay at least two
bills by September 30. Citibank is targeting customers in
California because its research shows that 40 percent of the 26
million households that surf the Web live here.
</P>
<P>
   To lure customers, banks are offering more and more services
online, including stock trading and loan applications.
</P>
<P>
   But some researchers doubt that one-stop shopping is what
customers want.
</P>
<P>
   After surveying 126,000 consumers this year, Forrester Research
reports that online consumers have accounts with four different
financial institutions on average, and 84 percent of them are more
interested in going to multiple sites for ``best-of-breed''
services than getting everything with one click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that ``banks increasingly view online banking
as a delivery channel rather than a product that can be sold by
itself,'' said David Weisman, a Forrester Research director.
</P>
<P>
   At Wells Fargo, 470,000 customers _ about 10 percent of the
bank's total _ use online banking and the number is growing about
1,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America's online customer base doubled last year and is
expected to grow another 70 percent this year, according to
Executive Vice President Mike DeVico. The service costs $5.95 per
month for unlimited bill payment but this fee is waived for direct
deposit and many other customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even more consumers will likely rush online when they are able
to get their bills as well as pay them online. ``The next killer
app will be bill presentment,'' said Wells Executive Vice President
Dudley Nigg.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is one of the banks testing electronic delivery of bills
using technology from Microsoft and First Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A competing joint venture involves Integrion, a collaboration of
banks, IBM and CheckFree that processes about 85 million online
bank payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   Individual companies, including AT&AMP;T, Con Edison and BellSouth,
are testing billing their own customers online. But most consumers
would prefer getting their bills from one Web site rather than
multiple sites.
</P>
<P>
   Complex technical issues have held up broad introduction of
online billing.
</P>
<P>
   Nigg expects ``meaningful consumer trials'' early next year. But
Forrester's Weisman expects ``it will take until 2001 for bill
presentment to reach critical mass.''

Year 2000 exchanges magic for hysteria 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who are middle-aged or older, the Year 2000 had a
magical sort of feeling. Back in the '60s and '70s, the new
millennium was seen as almost impossibly far away. And, if folks
thought about a Year 2000 problem at all back then, the problem was
in living that long.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 is almost here now. It's no longer magical. And,
for the governments and businesses of the world, it is a
multi-billion dollar problem.
</P>
<P>
   By now, unless you live in a cave somewhere around Katmandu, you
have read all about the Y2K bug that plagues many computers. The
stories have taken on an almost hysterical tone, with serious (and
perhaps credible) predictions of everything from a paralyzed air
traffic control system, to the failure of the government to be able
to handle Social Security payments, to a nuclear war triggered by
faulty software running the missile system in some relatively
underdeveloped country.
</P>
<P>
   Since even the experts have trouble agreeing and since _ for
people who aren't computer programmers _ the problem itself is so
difficult to understand, let's start today's trek through the World
Wide Web at a site that provides a very basic look at the problem,
what causes it, and what makes fixing the problem so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The site is called What is the Y2K Millennium Problem and it's
located at http://www-de
</P>
<P>
   .ksc.nasa.gov/specsintact
</P>
<P>
   /sib1096/year2000/sld003.htm. As you'll notice, this is a NASA
site. The information is presented in slide show fashion. Instead
of clicking on links, use the VCR-like control buttons at the
bottom of the page to move ahead or backwards on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of fancy graphics, this site can be a little
slow. If you'd like a faster text page, simply press the icon for
the letter ``A'' on that same control panel.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has a slide show that's the heart of an online
seminar called Solving the Year 2000 Problem. You'll find the show
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .microsoft.com/seminar/98
</P>
<P>
   /Y2KStrategy714/portal.htm. By Microsoft's estimate you'll be
able to cover the material _ presented on 17 slides _ in little
over 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, especially for PC users, a lot of the software in
your computer comes from Microsoft. The giant software company has
done a good job explaining the problem and offering help.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still hungry for more information from Microsoft,
there's an entire collection of links that deals with almost every
aspect of the Year 2000 problem. You'll find this general purpose
collection at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .microsoft.com/year2000
</P>
<P>
   /?RLD &QC; 53. Once there, you can follow the links to pages that
offer information at various degrees of technical complexity.
You'll also find a link to a section that lets you find out just
what problems Microsoft's own software has with the Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Microsoft site, make sure you visit the FAQ
(frequently asked questions) section devoted to the problem at
http://www.microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   /ithome/topics/year2k/2kfaq
</P>
<P>
   /2kfaq01.htm. You'll have to search hard to find a place that
does a better job explaining almost any facet of the problem. And
since it's organized by question, you can jump right to the part
that interested you most.
</P>
<P>
   This is all serious stuff. And by now, if you've followed all
the links, you may be a bit depressed. So save this link for last.
It's called 12 Reasons to Ignore the Y2K Problem at
http://www.ecl.udel.edu/(tilde)hague
</P>
<P>
   /ignore.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons cited: ``4. Nostradamus never mentioned this
problem. 5. You believe a comet is due to hit the Earth in 2000 _
why bother?''

LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online versions of NFL fantasy leagues have become so esoteric
that it's never too early to sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   (That's a hint: Get yourself in gear if you want to play one of
these things before the Sept. 6 opening kickoff.)
</P>
<P>
   There are several methods of compiling fantasy teams, then
competing with other cybersaps and monitoring the whole thing on
the Web. Some sites offer as many as three ways to play the league.
</P>
<P>
   Just be careful out there. Not all states allow playing these
games for prizes (in California it's OK). And because new
government regulations aimed at eliminating gambling on the
Internet might soon go into effect, all leagues must charge a fee
if they are to give out prizes.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the range that's available:
</P>
<P>
   __ Yahoo!:
</P>
<P>
   Address: http://fantasy.yahoo.com/nfl/start
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Free.
</P>
<P>
   Prizes: None (that's why it's free)
</P>
<P>
   Deadline: Sept. 3, 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Summary: Touts its game as one with ``no petty entry fees,
annoying transaction charges or hidden registration costs.'' Which
translates to no prizes.
</P>
<P>
   __ CNN/SI:

Illustrated).
</P>
<P>
   Prizes: $3,000 ski trip to Salt Lake City, personal computers,
autographed collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline: Sept. 2, 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Summary: Can also play by mail.
</P>
<P>
   __ CBS SportsLine:
</P>
<P>
   Address: http://fantasyfootball.commissioner.com/
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $19.95 (also $99.95 for private leagues)
</P>
<P>
   Prizes: $3,000 home-entertainment center (grand prize), Joe
Namath autographed footballs.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline: Sept. 5, 11:59 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Summary: Players seem to appreciate what they get on this site
as far as information to help make roster moves.
</P>
<P>
   __ ESPN SportsZone:
</P>
<P>
   Address: http://games-espn.sportszone.com/

</P>
<P>
   Prizes: $3,000 home-entertainment center (grand prize), ESPN
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline: Sept. 3, noon.
</P>
<P>
   Summary: Also offers late-season franchises (by Oct. 2).
</P>
<P>
   __ The Sporting News:
</P>
<P>
   Address: http://games.sportingnews.com/nfl/
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $59.95, with fees for roster moves ($2.50), adding new
players ($7.50) and adding new taxi squad players ($5).
</P>
<P>
   Prizes: $25,000 grand prize, $5,000 trip to the Super Bowl,
$4,000 trip to the Pro Bowl, $1,000 big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline: Sept. 4, 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>

iMac making mark in sales, offering a symbolic success for fallen
Apple 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week was one of the most important in Apple
Computer's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the company's re-entry into the consumer market. And
it was quite a debut.
</P>
<P>
   Star of the ball was its iMac computer, a model that includes a
built-in screen and retails for $1,299. It's the best deal Apple
Computer has ever offered on a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, iMac sales have been brisk. Stores in Atlanta
and nationwide have reported people standing in line to see this
new computer, which resembles an iridescent gumdrop.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the iMac was selling well before Apple Computer even
released it. The company announced two weeks ago that it had
pre-sold 150,000 iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are forecasting that Apple Computer will
sell 250,000 iMacs by year-end, helping raise sales nearly 13.5
percent to 740,000 for the fourth quarter. The company sold 652,000
computers in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, brisk sales of the iMac are expected to dilute the
company's profit margin. That's because the iMac sells for such a
low price. Wall Street analysts estimate Apple's profit margin will
shrink to about 20 percent from a current 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While not a financial windfall, the iMac is an important
symbolic success for Apple. It has repositioned the company as once
again the computer industry's hip innovator.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers in The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other
leading newspapers have heralded the iMac as the most interesting
new computer since, well, the original Mac. It also was an
all-in-one unit.
</P>
<P>
   These high-profile reviews have more than turned back the storm
of criticism that nearly swamped the company during the past two
years. Respect for the company is rising and so is its profit and
market share, although it remains a small player with about 5
percent of total computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   What Apple needs to do now, many observers believe, is expand
its small market share. That means attracting customers other than
current Mac users. Will the iMac do that? Industry observers say
it's too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   While selling well now, the iMac may lose steam once users start
kicking the tires. It lacks some key features standard in most
computers today. One of them is a floppy drive, which lets users
easily copy and move files via a 3.5 inch disk.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature missing is standard connections for today's
peripherals such as printers. The iMac instead uses a new standard
that the industry is slowing moving toward.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is users will have to buy either a new printer
or a special device that lets them use their old ones with the
iMac. And, of course, that adds to the computer's price.

Wheels on the bus make your PC go round and round 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying a PC is easy. Prices are lower than I've ever seen;
machines are more powerful, and (with rare exceptions) even the
no-name machines work fairly reliably.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most folks strain and fret too much when getting ready to
buy a new PC. They study magazines, ask friends, consult psychics
and hang out in computer stores. Truth is _ until recently _ you
could do pretty well by simply setting a budget for how much you
can afford to spend on a PC, then shopping for the most powerful
machine you can find in that price range.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you are one of those fretters I was talking about, do I
have good news for you. A new generation of machines hit the market
several months ago. And that's made the buying decision a little
more difficult. So now you can worry and study and scratch your
head without feeling paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to talk about buses today. And I'll do my best to
explain why it's a good idea not to miss the bus.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a computer guru, you'll know all about these new
machines already. But if you're a computer guru, you probably ought
to be spending your Sundays outside anyway and take a break from
all this tech talk. So for the rest of you, let's gather around and
talk about why things got complicated at the computer store.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines have faster chips in them. And most new users
think the speed of the chip, measured in megahertz, is the only
measure of a computer's speed. But speed is just one of the
criteria. While these new machines have chips that run at 350 and
400 megahertz, the real speed increase comes from a faster bus.
Faster bus? If you're a novice user, the last bus you encountered
had a smelly exhaust. The kind of bus we're talking about today is
built into the motherboard (the main circuit board of the PC).
</P>
<P>
   To understand how a bus works, let's think of the motherboard as
a city. The chips on the board, including the processor chip, are
buildings, and the circuitry that ties these chips together makes
up the bus. The bus is roughly equivalent to roadways that connect
the chips together. Until now, buses ran at either 33 megahertz, 60
megahertz or 75 megahertz. But this new generation of Pentium II
machines uses a bus that runs much faster _ at 100 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   So the story here isn't in the chips. The 350 megahertz and 400
megahertz chips are faster, but _ inside _ there's no real
difference in the way they are made.
</P>
<P>
   The real speed increase comes from the speed of the bus. And
like a broader roadway, this 100 megahertz bus means data will
travel faster inside the circuitry of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay a premium for 100 megahertz machines. And because
they work so much faster, you'll also pay more for the faster
memory chips they use. After all, you need a faster chip to take
advantage of the faster bus speed.
</P>
<P>
   So now you have a real choice. If you buy one of these
new-generation machines, you'll be able to upgrade it with faster
chips _ as they're introduced _ and get speed bonuses just not
possible with machines with a slower bus speed.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines really are faster and, if you have plenty of
money to spend on computing, they're the way to go. On the other
hand, not all of us are fabulously wealthy. And depending on how
you use a PC at home, the speed increase from one of these new
machines may not be important to you.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while I have fancy machines here at work, at home
I have a really old PC that runs at 125 megahertz. (That's not a
typo, it's the result of an old Overdrive chip used to upgrade what
had been a Pentium/75.) That home machine is used almost
exclusively for checking e-mail, using a word processor and
browsing the Web. It's not a perfect machine, but it does all I
need right now. And until I win the lottery, it's likely to stick
around.
</P>
<P>
   How about you? Who knows what you ought to do. But if you're
computer shopping these days, at least you now have some
legitimately tough decisions. Enjoy the suffering.

It's a snap taking a photo now that you can see and send almost
instantly 
By Kristi E. Swartz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strike a pose.
</P>
<P>
   Grab a disc.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the film, just say ``cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to digital cameras _ photography of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect for the impatient, the computer geek or anyone who wants
to see photos in seconds, these hand-held and sometimes
pocket-sized cameras allow you to snap pictures, and see the images
on a computer screen or on paper within minutes. And you can use
your computer to edit the photographs _ no darkroom required.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other high-tech toy, these cameras are becoming more
available and more affordable to consumers. They now range in price
from $200 for low-end, user-friendly models to $800 for the most
technologically advanced. The average price is about $500.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras first hit the market several years ago,
professional photographers and techies were the only ones with
their fingers on the flashes. Now cameras are falling in the hands
of almost everyone _ real estate agents, insurance adjusters and
parents wanting to show off their child's first steps to Grandma
and Grandpa.
</P>
<P>
   James Harris, who works at Elemental Interactive, an
Atlanta-based Internet development company, has been using a
digital camera to check out commercial real estate and office
furniture in San Francisco, where the company just opened a new
office.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought a camera a year ago, and employees took it
across the country to snap shots of potential office space, desks,
chairs, carpets, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Harris bought his own digital camera to take on vacation. Last
year, he and some friends created a Web page of their snowboarding
trip to show to the friends who couldn't make it to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to take these digital pictures and put them
on the Web and e-mail them to people instead of taking regular
pictures and having them developed and scanned in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone should throw away their film and pick up these
digital gadgets. Here's the advice consumers get from a local
photography expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take terrible pictures, that's the first thing I tell
them,'' said Cliff Whitney, Wolf Camera vice president for
technology development.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him wrong. Whitney raves about the cameras, as long as
the prints are only to be viewed on a computer screen. For that
kind of application, the images are just as serviceable as those
from a film camera. But when the images are turned into prints, the
film camera is much better.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how you use them, Wolf Camera and Video is a top
vendor of these toys. The cameras are becoming all the more popular
with people being more Net friendly. Eastman Kodak and Olympus
America are the top manufacturers, with nearly 40 other ones close
on their heels. The cameras also can be found in such stores as
Best Buy, Sharper Image and Brookstone.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be film-free, the first thing to tell the
behind-the-counter camera salesperson is how you plan to use the
camera, Whitney said. Once that's decided, he said it's best to buy
a digital camera that's similar to a typical ``film'' one _ with a
zoom lens and a built-in flash. Kodak's DC210 has a 2X zoom lens,
equivalent to a 29-58mm range on a 35mm camera. It also can take
pictures as close as eight inches, and the lens is focus-free for
point-and-shoot ease.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things to consider when shopping:
</P>
<P>
   -- LCD vs. optical viewfinding
</P>
<P>
   An LCD shows images stored in the camera to view before being
loaded up on a computer or printed out. This way you always have a
second chance to get that first shot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Resolution
</P>
<P>
   It plays a major role in the precise detail and quality of
photos taken and in maximum image size you can display or print
without enlarging the photo. Most digital cameras have a resolution
at 640x480, but others in the high-price range, such as the Fuji
MX700, have a resolution of 1280x1024.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uploading images
</P>
<P>
   Before the use of digital cameras, images could be transferred
to a computer using a scanner. Now they can be stored in the camera
with either a floppy disk or a memory card.
</P>
<P>
   Most cameras come with cables to connect the camera directly to
the computer and also software for viewing the images.
</P>
<P>
   -- Printing
</P>
<P>
   Pictures can turn out OK if the printer used has the same
resolution as that of the camera. Anything lower than the camera's
resolution makes shots look grainy or washed out. But prints will
not be anywhere near as good as the ones from a film camera.

It's eBLAST searching the Net, thanks to Encyclopaedia Britannica 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Encyclopaedia Britannica has been published since
1768, and in the 230 years since its founding in Edinburgh,
Scotland, the venerable reference work has saved countless numbers
of students who waited until the night before an essay was due to
start writing.
</P>
<P>
   The entire 32-volume set has been available on the World Wide
Web since 1994 at http://www.eb.com, and as a two-disc CD-ROM for
Windows and Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   In July the company opened another chapter in its long history
by launching eBLAST, a free Web navigation service featuring a
searchable and browsable directory of more than 125,000 sites
chosen by a team of 25 Britannica editors for their quality and
usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers an editorial forum for some of the world's
leading thinkers and writers. Early contributors have included
novelist Scott Turow, Slate editor Michael Kinsley,
artificial-intelligence expert Marvin Minsky and civil rights
activist Lani Guinier.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to search on eBLAST. Users can enter a word,
name or phrase in a window on the opening screen, or browse an
outline of 17 major subjects, clicking anywhere in the outline to
find subtopics that will lead to a Web site. eBLAST uses AltaVista
technology for its searches.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features is the Britannica Quick Search, a
toolbar that gives access to the entire suite of online reference:
eBLAST, Sample Search from the online encyclopedia, and the
Merriam-Webster dictionary and thesaurus. After a one-click
download, the EB button resides in a corner of the computer screen.
All the user has to do is click on it, type in a search term and
indicate the reference desired.

   Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. is based in Chicago. For more
information, call 1-800-747-8503.

   New mouse a mighty mite
</P>
<P>
   A lack of available space can be just as much of a problem on a
desktop as it is on a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Suncom Technologies is trying to remedy that with its Atom
Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse measures just 3 1/2-by-3 1/2 inches. To control the
cursor position on the screen, it uses an optical code bar that
moves in a small arc on a stationary pad that takes up no more
space than a trackball. The mouse never leaves the pad.
</P>
<P>
   The company is targeting users of laptop, notebook and portable
computers, and ``road warriors'' who use computers in cars, trains
or planes.
</P>
<P>
   Suncom, the Wheeling, Ill.-based subsidiary of a Hong Kong firm,
is best known for its F-15 Strike Fighter series of joysticks for
air-combat software. For more information, check out the company's
Web site at http://www.suncominc.com.

   The Atom Mouse retails for $40.

   Bringing fine art home
</P>
<P>
   Images of staggering beauty reside within the walls of museums.
But many of us never get to visit the great repositories of art in
our own country, much less the Prado in Madrid, Spain, or the
Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, or the Louvre in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Broderbund is trying to bring some of the
museums' offerings to the rest of us with FineArt, the latest in
its ClickArt family of products.
</P>
<P>
   FineArt includes more than 8,500 images, divided into categories
such as scenic watercolors, fine art oil paintings and elegant
landscapes, as well as 36 fonts and four decorative alphabets. The
software is intended for use in cards, invitations, address labels,
advertisements or just about anything that could use an elegant
splash of color to dress it up.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the images are lifted from museum walls, but the company
says each was handpicked based on its beauty and artistry.
</P>
<P>
   The software includes a full-featured image
browser/viewer/converter and works with dozens of desktop
publishing programs. It requires Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 running
on at least a 486 computer with 4 to 8 megabytes of RAM, a
256-color display and a 2X or faster CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   FineArt retails for $30. Broderbund's other offerings in the
ClickArt series can be seen at the company's Web site:

   Bat makers step up to plate
</P>
<P>
   Two baseball bat manufacturers have sued the NCAA over changes
to bat specifications and performance scheduled to take effect Aug.
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA rules change _ which included reducing the diameter of
the bats and decreasing the allowable speed of a ball coming off a
bat _ was a response to concerns that high-tech bats could lead to
serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Easton Sports Inc., maker of the Z-Core scandium-alloy aluminum
bat, filed a restraint-of-trade lawsuit this month against the NCAA
in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Kan., and is seeking $267
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Baum Research and Development, which makes wood composite bats,
also sued for unspecified damages, accusing the NCAA of conspiracy
to monopolize the bat industry.

Digital video disc can swallow CD-ROMs 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My (relatively) new computer is equipped with a
DVD-ROM drive, a technology for which little appears to be
available presently, so I had to go afield for something with which
I could make valid comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   For the purpose, Microsoft sent me the DVD, or digital video
disc, version of its popular Encarta Deluxe encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   The chief advantage of DVD is an enormous increase in capacity.
Digital video discs are the same physical size as ordinary CD-ROM
discs; my drive will read both kinds.
</P>
<P>
   But the single disc of the DVD version of Encarta not only
contains the two-disc CD version, but also Microsoft Bookshelf and
Virtual Globe. DVDs will hold as much as 4.7 gigabytes of
information, as opposed to the roughly 680 megabytes on the
standard CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   What formerly required five discs now fits on one, and in an
enhanced form, too. It is difficult to determine exactly how much
has been added to this version of Encarta itself. My CD-ROM version
of the encyclopedia contained 73 videos; the DVD-ROM has 104.
Furthermore, they can be expanded from their very small starting
size to what would be full screen if you are running your video
card at 800x600. Quality is excellent at that greater size.
</P>
<P>
   There are more of the 360-degree views included in the tour
section.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how rapidly this technology
becomes commonplace. It comes at a time when publishers are
becoming more willing to expand programs onto multiple discs, which
is not really a problem for games, where the insertion of new discs
is progressive and there is no need to swap them in and out.
</P>
<P>
   But putting encyclopedias on more than one disc, and forcing the
user to swap them back and forth, is annoying to us couch potatoes
who went through all that with floppies years ago and thought it
was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no reliable predictor of industry trends. But since DVD-ROM
drives will read both formats, the changeover from one format to
the other would be relatively painless. Unfortunately, the world we
live in now doesn't seem to be driven by things such as
encyclopedias and other electronic reference tools, despite their
enormous value.
</P>
<P>
   It took a game _ ``Myst'' _ to bring the CD-ROM into every
computer room. It will probably take some gargantuan game, with
exquisite graphics running full screen with no loss of quality, to
put DVD over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have reviewed Encarta 98 already, and since the 99
version will be forthcoming soon, I won't rehash that, rather than
to say the DVD version is even nicer than the standard one.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Bookshelf now contains nine separate reference works:
Roget's Thesaurus, the Columbia quotations book, an encyclopedia,
dictionary, the latest World Book almanac, an atlas, something
called The People's Chronology, an Internet directory and, wonder
of wonders, Microsoft's excellent computer dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   If you had the computer dictionary, you would be able to
understand the computer writers who talk about really heavy stuff
like thin clients and thin servers. You would also be pleased to
know there are fat versions of these things, too.
</P>
<P>
   You can access just one of these books, or search through the
entire collection.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Globe is an excellent study tool. Its chief selling
point is its flyovers of certain parts of the world, marking the
cities and showing the terrain. But this is limited; its greatest
value is its excellence as a standard atlas, fully up to the job of
dealing with the homework of most students through high school. It
is very easy to navigate through, too.
</P>
<P>
   Having all these tools on a single disc is as close as we can
get right now to research nirvana on the personal computer.

SURFING THE WEB FOR NEWS IN A BLOCKBUSTER NEWS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traffic to news sites on the World Wide Web soared last week,
suggesting that more people than ever turn to the Web to follow
breaking news stories _ particularly from the workplace, where
television sets can be scarce. Indeed, on both Monday afternoon,
while President Clinton was testifying, and Thursday afternoon,
when he was announcing military strikes on terrorist targets,
record numbers on news sites were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that our busiest times are during the U.S.
business day,'' said Kerrin Roberts, a spokesman for CNN
Interactive. For Monday, the site reported a 31 percent increase
over its previous busiest day, which occurred in April.
</P>
<P>
   Relevant Knowledge, a measurement firm in Atlanta, reported an
increase of nearly 43 percent to 11 news sites _ including MSNBC,
ABCnews.com and The New York Times on the Web, as well as the
Drudge Report, which was included because of its role in reporting
on the brewing Monica Lewinsky matter in January.
</P>
<P>
   While the quest for the latest information is part of the
attraction of the Web, many of those who went online did so to do
what the Web allows for best: the expression of personal opinion.
Opinion was something that was not in short supply during the
week's news events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise and the expectation of the Internet is the ability
to reach out and touch everyone,'' said Jim Schulte, editor of the
online edition of USA Today. ``That's the whole strength. Everyone
gets their 2 cents in.''
</P>
<P>
   More people posted messages to bulletin boards on America Online
about the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship than in the aftermath of
the death a year earlier of Diana, princess of Wales. That could be
as much a reflection of the growth of the online medium as it is
the nature of the news reports involved, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is building as more and more people get online,'' said Adam
Clayton Powell III, vice president for technology at the Freedom
Forum, a free-speech advocacy group based in Arlington, Va. He
foresees a day when the primary sources of news will be online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we have one of these big events, it's another big
boost up,'' he said, ``and each time the peak is a little higher.
The thing that's hard to predict is where it all starts to
plateau.''

FCC WANTS HDTV GLITCH SOLVED SOON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, worried that a small technical problem will impede the
transition to digital television that is scheduled to begin in just
10 weeks, has written a sharp letter to industry leaders demanding
that the problem be solved by Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the special cable that is needed to carry a digital,
high-definition television signal from a set-top cable converter
box to an HDTV set. The technical work on that new cable is not
finished. This means that cable subscribers who buy the costly new
sets will be unable to receive any of the digital programming that
broadcasters are scheduled to begin showing in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``These compatibility problems must be resolved quickly to
ensure that American consumers are able to enjoy the benefits of
digital television starting this fall,'' FCC Chairman William
Kennard wrote on Aug. 13. Two-thirds of the nation's television
viewers are cable subscribers, and the transition to digital
television will be hobbled if these people are unable to receive
any of the new digital programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason why this should not be complete by Nov. 1,
1998,'' Kennard wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was addressed to Decker Anstrom, president of the
National Cable Television Association, and Gary Shapiro, president
of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association. So far,
neither has answered it.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Shapiro and a cable association spokesman both
said work was proceeding at a rapid pace. But neither was willing
to commit himself to completing it by Nov. 1. After receiving
Kennard's letter, however, Shapiro's group created an internal
committee to concentrate on solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The research work is under way at an industry-supported
laboratory, Cable Television Laboratories Inc. in Colorado. Richard
Green, the laboratory's president, said he expected to have a draft
specification complete by Oct. 1. At that time, he added,
manufacturers could begin designing equipment for the new cable.
</P>
<P>
   But approval by national standard-setting bodies probably will
not come until late November, Green said, and world standards
bodies will not be able to approve the new device until early
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kennard's deadline is met, the first digital television
sets with the new cable jacks probably will not go on sale until a
year later. So Kennard urged the industries to find some sort of
interim solution as well.
</P>
<P>
   Several television manufacturers, including Sony and Zenith, say
they may have their own proprietary solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard wrote, ``I call on your industries to communicate to
the American public that these solutions will be available and to
redouble your efforts to enable the American public to receive
digital broadcast programming over cable for display on
first-generation digital-television sets.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Mr. Whipple, where are you now?
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the big unanswered question during two days of
high-powered industry talk, as some of the most practiced dream
merchants in America assembled here at the headquarters of Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co. to ponder the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G grew to be the nation's largest consumer products company in
large part by grasping the storytelling power first of radio and
then of television, and by using those media to tell the company's
own 30- and 60-second stories, like the constant battles of Mr.
Whipple to find time to squeeze his Charmin in peace. And often
those narratives were inserted into 30- and 60-minute stories of a
serial genre that Procter helped create just for that purpose: the
soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Whether heartwarming or annoying, these product parables worked
their way into the back of shoppers' minds so that they would reach
for the Charmin, or for other Procter brands like Crest or Tide,
while rolling their carts down supermarket aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Internet has become the first medium to
actually reduce the viewership of television _ and World Wide Web
surfers have shown little interest in serial storytelling _ Procter
is trying to figure out how to sell soap without soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the company convened a two-day ``summit'' meeting
that brought together some 400 top executives from Internet and
consumer marketing companies, including America Online and
Agency.com, Coca-Cola and Sears, and even Procter archrivals like
Unilever and Philip Morris' Kraft Foods unit.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the discussion centered on technical matters,
participants struggled with issues like whether Web sites,
so-called banner advertisements and other online vehicles can ever
achieve the emotional resonance of a little boy in a Crest
television commercial bounding up to say ``Look, Ma! No cavities!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of one slogan developed on the Net that
everybody knows,'' says Seth Godin, the chief executive of
Yoyodyne, an Internet promotion company. ``It's not a medium for
the Great Big Idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Internet executives who attended the meeting argued
that P&AMP;G, in fact, was asking the wrong question. The Internet,
these experts said, might not be so much about mass-market brand
building as about providing detailed information about brands
consumers already recognize from other media, the way Ford Motor
does with its automobiles, or for selling things directly, as
Amazon.com does with books.
</P>
<P>
   Though often vaunted as the first medium that enables marketers
to interact with consumers one to one, the Web has yet to reveal
itself as a means for mass marketing the communal dreams in which a
box of detergent or a can of soda comes to symbolize a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be the current limitations in bandwidth,
or network carrying capacity, that make the Web better suited to
text, still images or simple animation than high-fidelity sound and
full-motion video.
</P>
<P>
   John Sculley, the former president of Pepsico and former chief
executive of Apple Computer, who is now an investor in various
Web-related ventures, said in a recent interview that today's
Internet simply cannot be used to create the sort of hip imagery
employed by Pepsi in the early 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we created the Pepsi Generation, we needed to make Pepsi
a drink that says something about the people who drank it,''
Sculley said. ``The Web isn't ready for that emotion yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Procter and others insist that they can, indeed must, find
ways to use the Internet to peddle packaged goods like dishwashing
liquid, diapers and soap _ items that might fall into the purgatory
of who-cares commodities, without marketing's holy trinity of
product differentiation, brand recognition and unique selling
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, many Web sites for consumer products emphasize
information _ like recipes or health facts _ rather than the
emotive aura that is favored by many television commercials. But
one of P&AMP;G's goals for the summit meeting was to press reluctant
Internet companies to offer bigger, more elaborate advertisements
that can pull in the audience the way the best television
commercials can.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company and others contend that the
Internet may prove to be a catalyst for a broader change _ away
from a focus on products and toward services and experiences better
suited to delivery online than via any other medium.
</P>
<P>
   So far, P&AMP;G and other consumer product companies have been
doubtful enough of the payoff to have contributed only a small
fraction of the nearly $1 billion spent for online advertising last
year. The Internet, for example, represents only 0.4 percent of
Procter's $3 billion annual advertising budget. Unable to measure
any discernible sales attributable to their initial Internet
efforts, consumer product companies have so far shown themselves
unwilling to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Most online advertising today takes the form of banner ads _ the
wide, shallow rectangles often seen at the top or bottom of Web
pages, which if clicked with a mouse take the user to the
advertiser's Web site. But these banners were widely disparaged at
the P&AMP;G summit meeting as being too small, too ineffectual and
simply too easy to ignore, to perform the hard work of building
brands and selling products.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Neufeld, an analyst with the research firm Jupiter
Communications, presented data at the conference that underscored
these concerns. In a Jupiter survey, 21 percent of Internet users
polled said they never clicked on banner ads and another 51 percent
said they clicked only rarely.
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts notwithstanding, some big packaged-goods companies
have decided that they should take a leap of faith by stepping up
their online efforts. For example, Unilever, the company behind
brands like Popsicle, Lipton and Ragu, has signed a deal with
America Online that calls for experiments ranging from banner ads
to the creation of new online areas devoted to food, health,
cleaning and grooming.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-08-23-98 1747EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears you can sell automobiles and books online, but I
don't know if it will be a good place to sell detergent,'' Richard
Goldstein, head of the North American unit of Unilever, a
British-Dutch company, said in an interview. Still, ``you can't sit
back and wait to see what happens,'' Goldstein added. ``You have to
get involved and experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's Ragu spaghetti sauce was an Internet pioneer in 1995
when it set up Eat.com, a tongue-in-cheek site about Italian
cooking and culture, labeled Mama's Cucina, which Unilever's Lipton
Inc. food unit has continued to update.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, meanwhile, has put most of its online
marketing budget behind brands like Always panty liners, Tampax
tampons, Pampers diapers, Cover Girl makeup and Olean fat
substitute. (So far, there is no Charmin.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Those have a narrow target audience with a more personal
subject matter,'' said Denis Beausejour, P&AMP;G's vice president for
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for example, has turned Pampers.com into the
Pampers Parenting Institute, addressing various issues of concern
to new or expectant parents. And it is by no means the dry
reference library it might appear to be at first glance
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site lets a woman who is pregnant explore what will happen
to her in private, so she doesn't have to ask stupid questions,''
Beausejour said. ``That's as emotional as you can get in that
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to put entertainment on their sites to
attract wired children and teen-agers. Unilever's Popsicle.com site
offers games, and Warner-Lambert's Certs.com site enables users to
send electronic greeting cards to people with whom they want to get
cozy.
</P>
<P>
   But what about products with even less emotive potential than
breath mints?
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a big challenge with selling soap on the
Internet,'' said Rex Briggs, vice president of Millward Brown
Interactive, a company that tests the effectiveness of advertising.
``Right now the brands that do well are those that the consumer is
already pretty interested in. There isn't a lot of excitement
surfing a site about shampoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is because some products are so inherently unexciting
that Procter has been so insistent that Internet publishers allow
it to offer more attention-getting advertising. The company and
other advertisers would like to see bigger ads than the standard
banner _ especially those called ``interstitials,'' which are
screens that pop up to interrupt Web surfing the same way
television ads are inserted into breaks in programming.
</P>
<P>
   And Procter wants more sites to accommodate advertisements that
use techniques known as ``rich media,'' which can enable both
banners and bigger ads to include animation, sound and even full
video.
</P>
<P>
   IPSOS/ASI, another research firm, released a study at the
conference indicating that larger, more complex types of
advertising are remembered more and are more likely to prompt users
to click on them. Many Internet publishers, however, complain that
interruptions by interstitials and the surfing slowdowns caused by
rich-media ads will scare off their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic methodology of advertising since I've been alive has
been breaking and entering,'' said Meyer Berlow, the head of sales
for America Online. ``I jump in front of you, amuse you a little,
give you a piece of information I hope will change your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``that's a brain-dead model,'' Berlow said of the
in-your-face approach. ``It worked when there were only three
channels and the bathroom. Now the consumer has a million
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   For packaged-goods companies, like all manufacturers, the
capabilities of the Web raise the question of whether they will
start selling goods directly to customers rather than, as they now
typically do, indirectly through wholesalers and retailers. While
big-ticket items like computers or cars, or even less costly
products like books, may be conducive to direct sales, the cost of
packing and shipping a single tube of toothpaste or a lone jar of
spaghetti sauce makes direct sales of individual items impractical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be hard pressed to see the potential of selling our
products to consumers one to one,'' Goldstein of Unilever said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a number of companies, led by Peapod
(www.peapod.com) and Netgrocer (www.netgrocer.com), that are
seeking to replace conventional supermarkets by taking online
orders for a full load of groceries and shipping them to consumers.
For the packaged-goods companies, the aim would be to continue
making their brands the ones consumers place in their virtual
shopping carts.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, for example, has struck a deal with Netgrocer to use
pop-up ads to promote its products as people shop online, much as
Unilever works with supermarket chains to create in-store
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that demographic shifts and the rise of the
female work force has changed the audience for daytime television
soap operas, the Internet is a medium affected by and reflecting
societal trends. In the case of the Web, this may mean less
emphasis by packaged-goods purveyors on individual products and
greater attention to service.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein says, for instance, that the average household now
spends an average of 20 minutes a day shopping for and preparing
dinner _ down from two and a half hours 30 years ago. That may
require food combines to sell not mere food but ``meal solutions,''
which may include a package of ready-to-assemble ingredients
supported by online information and help.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble is looking at using the Internet to sell
products with far more variations than could be sold through
traditional supermarket chains. It has already designed an online
ordering system for its Millstone premium coffee brand, for
example, that lets consumers create their own blends, which are
then shipped to them monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ask you 20 or 25 questions and blend a blend of
Millstone that you will find vastly superior to the coffee you
drink today,'' Beausejour said. ``We can do things on the Internet
that are not possible today in a big scale.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 PHILADELPHIA: doing that. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the same time, mergers have also sometimes accelerated
electronic banking. Rubin, the Tower analyst, points to two
examples of this: the combination of NationsBank and Florida's
Barnett Bank and the acquisition of Corestates Financial Corp. by
First Union Corp. In both cases, he said, a smaller, regional bank
that had been slow to offer online banking was forced to change
plans once it was purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions were slower to introduce Internet banking than we
thought,'' Rubin said. ``Of the top 100 banks, only about 30 have a
transactional Web site. Another 30 to 40 more are planning to offer
it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he added, so-called virtual banks, which were
created to exist solely on the Internet, have reluctantly had to
acknowledge the need for face-to-face interaction with customers
for products like loans and have opened conventional
brick-and-mortar branches.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of these, Atlanta-based Security First Network Bank,
was created in 1995. It opened its first branch _ it calls it a
``city office'' and the staff ``customer assistants'' _ in January
1997, said Eric Hartz, bank president.
</P>
<P>
   Security First also has a software division that competes with
Integrion, and dozens of banks now use its Internet-based system.
</P>
<P>
   Security First was acquired earlier this year by Royal Bank of
Canada, which has said it plans to spin off the software division
as a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin projects that U.S. banks will spend $336 million this year
for online initiatives and accelerate that process at an annual
growth rate of 29 percent for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Original estimates were off base, he said, because the banking
industry looked at the explosion of Internet use in 1994 and 1995
and predicted a similar pattern for electronic banking.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, banks found themselves limited by systems they had
built around personal finance software, which required the user to
buy frequent upgrades and limited the design of the overall
service.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based systems do away with those issues and offer other
strengths as well: questions can be answered quickly by e-mail,
applications for accounts and services can be transmitted
electronically, and a bank can more closely track a customer's
account, which in turn enables it to market products or services
like insurance, credit cards and auto and home loans.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers had any number of reasons for not quickly embracing
electronic banking. The software was expensive, the service was
often unreliable, technical support was limited, and the security
of financial data was unproved.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Integrion's Wallace said, the services were not
well designed. Bill payment, for example, often cost a hefty
monthly fee for not much added convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based systems now emerging enable utility, phone,
credit card and other companies to bill customers electronically;
customers, in turn, can approve payments by e-mailing instructions
to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the newest software and best system designs,
many questions have to be answered before banks start closing
branches and eliminating staff. Don Kunz, manager of electronic
banking for PNC Bank of Pittsburgh, said that it was anyone's guess
when the bank might see real savings from the Web-based system it
introduced in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still struggling with `What does the customer want to
do?' and `As a bank, have we created a redundant way of doing
business?' '' Kunz said.``Our biggest criteria for success will be
customer usage. We need to figure out whether it adds revenue or
just additional expense.''

MERGERS AND YEAR 2000 SLOW ONLINE BANKING
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID J. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Earlier this decade, bankers and software
developers looked ahead eagerly to 1998 and 1999 as the period when
electronic banking would evolve from a niche business to a
ubiquitous service, saving financial institutions millions of
dollars in transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is proving to be the era of megamergers and
millennium preparation, two issues that have distracted software
and system developers and have, for the time being anyway, delayed
consumer banking via personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have expected more activity at this point in our
evolution,'' said Scott Wallace, director of marketing for
Integrion Financial Network LLC, a leading developer of electronic
banking software. ``But the rapid consolidation diverts the
attention of institutions. It takes a long time to integrate two
different systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Original estimates that 15 percent of banking customers in the
United States would be on line by 2000 have now been pushed back
two years. Now, about 6 percent of customers nationwide have
electronic banking available, said Ian Rubin, senior analyst at
Tower Group in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The main distraction has been the greatest rush of bank mergers
in history _ more than $200 billion in the first half of this year
alone. In each case, a merger requires a melding of different and
sometimes stubbornly incompatible computer systems. And as the
millennium approaches, solutions that the merging banks have
adopted to fix the year 2000 problem must also be made compatible.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, banks that saw themselves as takeover targets
halted further development of electronic-banking initiatives, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there has been a bright side to the delay. A new
generation of consumer electronic banking, based on Internet
connections, promises to replace today's myriad bank-specific and
incompatible software programs that offer access by direct dial-up
connections to a bank's computer. Bank analysts predict that
improved systems using Internet browser-based software will draw
millions of new customers to online banking as merger frenzy slows
and prices for the services decline.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank introduced its Internet-based system, the latest
incarnation of its Direct Access electronic banking service, in
October after upgrading to the most robust encryption security
available, said a spokeswoman, Maria Mendler.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has offered various versions of Direct Access since
1984, when forecasters were predicting a personal computer on every
kitchen table by 2000, Ms. Mendler said. Today, the bank has about
300,000 electronic-banking clients and those using the older
software will be moved to the Internet-based version by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, she said, are motivated by cost more than technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a real jump in 1995, when we eliminated the fee,'' Ms.
Mendler said.
</P>
<P>
   The industrywide shift to Internet-based systems has come at the
expense of personal financial management software like Microsoft
Corp.'s Money, Intuit Corp.'s Quicken and Meca Software's Managing
Your Money. All three had been widely used by banks on the consumer
end of direct dial-up systems. But such software has serious
drawbacks. If a customer changes banks, for example, he usually has
to switch software as well, because no two bank systems integrate a
program in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, browser programs for navigating the World Wide Web
offer customers and banks a universal interface on almost any
computer system and eliminate problems that customers often
encounter installing proprietary software.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the open systems is a package developed by
Integrion, a Philadelphia-based consortium of 17 banks, IBM and
Visa USA. Integrion created a platform for banks to interact with
customers for a range of retail services using the Internet, direct
dial-up software or a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six months,'' Integrion's Wallace said, ``the Web
has become more important, and banks that might not have focused on
a transactional Web site now are doing that.''

CATTLEMEN IN SEARCH OF STOCK TURNING TO THE WEB

(ART ADV: A photo of David Reynolds is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling

 By ARLENE WEINTRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What with working his day job as a technician for a company that
sells artificial insemination gear to the cattle industry, and then
running his own side business breeding and selling Holstein dairy
cows, David Reynolds does not have much time to attend the cattle
auctions that are a crucial part of his vocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work seven days a week, so it's hard for me to travel to an
auction yard and sit in a tent and bid,'' said Reynolds, whose
small business, Higher Plain Genetics, is in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Reynolds, animal husbandry _ like so many other
commercial endeavors these days _ has gone online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Reynolds said. ``You just get up in the morning,
log on, see where the prices are and place your bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Web-based transactions still represent but a tiny fraction of
the $31 billion annual beef-cattle and $23 billion dairy-farming
industries. But the number of Web-based commercial cattle resources
is estimated at 1,000 and growing, with the leaders including
Cattle Offerings Worldwide _ or COW, for short.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when Reynolds was in the market for
top-of-the-line Holstein embryos, he logged onto COW
(www.cattleofferings.com) and clicked his way through an auction,
pulling up snapshots of the donor cows and reading their vital
statistics and ancestry _ all the while watching bids stream from
around the world. Within an hour, his own bid of $520 each for four
embryos from a Virginia breeder had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Before he even had time to arrange for delivery, though,
Reynolds received a call from someone else who had been
participating in the auction and wanted to know if he would be
willing to resell the Holsteins-in-waiting at a higher price to a
breeder in Italy. ``So I resold them and made a $600 profit in 15
minutes,'' Reynolds recalled. ``The eggs were top quality and from
one of the best cow families in the United States. But I'm not
averse to making a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is still finding its place among the more
established methods that farmers use to buy and sell cattle, like
live auctions, advertisements in agricultural publications, and
business relationships nurtured by generations of farming families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense is that farmers are using the Net now mostly to get
breaking news,'' said John Walter, editor of (AT)griculture Online
(www.agriculture.com), an electronic offshoot of Meredith
Publishing's Successful Farming magazine. ``I don't think there's a
heck of a lot of commerce going on yet,'' Walter said. ``But we're
just on the verge of seeing things start to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a whole host of livestock professionals have gone to the
Web, most offering some form of classified advertising. Online
Livestock Corner (www.onlinelivestockcorner.com), for example,
posts ads not only for cattle, but also for horses, sheep, bison
and dogs. Other Web sites, though, deal only with specific breeds
of cattle, like www.beefalobeef.com, whose offerings range from ``O
Bar R's Semen'' to ``Big Sky Beefalo Meat Products.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lifeblood of the cattle trade is still the traditional
auction. That is why many industry experts believe that online
auctions could eventually make the Internet as vital a farming tool
as branding irons and milking machines.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Zaitz, founder and president of privately held COW, is one
of the pioneers of the Internet cattle industry. He started his
ad-supported site three years ago primarily as a meeting place for
buyers and sellers. But it was not until the advent of the Java
programing language for Web applications that he was able to
perfect a way for all auction players _ sellers, auctioneers and
buyers _ to conduct business in real time in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a system where everyone who was logged on would get
instant feedback,'' said Zaitz, a former cattle dealer who is based
in Chapel Hill, N.C. ``If you had the bid you would know instantly,
and if you were cut you would know instantly,'' he said. ``Java
allowed us to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since COW's auction system went operational last year, Zaitz
said, about $300,000 worth of cattle, embryos and bull semen have
been traded. COW earns commissions ranging from 2 percent to 15
percent on each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading player in the field, Cyber Stockyard
(www.cyberstockyard.com), based in Starkville, Miss., takes a
slightly different approach. Scott Sanders, Cyber Stockyard's
president, sends representatives to real auctions who provide live
chat-room coverage via the Web. Customers can log on, view a
catalog of the offerings, and submit their bids electronically to
the Cyber Stockyard representatives, who call them out as the
auctioneer is also hearing bids from those in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whose family has been in cattle trading for decades,
also offers a placement service that electronically searches for
cattle based on a buyer's or seller's specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   How have ranchers and dairymen reacted to all this new
technology?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some think it's the best thing since sliced bread,'' Sanders
said. ``Some think it's the stupidest thing they've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the converts tend to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Yackley, customer relations and marketing manager for
Express Ranches in Yukon, Okla., concedes that his company's cattle
sales through Cyber Stockyard have been minimal so far _ only seven
head among hundreds sold in one recent auction, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the real advantage for us is that it opens up a worldwide
market,'' Yackley said. ``People from, say, Brazil or Australia can
bid, and people in the U.S. who might not be able to afford to
travel from point A to point B can come to the auctions, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-08-23-98 1705EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention less wear and tear on the livestock. ``When you
put cows on trucks and haul them to auctions, they lose weight,''
Zaitz said. ``When they get chased around and jostled, they get
nervous _ they make manure and urine, and that causes weight
loss.'' This ``shrink,'' as it is known in the industry, typically
knocks a few percent off a cow's value.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the health issues. ``Taking a cow to auction is
much like putting a child in day care,'' said James Henderson, a
market analyst at Cattle-Fax, an information service based in
Englewood, Colo. (www.cattle-fax.com). ``Just as a child can get
sick from being around other children, when cattle from different
places get together and one herd's health program is not so good,
all the cattle might get sick. When you sell straight off the farm,
you eliminate the problem of commingling.''
</P>
<P>
   For all these benefits, though, neither COW's or Cyber
Stockyards' auctions are profitable yet. ``I'm just as good at
losing money as Amazon.com,'' Zaitz joked.
</P>
<P>
   Changing traditional ways of farming and ranching will take
time, Zaitz predicted, because cattlemen ``just don't have time to
make something new work when they've got to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   And simply getting on the Net can often be a challenge in rural
areas. ``Reasonably priced Internet access is not as good as it is
in the city,'' said Walter, the online editor. ``But it's
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, evidently, is the interest. According to Gallup's 1998
``Trends in Agriculture'' survey (www.agpub.org/gallup/index.htm),
while only 22 percent of beef producers currently use the Internet,
an additional 55 percent say they intend to start within the next
three years. Among dairy producers, only 16 percent use the
Internet now, but another 62 percent expect to log on within three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Zaitz's goal is to reach those cattle buyers by providing
auction-house owners with the technology they need to make a Web
presence a standard part of their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need the Internet to sell a couple of oddball steers in
Kentucky?'' he said. ``Maybe not. But why should people have to
travel from stockyard to stockyard buying herds of cattle when they
can use the Internet?''

 Printers On the Way For the iMac  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I've been thinking about getting an Apple iMac. The only
thing that concerns me is whether I'll be able to get a printer
that will work with it, since it only has a USB port. Is anybody
planning to come out with a USB printer soon? And what about other
peripherals such as mice and Zip drives?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  All major printer-makers will have USB models within the
next few months that will work with any computer that has a USB
port. Also, companies are starting to sell cables that convert a
standard parallel port printer to USB. In fact, Hewlett-Packard
already has announced USB cables for its DeskJet 670C and 690C
printers, and Epson has announced one for its Stylus 600.
</P>
<P>
   USB-compatible mice are already available from market leaders
Microsoft and Logitech. And Iomega is planning to introduce a USB
version of its popular Zip drive soon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I am in my truck a lot calling on customers, and I want to
use a laptop to keep track of my contacts. I will be booting up
anywhere from three to 10 times a day after sales calls. Because I
won't be near an electrical outlet, I'm afraid I'll run down the
battery in the computer. Is there a way to recharge using the
battery in the truck?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  As Curley would say, ``Soitenly.'' All the big
computer-makers sell special cables that let you plug your lapt &QR; 
ePfw41~to the cigarette lighter in the car or truck or boat or
whatever. You can treat this connection just like a regular plug in
your house. That is, you can run the computer off it, or use it to
recharge, or both. Expect to pay about $90.
</P>
<P>
   You also can find cables that convert your regular laptop power
cord into a mobile charger. That's a good option if you can't find
a car cable for your specific model laptop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I've got a Packard Bell with a 75 MHz Pentium and 16
megabytes of memory. I'm thinking of getting Windows 98, and I'd
like to know: A) Will I need more memory? and B) If so, how can I
find out what kind I need? Also, is it hard to upgrade, or should I
let a store do it for me?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  You don't need any more memory to run Windows 98 than you
need for Windows 95. But doubling your memory to 32 megs would
speed up your system appreciably. So it's definitely worth the
upgrade, especially because the kind of memory your computer uses
has become pretty cheap. You should be able to get 16 megs for
under $30.
</P>
<P>
   I believe your Packard Bell uses standard 72-pin SIMM chips. But
just to be sure, check the manual or call the company. That way
you'll know exactly what kind and how many chips to buy. As for
upgrading, it's a simple procedure, but if you feel queasy about
opening up the PC, let the store do it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I recently removed several programs I was no longer using
by deleting their folders in Windows Explorer. Then I noticed that
when I go to Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel, the programs
are still listed. When I try to remove them, I get a message saying
``Cannot locate install.log.'' How do I get rid of the programs and
make sure they're truly gone?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Don't worry, they're gone. But since you didn't use
Add/Remove Programs to delete them, Windows thinks they're still
there. It's possible to remove the names, but it's complicated and
involves going into the Windows Registry. You don't want to do
that. Trust me. Just live with it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Netscape Update &LR;  _ Last week, I noted that Netscape
Communicator doesn't let you view a list of e-mail messages and a
directory of e-mail folders in the same window. But Netscape has
corrected that oversight with version 4.5 of Communicator, which is
now in beta testing and can be downloaded for free at
www.netscape.com. This new version can display the directory of
folders on the left and the list of messages on the right. In
addition, you can view the text of a selected message below the
list of messages. And you can drag messages from the list to any
folder in the directory.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; Want fast access to files you create in Word,
Excel or another Microsoft Office application? Put a shortcut to
the My Documents folder on your desktop. Just go to My Computer,
find the folder in the ``C'' drive and drag it to the desktop using
the right mouse button. Then click Create Shortcut(s) Here. When
you open the My Documents shortcut, double-clicking any item will
launch the associated application and open the file.

MORE ABOUT WEBTV: AMBITIOUS NEW CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's column on WebTV for Windows stirred up enough
questions from readers about TV cards for personal computers to
warrant a review of the latest and most ambitious of this breed of
hardware, All-in-Wonder Pro from ATI Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, this product is an all-in-one television,
video and graphics upgrade that can be installed in any Pentium
computer with an available PCI slot. PCI (for Peripheral Component
Interconnect) is a standard introduced several years ago by Intel
Corp. for high-speed, multitasking devices like video hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Most Pentium computers have two PCI slots, so before buying a TV
card or other high-speed video upgrade _ especially the new
generation of 3-D video cards _ make sure the machine has a free
PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   Another version of the All-in-Wonder Pro is available for owners
of Pentium II computers that have the new Accelerated Graphics
Port, or AGP, which can handle larger, more complex 3-D animations
by borrowing memory from the computer's RAM. This is especially
useful if the computer is often used for 3-D games or other
applications that do extensive three-dimensional rendering.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-Wonder comes in two versions, the original, which has
a minimum of two megabits and maximum of four megabits of
high-speed, EDO (Extended Data Out) memory.
</P>
<P>
   The card tested for this column was the All-in-Wonder Pro, a
more powerful version that offers twice as much memory, to a
maximum of eight megabits, and the memory is slightly faster. In
addition, the Pro version adds what is known as a 3-D Triangle
setup engine, which uses a sophisticated math processor to add
detail to complex 3-D animations, and DBX brand television audio,
which cuts the background hiss and static to deliver clear, bright
sound approaching CD quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro also allows people with similar equipment to conduct
videoconferences and includes extra features beyond the scope of
this review. It also comes bundled with multimedia and game
software that show off the card's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The basic All-in-Wonder retails for about $150. The Pro version
is twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Installation is straightforward and well-documented, and all the
drivers and other setup software are delivered on a self-starting
CD-ROM. But installing the card requires opening the computer, so
users who are squeamish about exposing the machine's guts should
probably buy the card from a retailer that will install it.
</P>
<P>
   Both cards were tested in low-end machines. The All-in-Wonder
was installed in a home-built 100-megahertz Pentium computer
running Windows 95, and the Pro version was installed in an AST
computer with a 166-megahertz Pentium MMX processor running Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   The only glitch in both cases was that installing the
All-in-Wonder for some reason removed the speaker icon from the
tool bar tray and muted the line input in the Windows sound mixer,
resulting in no sound from the on-board television until the
original audio settings had been restored. This problem is not
mentioned in the original or supplemental documentation for either
card, but it was not difficult to diagnose and fix.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hardware and software are installed, the card has to be
told whether it is connected to an antenna or cable system. It then
scans to find all available channels _ as many as 125 on cable
systems and 70 on antennas. In either case, the setup time, from
breaking the seal on the package to sitting back to watch
television, was about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reception on a Comcast cable hookup was far superior to
reception of standard televisions in the same house _ or at least
seemed to be. Some of this is an eye-brain trick that's performed
by many TV cards, a result of the higher scan rate of computer
monitors relative to televisions, and the fact that viewers tend to
sit much closer to a monitor than to a television set.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the soft, flicker-free image can be
attributed only to fine electronics in the tuner part of the ATI
card. Previously tested cards connected to the same cable system
could not match the ATI's image quality.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the card is rich in features. While
WebTV, the television software that comes with Windows 98,
showcases the strength of blending the Internet with television,
ATI's software demonstrates that mating the computer and the
television can produce a surprisingly useful information appliance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a standard television, closed captioning is
primarily a technology for people with hearing disabilities,
although it is occasionally used to avoid bothering someone
sleeping in the same room or in noisy public places like Times
Square, where audio is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   On a PC-TV hybrid, closed captioning takes on data-base
characteristics. The text can be searched for keywords, stored in a
file as a complete transcription of a program, or told to flag the
viewer if certain words are spoken on any channel that is being
scanned. This feature can be set so that a television window pops
up, either full screen or in a smaller window on the desktop,
whenever certain words are spoken in a program, allowing the user
to work uninterrupted until certain subject matter appears.
</P>
<P>
   Complete transcripts of programs can be saved in several
formats, which ATI calls ``TV magazines.'' The advantage of these
is that the text is saved in rich text format (.rtf files) that can
be read by most word processors. The magazine feature also
intersperses black-and-white screen shots in the text at a
frequency defined by the user _ that is, one picture per so many
words of text _ and changes the all-capital-letter text that closed
captioning delivers into upper- and lower-case text.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-08-24-98 1714EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the most useful of ATI's tools is a feature that
continuously scans the channels available and builds a grid of
thumbnail images of what is playing on each channel at that moment.
On a monitor set at a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels, this
feature displays the current programing on as many as 80 channels
simultaneously. The user can double-click on any thumbnail to tune
to that channel.
</P>
<P>
   The memory in the card is employed in several ways that make the
PC-TV hybrid more interesting than standard television, including
storing two to 10 seconds of video streams for instant replays.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has used a high-quality image editing program like
Adobe Photoshop will appreciate the ability of ATI software to save
``screen grabs'' as graphic still images. And, ATI's television
software allows the user to define a rectangle on the television
screen by dragging a mouse and then zooming in to just that portion
of the image.
</P>
<P>
   The software also captures full-motion video and/or audio and
saves it as an AVI (audio-video interleave) movie, although no type
of data eats disc space faster. The Pro version bundles MGI
Videowave, a video editing program that works with any source,
including the television tuner or a VCR, enabling users to edit
piece of video and create rudimentary special effects, fades and
titling.
</P>
<P>
   The card offers audio-visual input and output connections that
make it usable with any television, VCR, DVD, video CD or stereo
component. These include the single-cable S-Video connectors that
have become a standard for camcorders and VCRs, plus old-fashioned
composite video connectors that take traditional patch cords.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-Wonder viewer can be used for video formats other
than television, including MPEG (Motion Pictures Experts Group) and
AVI movie formats, and it includes a CD music player that is
slightly more advanced than the one shipped with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation accustomed to equating television with the
passive medium that spawned generations of couch potatoes, the
PC-TV hybrid begs a rethinking of what the appliance can, and maybe
should, be. At the very least, it is a lot more entertaining than
either of its progenitors. At best, it is an interactive
information machine that promises to grow more powerful over time.

BLESSING: GOD HAD NO PC FOR CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Wed be in a world o' hurt if God had used a PC for
creation!
</P>
<P>
   That's all I can conclude after collecting entries for the past
couple of weeks in our latest contest. Readers were asked to send
in examples of how things would be if God had used a PC to create
things.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the top three entries:
</P>
<P>
   Our second runner up was Bob Lind, who wrote that creation
``would have taken a lot longer than seven days. You'd have to
allow for the time He'd spend on hold for tech support!''
</P>
<P>
   Our first runner up was Doyle Holcomb, who wrote, ``God did
consider using a computer to create the universe, but he was unable
to come to an agreement with Bill Gates on the software to run it.
Talks broke off when Gates refused to use the word ``apple'' in a
program about two people in the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   First place went to Steve Hrovat, who sent in several great
examples of how things would be if God had used a PC for creation.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite was: ``Having a baby is considered a slow, painful
process by many. This was done out of God's frustration at having
to download an entire universe on a 2400-baud modem. It was a slow,
painful process. He figured he'd make `downloading' a baby an
equally painful process so people realize what he went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another gem from Hrovat: ``All humans are expected to go
to school at least 12 years to have any chance of success. This is
a throwback to the days of MS-DOS, which took God about 12 years to
figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``The Ten Commandments were done on a clay tablet
because God's printer driver had some type of bug in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was fun, eh? Thanks to everybody who sent in an
entry!
</P>
<P>
   We'd better stop now, though, or we'll all get struck by
lightning! &QL; 
Passwords to success
</P>
<P>
   A couple weeks ago I wrote about the growing problem of
passwords. These days, most people are walking around with one or
two in their heads. And it's not unusual to have five, 10 or more
passwords to remember, thanks to things like ATM machines and
Internet access accounts.
</P>
<P>
   I asked for your suggestions on good ways to remember passwords.
Here's what you said:
</P>
<P>
   - Several readers suggested using a single password for
everything. (This might work for some people, but there's got to be
something better you can do.)
</P>
<P>
   - Here's a variation on that theme from a reader named Eric:
Think of a person or pet in your life and use it to create slightly
unique passwords everywhere. Say your dog is named ``Fido.'' Your
password to log on to your computer could be ``fidocomp001.'' To
check your e-mail, the password could be ``fidoemail002'' and so
forth. (Not a bad idea.)
</P>
<P>
   - One reader said he put all his passwords in a computer file
and gave the file a mysterious name. That way he can open the file
any time he's online and needs a password quickly. (Interesting
idea, but not very secure.)
</P>
<P>
   - One guy proposed creating passwords based on your favorite
things _ you favorite fruit, favorite sports team, etc. Use the
first letter from each to make up the password. (An idea with some
merit.)
</P>
<P>
   - A reader said he maintains a free e-mail account and uses it
only to keep e-mails he sends himself that contain passwords and
other account information for accounts he sets up. ``Risky?'' he
asked. ``Sure, but what isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   - Here's a good one: A reader named Rozanne suggested thinking
up a sentence that has personal meaning. Then, use the first letter
from each word to create the password. Example: ``My father was
born on 3/7/22'' would create the password ``mfwbo3722.''
</P>
<P>
   - A Phoenix area company called Micro System Designs makes a
program called ``WebPassKey.'' It watches where you browse the Net
and remembers passwords and login names automatically. On your next
visit, it automatically enters the info for you. The software also
can be used to store passwords for other applications. Interested?
Call (602) 788-6000, or visit their Web site at www.maxlock.com.
</P>
<P>
   - A reader named Antoniu suggests keeping passwords in a single
file, then encrypting the file with a program such as PGP.
</P>
<P>
   - John recommends using Password Safe, a free program you can
download from www.zdnet.com. ``It's like having a little safe to
keep all of your passwords in,'' he wrote. ``Only one catch: You
need a password to get into Password Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   - Juergen says he uses his Palm Pilot to keep his passwords
safe. He puts them all in a single file, then uses a Palm Pilot
program called Secret to scramble the contents. Of course, you need
a password to read the file later.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there you have it. I hope some of those suggestions help
you out. I know I'm going to try a couple! &QL; 
Just another hoax
</P>
<P>
   Internet users have been passing around an e-mail lately that
refers to ``Time'' magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, the article states that two engineers at Intel
somehow managed to write the words ``Bill Sux'' on the surface of a
Pentium microchip. The graffiti is supposedly visible under a
powerful electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail points out that the reference to ``Bill'' is aimed at
Bill Gates, the billionaire head of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's fun to think that this actually happened. But, it
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   An Intel spokesman confirmed that the e-mail claim is somebody's
idea of a joke.
</P>

``chip,'' visit snopes.simplenet.com/spoons &QL;

Texas techies outnumber oilers 
By Kirk Ladendorf  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's official: nerds and geeks outnumber
wildcatters and roughnecks in the Lone Star state.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the presence of two of the world's biggest personal
computer makers _ Compaq in Houston and Dell in Round Rock _
oil-and-gas still packs a bigger economic punch than high-tech. In
a study released Monday, the state Comptrollers office said the
number of high-tech jobs in Texas surpassed those in the
oil-and-gas industry for the first time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is sure to continue, said Comptroller John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``High technology has emerged as one of the main engines of
economic growth in the state,'' said Comptroller John Sharp.
``There are strong signals that our high-tech industry will become
even more dominant in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, oil-and-gas accounted for 11 percent of the state's
economic output, while high-tech accounted for 8 percent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of jobs, however, high tech will continue to grow
beyond oil-and-gas. The report says jobs in the five core high-tech
businesses will pass 500,000 this year year, compared to 453,599 in
oil-and-gas.
</P>
<P>
   The core businesses are: semiconductors and computers;
communications, biotechnology, defense and electrical and
electronics equipment. Sharp released the study at a press
conference at the University of Texas at Dallas. The data also are
published in the comptroller's latest Fiscal Notes newsletter. It
is available online at
http://www.window.texas.gov/comptrol/fnotes/fnhome.html.
</P>
<P>
   When two related employment areas _ technical services and
``technology-intensive manufacturing'' _ are added, then Texas
high-tech employment swells to 781,000, or about 10 percent of the
state's work force.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech workers are far better paid than the typical Texas
worker, with an average annual salary of $48,000 compared with
$28,000 for all workers, but the benefits of the high-tech
explosion in the state are, for the most part, limited to the
state's largest metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of them are in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston,
while another 16 percent are in Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Triangle of Dallas-Forth Worth, Houston, Austin and
San Antonio are the primary beneficiaries'' of high-tech growth,
said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic
Development at the University of North Texas. ``It's not getting
spread out to the hinterlands of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein noted that three areas tied to petroleum and
petrochemicals, Beaumont, Odessa-Midland and Galveston-Texas City,
have high jobless rates of 7.7, 5.8 and 7.1 percent respectively.
By comparison, two high-tech centers, Dallas and Austin, have
jobless rates of 3.5 and 2.9 percent. High-tech has been gaining on
the oil-and-gas industry in Texas for some time. But the
comptroller's study said that the high-tech core industries gained
more than 51,000 jobs between 1994 and 1996 to top the 454,000 jobs
statewide and surpassed Texas' oil-and-gas employment for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas can keep training workers, high-tech jobs should keep
growing in the state, Sharp said. His office projects Texas will
add 51,000 high-tech industrial jobs in the next four years. Sharp
warned that the state must continue to train more workers for
high-technology jobs or risk having its job growth slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the computer power in Texas cannot match the brain power
of our young people,'' Sharp said. ``We have to do all we can to
create a technically skilled workforce to meet industry's demand.''

 Intel's New Pentium Chip to Send PC Prices Lower  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel's new top-of-the-line chip, the 450 MHz Pentium II, made
its debut this weekend, and at least one retailer, CompUSA, is
selling a system with the new chip for under $2,000. To anyone who
has followed the PC industry, that's nothing short of remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago, after all, that you had to pay over
$3,000 to get a system with a brand new high-end Intel chip. And
$2,000 barely got you last year's chip.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind my nostalgia. The bottom line here is that if
you're in the market for a new PC, put on your shopping shoes,
because prices are about to take a nose-dive across the board.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the introduction of the new Pentium II will force
prices lower for other desktop PCs using Intel chips, as well as
for systems that sport competitive chips from AMD and Cyrix.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, PCs with 266 MHz chips _ now considered the low
end _ could soon be available for less than $750 from some dealers.
And 300 MHz systems, which now sell for as little as $1,000, should
move down below $900. By year's end, the 300 MHz will be the entry
level.
</P>
<P>
   The picture isn't so rosy for`}ntel. The big Santa Clara company
is selling the new Pentium II 450 to computer-makers for $669 (when
bought in volume). That's a good deal less than the $824 it got for
the Pentium II 400 when it appeared in April _ and far below the
nearly $1,000 it commanded for the first Pentiums five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take an economist to conclude that when you shave
that much off the price, your profit margins go down. Intel will be
able to cushion the blow, because it continues to reap tremendous
profits from its notebook chips and chips used in corporate
workstations. But it's gotta hurt nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's overall gross margins this year should be around 52
percent. That's still high, but it's less than in years past, when
it topped 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A more imminent threat may face AMD, which has carved out a nice
business for itself selling chips for low-end systems. That
company's profit margins already are thinner than model Kate Moss,
but they're about to get thinner, and that could dampen AMD's hopes
of returning to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   AMD also faces renewed competition from the latest version of
Intel's Celeron _ Intel's entry in the sub-$1,000 market _ which
was introduced along with the Pentium II 450 over the weekend.
</P>

CONSUMERS HIT THE INTERNET FOR BARGAINS

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers 
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.) 
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Vigneau knew exactly what he wanted: a 1998 Volkswagen
Passat with a V-6 engine, silver paint, and black leather interior.
It's a vehicle that is hard to find on this side of the Atlantic.
But the Massachusetts software consultant knew exactly where to
look_ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Using his laptop computer, Vigneau discovered how much a car
dealer pays the factory for a new Passat; the information is
available at no charge on line. He also read on-line auto magazines
and messages from Volkswagen owners in Europe to get opinions on
the car. And he began e-mailing Volkswagen dealers in search of the
best price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pounding the pavement, Vigneau did nearly all his
research while sitting at a keyboard. He ended up paying $1,000
below sticker price for a hard-to-get car. ``By having the amount
of information that I did, from car review sites, to people's
personal experiences ... I knew enough so I wouldn't be taken for a
ride,'' Vigneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with streams of product information available on the
Internet, Vigneau and millions of other on-line consumers are
rewriting the rules of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of electronic shopping, information is power.
Businesses, consumer groups, and individuals publish vast amounts
of data about thousands of products _ data that shoppers can obtain
at the click of a mouse. Information that was once the private
possession of industry insiders is at the fingertips of any
consumer who cares to look. The results include better deals,
greater convenience, and retailers scurrying to preserve their
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have always benefited from the ignorance of their
customers. Sellers can pad their earnings by concealing the true
cost of goods they sell. They can withhold information about the
quality of merchandise. And sellers can count on the consumer's
limited patience, his unwillingness to visit one more store or buy
one more consumer-education magazine. But Internet shoppers can
overcome these barriers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester ResearchInc. in Cambridge, Mass., 5
percent of North American households bought something on line last
year, spending $2.4 billion. The number of on-line shoppers is
expected to double this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dollars spent on line only hint at the importance of
Internet shopping. The surge of Internet shoppers is turning
retailing upside down. For example, Portland, Ore.-based Egghead
Inc. stunned the retail world in February when it closed its 40
stores. The company changed its name to Egghead.com Inc. and began
selling products exclusively over the Internet or by telephone
order.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers will not go away
entirely. Consider Joseph Vigneau and his new Volkswagen Passat.
While he shopped for his car on the Internet, he actually made the
purchase at a traditional auto dealer. With products like cars,
many consumers still will want to see and test the wares.
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers still are finding money-saving information on line.
In order to attract visitors to their retail Web sites, companies
like bookseller Amazon.com or travel agents like Travelocitypublish
huge amounts of information that is free to all visitors, even if
they don't make a purchase. In addition, Internet access services
like America Online or Yahoo provide free consumer information to
boost the number of visitors to their advertiser-supported Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers have been among the first to feel the effects of
Internet shopping. Detailed information about cars is plentiful on
the World Wide Web. For example, Edmund Publications Corp. of
Beverly Hills, Calif., publishes its new- and used-car guides on
the Web with prices, product reviews, and comments from car owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resist the enlightened consumer, many car dealers
are joining organizations like Autobytel.com Inc., an on-line
buying system that helps direct customers to nearby dealerships
that have exactly the car they want.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the Autobytel site can type in exactly the car he
wants, starting with a base model and adding options. The system
provides the invoice price _ the cost of the car to the dealer _
and shows the consumer how to calculate additional factors like
destination charges and rebates. A visitor can get similar
information for hundreds of new and used cars. Once he makes a
choice, the buyer can type in his contact information and request a
bid from the nearest car dealer in the Autobytel network.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel president Mark Lorimer says that it is a good deal for
the seller as well as the buyer, because the system automates so
much of the selling process. Lorimer says it costs a dealer about
$1,260 to sell the average new car. Selling through Autobytel
lowers that cost to around $400. That means more savings for
consumers and higher profits for dealers. Lorimer estimates that
the nation's 2,700 Autobytel dealers sell between 20,000 and 25,000
cars a month using the on-line approach.
</P>
<P>
   But some auto dealers find they don't have to share their
profits with a firm like Autobytel in order to reach customers on
the Internet. Smith Volkswagen in East Providence, R.I., where
Vigneau bought his Passat, created its own Web site. And it's
working. The company gets 100 to 200 e-mail inquiries a day from
Web shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get Thailand, places in North Africa, Western Europe, South
America, pretty much everywhere,'' said Smith salesman Phil Teves.
The dealership gets so many long-distance queries because of its
reputation for being able to acquire hard-to-get models like the
silver Passat. Teves said 20 to 50 percent of the dealership's
monthly new-car sales come from Internet shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most visitors to retail Web sites buy nothing. But
many of them collect information for use at stores in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, the
electronic bookstore that is probably the Internet's best-known
retailer. ``One of the pieces of feedback we get is that for some
people, they find the book they want to buy, or the CD, and they
print it out on a sheet of paper and take it to the clerk'' at a
store, Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors write and apologize for not buying from Amazon.
Said Bezos, ``We send them back mail saying, `Don't worry about
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Amazon.com spent millions on its huge database of
books and music recordings to attract paying customers from around
the world. But it costs the company nothing extra when visitors
just browse. Those browsers could turn into buyers one day.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and organizations are jumping into the market for
on-line consumer information. Consumer Reports magazine has rolled
out a Web site that aims to build on the magazine's reputation for
reliable, honest product reviews. In keeping with the Consumer
Reports tradition, there is not a trace of advertising. That means
visitors must pay for the service, but the price is just $2.95 a
month or $24 a year. Thomas Falconer, manager of the site, said
140,000 people have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   There are also for-profit consumer information services on the
Internet, which support themselves through advertising. The most
interesting of these feature ``shopbots'' _ software that lets a
visitor search for a product at several Internet retailers. A
number of these shopbots are available through the major Internet
gateways _ sites like Yahoo or Lycos _ visited daily by millions of
users.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo search service has a section devoted to on-line
shopping. Visitors can locate hundreds of sources for a variety of
consumer goods, and compare prices and features. For instance, a
visitor looking for a computer priced between $1,000 and $2,000
gets 365 suggestions culled from several on-line electronics shops.
The user can order the products over the 'Net, or use the
information as a guide when shopping in a store.
</P>
<P>
   The Compare.Net service takes this concept even further. The
site includes product reviews, side-by-side comparisons, and links
to Usenet message boards where consumers discuss their experiences
with similar products.
</P>
<P>
   This last feature is one of the most significant changes the
Internet has brought to retailing. Until now, consumer
word-of-mouth usually traveled as far as the back fence or the
office water cooler. Today, many turn to the Usenet, a set of
thousands of electronic bulletin boards or ``newsgroups.'' There
are a couple of newsgroups for general consumer issues, but many
more that focus on specialized interests like cars, computers, home
electronics, and other topics. And people are not shy about
relating their experiences with the products they buy.

   David Dologite, 25, a Boston project manager, routinely visits
the Usenet before making major purchases, to see how others have
fared. ``I've found the newsgroups to be useful in getting a sense
of what the customer service is like for various companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The DejaNews search service maintains an archive of old Usenet
messages that can easily be searched using key words, such as the
name of a particular product.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers sign on to the Internet in search of
bargain-basement prices. Indeed, Amazon.com and other Internet
retailers have used the lure of sharply discounted prices to draw
customers. But on the whole, it is not clear that goods purchased
on line are much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   While much is made of cut-rate book prices, the discounts are
sharply reduced when shipping costs are added. And travelers
searching for cheap air fares can find them just as readily with a
phone call as they can on the Internet.Many other products on the
Internet _ computers for instance _ cost about the same as at a
discount electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   But for many consumers, finding exactly the right product _ say,
a silver Volkswagen with black leather interior _ is more important
than getting the lowest price. For these people, the Internet is on
its way to becoming the first place to look.

BAD NEWS TRAVELS FAST ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retailers beware. On the Internet, everybody will know if your
product is a dog.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is turning disgruntled shoppers into fearless
consumer advocates. Consumers can create or tap into a host of
``anti-sites,'' Web sites where customers can share complaints
about cheesy products and lousy service with an audience of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Yahoo Internet search service and run a search using
the words ``consumer opinion.'' You will find dozens of sites built
by ordinary people who want to denounce _ or occasionally praise _
a particular product. For fast food-phobics, there is the ``I Hate
McDonald's'' page. An angry airline passenger offers the ``Untied
Airlines'' page _ targeted at United Airlines. The boycott against
the Walt Disney Co.'s ``anti-Christian'' policies is backed by a
number of sites, while others support the company. And this does
not count another popular Internet service _ the Usenet, a system
of public bulletin boards or ``newsgroups'' devoted to thousands of
different topics. Usenet visitors routinely post messages slamming
companies that have left them unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the best-known consumer watchdog in cyberspace keeps
his eye on theInternet's most powerful company, America Online.
</P>
<P>
   David Cassel, a 34-year-old freelance writer in Berkeley,
Calif., was amusing himself in an AOL chat room in 1994, when a
fellow chatter used a four-letter word. Shortly thereafter, the
offending chatter was electronically silenced by AOL.
</P>
<P>
   That casual act of censorship turned Cassel from an on-line
neophyte to a crusading avenger dedicated to exposing the evil of
AOL and all its works. He started AOL Watch, a Web site which,
according to Cassel, gets as many as 1,000 visitors a day. He also
claims 32,000 people receive regular AOL Watch newsletters via
electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that when Cassel speaks, people listen. He
reported last year that AOL planned to sell the phone numbers of
its 12 million users to outside firms for marketing purposes. The
story made headlines nationwide and forced the company to abandon
the plan. ``Who knows how much money they would have made off
that,'' Cassel said, ``and who knows how many people would have
suffered?''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of David Cassel has not been lost on corporations,
which is good news for James Alexander. The former television
production worker runs eWatch, a New York firm that keeps track of
what Internet users say about various businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Over 600 firms have employed eWatch. The company uses ``software
agents,'' software that automatically scans thousands of Web pages
and Usenet newsgroups in search of words and phrases related to the
client companies. All relevant material is then examined by
editors, who write up a daily report for the client.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not attempt to contact disgruntled consumers.
``We're just a listening post,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the gripes are actually planted by cunning
investors hoping to spread false information to depress the value
of a company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But when customers complain about real problems, eWatch reports
can provide client companies early warning about product
shortcomings that need fixing. Said Alexander: ``We are improving
customer service, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But most of the credit goes to angry consumers who
have begun using the Internet to broadcast their gripes.

A maestro of the new media 
By Ernest Holsendolph  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Oliverio, in his own way, answered the question
before it could be asked. Is he a technology aficionado disguised
as a musician, or vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a pianist, one of my favorite pictures is of me
in diapers trying to sound a note on a string, and I was the church
organist at 10, playing a Hammond B3,'' he said. Enough said. Next
question...
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's first composer-in-residence is a man who loves to
talk music and technology, and that's why he's so right for his
job. He has accumulated a wealth of musical experience and credits
in Hollywood with his standalone pieces, such as his Concerto No. 1
for Orchestra and Timpani.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also comfortably at home with his colleagues in the
Interactive Media Technology Center at Tech, where he employs
electronics to extend the musical palette. Other specialists in the
cheerfully collegial media lab include authorities in education and
sports technology, and experts who know of ways to heal with a
combination of computer and human techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio's works are voluminous and varied. They include film
scores, a high-tech opera called Star Child that premiered from the
Olympic Village prior to the opening of the Games in 1996, and
various other works large and small.
</P>
<P>
   His works have been played by the Cleveland Orchestra and the
Atlanta Symphony, as well as by the DeKalb (Ga.) Symphony and the
orchestras of Chattanooga, Tenn., Albany, Ga., Macon, Ga. and Fort
Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio, a Cleveland native, who lived in Los Angeles before
moving to Atlanta, has won four Emmys and other awards for his
music.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no piece was more important to Atlantans than his musical
score for the film ``Time and Dreams'' about the city. The film,
produced by William VanDerKloot, was instrumental in helping to win
the Olympics for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A truly modern artist, Oliverio's sketch pad is the computer.
Though, like some writers, he often indulges his need to be
physically in touch with his work by putting pencil to paper, as
often as not he starts with an electronic grand piano. It's a real
piano, but it plays into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   He then is able to build and augment with computer-generated
tones.
</P>
<P>
   Through the power of the computer, artists will be able to feed
the insatiable appetites for something new, Oliverio said.
Combining the sounds with visual values will be one of the avenues
for new excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Artists like Oliverio and Tech technicians have already produced
ballet performances that included a dancer miles away from the
active stage, projected onto a screen and performing in real time
with the ``live'' performers. The remote dancer at times was
portrayed in changing colorful garb, sometimes flaming, sometimes
ghostly, all by computer manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   With the greater bandwidths possible with newer technology,
Oliverio said, a world class pianist here in Atlanta may perform
live with, say, the Albany symphony. It will be a way of extending
the living presence of world class performers, and also creating a
new kind of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live is important,'' Oliverio said. ``Unlike a pre-taped
performance, the combination remote performer brought by digitized
communication, and the orchestra in the auditorium allows
interaction among orchestra, conductor and the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio believes musical challenges ahead will simply be new
ways to create music, but also ways to pull together music and
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music listeners, especially our young people, look for
excitement,'' he said. ``Orchestras will have to turn from their
fears of the new and at least include newer things to build their
following.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been able to see firsthand, at Georgia Tech, the
possibilities of enticing smart young people to embrace new sounds
and production values in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students I teach are mostly from traditional engineering,
and some from computer sciences, looking for a new kind of musical
experience to carry through their lives,'' Oliverio said. They are,
in effect, a sampling of the audience of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Oliverio do his thing at Tech, you realize he is an
embodiment of the audience he strives to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Though he teaches courses at Tech in the history of electronic
music, history is not his driving interest. Pushing the borders of
musical expression is. And he is not locked into computer generated
tones. It is an odd but instructive sight to see him turn from his
machines, and strike a note from the tuned kettledrum nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the timbre of the notes I'm listening for,'' he
explains. Though he looks to a horizon, he stays in touch with his
musical base.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest pending project, he said, is his second Timpani
concerto, which will not be completed until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will be one of the most talked-about pieces of the
late 20th century,'' he said with a smile, ``or maybe the first in
the 21st century.''

BASIC PC CAN MEET STUDENT'S NEEDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BlOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you're finally ready to shop for a computer.
You've figured out where your student's living, what he or she
needs for networking, whether it will be a desktop or laptop
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to go into the store. Thankfully, the computer
business is going through a vicious cost-cutting cycle, with
terrific, very capable machines available for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, those inexpensive machines are more than enough
for most young students' needs. Beware what you buy, however,
because some cheap machines offer more than others.
</P>
<P>
   You need to get a machine that minimally has:
</P>
<P>
   A Pentium processor for PCs, or a PowerPC chip for Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   In the PC world, Intel competitors such as AMD and Cyrix have
created inexpensive alternatives to Pentiums that work quite well,
with few or no compatibility problems. AMD's K6 chip, for instance,
is found in many less-expensive machines and is a capable
alternative to Intel's low-end Celeron or Pentium chips.
</P>
<P>
   RAM, or random-access memory, of 32 megabytes. Given the low
prices for memory, the bloat of many software programs and the huge
improvement in usability you get from extra memory, go ahead and
get more if you can. It's the single biggest improvement per dollar
that you can make to a simple system.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum 2-gigabyte hard drive for storage of all the research,
term papers, spreadsheets, Web pages and Quake scenarios your
little student will be pumping out. Larger is better.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-inch monitor, with at least a .28mm dot pitch. The dot
pitch measures the screen's clarity, and smaller dot pitch means a
sharper screen.
</P>
<P>
   A 56K bps, V.90 modem or a good-quality Ethernet card. If your
student is living off-campus, or has a dorm room that's not
directly wired to the campus network, a fast modem will allow them
to dial in and surf the Internet, contact their teacher, even write
you an e-mail asking for more money. Faster is better when it comes
to speed, and prices for modems are dirt cheap. Here more than
anywhere, speed makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   A basic software package, such as ClarisWorks (called AppleWorks
in a bundle with Apple's new iMac) for the Macintosh, or Microsoft
Office (more expensive, but featuring more fully functional
programs for Macs and PCs), will cover the basic needs of most
students.
</P>
<P>
   These packages come with a solid word processor and spreadsheet,
database and presentation capabilities. They also come with
programs that allow a student to dial into a campus' mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet access programs, such as a World Wide Web browser like
Netscape's Communicator or Microsoft's Explorer, typically come
free with every machine. Those browsers also include built-in
e-mail capability and the ability to create simple pages for the
World Wide Web.

WHAT SCHOOLS ARE MOST WIRED?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The magazine Yahoo! Internet Life ranked the top
100 most wired schools in the country again this year on its
Internet site. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the schools in the
top 10 are smaller and are famous for their engineering and
technology programs. CalTech in Pasadena is the only California
school in the Top 10, which include:
</P>
<P>
   1. Dartmouth College
</P>
<P>
   2. New Jersey Institute of Technology
</P>
<P>
   3. Massachusetts Institute of Technology
</P>
<P>
   4. Rensselaer Polytechnic University
</P>
<P>
   5. University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana
</P>
<P>
   6. Carnegie-Mellon University
</P>
<P>
   7. California Institute of Technology
</P>
<P>
   8. University of Indiana, Bloomington
</P>
<P>
   9. University of Oregon
</P>
<P>
   10. Worcester Polytechnic University
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, at 23, was the next-highest-rated local school on the
list, followed by USC at 43, three of the Claremont Colleges
(Pomona at 70, Claremont McKenna at 79 and Harvey Mudd at 80) and
Occidental College at 81.

SURFING'S NOT AN ELECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By David Bloom  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a UCLA freshman in 1994, Anna McDivit arrived
on campus thinking a computer wasn't that vital for her pre-med
studies. An uncle's ancient Apple II was enough to pound out term
papers but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years later and a quarter away from graduation, the
Brentwood student thinks differently. On her Toshiba laptop, she
runs spreadsheets on biology experiments, databases for contact
lists, a Web browser for research online and e-mail to keep in
touch with friends, family and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The campus has) definitely become more computer literate,''
McDivit said. ``It's a good way to educate you on the importance of
computers, and it makes information way more readily accessible.
It's made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Her personal revolution matches that of UCLA, the Internet's
birthplace and now site of a far-reaching effort to transform
education with technology.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA ranked 23rd among the ``100 Most Wired Campuses'' in the
country and second in the area only to seventh-ranked California
Institute of Technology in a recent study by the magazine Yahoo!
Internet Life.
</P>
<P>
   All 3,000 of UCLA's classes now have World Wide Web sites, each
with at least a syllabus and general reference links, said Brian
Copenhaver, provost of UCLA's College of Letters and Science.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated sites have far more: class readings, book
lists, links to educational software, additional assignments and
even discussion areas, Copenhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Each student gets a lengthy personal Web site with that
quarter's course schedule and areas devoted to add/drop requests
and status, scheduling for academic counseling and exams, links to
many basic reference sites and campus organizations, online
subscriptions to publications such as the Daily Bruin and much
more, Copenhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital technology, Web-based communications, are very
important for us to understand as a very powerful supplement to the
core educational experience,'' Copenhaver said. ``It can in many,
many ways improve what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA may be one of the most ambitious but is far from the only
area college diving into Information Age technology for education,
spurred by the Internet explosion of the past few years, said
Kenneth Green of the Campus Computing Project, which surveys
computerization by about 650 colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have access to rich content on the Web,'' said Green.
``It's making for some very striking and even significant changes
in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, college officials report, their students are
arriving on campus with a computer in hand, or at least the skills
to use the machines most schools make available in labs, libraries
and student unions.
</P>
<P>
   Green said nationwide about half of all students now come to
campus owning a computer. And for those without machines, schools
are putting millions of dollars into outfitting computer labs for
campus have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are expecting these things now,'' Green said.
``They're coming to campuses not just to learn about technology but
to learn with it. You don't have to be a geek to use it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Most schools give students an e-mail account, allowing them to
swap messages with professors (many of whom hold online office
hours), each other and the outside world. And most provide some
sort of access to campus library collections and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, the schools are forcing computer skills on
students.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodbury University in Burbank, all freshmen must lease from
the school laptop computers, Internet access and a package of basic
software, said academic vice president Zelda Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Older students don't face the same requirements but will be
forced onto computers to get more and more class information and
assignments, Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Southern California, about three-fourths of
students have their own computers, said Phil Reese, executive
director of the school's information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the school's computer labs are busier than ever,
as students pop in to check e-mail, write or use the computers'
fast modems and phone lines to do quick research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are much more wired than we think they are,'' Reese
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, USC bought a campus-wide document system based on
Lotus Notes software that is designed to ease professors' efforts
to put their information online, Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   The computerization efforts aren't quite as far along at smaller
or poorer schools such as Pepperdine University and California
State University, Northridge. Nonetheless, even those schools
report big investments and decent progress.
</P>
<P>
   At CSUN, just-hired chief information officer David Liu is
surveying what computer resources the school has, so he can decide
where to further invest precious dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to what UCLA has, we're not there,'' Liu said. ``We
want to be there, but it's a matter of time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is focusing on classroom and lab computer access,
because so many of its students live off campus, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is wiring dorms and outfitting computer labs but
wants to better connect students at its satellite campuses, said
Danita Leese, director of educational technology for the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is expand the learning hours beyond the
classroom,'' Leese said.

LIKE ANY MAJOR PURCHASE, THIS ONE INVOLVES HOMEWORK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before you ever walk into a store to buy a
computer for your college student, you have to answer several basic
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Do these first, and you'll save a lot of headaches and regrets
later _ and maybe even some money, too.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, find out what the college recommends. Many
schools have a minimum configuration, and even certain
manufacturers they may suggest, based on compatibility with campus
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Contacting the school is particularly important if your child is
going to be connecting an Ethernet card to the school's high-speed
data network, say from his or her dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   You can save a lot of troubleshooting grief later (like on the
night before a big paper is due) by ensuring the school's
networking administrators are familiar with the kind of card you
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Figure out what you can afford to spend. It doesn't have to be a
lot of money: More-than-adequate machines and a printer can be
bought for comfortably less than $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   You should think about what your child will be studying, and how
that affects your child's computer needs. For instance, a would-be
artist will need a better graphics-oriented machine _ with far more
memory and maybe a removable storage peripheral like Iomega's Zip
drive _ than will a history or business student.
</P>
<P>
   With a freshman in any area of study, however, you may want to
start with a cheap, simple machine that has room for lots of
upgrades as technology improves and needs increase.
</P>
<P>
   Such a machine will allow your student to write papers, use the
Internet and campus networks easily and do simple analysis with
spreadsheets and database programs. When the student moves into
more demanding classwork in a couple of years, you can upgrade the
machine accordingly, with a more powerful processor, more memory,
or other improvements.
</P>
<P>
   If you can, buy the computer through the school's bookstore or
on-campus computer store. Machines and particularly software are
often deeply discounted for those with school IDs, while deals are
minimal in the retail sale of low-end hardware. But the bookstores
can save you hundreds of dollars in software, which is often deeply
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need to decide whether you want to buy a
Windows-based PC or an Apple Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Macs are far easier to set up and use, an important
consideration particularly if your baby is far from home and
customer support. Also, many students have worked on Macintoshes
throughout school and know those machines well, which is a real
plus.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's just-released iMacs are particularly attractive
all-in-one machines with great power for about $1,300. The
cool-looking, luggable machines aren't meant to be carried around
campus but come with built-in networking capability and are perfect
for a wired dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Macintoshes remain somewhat more expensive than
roughly comparable name-brand PCs. Brave consumers can still get
the best deals if they buy a no-name PC, especially if they build
their own or have someone knowledgeable put it together for them.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of the best-known PC companies are now offering
adequate machines that cost less than $1,000. Their products
provide most of the basics any starting student would need and come
with the security of a prominent brand name's warranty.
</P>
<P>
   PCs also have far more software available, particularly in areas
such as games (though your student would never be interested in
simply playing on his or her computer, right?).
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh developers have written around 17,000 programs,
including all the basics a student needs to write papers, analyze
business and math problems and access the Internet. But there are
tens of thousands of other programs that run only on PCs.
Macintoshes require an emulator program to run those same programs,
and they do it slowly.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also have to decide whether you want a laptop or desktop
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Laptops are great to carry to the library and on road trips,
providing wonderful flexibility that's particularly appealing to
footloose students who like to study far from their home base.
</P>
<P>
   But laptops have a bad habit of getting stolen, cost much more
for the same level of power, and are more limited in their
upgradability, a consideration for a machine your student will
probably use through most of his or her college career.
</P>
<P>
   If your student prefers to hole up in his or her dorm room for
hours at a time to study, a desktop machine might be the better
option. As a philosopher once said, to each his own.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: Intel microprocessors. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But at times, Intel's software development conflicts with
Microsoft's plans. At the August 1995 meeting, Gates expressed
concern about Intel's software work in two areas _ a layer of
multimedia software called native signal processing, or NSP, and
the possibility that some of Intel's Internet software development
might be at odds with Microsoft's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Microsoft and Intel over NSP technology
were widely reported in the trade press in 1995, but the memos now
reveal that the two companies were also at odds over Intel's plans
for developing support for Internet features and a software engine
for Java, a programming language created by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
a Microsoft rival.
</P>
<P>
   A microprocessor that supported Java would have enabled programs
written in that language to run on any operating system _ a serious
threat to the dominance of Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal memo written by an Intel executive who
attended the meeting, Gates left no doubt that he wanted the
software development at the Intel Architecture Labs, or IAL,
curbed. And at the same time he publicly announced that Microsoft
would share technologies and spend up to $100 million to train
engineers to develop and service products on a version of Windows
written for a competitor's microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates didn't want IAL's 750 engineers interfering with his
plans for domination of the PC industry,'' the Intel memo stated.
``Gates made vague threats about support for other platforms, and
on the same day he announced a major program to support the Alpha
microprocessor made by Digital Equipment Corp., an Intel
competitor. Gates was livid about IAL's investments in the
Internet, and he wanted them stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Netscape also came up at the meeting and,
according to Intel documents, Gates said it was fine for Intel to
support Netscape to the degree it would support any company
developing software for the Wintel technology. But the Intel
documents also say that Gates clearly delivered the message that he
wanted the most and closest cooperation for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   How evidence about the meeting might be used in the case against
Microsoft is not clear. At this point, the government can add
evidence only if it mirror charges already in the suit filed in
May.
</P>
<P>
   In that complaint, the government alleges that during two
meetings in June 1995 between Microsoft and Netscape executives,
Microsoft tried to persuade Netscape to divvy up the browser market
instead of competing. Microsoft denies the allegation. In any case,
Netscape says it declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government lawyers could argue that the Microsoft-Intel
meeting was an effort to limit competition _ Intel's freely
distributed software, in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the least, this potentially reinforces the government's
argument that Microsoft is a monopoly _ if it can even push Intel
around,'' observed Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legal implications, industry analysts say that
Microsoft exercises considerable control over the pace of
innovations in computing. For another company's hardware or
software to work, it must conform to Microsoft's operating system.
</P>
<P>
   That power, industry analysts say, cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to set standards for everything in your computer
to work, and Microsoft has assumed that role,'' said Richard
Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford,
N.Y. ``But it is also true that when Microsoft can't yet see a way
to gain some proprietary advantage from some new technology, it is
in Microsoft's interest to stall its introduction _ and it does. In
all sorts of ways, Microsoft can create a weather storm in the
industry, so the ships will not leave port.''
</P>
<P>
   After the August 1995 meeting, Intel pretty much followed
Microsoft's lead on Internet and multimedia software. In later
meetings, Intel made it clear it would back off on the technology
initiatives that Microsoft found objectionable, according to Intel
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a September 1995 meeting with Intel, Paul Maritz, a senior
Microsoft executive, told Intel, according to an Intel memo, that
it was ``imperative we are in lock-step on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Intel shifted course for pragmatic reasons _ its
relationship with Microsoft was too important to jeopardize. And
the outcome of the dispute over Intel's multimedia program, NSP,
sheds some light on the business logic involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel-Microsoft confrontation over NSP in 1995 was closely
followed in the industry. A year later, in lengthy dialogue between
Grove and Gates, published in Fortune magazine as ``A Conversation
with the Lords of Wintel,'' the two men discussed the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said, ``Intel deserves a lot of credit for stepping
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove replied, ``We didn't have much of a choice. We basically
caved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates objected to that characterization, but Grove stuck to his
line. ``We caved,'' the Intel chairman said. ``Introducing a
Windows-based software initiative that Microsoft doesn't support .
. . well, life is too short for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove declined to comment for this article. And Intel itself
faces a government antitrust suit; the Federal Trade Commission
charges that the company has abused its dominance in
microprocessors by retaliating against corporate customers and
competitors, withholding information on Intel technology needed to
make other products.

MICROSOFT MAY HAVE DETERRED INTEL FROM NEW INTERNET TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR and JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. are so intertwined, so seemingly
dependent on each other for their success, that they are often
referred to as a single entity _ ``Wintel'' _ in recognition of the
degree to which Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's
microprocessors dominate the technology of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   But the government is investigating whether Microsoft has used
its market muscle to force even Intel, its only real peer, to
shelve new technology efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators appear particularly interested
in an August 1995 meeting between Intel executives including
chairman Andrew Grove and Microsoft executives led by chairman Bill
Gates. At the meeting, Gates made ``vague threats'' about
supporting Intel competitors, according to one of many internal
Intel memos that the company was required to hand over to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, according to a memo written by an Intel executive who
attended the meeting, was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in
the Internet, and wanted them stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, federal and state investigators have been
taking taking depositions from Grove and three other Intel
employees, people close to the inquiry said. The investigators are
pursuing additional evidence that might be included in the sweeping
antitrust case against Microsoft filed by the Justice Department
and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the states accuse Microsoft of using
unfair business practices to protect its monopoly in operating
systems and to extend that monopoly into the new markets for
Internet software and commerce. The case, scheduled to go to trial
Sept. 23, focuses mainly on Microsoft's tactics in the market for
browsing software for navigating the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel employees' depositions could strengthen the case if
the evidence suggests a pattern of Microsoft's abusing its monopoly
power. The Justice Department and the states say that in addition
to thwarting competition, Microsoft has the clout to control the
pace of innovation in computing, which is the focus of the
investigation of Microsoft's dealings with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The public policy implication of Microsoft's power, the
government says, is that technology makes its way into the
marketplace at the pace that is best for Microsoft instead of best
for the economy and for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the antitrust suit is misguided, and that
the company is a champion of innovation, enriching not only itself
but much of the high-technology economy and benefiting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Intel case and others, federal and state investigators
are trying to portray routine business meetings as attempts to
forge an anticompetitive conspiracy, Microsoft says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business partners like Intel and Microsoft occasionally have
minor disputes, and the fact that the Justice Department and the
states are apparently trying to shoehorn this into their case at
the last minute shows how desperate they are,'' said Charles Rule,
a partner at Covington &AMP; Burling and a former senior Justice
Department official who is an adviser to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department would not comment on its investigation of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between executives of Microsoft and Intel in early
August 1995 came only weeks before the introduction of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was already well along in its plans for the Internet,
though it would not announce them until December 1995. None too
soon, for by early August 1995, Netscape Communications Corp., the
pioneer in browser software, was a hot startup about to sell shares
to the public, setting off an Internet mania on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1995, Grove met with Gates on Intel's corporate
campus in Santa Clara, Calif., according to the Intel documents.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour session in a windowless, second-floor conference
room was attended by several executives from each company. It was
mainly a confidential exchange of product plans and market
strategies _ not only for Microsoft's operating systems and Intel's
microprocessors but in areas like multimedia software and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There was a heated discussion of software, according to Intel
documents, but it was software that had been developed by Intel
rather than by Microsoft. Though its business is making
microprocessor chips, Intel also works on software, just as
Microsoft does research and development work on hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's silicon microprocessors are typically called the
electronic brains of personal computers, while Microsoft's
operating system is referred to as the central nervous system. Just
as the brain is part of the central nervous system, the line
separating the fundamental hardware and software technology of
computing is often blurred. Software instructions can be programmed
into chips, and hardware functions can be emulated in software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon is simply frozen software,'' Intel's Grove once said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's software work has long been done at its research center
in Hillsboro, Ore., the Intel Architecture Labs. Intel has mainly
developed the software that sits between the operating system and
the microprocessor _ ``under-the-hood'' programs that enhance the
performance of advanced tasks like Internet communications, video
or audio.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Intel gives such software to developers, including to
Microsoft, which has often added Intel-developed enhancements to
its operating systems. This kind of software development makes
business sense for Intel because the more people want
high-performance computing for work or games, the more they need
powerful new computers _ about 85 percent of which are powered by
Intel microprocessors.

GINGRICH QUESTIONS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PURSUIT OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL PAULSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in his strongest
criticism to date of the government's case against Microsoft,
suggested Tuesday that the Justice Department would be better off
pursuing drug dealers or campaign finance violators than going
after the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, speaking at a Seattle fundraiser for Rep. Rick White,
R-Wash., also said Congress should investigate whether the Justice
Department improperly has attempted to persuade foreign governments
to initiate their own legal cases against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department could do a variety of things _ they
could be looking more effectively into bringing drugs into the
country illegally, they could be looking more effectively at
illegal foreign campaign contributions _ there are a range of
opportunities for the Justice Department other than trying to
destroy jobs at one of America's leading companies and trying to
weaken America's role in the world market,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gingrich at first seemed to attribute that stance
to White, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash, but a spokesman said later that Gingrich shares the
pro-Microsoft sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who posed for a photo with Microsoft vice president
William Neukom before giving his speech, seemed particularly
disturbed about the Justice Department's conversations with foreign
goverments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Justice Department began to raise questions about
Microsoft the way they did, all over the world other countries also
began to raise questions,'' Gingrich said. ``There's some very real
question whether or not there was in fact collusion by the American
Justice Department encouraging foreign governments to file a
lawsuit against an American company.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling such activity ``entirely inappropriate,'' Gingrich said
it is ``something we're going to work very hard to get to the
bottom of. ... The purpose of the American government is to
strengthen American companies in the world market and increase
American exports in the world market, not to undermine American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's complaint echoes one made last month by Sens. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
who alleged that investigations of Microsoft by Japan, Israel,
Brazil and others were prompted by senior Justice Department
antitrust officials. The senators pointed out that shortly after a
visit to Tokyo by Justice Department antitrust chief Joel Klein,
the Japanese Fair Trade Commission raided Microsoft's offices
there.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Gingrich make positive comments about Microsoft,
but he excised from his standard stump speech a positive reference
to technology manufactured by Sun Microsystems Inc., a California
company that is now suing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department defended the agency's
conduct. The Justice Department has been embroiled in various legal
battles with Microsoft for four years, most recently with a broad
antitrust suit accusing the company of illegally trying to extend a
monopoly on computer operating systems into the market for Internet
browsers. That case is scheduled for trial Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charge that the Department colluded with, solicited, or
encouraged foreign governments to take legal action is completely
false,'' said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   Talamona also said it was appropriate for the Justice Department
to press its case against Microsoft, saying that ``The antitrust
division is about protecting consumers and enforcing laws, and we
need to continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   White said he has been encouraging the speaker to be more
outspoken on behalf of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're indicating to him that he needs to speak out a little
bit more on the Microsoft situation, and I think he's relatively
receptive to that message,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been spending parts of this week in Washington
state. On Saturday he attended the King County GOP picnic on Vashon
Island and a state GOP fundraiser in Seattle. On Monday he attended
a fundraiser in Pasco for Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. Tuesday, in
addition to the White fundraiser, he visited the Pacific Science
Center at Seattle Center. Wednesday and Thursday he is to tour the
Hanford nuclear reservation, the Hanford Reach, and the North
Cascades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has sharply limited his accessibility to the news media
while in Washington state, generally declining to answer questions
or grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's staff Tuesday cancelled a promised question and
answer session at the Pacific Science Center, and physically
blocked reporters from following the Speaker around the private,
non-profit museum. Gingrich's spokesman said he did not want to be
distracted by questions about President Clinton's sex scandal.

Web sites search out new ways to hang on to surfers 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Memo to Web surfers everywhere: Knock it off.
</P>
<P>
   Find one comprehensive site and stay there. Search there. Shop
there. Check your mail there. Read the news there. Monitor the
stock market there. Plan your day there. Build a Web site there.
Surf on over. Stay a while.
</P>
<P>
   The newest scheme Web sites are adopting to eke out some kind of
profit is to load up their sites with additional products and
services in addition to their core businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com) was perhaps the first company to
realize people conducting searches find what they want and leave.
To stop that disturbing trend, Yahoo has added a variety of new
services including phone service and a travel service.
</P>
<P>
   CNNfn (http://www.cnnfn.com), the Cable News Network's financial
Web site, plans to add a shopping area before the end of the year.
City-sites are also trying to hold on to audiences who have already
gotten into the habit of stopping by for local news and
entertainment information.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media, which operates AccessAtlanta (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com), is planning a redesign of its 21
city-specific sites to include search capabilities aimed at
attracting a broader audience to the site. Both companies are owned
by Cox Enterprises Inc., which also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that everybody is thinking about portals,'' says Lisa
Allen, a senior research analyst at Forrester Research. ``There is
an epidemic case of portal envy, and it seems to be contagious
because it first appeared at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNNfn, one of the most popular financial sites on the
Web, announced it had taken an equity stake in C2B Technologies to
integrate an electronic commerce shopping area into the CNNfn site.
Craig Forman, vice president of CNNfn Interactive, says the area
will launch before the end of the year. The C2B shopping service
will include e-commerce as well as e-commerce comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Kim Whelan, CNNfn's vice president of business
development, says the addition of e-commerce to the CNNfn site is a
natural evolution for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out on CNNfn is something that we've known for
quite a while _ our users are a well-heeled, educated bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are middle-aged males with an average income of $87,000.
CNNfn users are also slightly ahead of the curve when it comes to
making purchases on the Web. Statistics show they've bought more
books, software and airline tickets. Like the TV networks who
understand the money to be made from a night of ``must see TV,''
media Web sites are just beginning to see it's not enough to have
users surf through your site. You've got to do something to make
them stay a while.
</P>
<P>
   Developing sites that will engage users for more than a minute
or two is a dramatic shift from the way Web sites were developed in
the Internet's infancy only three or four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, it was all about breaking news and finding
news on the Internet,'' says CNNfn's Forman. ``We realized the Web
was something people wanted to come to for breaking news.'' But in
1998, CNNfn, finds itself with a huge loyal audience checking in
every day. (Measurement firm Relevant Knowledge ranks it the fourth
most-visited commercial network site on the Web). With 87 percent
of CNNfn's users returning daily and with research indicating they
are established e-commerce customers, the Web site decided to
provide shopping resources to keep users on the CNNfn site.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Cox Interactive Media, which oversees not only Access
Atlanta, but the sites around the country, users already get local
news and information courtesy of Cox companies such as this
newspaper as well as a variety of nationwide media partners. CIM
says the advantage of being ``the home team'' in each of these
markets is a key drawing point, but the goal is to draw even more
users into the site and keep them there. By mid-September, Access
Atlanta and Cox sites nationwide will add a search engine called
``LookSmart.'' It offers intelligent Web searches delivering local
Web information first followed by national and international
information.
</P>
<P>
   George deGolian, acting general manager of CIM's Atlanta studio,
says the addition of a search engine will draw more users to the
site including women and minorities _ two of the most rapidly
growing user groups on the Web. ``A few months ago we determined we
had a clear leadership in this space,'' deGolian says. ``Then we
looked at the Net as a whole and we realized the number one thing
people do on the Web is search.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Web user doesn't spend much time on the Web'' adds
marketing manager Beth Goldstein. ``We want to offer both features
and functionality _ a place where users will want to stay longer
because of the information we are able to provide. We don't want
users to visit our sites for local information and then hop off to
Yahoo! to look into buying a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Allen calls this kind of tactic, whether it's adding
e-commerce to CNNfn or a high-powered search engine to Access
Atlanta ``sticky products.'' She says the goal of ``sticky
products'' is to get users to go a site and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's enough to say, 'We want to be your first
stop when you log on to the Internet,''' she says. ``A better
approach is to not only strive to be the first site, but the site
where users spend the most time. You want users to spend time and
enjoy it. You don't want users to just walk. ``

Dell passes on cheaper PCs: Too much trouble 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. and other personal
computer makers announced several new systems recently that
incorporate the newest processors from Intel Corp., including a new
and improved chip for the sub-$1,000 market.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, however, will not use the chip to enter the fast-growing
market for computers that cost less than $1,000. It remains the
last of the major PC makers without a sub-$1,000 PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock-based company will use Intel's new Celeron chip
to help launch a new line of its Dimension computers, its consumer
and small business line, that start at $1,399. That will be Dell's
lowest-priced computer for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also introduced its most powerful OptiPlex, the desktop
computer for large customers. It is powered by Intel's newest
Pentium II, a 450-megahertz microprocessor that is considered an
evolutionary, not revolutionary, improvement over the 400-megahertz
Pentium II. The high-end OptiPlex GX1p with the 450-megahertz
Pentium II starts at about $3,100.
</P>
<P>
   New products from Dell, Compaq Computer Corp. and others were
expected with Intel's formal announcement of the new
microprocessors, which are the brains of computers. It has become
the pattern in the industry in recent years for PC manufacturers to
base new computers on the improved processors that come once or
twice annually from Intel, whose chips run an estimated 80 percent
of PCs in use today.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, from the industry's point of view, the new processors
are accompanied by significant ``buzz'' or anticipation, such as
the intense interest that Apple Computer Inc.'s iMac has generated.
That typically translates into more sales.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of the new offerings from Intel was relatively
modest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although less powerful than the Pentium II, the new
300-megahertz and 333-megahertz Celeron chips have attracted more
attention than the 450-megahertz Pentium II because the Celeron
introduced in April was a disappointment, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new chip is what the Celeron should have been to start
with,'' said Keith Diefendorff of Microprocessor Report, a
chip-industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Celeron been there when it was introduced, Intel wouldn't
have lost quite as much market share in the sub-$1,000 market.''
</P>
<P>
   Microdesign Resources, the Silicon Valley firm that publishes
the newsletter, estimates that AMD had 54 percent of the budget-PC
market in June, compared with 40 percent for Intel. AMD
manufactures processors in Austin and California.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Thomsen, a researcher at Microdesign Resources, said those
estimates don't give a complete picture of the chip's sales because
many of them ended up in computers that sold for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the original Celeron had shortcomings, which opened the
door for AMD and Cyrix, the Dallas chip maker that is owned by
National Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Dell ignored it because it did not have a backside, or level 2
cache, which stores data on the chip for faster processing. The new
Celeron has 128 kilobytes of L2 cache.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what was in the pipeline,'' said Dell spokesman T.R.
Reid, explaining that Dell decided to wait until Celeron had the
cache feature before putting the chip in its computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell remains the sole major computer maker to eschew the
sub-$1,000 market, which accounts for an estimated 10 percent of PC
sales. Dell has long targeted more sophisticated customers who are
likely to buy more high-end machines where profit margins are
somewhat higher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, buyers of cheaper PCs tend to be less computer
savvy and require more assistance, Dell executives argue. Taking
care of them adds to costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Dell sees little demand for a budget PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where our customers are taking us,'' Reid said.
``That, combined with the fact that we've got a variety of growth
opportunities, perhaps more than we can effectively manage, (means)
it becomes a matter of choices, and to focus on the higher end of
the market is an obvious choice for us.'' iDOT.com, a new Austin
company that sells PCs exclusively over the World Wide Web, offered
a $999 computer using the 300-megahertz Celeron processor. The
company offers 450-megahertz Pentium II products starting at
$1,799.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors start at $99, iDOT said.

RESEARCHERS TO DELVE INTO AMERICAN LIVES VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KEAY DAVIDSON   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans are far more mobile than their
ancestors were a century ago, and that mobility exacts a
psychological price: loss of ties to one's family, relatives,
friends and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   How are Americans coping with this high-speed, high-tech age,
when ``all that is solid melts into air'' (to borrow a line from
Karl Marx, who watched the Industrial Revolution similarly derail
the lives of 19th-century Europeans)?
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic magazine and social scientists want to find
out, using the ultimate engine of mobility, the World Wide Web, by
which humans can navigate global databases, chat rooms and stock
markets at the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, described Monday at the American Sociological
Association meeting in San Francisco, is one of a number of
fledgling efforts to gather scientific data via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sept. 20, the magazine is sponsoring ``Survey 2000,''
an on-line sociological survey of the nation. Those who want to can
go on line and fill out a questionnaire to describe who they are,
what they do for a living, where they come from originally, how
well-connected they feel to both their hometowns and new
communities, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   According to the project director, social scientist James Witte
of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., the study aims to
answer questions such as, ``How does migration affect our sense of
community? How much are cultural tastes (for example, in food and
music) influenced by migration?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is regional variety giving way to homogenized global culture?
Are people replacing geographic communities (such as their
hometowns) with substitutes such as (their) profession, workplace
or the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say gathering scientific information through the
Internet allows researchers to contact far more people than is
feasible with telephone surveys or old-fashioned questionnaires
sent by mail.
</P>
<P>
   It also is much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, too, Witte acknowledged. For one thing,
those surveyed by the Web aren't likely to be a representative
sample of the U.S. population. But he said scholars can
statistically massage the data to extract useful insights into
modern American society.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie May, managing editor of National Geographic Interactive,
said the magazine hoped to increase participation in the survey by
social groups that don't routinely use the Web. Hence, anyone who
needs assistance in joining the Survey 2000 can phone 800-424-9420,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire will be posted from Sept. 20 until Nov. 27 at
the following Web site: http://survey2000.nationalgeographic.com.

   GREAT BRINGTON, England _ Dorothy Jackson talks about a friend
who's gone away.
</P>
<P>
   She sits with her closest friends in a circle of folding chairs
arrayed around coolers topped with an assortment of quiches, fancy
cheeses, green salads and two nearly empty bottles of good white
wine. They await their appointed time to enter Althorp House,
Princess Diana's childhood home and final resting place. This
refined tailgate party is set between the neat rows of cars parked
in the grassy field that serves as a parking lot across a gravel
road from the grand country manor. With all the Mercedes, BMWs and
even a Rolls Royce in the lot, it is clear this isn't Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings about this, actually,'' Jackson says with
both guilt and reverence in her voice. ``We were coming to Diana's
memorial, yet we were making it festive with a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses and then continues on a new track. ``We've really
come to celebrate her life. She was a very lively extroverted kind
of character, so we've come to celebrate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin, John Massey, a courtly man wearing a navy blazer and
honey-colored necktie, chimes in cheerfully. ``I'm sure she's
looking down and thoroughly approving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' Jackson says approvingly. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a sadness emerges in her voice. ``I miss her. I miss the
color that she brought to everyday life,'' she says. ``Suddenly,
she would be on the front of the paper or you would open the
newspaper and she was there, doing something, always. She gave this
feeling of, whatever she suffered, she was quite a light, wasn't
she?''
</P>
<P>
   To Jackson and her friends -- and to millions more worldwide --
Princess Diana of Wales still represents a powerful combination of
the glamorous and familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her privileged and aristocratic background -- some say
her lineage was more royal than the royals -- she connected to
ordinary folks. They talk about her as if they hung out with her at
Kensington Palace, and shopped with her in the Sloane Street
boutiques. They know the failings of her marriage, her successes as
a mother and hold well-developed positions on her peculiar
relationship with the press.
</P>
<P>
   In the way that Americans over the age of 40 can tell you where
they were when they got news of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, many Britons have fixed in their minds the moment
they learned about Diana tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a year after her death, Diana remains alive in the press,
still young and beautiful. Her blue eyes radiate from the front
pages of tabloid newspapers that hounded her in life. Television
chat shows and news magazines frequently re-hash the familiar story
of the black Mercedes slamming into the 13th pillar of the famed
Parisian tunnel resulting in the violent death of a 36-year-old
woman whose warmth and vulnerability touched so many people.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, virtually all major London dailies carried special
magazine sections marking the anniversary of her death. Taking note
of the potential for Diana overkill, a London Times media writer
recently used his computer to determine that the word ``Diana'' had
been used in news stories in the British press 72 times in a
three-day period of mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Her life has been a rich mine for other media, as well. In
addition to a seemingly endless supply of books, authorized and
otherwise, two new Diana plays have opened here. There is talk of a
Walt Disney Co. movie.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the industry of commemoration has slipped into
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   The Diana souvenir business has been brisk with an estimated
$165 million in sales to date. In gift shops throughout London's
touristy districts are Diana coffee cups, plates, posters, T-shirts
and yes, souvenir thimbles, piled high in gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from Diana's estate and the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund have been deployed to rein in the numerous
unauthorized uses of her image and name.
</P>
<P>
   They may have to work extra billable hours to keep up with the
inspirations of enterprise. One Parisian hotel is offering what can
only be described as a brief tour of Diana's death. ``I am simply
responding to demand from my clients,'' an unabashed Emile
Cacciari, manager of the three-star Odeon Hotel on the Left Bank,
told Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 -- free to guests -- Cacciari is offering the chance to
relive Diana's final moments. For a little more, he can provide the
authenticity of a black Mercedes. ``We have a lot of American
visitors, and whenever they leave the hotel in the morning they
want to know two things and two things only: where is the Eiffel
Tower, and where is the Pont de l'Alma. People want to go (to the
scene of the crash); it's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds, he said, will be donated to the memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   There are varying schools of thought about Diana's lasting
legacy here. Some people believe she has permanently altered
British life, as if people impressed by the warmth of her example
now have come in touch with their feelings and have opened up.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lashmar, a London man who was at the gates of Kensington
Palace the night the city learned of her death, believes the
experience has helped Britons get in touch with their feelings. ``I
think we've definitely grown up since then,'' he says. ``I don't
think we would have behaved the way we do with the outpouring of
grief, and (us) being afraid to cry in public. I mean, that night
there were grown men of all shapes, sizes and descriptions crying
their eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourning has never really stopped. Bouquets with handwritten
notes still appear faithfully at Kensington Palace -- Diana's
former home -- where the world kept a televised vigil in the days
after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such public displays, there are those who believe the
outpourings have been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Decca Aitkenhead, a columnist for the Independent newspaper
here, said on a recent TV chat show that she believes people were
moved more by the larger-than-life proportions of Diana's life,
death and celebrity than by real feelings for the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of emotional outpourings we saw in the week after
her death were genuine in so far as they were real emotions,''
Aitkenhead said. ``The mistake was to interpret them as grief, that
people were grieving for Diana. I think what people were
demonstrating was their desire to feel a part of a big momentous
occasion, to feel a part of history, to feel they can suddenly talk
to strangers and they could bond in queues waiting to write in a
condolence book.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think as the year has passed, we're seeing it fade into
something that's just closer to sentimentality rather than a new
emotional maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed a new study suggests that Britain was not as united in
its grief as the TV images suggested. Research by the British Film
Institute suggests that many people here were displeased that so
much airtime was consumed by the commotion surrounding Diana's
death. Nearly 40 percent of the 500 people surveyed said the
coverage was excessive and overly sentimental. Many were irritated
that soaps, soccer and cricket matches were sacrificed to the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but whatever it is, it persists.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of going on sale, tickets to Althorp House were
snapped up by 152,000 people like Jackson and her friends. More
than 3,000 people a day have passed through Althorp's gates since
the estate was opened to the public July 1. Inside they find an
exhibit describing Diana's journey from gawky bride to
sophisticated patron. It ends with a visit to her grave on a small
island in a lake on the estate. Althorp's gates will close for the
year on Sunday(Aug. 30), the eve of the first anniversary of
Diana's death in a car crash in Paris' Pont de l'Alma traffic
tunnel, along with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
It has not been determined when they will open in 1999, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where sentimentality is aggressively spurned, a
candlelit march on Monday(Aug. 31), to mark the moment of her death
is expected to draw 10,000 mourners. The underpass, where emergency
workers struggled to save the fatally injured Diana, has become a
point of pilgrimage for hundreds of people each day.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent opinion poll showed that 70 percent of Parisians
want a nearby boulevard renamed to honor the late princess.
However, the city's mayor has responded by saying that Parisian
streets and buildings cannot be dedicated to celebrities until they
have been dead for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Purkins, who heads the memorial fund in Diana's name,
believes there is something deeper to her appeal. This, in part
because of her embrace of poor people and people on the margins,
and of causes such as Third World Poverty, AIDS research and
ridding the world of land mines that have in the past made the
British aristocracy squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's genuine regard for ordinary and damaged people will
stick, he said. ``That's something people instinctively know should
endure and is important, and is something that can be distinguished
from the more transitory emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with a balance of nearly $80 million -- more than $30
million of which came from the proceeds of Elton John's ``Candle in
the Wind'' tribute -- intends to give $8 million to $10 million a
year to causes that trustees believe Diana would have supported.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her most lasting influence is a change in the perceived
way the Royal Family interacts with the public. At times, this
regal populism can be awkward as with the recent visit by Queen
Elizabeth to a McDonald's restaurant. Perhaps fortunately, she
didn't order any food, saving a counter worker from having to utter
the phrase, ``And would one wish to have one's order
'Super-sized?'''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth, who was accused of not emoting sufficiently
after Diana's death, ordered flags at royal residences to fly at
half-mast on Monday(Aug. 31), to mark the first anniversary of
Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The queen and husband, Prince Philip will be joined by Prince
Charles and sons William and Harry, for family prayers at Crathie
Church, just outside the grounds of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.
Also at the service will be Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife,
Cherie. William, now 16, and Harry, 13, were told of Diana's death
by Charles while they were staying at Balmoral last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in image has come to Prince Charles, once
vilified for being cold-hearted to the genial Diana. While still
far from hugging his future subjects in public, the prince is often
seen with his two sons in comfortable ordinary surroundings, the
picture of the modern dad.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months after the crash, an opinion poll suggested
public approval of Charles had leaped nearly 20 points, from 42
percent last August to 61 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, that tabloid that dispensed its share of vitriol at
Charles' expense, patted him on the back this summer and even
advised him to go public with his longtime affair with Camilla
Parker Bowles -- once arguably the most hated woman in England.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new plays about Diana, ``Love Upon the Throne''
offers Charles a kind of forgiveness by expressing on his behalf,
sentiments he never would have shared in public -- even if he
really felt them. At the end of the play, the Charles character
utters these words to the stage Diana: ``I'm very, very, very sorry
for not loving you as I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to pay her respects at Diana's grave, Jackson, dressed
in a tasteful dark dress selected with Diana inspired sensibilities
-- expresses the common feeling toward the princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became a legend in my lifetime and that's not something
one often experiences really,'' she said. ``She did leave a mark on
the world, and it's quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her explanation of Diana's appeal is that the princess, despite
her advantages, was an underdog who survived in a hostile world and
in so doing discovered herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have been a recluse and hidden from the world in the
later years, but she went off to help people. She decided to do
this herself, and that's what makes it all the more commendable.''
</P>
<P>
   She sips her wine thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity -- no, we all had the opportunity -- to
see a human being flower.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Despite a year of deliberations by a jury of talk
shows, newspapers and authors, the real trial has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And at the rate this investigation is proceeding, it may well
become known as the ``Trial of the Next Century.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to high-profile cases in the United States,
the French inquiry into who caused the death of Princess Diana of
Wales has been conducted with nearly absolute stealth.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Herve Stephan, who under French law has the powers of
judge, investigator and prosecutor, has succeeded in shrouding the
probe in the strict secrecy that French law requires.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare statement last week, Stephan said the investigation
would end in October, when several ongoing tests are concluded. It
was the first statement prosecutors had issued since the early days
of the case. It was released to respond to the crush of media
queries surrounding the anniversary of Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine the meaning of
abnormally high levels of carbon monoxide in the blood of driver
Henri Paul, who was killed in the crash, the prosecutors said.
Blood tests also found that he was heavily drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the carbon monoxide isn't clear, but the gas can
cause dizziness, headaches, nausea and disorientation -- even
leaving a person in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also are reviewing the efforts to treat Diana at
the crash site. It is common in France to treat even seriously
injured people at crash sites, a practice that differs from
thinking in the United States that patients should be taken
immediately to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A third probe involves lab tests on the body of the wrecked
black Mercedes. Forensic tests are being conducted on the crashed
car to determine if it had been brushed by a mysterious Fiat before
the accident. Investigators said they had interviewed nearly 3,000
owners of Fiat Unos and reportedly have come up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have interviewed 153 people as potential witnesses
to the crash, but the investigators did not reveal any of their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the report by Stephan and his colleague, magistrate
Marie-Christine Devidal, is issued will it be determined who, if
anyone, will be criminally charged. A criminal trial would be open
to the press and public, even though no television cameras will be
allowed, said a spokesman for the court in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the only people in clear legal jeopardy are the
paparazzi who were trailing -- some say, chasing -- the Mercedes
that night, and who have been widely condemned for their part in
the world's most famous car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men -- nine photographers and the driver of one of the
motorcycles giving chase -- have been in legal limbo since the
early days following the accident. At that point, they were placed
under formal investigation on charges of both manslaughter and
failure to assist people in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have not agreed on the behavior of the photographers,
however, with some saying they were following too closely and
others saying they kept a safe distance before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   None of the paparazzi -- some of whom still work Diana-related
events -- has been formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Stephan summoned the paparazzi to give secret
testimony. Also present were Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi
Al Fayed, who also perished in the crash. Frances Shand Kydd,
Diana's mother, was also there to hear the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable leaks of the testimony, but some
news reports have said that those close to the case believe all 10
will be cleared of the manslaughter charges. However, some may go
to trial on the non-assistance charge, facing minor penalties,
perhaps a fine.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about other aspects of the case. It is
unclear how much management at the Paris Ritz Hotel, which Diana
and Al Fayed were leaving, knew about Henri Paul's condition. That
factor could come into play in determining the prestigious hotel's
liability in the case.
</P>
<P>
   And what about bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of
the crash? Six months ago, his story was that Paul appeared fine
that night -- that he wasn't visibly drunk. But that was before he
resigned from the employ Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   The latest clue comes in the form of new charges about the
mechanical condition of the car itself. It has been widely reported
here that a person familiar with the Mercedes has told
investigators that the car's brakes were faulty, making it
especially difficult to brake suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Etoile Limousines, which rented the car
to the Ritz, warned the hotel about the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps seeking to learn more about these matters, Stephan
Tuesday questioned two key witnesses: the president of the Ritz
Hotel, Frank Klein, and its director, Claude Roulet.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects of civil litigation and even more criminal
investigations, Stephan's report is likely to signal only the end
of the beginning.

<P>
   LONDON _ On his swim trunks are the letters ``W.O.W.''
</P>
<P>
   They stand for ``William of Wales,'' but it also pretty well
sums up the popular sentiment here for the eldest son of Princess
Diana and the most likely heir to her title of lead character in
the ongoing national melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   With his blond locks, shy ways and brilliant blue eyes, it is
hard to look at William and not see Diana.
</P>
<P>
   He has demonstrated a grasp of her ``common'' touch while
showing signs that he is quickly developing a charisma of his own.
On the day of his mother's funeral last year, William graciously
received flowers handed him by mourners outside Buckingham Palace,
a notable personal touch given the awkwardness exhibited by his
royal relatives. Britain was charmed.
</P>
<P>
   A new national survey placed him No. 2 on the list of most
popular royals, just behind Princess Anne, the queen's only
daughter. Prince Charles, his father, was at the bottom of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   His rare public appearances have created remarkable reactions.
Girls whose mothers -- and perhaps grandmothers -- no doubt
shrieked for the Beatles, do the same for the 6-foot-1 William,
whose mother, according to one author, teased her son by calling
him ``DDG'' -- for drop dead gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Vancouver in March he was besieged by frantic
girls, an experience that friends, always quoted anonymously in the
British press, said frightened him to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned 16 in June, the well-behaved newspapers were
rewarded with the transcript of a very tame interview that
essentially confirmed that William is a teenager with a teenager's
likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   He loves sports: particularly rugby, soccer, swimming, water
polo and tennis. He likes action movies and loves his black lab,
Widgeon. He likes techno pop music, and apparently the Spice Girls
(he met the girl-power group during a visit to South Africa) but
also has an ear for the classics.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Kennedy, a hair stylist from Surrey, offers the theory
that people are hoping that William can help fill the gap left in
their lives by the death of his mother. ``You know it reminds me of
the way that people tried to put John Lennon's son, you know, Sean,
out front after his father was murdered,'' she said. ``That's a
right raw thing to do, but they do it, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be trying. William is a tantalizing topic for a
British media eager to fill the void created by Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, Buckingham Palace has worked vigorously to
protect his, and younger brother Harry's privacy. Indiscretions
that seem minor compared to the wild, intrusive treatment afforded
Diana are not tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   When a newspaper reported that William was selecting girls for
invitations to tea, the teenager filed an official complaint with
the Press Complaint Commission, leading to a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   When William and 13-year-old Harry met in private for 30 minutes
with Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' long-time love
interest, the tabloid Sun got the scoop of the year for a
three-page spread, photos and all --much to the outrage of the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, the British media, perhaps chastened by
the public's hostility after Diana's death, have provided William
the space to grow up in as normal an environment as can be expected
for a future king.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as William prepares return to his studies at the elite
prep-school Eton, there remain some misgivings about the attention
heading his way.
</P>
<P>
   There even have been calls for tougher laws written specifically
to protect the princes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To rely on the decency of the media is ludicrous,'' wrote
Libby Purves, a columnist for The Times of London. ``The princes
should be allowed to walk freely in their own country, take risks,
make decisions and grow up without being spied on.''

<P>
   GREAT BRINGTON, England _ Dorothy Jackson talks about a friend
who's gone away.
</P>
<P>
   She sits with her closest friends in a circle of folding chairs
arrayed around coolers topped with an assortment of quiches, fancy
cheeses, green salads and two nearly empty bottles of good white
wine. They await their appointed time to enter Althorp House,
Princess Diana's childhood home and final resting place. This
refined tailgate party is set between the neat rows of cars parked
in the grassy field that serves as a parking lot across a gravel
road from the grand country manor. With all the Mercedes, BMWs and
even a Rolls Royce in the lot, it is clear this isn't Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings about this, actually,'' Jackson says with
both guilt and reverence in her voice. ``We were coming to Diana's
memorial, yet we were making it festive with a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses and then continues on a new track. ``We've really
come to celebrate her life. She was a very lively extroverted kind
of character, so we've come to celebrate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin, John Massey, a courtly man wearing a navy blazer and
honey-colored necktie, chimes in cheerfully. ``I'm sure she's
looking down and thoroughly approving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' Jackson says approvingly. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a sadness emerges in her voice. ``I miss her. I miss the
color that she brought to everyday life,'' she says. ``Suddenly,
she would be on the front of the paper or you would open the
newspaper and she was there, doing something, always. She gave this
feeling of, whatever she suffered, she was quite a light, wasn't
she?''
</P>
<P>
   To Jackson and her friends -- and to millions more worldwide --
Princess Diana of Wales still represents a powerful combination of
the glamorous and familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her privileged and aristocratic background -- some say
her lineage was more royal than the royals -- she connected to
ordinary folks. They talk about her as if they hung out with her at
Kensington Palace, and shopped with her in the Sloane Street
boutiques. They know the failings of her marriage, her successes as
a mother and hold well-developed positions on her peculiar
relationship with the press.
</P>
<P>
   In the way that Americans over the age of 40 can tell you where
they were when they got news of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, many Britons have fixed in their minds the moment
they learned about Diana tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a year after her death, Diana remains alive in the press,
still young and beautiful. Her blue eyes radiate from the front
pages of tabloid newspapers that hounded her in life. Television
chat shows and news magazines frequently re-hash the familiar story
of the black Mercedes slamming into the 13th pillar of the famed
Parisian tunnel resulting in the violent death of a 36-year-old
woman whose warmth and vulnerability touched so many people.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, virtually all major London dailies carried special
magazine sections marking the anniversary of her death. Taking note
of the potential for Diana overkill, a London Times media writer
recently used his computer to determine that the word ``Diana'' had
been used in news stories in the British press 72 times in a
three-day period of mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Her life has been a rich mine for other media, as well. In
addition to a seemingly endless supply of books, authorized and
otherwise, two new Diana plays have opened here. There is talk of a
Walt Disney Co. movie.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the industry of commemoration has slipped into
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   The Diana souvenir business has been brisk with an estimated
$165 million in sales to date. In gift shops throughout London's
touristy districts are Diana coffee cups, plates, posters, T-shirts
and yes, souvenir thimbles, piled high in gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from Diana's estate and the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund have been deployed to rein in the numerous
unauthorized uses of her image and name.
</P>
<P>
   They may have to work extra billable hours to keep up with the
inspirations of enterprise. One Parisian hotel is offering what can
only be described as a brief tour of Diana's death. ``I am simply
responding to demand from my clients,'' an unabashed Emile
Cacciari, manager of the three-star Odeon Hotel on the Left Bank,
told Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 -- free to guests -- Cacciari is offering the chance to
relive Diana's final moments. For a little more, he can provide the
authenticity of a black Mercedes. ``We have a lot of American
visitors, and whenever they leave the hotel in the morning they
want to know two things and two things only: where is the Eiffel
Tower, and where is the Pont de l'Alma. People want to go (to the
scene of the crash); it's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds, he said, will be donated to the memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   There are varying schools of thought about Diana's lasting
legacy here. Some people believe she has permanently altered
British life, as if people impressed by the warmth of her example
now have come in touch with their feelings and have opened up.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lashmar, a London man who was at the gates of Kensington
Palace the night the city learned of her death, believes the
experience has helped Britons get in touch with their feelings. ``I
think we've definitely grown up since then,'' he says. ``I don't
think we would have behaved the way we do with the outpouring of
grief, and (us) being afraid to cry in public. I mean, that night
there were grown men of all shapes, sizes and descriptions crying
their eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourning has never really stopped. Bouquets with handwritten
notes still appear faithfully at Kensington Palace -- Diana's
former home -- where the world kept a televised vigil in the days
after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such public displays, there are those who believe the
outpourings have been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Decca Aitkenhead, a columnist for the Independent newspaper
here, said on a recent TV chat show that she believes people were
moved more by the larger-than-life proportions of Diana's life,
death and celebrity than by real feelings for the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of emotional outpourings we saw in the week after
her death were genuine in so far as they were real emotions,''
Aitkenhead said. ``The mistake was to interpret them as grief, that
people were grieving for Diana. I think what people were
demonstrating was their desire to feel a part of a big momentous
occasion, to feel a part of history, to feel they can suddenly talk
to strangers and they could bond in queues waiting to write in a
condolence book.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think as the year has passed, we're seeing it fade into
something that's just closer to sentimentality rather than a new
emotional maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed a new study suggests that Britain was not as united in
its grief as the TV images suggested. Research by the British Film
Institute suggests that many people here were displeased that so
much airtime was consumed by the commotion surrounding Diana's
death. Nearly 40 percent of the 500 people surveyed said the
coverage was excessive and overly sentimental. Many were irritated
that soaps, soccer and cricket matches were sacrificed to the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but whatever it is, it persists.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of going on sale, tickets to Althorp House were
snapped up by 152,000 people like Jackson and her friends. More
than 3,000 people a day have passed through Althorp's gates since
the estate was opened to the public July 1. Inside they find an
exhibit describing Diana's journey from gawky bride to
sophisticated patron. It ends with a visit to her grave on a small
island in a lake on the estate. Althorp's gates will close for the
year on Sunday(Aug. 30), the eve of the first anniversary of
Diana's death in a car crash in Paris' Pont de l'Alma traffic
tunnel, along with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
It has not been determined when they will open in 1999, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where sentimentality is aggressively spurned, a
candlelit march on Monday(Aug. 31), to mark the moment of her death
is expected to draw 10,000 mourners. The underpass, where emergency
workers struggled to save the fatally injured Diana, has become a
point of pilgrimage for hundreds of people each day.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent opinion poll showed that 70 percent of Parisians
want a nearby boulevard renamed to honor the late princess.
However, the city's mayor has responded by saying that Parisian
streets and buildings cannot be dedicated to celebrities until they
have been dead for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Purkins, who heads the memorial fund in Diana's name,
believes there is something deeper to her appeal. This, in part
because of her embrace of poor people and people on the margins,
and of causes such as Third World Poverty, AIDS research and
ridding the world of land mines that have in the past made the
British aristocracy squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's genuine regard for ordinary and damaged people will
stick, he said. ``That's something people instinctively know should
endure and is important, and is something that can be distinguished
from the more transitory emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with a balance of nearly $80 million -- more than $30
million of which came from the proceeds of Elton John's ``Candle in
the Wind'' tribute -- intends to give $8 million to $10 million a
year to causes that trustees believe Diana would have supported.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her most lasting influence is a change in the perceived
way the Royal Family interacts with the public. At times, this
regal populism can be awkward as with the recent visit by Queen
Elizabeth to a McDonald's restaurant. Perhaps fortunately, she
didn't order any food, saving a counter worker from having to utter
the phrase, ``And would one wish to have one's order
'Super-sized?'''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth, who was accused of not emoting sufficiently
after Diana's death, ordered flags at royal residences to fly at
half-mast on Monday(Aug. 31), to mark the first anniversary of
Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The queen and husband, Prince Philip will be joined by Prince
Charles and sons William and Harry, for family prayers at Crathie
Church, just outside the grounds of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.
Also at the service will be Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife,
Cherie. William, now 16, and Harry, 13, were told of Diana's death
by Charles while they were staying at Balmoral last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in image has come to Prince Charles, once
vilified for being cold-hearted to the genial Diana. While still
far from hugging his future subjects in public, the prince is often
seen with his two sons in comfortable ordinary surroundings, the
picture of the modern dad.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months after the crash, an opinion poll suggested
public approval of Charles had leaped nearly 20 points, from 42
percent last August to 61 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, that tabloid that dispensed its share of vitriol at
Charles' expense, patted him on the back this summer and even
advised him to go public with his longtime affair with Camilla
Parker Bowles -- once arguably the most hated woman in England.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new plays about Diana, ``Love Upon the Throne''
offers Charles a kind of forgiveness by expressing on his behalf,
sentiments he never would have shared in public -- even if he
really felt them. At the end of the play, the Charles character
utters these words to the stage Diana: ``I'm very, very, very sorry
for not loving you as I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to pay her respects at Diana's grave, Jackson, dressed
in a tasteful dark dress selected with Diana inspired sensibilities
-- expresses the common feeling toward the princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became a legend in my lifetime and that's not something
one often experiences really,'' she said. ``She did leave a mark on
the world, and it's quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her explanation of Diana's appeal is that the princess, despite
her advantages, was an underdog who survived in a hostile world and
in so doing discovered herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have been a recluse and hidden from the world in the
later years, but she went off to help people. She decided to do
this herself, and that's what makes it all the more commendable.''
</P>
<P>
   She sips her wine thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity -- no, we all had the opportunity -- to
see a human being flower.''

   LONDON _ Despite a year of deliberations by a jury of talk
shows, newspapers and authors, the real trial has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And at the rate this investigation is proceeding, it may well
become known as the ``Trial of the Next Century.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to high-profile cases in the United States,
the French inquiry into who caused the death of Princess Diana of
Wales has been conducted with nearly absolute stealth.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Herve Stephan, who under French law has the powers of
judge, investigator and prosecutor, has succeeded in shrouding the
probe in the strict secrecy that French law requires.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare statement last week, Stephan said the investigation
would end in October, when several ongoing tests are concluded. It
was the first statement prosecutors had issued since the early days
of the case. It was released to respond to the crush of media
queries surrounding the anniversary of Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine the meaning of
abnormally high levels of carbon monoxide in the blood of driver
Henri Paul, who was killed in the crash, the prosecutors said.
Blood tests also found that he was heavily drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the carbon monoxide isn't clear, but the gas can
cause dizziness, headaches, nausea and disorientation -- even
leaving a person in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also are reviewing the efforts to treat Diana at
the crash site. It is common in France to treat even seriously
injured people at crash sites, a practice that differs from
thinking in the United States that patients should be taken
immediately to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A third probe involves lab tests on the body of the wrecked
black Mercedes. Forensic tests are being conducted on the crashed
car to determine if it had been brushed by a mysterious Fiat before
the accident. Investigators said they had interviewed nearly 3,000
owners of Fiat Unos and reportedly have come up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have interviewed 153 people as potential witnesses
to the crash, but the investigators did not reveal any of their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the report by Stephan and his colleague, magistrate
Marie-Christine Devidal, is issued will it be determined who, if
anyone, will be criminally charged. A criminal trial would be open
to the press and public, even though no television cameras will be
allowed, said a spokesman for the court in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the only people in clear legal jeopardy are the
paparazzi who were trailing -- some say, chasing -- the Mercedes
that night, and who have been widely condemned for their part in
the world's most famous car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men -- nine photographers and the driver of one of the
motorcycles giving chase -- have been in legal limbo since the
early days following the accident. At that point, they were placed
under formal investigation on charges of both manslaughter and
failure to assist people in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have not agreed on the behavior of the photographers,
however, with some saying they were following too closely and
others saying they kept a safe distance before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   None of the paparazzi -- some of whom still work Diana-related
events -- has been formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Stephan summoned the paparazzi to give secret
testimony. Also present were Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi
Al Fayed, who also perished in the crash. Frances Shand Kydd,
Diana's mother, was also there to hear the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable leaks of the testimony, but some
news reports have said that those close to the case believe all 10
will be cleared of the manslaughter charges. However, some may go
to trial on the non-assistance charge, facing minor penalties,
perhaps a fine.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about other aspects of the case. It is
unclear how much management at the Paris Ritz Hotel, which Diana
and Al Fayed were leaving, knew about Henri Paul's condition. That
factor could come into play in determining the prestigious hotel's
liability in the case.
</P>
<P>
   And what about bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of
the crash? Six months ago, his story was that Paul appeared fine
that night -- that he wasn't visibly drunk. But that was before he
resigned from the employ Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   The latest clue comes in the form of new charges about the
mechanical condition of the car itself. It has been widely reported
here that a person familiar with the Mercedes has told
investigators that the car's brakes were faulty, making it
especially difficult to brake suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Etoile Limousines, which rented the car
to the Ritz, warned the hotel about the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps seeking to learn more about these matters, Stephan
Tuesday questioned two key witnesses: the president of the Ritz
Hotel, Frank Klein, and its director, Claude Roulet.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects of civil litigation and even more criminal
investigations, Stephan's report is likely to signal only the end
of the beginning.

<P>
   LONDON _ On his swim trunks are the letters ``W.O.W.''
</P>
<P>
   They stand for ``William of Wales,'' but it also pretty well
sums up the popular sentiment here for the eldest son of Princess
Diana and the most likely heir to her title of lead character in
the ongoing national melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   With his blond locks, shy ways and brilliant blue eyes, it is
hard to look at William and not see Diana.
</P>
<P>
   He has demonstrated a grasp of her ``common'' touch while
showing signs that he is quickly developing a charisma of his own.
On the day of his mother's funeral last year, William graciously
received flowers handed him by mourners outside Buckingham Palace,
a notable personal touch given the awkwardness exhibited by his
royal relatives. Britain was charmed.
</P>
<P>
   A new national survey placed him No. 2 on the list of most
popular royals, just behind Princess Anne, the queen's only
daughter. Prince Charles, his father, was at the bottom of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   His rare public appearances have created remarkable reactions.
Girls whose mothers -- and perhaps grandmothers -- no doubt
shrieked for the Beatles, do the same for the 6-foot-1 William,
whose mother, according to one author, teased her son by calling
him ``DDG'' -- for drop dead gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Vancouver in March he was besieged by frantic
girls, an experience that friends, always quoted anonymously in the
British press, said frightened him to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned 16 in June, the well-behaved newspapers were
rewarded with the transcript of a very tame interview that
essentially confirmed that William is a teenager with a teenager's
likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   He loves sports: particularly rugby, soccer, swimming, water
polo and tennis. He likes action movies and loves his black lab,
Widgeon. He likes techno pop music, and apparently the Spice Girls
(he met the girl-power group during a visit to South Africa) but
also has an ear for the classics.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Kennedy, a hair stylist from Surrey, offers the theory
that people are hoping that William can help fill the gap left in
their lives by the death of his mother. ``You know it reminds me of
the way that people tried to put John Lennon's son, you know, Sean,
out front after his father was murdered,'' she said. ``That's a
right raw thing to do, but they do it, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be trying. William is a tantalizing topic for a
British media eager to fill the void created by Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, Buckingham Palace has worked vigorously to
protect his, and younger brother Harry's privacy. Indiscretions
that seem minor compared to the wild, intrusive treatment afforded
Diana are not tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   When a newspaper reported that William was selecting girls for
invitations to tea, the teenager filed an official complaint with
the Press Complaint Commission, leading to a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   When William and 13-year-old Harry met in private for 30 minutes
with Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' long-time love
interest, the tabloid Sun got the scoop of the year for a
three-page spread, photos and all --much to the outrage of the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, the British media, perhaps chastened by
the public's hostility after Diana's death, have provided William
the space to grow up in as normal an environment as can be expected
for a future king.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as William prepares return to his studies at the elite
prep-school Eton, there remain some misgivings about the attention
heading his way.
</P>
<P>
   There even have been calls for tougher laws written specifically
to protect the princes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To rely on the decency of the media is ludicrous,'' wrote
Libby Purves, a columnist for The Times of London. ``The princes
should be allowed to walk freely in their own country, take risks,
make decisions and grow up without being spied on.''

   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''
</P>

Wyborcza,'' a leading Polish newspaper published in Warsaw and

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''
</P>
<P>

Wyborcza,'' a leading Polish newspaper published in Warsaw and
other Polish cities.)

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

SOME PAIN SUFFERERS FIND AN ATTRACTION TO MAGNETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Whenever Joan Schermerhorn feels a twinge of pain
in her knees, she reaches for a magnet rather than a bottle of
ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do feel like a kook,'' she said about applying magnets the
size of half-dollars to her knees. But, after almost a decade of
chronic pain from a rare disorder known as stiff man's syndrome,
Schermerhorn, 64, says she can't shrug off the fact that she feels
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried every product I can think of for pain,'' she said
from her home in Clifton Park, N.Y. ``They're definitely a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like snake oil _ and some physicians aren't
buying it _ consider that one of the largest manufacturers of
therapeutic magnets is reporting annual global sales of more than
$1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics call it hype. Believers offer personal testimonials to
back up their claims that magnets aren't just for the refrigerator
anymore. Suffer from lower back pain? There's a magnetic seat
cushion. Have a headache? Try a magnetic headband.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find magnetic insoles for your shoes, magnetic mattress
pads for you bed and magnetic wraps for your arms, wrists and
knees.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't find are any good scientific studies in the
United States proving that magnets work.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are licensed medical devices in Korea and Japan,
magnets have not yet undergone any vigorous testing in the United
States. The Office of Alternative Medicine at the National
Institutes of Health is hoping to fill that gap with a study at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, consumers are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is any good evidence the magnets do
anything,'' said Dr. Doyt Conn, senior vice president of medical
affairs for the Arthritis Foundation in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Like most alternative therapies, magnets aren't approved or
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. And technically, any
salesperson who pitches magnets as a medical device is breaking the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and supporters of therapeutic magnets claim they promote
healing by improving circulation to the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the magnetic field is believed to attract and
repel charged particles in the blood, creating movement and heat.
As a result, blood vessels dilate, making it easier for blood to
circulate.
</P>
<P>
   They differ from common refrigerator magnets in their strength
and polarity.
</P>
<P>
   Fridge magnets register about 4 gauss, a measure of magnetic
strength, while therapeutic magnets register 800 to 4,000 gauss.
The magnetic field delivered by these magnets is static with no
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   A more accepted form of magnetic therapy in this country uses
pulsed magnetic fields. The FDA has long approved the use of pulsed
magnetic fields in ``bone-growth stimulators'' to promote the
healing of hard-to-heal fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many physicians are skeptical that the static cousins, being
sold from basements, catalogs and stores across the country, have
any value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no real science there that a physician or a consumer
can rely on to explain how it works or to know they're not being
ripped off,'' said Dr. Joel Kremer, a professor of medicine and the
head of the division of rheumatology at the Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't deterred people from using magnets in various ways
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra reportedly slept with a magnetic lodestone to prevent
aging. Paracelsus, a Swiss physician and alchemist who lived from
1493 to 1541, theorized that since magnets had the power to attract
iron, they could also attract diseases and pull them from the body.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous proponent of magnets was Franz Anton
Mesmer, a German from whose name comes the word mesmerism. He
promoted the theory of ``animal magnetism.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many horse trainers have started using magnets
on their injured thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, magnets are making a marketing comeback, in part because
of numerous endorsements by professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Steve Atwater, a starting safety for the Denver Broncos
who sleeps on a magnetic mattress pad. Jim Colbert, a top golfer on
the senior PGA Tour, reportedly credits his success to the magnets
taped to his back. New York Yankees pitcher Hideki Irabu uses
dozens of tiny magnets taped to his body.
</P>
<P>
   Also credited for the success of magnets is a convincing
marketing strategy, known as network marketing, used by Nikken, the
largest seller of magnets in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes associated with shady pyramid schemes, network
marketing thrives on word-of-mouth referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest in those who are pushing it to
succeed,'' Kremer said. ``Therefore there's a lot of hype. All you
can say is consumer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Physicians, at a loss to explain how magnets work, aren't
dismissing the power of suggestion. Studies have shown that 20 to
40 percent of people who unknowingly take a ``sugar pill'' or any
other placebo report an improvement in their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying the placebo effect isn't valid: if you feel
better, you feel better, no matter what the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, however, is that people with chronic pain,
especially those suffering from some forms of progressive
arthritis, will opt for magnets rather than medical treatment and
that underlying problems could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Conn, of the Arthritis Foundation, believes one reason people
are so willing to try magnets is because they aren't aware of the
medical options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a very good job of managing most types of arthritis,
if we catch it early,'' he said. ``There's a general misconception
in the population that there's not much you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Conn said he had no problem with people using magnets as long as
they don't use them in lieu of getting a diagnosis from a physician
and as a long as they don't discard other medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against investing a lot of money and hope in
unproven treatments. Magnets don't work for everybody and pregnant
women and people with pacemakers are advised not to try them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain makes you vulnerable,'' Conn said.
</P>
<P>
   Schermerhorn has spent more than $200 on magnets and accessories
since she saw an ad for them in March in a free circular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth every cent,'' she said. ``I can't get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that she has no plans to abandon her other
medications or regular visits to her neurologist. ``It's a relief,
not a cure,'' she said.

   MOSCOW _ A note to Bill Clinton: On your scheduled trip to
Moscow next week, please bring dollars. The 10,000 American
expatriates in this city, not to mention 10 million or so Russians,
could use them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll write you a check ... honest.
</P>
<P>
   It is grim business for Russia, this main event of faltering
banks, plummeting stocks and the withering ruble -- a financial
crisis called ``Indonesia with nukes'' by some Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned a curious sideshow: Dollars are scarce and people
are spending considerable amounts of time and effort trying to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of spotting an automatic teller machine (ATM) that will
accept a U.S. bank card and spit out dollars now spread through the
city like news of a UFO sighting.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know was nearly mobbed on the street the other day as
she pulled a $20 bill out of her wallet on her approach to a
currency-exchange window. The eager Russians around her wanted to
trade their rickety rubles for her bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of ironic that we are so used to U.S. dollars being
available everywhere and all of that seems to be over for the time
being,'' said Paul Backer, an American lawyer in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble may be legal tender in Russia, but the dollar is
serious cash. It is illegal to pay in dollars for goods and
services, and unlawful for merchants to accept them. But, well,
let's just say it happens -- often.
</P>
<P>
   In value terms, estimates say there are as many U.S. dollars in
circulation in Russia as there are rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Aug. 17 announcement of devaluation that allows the
ruble to slide against the dollar by as much as 34 percent -- to
9.5 rubles to the dollar compared to its previous value of 6.2 --
dollars were easily accessible at banks, at American Express and
from ATMs in major hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the announcement, I happened to walk in to the
American Express bank and cashed a U.S. check in order to pay my
telephone bill and other work expenses. They handed over $1,000 in
rubles and $2,000 in U.S. currency without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the government devalued the ruble. Twenty
minutes later, an American colleague went to AmEx to pick up $8,000
wired to him by his editors. All banking services were closed. He
is still waiting for his money.
</P>
<P>
   Well-salaried expatriates are cash-starved. An American woman in
search of a working ATM posted a message on a computerized bulletin
board last week. Where can I go to get dollars, she asked. Someone
replied: Try the corner of 52nd and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is no joke. Some Americans are contemplating trips to
Helsinki or Warsaw simply to get dollars wired from America and
bring them back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Russians, most of whom receive their pay in rubles, they
spend what they need to survive and convert the rest to dollars as
a form of cookie-jar savings account.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there are almost as many currency-exchange booths in
Russia as there are places to buy vodka, in other words, on just
about every other street corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar is in fact our national currency,'' quipped the
newspaper Sevodnya about last week's ruble devaluation, ``so let it
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the ruble dropping, the price of dollars is going up.
Nervous banks and people are hoarding. Large Western companies
doing business in Russia are getting their dollars for now, but
they fear their corporate wire-transfers eventually could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper offered a clip-and-save guide for
Russians to cope with the crisis, including tips such as: if you
were waiting to buy that TV or fridge, do it now. And don't
needlessly rush to exchange rubles for dollars as that will only
weaken rubles further.
</P>
<P>
   The advice concluded: ``If your savings are in a strong, hard
currency, you have just wasted your time reading this list.''

trade their rickety rubles for her bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of ironic that we are so used to U.S. dollars being
available everywhere and all of that seems to be over for the time
being,'' said Paul Backer, an American lawyer in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble may be legal tender in Russia, but the dollar is
serious cash. It is illegal to pay in dollars for goods and
services, and unlawful for merchants to accept them. But, well,
let's just say it happens -- often.
</P>
<P>
   In value terms, estimates say there are as many U.S. dollars in
circulation in Russia as there are rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Aug. 17 announcement of devaluation that allows the
ruble to slide against the dollar by as much as 34 percent -- to
9.5 rubles to the dollar compared to its previous value of 6.2 --
dollars were easily accessible at banks, at American Express and
from ATMs in major hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the announcement, I happened to walk in to the
American Express bank and cashed a U.S. check in order to pay my
telephone bill and other work expenses. They handed over $1,000 in
rubles and $2,000 in U.S. currency without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the government devalued the ruble. Twenty
minutes later, an American colleague went to AmEx to pick up $8,000
wired to him by his editors. All banking services were closed. He
is still waiting for his money.
</P>
<P>
   Well-salaried expatriates are cash-starved. An American woman in
search of a working ATM posted a message on a computerized bulletin
board last week. Where can I go to get dollars, she asked. Someone
replied: Try the corner of 52nd and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is no joke. Some Americans are contemplating trips to
Helsinki or Warsaw simply to get dollars wired from America and
bring them back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Russians, most of whom receive their pay in rubles, they
spend what they need to survive and convert the rest to dollars as
a form of cookie-jar savings account.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there are almost as many currency-exchange booths in
Russia as there are places to buy vodka, in other words, on just
about every other street corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar is in fact our national currency,'' quipped the
newspaper Sevodnya about last week's ruble devaluation, ``so let it
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the ruble dropping, the price of dollars is going up.
Nervous banks and people are hoarding. Large Western companies
doing business in Russia are getting their dollars for now, but
they fear their corporate wire-transfers eventually could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper offered a clip-and-save guide for
Russians to cope with the crisis, including tips such as: if you
were waiting to buy that TV or fridge, do it now. And don't
needlessly rush to exchange rubles for dollars as that will only
weaken rubles further.
</P>
<P>
   The advice concluded: ``If your savings are in a strong, hard
currency, you have just wasted your time reading this list.''

   MOSCOW _ A note to Bill Clinton: On your scheduled trip to
Moscow next week, please bring dollars. The 10,000 American
expatriates in this city, not to mention 10 million or so Russians,
could use them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll write you a check ... honest.
</P>
<P>
   It is grim business for Russia, this main event of faltering
banks, plummeting stocks and the withering ruble -- a financial
crisis called ``Indonesia with nukes'' by some Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned a curious sideshow: Dollars are scarce and people
are spending considerable amounts of time and effort trying to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of spotting an automatic teller machine (ATM) that will
accept a U.S. bank card and spit out dollars now spread through the
city like news of a UFO sighting.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know was nearly mobbed on the street the other day as
she pulled a $20 bill out of her wallet on her approach to a
currency-exchange window. The eager Russians around her wanted to
trade their rickety rubles for her bill.

CUTRUFELLO `ON THE EDGE OF LIVING' HER DREAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Thursday, Aug. 27) 
(Eds.: Cutrufello to appear on ``The Tonight Show'' on Thursday is
cq) 
(Attn: Conn.) 
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first words heard on Mary Cutrufello's
cool-rockin' new album are ``Ain't it good to be alive on a sunny
day ...''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, every day feels like a good day to be alive for the
Houston resident who, in recent months, has maintained a low
profile locally while commuting between her management office in
Nashville and her record label in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful place to be, on the edge of living your
dream,'' said Cutrufello last week prior to a gig at a local pub.
</P>
<P>
   Cutrufello's major-label debut, ``When the Night Is Through,''
was released Tuesday on Mercury Records. On Thursday, she will
appear on ``The Tonight Show'' with fellow guests Halle Berry and
Rob Schneider before starting what could become an extended
national and international tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out there and playing in front of a crowd, that's what
I love to do,'' she said. ``I've got a hot band, and I'm putting
out a record I really dig. I've been working toward this for such a
long time. It's fun, because you can really feel the momentum
starting to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutrufello, 27, grew up in New Haven, Conn., listening to her
parents' album collection of Broadway musicals and mainstream rock
'n' roll on the radio. She moved to Texas in 1991 after graduating
from Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play the guitar for a living,'' she explained.
``It seemed like Texas was the only place in the country you could
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After landing in Austin and then moving to Houston, she immersed
herself in the regional honky-tonk culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I sort of discovered while I was at the end of
my college years,'' she said of her passion for country music. ``I
graduated with a degree in American studies, so I figured I would
go study some American culture that I didn't know anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutrufello proved to be a quick study. She soon found herself
playing for two-steppers in small-town dives, as well as for hip
roots-rock fans in Austin, Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to play three or four hours a night, three or four
nights a week,'' she said of her apprenticeship in country music.
``That's a great thing for learning how to entertain a crowd. I
also learned a lot about the importance of craft in becoming a
solid songwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   But eventually there came a point when Cutrufello realized she
had to get back to her own roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I could do a pretty good facsimile of country _
for a kid from Connecticut. But if it's not your home, it's only
going to be so authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between what I do and what Dale
Watson does, because (country) is Dale's home. One of the lessons I
learned was, I should go back to my home. I grew up on Petty, the
Stones, Bruce, Mellencamp, all that stuff. Where I feel most
comfortable is where I'm the most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   A national tour playing lead guitar with Jimmie Dale Gilmore
raised her profile in the music industry, as did an exhilarating
set at a rock showcase in Nashville. She was signed to Mercury
Records in March 1997 following her South by Southwest performance
at the Austin Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Night Is Through'' was recorded in Los Angeles with
producer Thom Panunzio, who has worked with U2, Black Sabbath and
Lone Justice, among other rock acts. Cutrufello and Panunzio put
together a studio band, including such heavyweights as drummers
Kenny Aronoff (John Mellencamp, Bob Seger) and Jim Keltner (Little
Village), bassist Bob Glaub (Jackson Browne, John Fogerty) and
keyboardist Rami Jaffee (the Wallflowers).
</P>
<P>
   But if Cutrufello was at all intimidated to find herself in such
heavy company, it doesn't come through in the recording. Her
throat-shredding vocals and attack-mode guitar are front and center
in the mix, while her songs reflect the influences of the Rolling
Stones, Springsteen, Mellencamp and other classic rockers. Jaffee's
organ, in particular, adds a soulful, vintage vibe.
</P>
<P>
   While the image of a dreadlocked black woman guitarist is not
quite as unexpected in rock as it was in country music, Cutrufello
still could prove to be a tough sell to rock radio programmers
unwilling to take a chance on anything different. A single, ``She
Can't Let Go,'' has been sent to adult-alternative and album-rock
formats.
</P>
<P>
   Cutrufello's manager, Holly Gleason, said a big factor in the
decision to sign with Mercury was the company's top-to-bottom
support for Cutrufello's musical vision. The cover art for ``When
the Night Is Through'' features a silhouette of Cutrufello on a
darkened street corner, guitar in hand, dreadlocks flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Mercury, it's `This is a great record,' not `This is a
great record for a black woman from Yale with dreadlocks playing
guitar.''' Gleason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Mary is all those things certainly makes her stand out,
but it's not like she needs special treatment. More than anything,
she sees herself as a guitar player who wants to rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The band Cutrufello will take on the road includes her Texas
rhythm section of bassist Roland Denny and drummer Dana Myzer, plus
former E-Street Band keyboardist Danny Frederici, who came out of
semi-retirement to do the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Frederici's former boss, Springsteen, has reinvented
himself as a folk singer in recent years, Cutrufello maintains a
firm faith in the healing properties of full-assault rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll to me is a very powerful force that can bring
people together. It's a way to get through the hard times and
celebrate the good times,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I used to listen to rock radio out of New
York City. You got a sense of being in the community of believers.
It's like a sacred trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll could use a few more true believers these days,
and Cutrufello is ready, willing and able to pick up the fallen
flag. But whatever happens with her career, she's not planning on
moving to the music industry centers in New York or Los Angeles
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Houston a lot. I like the spirit, the whole downtown
revival thing with the Astros,'' she said. ``Once you've come out
for small-market baseball, you can't very well move to a big-market
city.''

THE HEEL AND THE HEALING PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's where I hit the wall on President Clinton
and his problems.
</P>
<P>
   I was reading the transcript of Monday's White House briefing by
press secretary Mike McCurry. I read these to congratulate myself
on not being a White House reporter. I wouldn't even accept the
Martha's Vineyard beach beat.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter asked McCurry: ``What can we construe from the fact
that the first family didn't go to church yesterday and the
president hasn't set foot on a golf course of (sic) yet this
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry answered: ``That they were enjoying their time _ well,
they were spending time together ...''
</P>
<P>
   At that point I just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Then a reporter asked: ``Mike, you said the other day that it
was your sense that the healing process was not completed yet. Any
update on ...''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter wants an official update on the healing process? It
was at that point I began the screaming process.
</P>
<P>
   What about our healing process? Is there no relief from the
speculating heads on CNN, and the talk-show Monica jokes? The
nation is dying of Clinton water torture, as regular leaks drip
into our brainpan.
</P>
<P>
   The public may think that, because of Clinton and Ken Starr, we
in the news or commentary business are in hog heaven right now. No,
we're in pig hell.
</P>
<P>
   Our president acted like a pig, and we've been printing the
details, sometimes in wire stories citing a single unidentified
source, such as ``a legal source close to the Lewinsky camp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there, a Camp Lewinsky?'' asked an editor who has to
look at stuff like this all day.
</P>
<P>
   Another editor said he hit his personal wall when he read a
story citing ``a source close to the garment.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it wasn't a dry-cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The above comments were made by staff members of the San
Francisco Examiner airing feelings about coverage of all the
president's problems. You could call it part of the healing
process, but this is a newspaper, not a touchy-feely presidency, so
this unofficial meeting was called ``a gasbag session.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be right to divulge all the hot air that was vented.
Let's just say that when it comes to Clinton coverage, there's as
much free-floating anxiety and anger inside newspapers as there is
outside. OK, I'll mention a couple of ideas that came out of the
gasbag session:
</P>
<P>
   1) One reporter said that if Ken Starr's report to Congress on
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair isn't fit for children, it should be
printed in a section clearly marked ``Keep out of reach of
children.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Another reporter dissented, saying the Clinton sex scandal
was the first thing to get her teen-age nieces and nephews
interested in reading the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a literacy program that works. To make it more
effective we can do the same as (1) above, and mark it ``Keep out
of reach of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I care more about my parents reading all this stuff.
They're old-fashioned. They don't like to read about sex in the
newspaper, and they don't like the idea that a president lied to
the nation, his family and supporters _ which until last week
included them.
</P>
<P>
   There's no healing process that will make them like Clinton
again. They yearn for a president they can respect.
</P>
<P>
   We're in a downward spiral, with Matt Drudge and yakking heads
on TV devaluing the national discourse. One editor here says, with
some exaggeration, that she looks back fondly at the O.J. Simpson
trial. At least she knew where all the leaks were coming from, and
didn't have to worry about a source close to the garment.
</P>
<P>
   We say we've had enough. We know we'll get more no matter what
we say. Everyone says they've had enough. They say they're just
buying the newspaper for the Yeltsin news.
</P>
<P>
   Man, that Yeltsin is so popular that newspapers are selling like
Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   You won't get a media culpa from me. There is only one man to
blame for this toxic national Love Canal, not some vast right-wing
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who signed the Defense of Marriage Act, thereby
interfering in the private lives of gays who want to get married.
Now he's saying we're interfering in his marriage and private life.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who got rid of Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
after she made some controversial comments, including one in favor
of masturbation. Now we have a president who has tried to define
oral sex as a sin comparable to having extra cheese on a Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who started an affair in the Oval Office with an
intern when he was in the middle of a sexual harassment lawsuit.
What we have here is one arrogant, sanctimonious guy. All we got
from the man from Hope was hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton doesn't think he deserves everything that's happened to
him. The thing is, the American people don't deserve everything
that's happening to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Democrats don't deserve what's happening to them.
Clinton has led them into a blind alley, and Republicans are
getting ready to pound them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're tired of this whole thing, turn off CNN and stop
buying newspapers. As for me, I am starting my healing process.
This will be my last Clinton column until the next shocking
revelation or act of war.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a few days.

THE NAKED TRUTH ABOUT POLITICIANS AND MORALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ She was tall and blonde. She wore a bored
expression and very little else. She was on stage Tuesday afternoon
at Goldfingers, a strip joint on State Street, and music was
blasting.
</P>
<P>
   The tall blonde was performing some art. That's official now. A
federal judge has ruled that the relentless effort by the City of
Schenectady to shut down strip joints violates the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of this huge flap in Schenectady _ the one
that'll cost taxpayers a few hundred grand in damages and legal
fees for the ladies and their employers _ the issue has been
whether stripping to music is art or obscenity. That and who gets
to decide that question _ the performers, the customers or local
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Is that we want our politicians doing, telling us what's art and
what isn't?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the cops were raiding these joints every 15
minutes, I dropped by one of the clubs. What I saw was a giggling
squad of girls young enough to be my daughters _ and Bill
Clinton's, too, by the way _ adorned with tattoos and nose rings.
They were gleefully exhibiting for a bunch of goggle-eyed strangers
what they ought properly to display only for their husbands. Or, in
some cases, their gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, however, had gone out and dragged those spectators in
there. My admission fee was paid by my newspaper's expense account.
Hey, journalism is hell. But these guys had to cough up the money
themselves, and they did it willingly. If that's their idea of
artistic appreciation, whose business is it? Not mine. Not yours.
And certainly not Al Jurczynski's.
</P>
<P>
   Jurczynski, Schenectady's mayor, argues that he was just trying
to protect public decency. Well, fine. Nobody can argue that he's
been anything but a conscientious mayor. And he's right when he
says that these joints degrade the neighborhoods in which they're
located.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, though, the solution to that problem was to
zone these businesses into specific neighborhoods _ away from
homes, away from people who find their presence on the block
offensive. Zoning is a legitimate function of local politicians to
protect property values and neighborhood integrity. That's what
Rudolph Giuliani is doing in New York City, and the courts have no
problem with that. That's what city after city has done across the
country _ Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The republic still stands, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   What politicians in those places have not done is to say to the
citizenry, ``We'll decide what you can see and not see. We'll
decide what's good for your character and what's not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what that federal judge objected to, and he was
completely right to do so. Al is the mayor. Nobody elected him art
critic. Nobody elected him daddy.
</P>
<P>
   If it's true that prostitution is taking place in these joints _
and that's the criminal charge against one of these places _ then
prosecute the crime, don't try to board up the club.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm delighted that Mayor Al and Mike Broadbank, his
city lawyer, are not liable for personal damages in this case. But
I'm not thrilled that the taxpayers of Schenectady will have to pay
damages to these strippers, the club operators and their lawyers.
When Jurczynski had his cops start busting these people, it should
not have required a Felix Frankfurter to see where this would end
up.
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely what happens, though, when local politicians
try to impose their visions of morality and art appreciation on
everybody else. You can approve or not approve of strippers and
stripping, but this particular art form has been around at least
since Salome.
</P>
<P>
   And it really is dangerous when some local politician like Al
Jurczynski starts counting her veils.

<P>
   BOSTON _ If only Jack had known: All beanstalks are magical. He
wouldn't have traded his mother's only cow for a handful of beans
and wouldn't have had to endure her sorrow as she tossed them
outside. Of course, there would have been no castle above the
clouds and no frightening giant with a hen who laid golden eggs.
</P>
<P>
   To find ordinary magic, however, Jack could have just planted
bean seeds and watched them grow. The stalks reach skyward
overnight. They appear so willingly, the vines looping up and
around, turning themselves into airy bushes laden with slender
green ornaments, that it's nothing short of garden enchantment.
</P>
<P>
   It suits the beans. They've finally reached their glory. A
vegetable once so dependable in its frozen state that a generation
of American children knew little else, fresh beans are now treated
with the same reverence as the garden's exotica. They've moved out
of their amandine rut into an exalted position on the plate. They
appear bathed in balsamic vinaigrette and toasted walnuts, tossed
with grilled portobellos, wrapped up with a vinegary white anchovy
fillet, sauteed Asian-style with fermented black beans, and steamed
with native halibut and a handful of summer herbs. Wet weeks and
dry spells both slowed down the harvest briefly, but green beans
are now bountiful _ and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't always. Before the renovation of the American menu,
green beans were stringy (hence the name string bean), often chewy,
rarely very slender, and cooked to an olive color. When they were
fresh in summertime, they were ``boiled,'' which sounds frightening
_ and was. It seemed as if some people put the beans on to cook
after breakfast, in anticipation of the midday meal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when good cooks offer green beans in August, they're
always native, often harvested that morning. ``Imports,'' or beans
that come from New Jersey, for example, are never considered. And
each bean has been plucked from the vine by hand. ``On the
hand-picked you find the stem on, on the machine pick you'll see a
cut,'' explains produce distributor Henry Wainer of Sid Wainer and
Son in New Bedford, who always goes for the hand-picked bean.
</P>
<P>
   There are machines that act like hand-pickers. At Wilson Farms
in Lexington, where all beans offered are hand-picked, Calvin
Wilson points out that new mechanical pickers leave on the calyx,
or stem end. The biggest disadvantage to the machine, he says, is
that beans have to be large enough for it to pick. They're ``not
the perfect size you want to pick,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Though you can buy beans all over town, native beans are found
only at farm stands and farmers' markets. Local wholesalers give
growers so little money for their beans, says Steve Verrill of
Verrill Farm in Concord, that he wouldn't offer beans to the
vendors at New England Produce Center in Chelsea because ``you come
back without a shirt on.'' Verrill would rather plow them under
than take less than they cost him to pick. At his farm stand he
gets $1.79 a pound, which is the going rate. They're exactly the
right size to eat, the beans aren't bursting out of the pods, and
nothing is bruised.
</P>
<P>
   In bean terminology, hand-picked beans are the elite corps. So
are beans that you can call by name. These include Maxibels, very
slender and extra long; Fire Dragons, off-white beans streaked
dramatically with purple and green; Royal Burgundy, green inside
and dark purple outside, meant for eating young in salads; and
Triumph de Farcy, or haricots verts, thin, tender French beans that
need only the slightest cooking.
</P>
<P>
   On the plate, wherever they turn up, they have their pointed end
on. ``The groovy part,'' says Stan Frankenthaler of Salamander
restaurant in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other unwritten rules. Green beans arrive on the
plate nicely crunchy (never underdone) and if they're served raw,
the chef knows who picked them and when.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McClelland of L'Espalier in Boston picks his own beans
some mornings. He goes into his South Hamilton garden with his
6-year-old son, Keppler; his 5-year-old daughter, Annie; and baby
James, 18 months. His home garden is his ``inspiration garden,'' he
says. Most of L'Espalier's produce comes from Green Meadow Farm in
Wilbraham.
</P>
<P>
   His own beans might be sliced very thinly lengthwise (what is
often called ``Frenched,'' to replicate the skinny French beans).
He does the Frenching to order, he says, so the beans hardly sit
before they're served _ without blanching _ as a garnish for a
seared piece of fresh tuna. ``It's a little tedious,'' he admits,
``but when you get a vegetable that's that fresh it cries with
moisture.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenthaler serves speckled Fire Dragons or the purple Red
Burgundies raw in salads, dressed with a lemon vinaigrette and
shallots. ``We do that purposely to keep the decorative look and
the crunch,'' he says. Another of his signature dishes is a saute
of mixed beans tossed with hot sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and
fermented black beans.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenthaler's produce comes from Nesenkeag Farm in Litchfield,
N.H., and from Hutchins Farm in Concord. Both have a system for
informing Frankenthaler and the other chefs in town the day before
what they will be picking _ or not picking. Two weeks ago, because
of the heavy rains in June, Hutchins had no beans to ship to
restaurants. The few that pickers culled from the beanstalks, says
Hutchins co-owner Gordon Bemis, went to the farm stand. Stalks
planted after the rains allowed him to send out lots of beans the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   Bemis is growing a Kentucky Wonder bush bean, a bean that used
to grow only on poles. He describes it as having ``good bean
flavor.'' Some chefs describe the fleshy Romano beans, which are
wide and flat, as having a ``meaty'' flavor. Romanos need more
cooking than ordinary green beans.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure maximum bean flavor, chefs use the ``blanch and
shock'' method of cooking, in which the beans are dropped into
boiling water for a minute or two, then plunged into an ice-water
bath. The technique gets its name from the shock of the ice after
the heat of the boiling water. The blanching offers a head start on
the cooking while the ice brings back the beans' bright green
color.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Belben, general manager of East Meets West catering,
says that when chef Greg Topham sees native beans that are
``gorgeous _ long with the stems on,'' he blanches and shocks them.
Then he tosses them with a balsamic vinaigrette, dusts them with
crushed walnuts or pine nuts, and marinates them overnight.
``They're best at room temperature,'' says Belben.
</P>
<P>
   Both Frankenthaler and Ana Sortun of Casablanca in Cambridge are
using Nesenkeag's golden beans. ``They're not like yellow wax
beans,'' Sortun says. ``They're a darker yellow, they're smaller
and brighter _ not quite as bright as tiny yellow tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   When striped bass was in season, Sortun made a compote of golden
beans with tomatoes and ribbons of zucchini to set under the fish.
Now she's doing the same dish with halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Sortun doesn't blanch the beans first for all dishes because
she's convinced that small slender beans have thin enough skins
that don't need extra cooking. ``It's the difference between a good
fresh pea and a woody fresh pea.''
</P>
<P>
   Her antipasto contains beans roasted in olive oil and tied into
bundles with a pickled white anchovy fillet. ``Beans are sort of
like potatoes,'' she explains. ``They need something kind of salty
that will bring out their sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Ingalls of Palmer's restaurant in Andover, the beans
need smoke. He tosses grilled portobello mushrooms with hard-cooked
egg, adds shaved Asiago cheese, and finishes the dish with slender
haricots verts.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls learned green beans amandine in cooking school. In 1977,
at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., they ruled
the menu, he says. ``We sauteed almonds, the sliced kind, until
they had a nice brown color on them.'' The beans had already been
blanched and shocked. As a dish was ordered, ``we steamed the beans
to warm them up, then dropped them in the saute pan with the
almonds, salt, and pepper. We served them with beef _ either prime
rib or filet mignon.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Verrill, whose farm sends half a dozen bean varieties
including Jade and Garden Jumbo to 15 restaurants inside Route 128,
goes into his kitchen at home and makes what he calls ``a big
production.''
</P>
<P>
   It drives his wife crazy, but he insists on steaming all the
varieties separately. ``Two different kinds of beans in two
different pans,'' he explains. Then he pulls a bowl from the
cupboard and sits down to eat. ``I like to eat beans just steamed
in a cereal bowl with butter, cream, salt, and pepper,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Let the chefs fuss with flavors.

<P>
   _  &UR; NOTE: As the first anniversary of the death of Princess Diana
approaches, a theologian asks whether she is in heaven or hell.  &LR; 
__
</P>
<P>
   The popular beatification of Princess Diana forces an indiscreet
theological question: Where is she now?
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian scheme of things, God judged the most popular
woman on earth after her death and sent her soul to heaven,
purgatory or hell.
</P>
<P>
   If heaven was her fate, God smiles on her posthumous veneration.
Purgatory is where the saved burn off their impurities, so at least
a ticket to heaven is guaranteed (and prayers might even speed her
deliverance).
</P>
<P>
   Hell, however, cannot be ruled out. If Diana died with ``grave
sins'' on her soul _ a not unlikely circumstance _ she is probably
now in hell, beyond hope and prayer, and thus unworthy of the
slightest reverence, let alone a funeral service at Westminster
Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Let us consider the three possibilities in more detail. The 1994
Catechism of the Catholic Church, the most comprehensive modern
compendium of Christian doctrine (bearing the imprimatur of John
Paul II), is unequivocal. Although the Church of England differs
sharply from the pope on female ordination, married priests and
divorce, its beliefs about matters relating to Diana's salvation
(namely, adultery and fornication) are essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for heaven is, I am afraid, weak. Church tradition
reserves instant entry for saints, martyrs and baptized babies who
die before reaching the age of reason. Nobody else qualifies.
Diana's good works may have been very good, but her trespasses,
large and small, surely barred St Peter's gate, at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves purgatory or hell, depending on the state of her
soul at the moment of death. As the Catechism says, ``To die in
mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love
means remaining separated from him forever.'' In other words, hell.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana's soul was in dire peril of damnation on the
evening of Aug. 30, assuming that she and Emad ``Dodi'' Al Fayed
had committed unrepented fornication (``carnal union between an
unmarried man and an unmarried woman'') during their romantic
holiday in France. Let us remember that all sex acts outside
marriage, and not a few within, are hell-bent offenses in the
Catechism. Masturbation, homosexual relations and watching the
Playboy television channel rank, in scale of punishment, with
running drug cartels and exterminating aboriginal populations.
Adultery and fornication remain as satanic today as they were in
King Solomon's time.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Diana had begged God's forgiveness after
the car crash, and if she expired in his grace, she would have been
cast into the ``cleansing fires'' of purgatory, there to expiate
her sins before ascending to heaven. Diana's last thoughts are
unknown, but if they did not include sincere sorrow for lying with
Dodi, even purgatory is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, hell looms as the most plausible spot for the
princess's soul. Christian dogma, immutable and infallible,
requires sinners in her presumed spiritual condition _ stained by
mortal sin _ to be condemned. ``Depart from me, you cursed, into
eternal fire,'' said Christ of the doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, the pope overlooked the damaging evidence
against Diana and gave a positive signal as to her redemption.
``The Holy Father has offered prayers summoning her to our Heavenly
Father's eternal love,'' he wrote in the third person to Queen
Elizabeth on Sept. 1. His remark implied purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father, is surely permitted to exclaim
in grief: ``God took their souls to live together in paradise.''
But how do we explain the pope's apparent blessing of the world's
most famous offender against the sixth commandment?
</P>
<P>
   A devil's advocate might detect hypocrisy in the papal posture.
People who meet their Maker en route to an illicit and scandalous
rendezvous do not generally receive benedictions from Vatican City.
The exception of the princess of Wales suggests that the church's
official position on sex crimes and punishment cannot withstand
rational scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Diana in hell seems cruel and repellent in human
terms, although it comfortably suits the divine. ``The gate is
narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find
it are few,'' declared Christ on the depressing odds against
anybody's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Roman/Anglican theology, which demonizes deviations of the
flesh, leaves little room for optimism in Diana's case. But that
tells us more about the chilling core of Christianity than about
the ultimate worth of a young, kind, sometimes foolish beauty who
had the misfortune to marry a prince and perish with a playboy.

<P>
   That leaves purgatory or hell, depending on the state of her
soul at the moment of death. As the Catechism says, ``To die in
mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love
means remaining separated from him forever.'' In other words, hell.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana's soul was in dire peril of damnation on the
evening of Aug. 30, assuming that she and Emad ``Dodi'' Al Fayed
had committed unrepented fornication (``carnal union between an
unmarried man and an unmarried woman'') during their romantic
holiday in France. Let us remember that all sex acts outside
marriage, and not a few within, are hell-bent offenses in the
Catechism. Masturbation, homosexual relations and watching the
Playboy television channel rank, in scale of punishment, with
running drug cartels and exterminating aboriginal populations.
Adultery and fornication remain as satanic today as they were in
King Solomon's time.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Diana had begged God's forgiveness after
the car crash, and if she expired in his grace, she would have been
cast into the ``cleansing fires'' of purgatory, there to expiate
her sins before ascending to heaven. Diana's last thoughts are
unknown, but if they did not include sincere sorrow for lying with
Dodi, even purgatory is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, hell looms as the most plausible spot for the
princess's soul. Christian dogma, immutable and infallible,
requires sinners in her presumed spiritual condition _ stained by
mortal sin _ to be condemned. ``Depart from me, you cursed, into
eternal fire,'' said Christ of the doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, the pope overlooked the damaging evidence
against Diana and gave a positive signal as to her redemption.
``The Holy Father has offered prayers summoning her to our Heavenly
Father's eternal love,'' he wrote in the third person to Queen
Elizabeth on Sept. 1. His remark implied purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father, is surely permitted to exclaim
in grief: ``God took their souls to live together in paradise.''
But how do we explain the pope's apparent blessing of the world's
most famous offender against the sixth commandment?
</P>
<P>
   A devil's advocate might detect hypocrisy in the papal posture.
People who meet their Maker en route to an illicit and scandalous
rendezvous do not generally receive benedictions from Vatican City.
The exception of the princess of Wales suggests that the church's
official position on sex crimes and punishment cannot withstand
rational scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Diana in hell seems cruel and repellent in human
terms, although it comfortably suits the divine. ``The gate is
narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find
it are few,'' declared Christ on the depressing odds against
anybody's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Roman/Anglican theology, which demonizes deviations of the
flesh, leaves little room for optimism in Diana's case. But that
tells us more about the chilling core of Christianity than about
the ultimate worth of a young, kind, sometimes foolish beauty who
had the misfortune to marry a prince and perish with a playboy.

   Which of the following Princess Diana-related stories is not
true:
</P>
<P>
   A. To mark the first anniversary of Diana's death in an auto
accident, the British ballet superstar Wayne Sleep recently
recreated the dance he performed in 1985 with the princess onstage
at London's Covent Garden. At the end of the tribute dance, he left
a single rose in a spotlight in Diana's memory and exited the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   B. Tubs of butter bearing the official logo of Princess Di's
memorial fund were made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   C. Donald Trump told reporters he regretted Diana's death
because he, and we quote here, ``never had a chance to ask her
out.''
</P>
<P>
   D. The Odeon Hotel in Paris is offering a ``Diana Tour,'' taking
you through the final hours of her life. For $25 you can ride in a
black Mercedes (just like Di's death car!) from the Ritz Hotel,
where Diana and Dodi had their last meal; to the Pont de l'Alma
tunnel, where the crash occurred; to the Pitie-Salpetriere
Hospital, where Diana was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   E. While anchoring the live coverage of Diana's funeral, NBC's
Tom Brokaw fell in and out of a fake British accent and said things
like, ``That shan't be too long.''
</P>
<P>
   F. A committee overseeing Princess Di's memorial fund is
considering a number of ways to spend the money _ including a plan
to bankroll a team of student nurses who would specialize in the
care of sick children. The nurses would be known as ``Diana's
Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As you probably guessed, it's a trick question. The answer, of
course, is that all of the above items are TRUE, and they represent
just a small portion of the stupefyingly bizarre ripple effect of
perhaps the most shocking celebrity death we've ever known _ the
auto accident in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, that claimed the lives of
three people, including the Lady Formerly Known as Princess, Diana
Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Diana's death, she was elevated to
premature-death pop-sainthood, right there with Elvis and Marilyn,
John Lennon and James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, given her worldwide popularity before the tragic
accident and the volcano of emotion that erupted following her
death, she may be the queen of them all. She's certainly in a
position to challenge Elvis (whose death-anniversary is Aug. 16,
just 15 days away from Di's) for the crown of most marketable
celebrity, post-mortem category.

</P>
<P>
   The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was established to
raise money for some of her favorite charities, including the
Leprosy Mission, the National AIDS Trust and the Royal Marsden NHS
Trust for cancer and organizations benefiting land-mine victims,
and to put some sort of restrictions on the hundreds of
opportunists seeking to market the name and image of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   To date the foundation has raised nearly $100 million. One item
alone _ Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind 1997,'' the top-selling
single of all-time _ has accounted for approximately $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 companies have the endorsement of the fund _ meaning
they can use the official logo of a purple replica of Diana's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Literally hundreds of other organizations and individuals have
attempted to profit from her demise. Some of these unauthorized
attempts to sell Di merchandise, including the Franklin Mint's line
of dolls, plates and jewelry, have resulted in the fund taking
legal action (which is still pending) in an effort to protect her
image; more obscure efforts have flown under the legal radar.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was impossible to stand outside Diana's death. People who
went to bed on Saturday night thinking, if they thought about her
at all, that she was a foolish and inconsequential woman, woke up
on Sunday morning to find themselves ambushed by their own sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions which overwhelmed the country were large but they
were never simple. It was never just a national outpouring of
grief. Sorrow is more intense when compounded of guilt and ours was
a guilty sorrow. We all had a hand in making the myths which killed
her.
</P>
<P>
   When we mourned her death, we mourned our own. People wept for
their own mothers and fathers, for lost children, as if all the
unconsoled losses of private life had been suddenly allowed to seek
public consolation. The people who placed bouquets on the railings
of Kensington Palace might have been decorating their own family
graves.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson of her death is how much unexpressed sadness and loss
there has been in our midst, how much ache and loneliness. The
churches do not seem to help. The therapists do not help. We talk
and talk. It does not help. In millions of us there seems to be a
vast amount of unmastered grief.
</P>
<P>
   Her death became the catalyst for these suppressed emotions
because we knew she had felt them herself. Her often confused
expressiveness gave us permission to break the Windsor code of
stoic reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly genuine sorrow was mixed with mawkishness and
self-pity. An older generation wondered whether the British had
lost their proverbial self-control. But by and large the grief was
restrained by a determination to honor her life and dignify her
death.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for a people's funeral for a people's princess
became a great popular uprising, not just against the royal family
but against the indignity of dying and the impoverishment of our
memorial rituals. The public wanted something grand for her because
they want something better for themselves than hospital deaths and
dry-eyed cremations. The popular uprising which forced an unwilling
monarch to pay public tribute to Diana was actually demanding the
right to define the protocols of public mourning.
</P>
<P>
   The native British genius for the invention of tradition crafted
her the kind of funeral which honors us all. For one hour life
stood still in homage to life. Now that the gun-carriage and the
lilies are gone, and the last electrifying notes of Taverner's
Alleluia have faded away, we have had the catharsis which only
great public ritual can provide. But by now we are also back where
we started, with the reality of her death, and the eventual fact of
our own.
</P>
<P>
   Had she died as the wife of the prince of Wales, her death would
have occasioned only discreet and manageable sorrow. But Diana was
never a safe and manageable figure. She was a scandal in life and
in death, a woman who had died in the company of her lover, a
defrocked royal princess who both embodied the aura of royalty and
incarnated its failure as an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was unique, no one knew how she should be honored,
and a mighty struggle took place for the symbolic appropriation of
her memory.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all, three great families _ the Spencers,
the Windsors and the Fayeds _ duelled in public over the ownership
of her symbolic remains. The ``blood family'' claimed her; her
putative adoptive family, the Fayeds, sought to convince us that
she had almost been theirs; and the Windsors, baffled and battered,
struggled lamely to say that they mourned her like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   While the three families struggled to control her legacy, two
institutions _ the modern media and the monarchy _ fought to save
their reputations from the stain of her death, and a third, the
Labor Party government, discreetly maneuvered to capitalize on the
discomfiture of the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this struggle was a force _ the British public _ which
at the week's beginning hardly sensed its power and by week's end
had swept all before it.
</P>
<P>
   In Earl Spencer's thrilling defense of the claim of the ``blood
family'' in Westminster Abbey, a very British process of social
alchemy took place. In life, Diana had shed the strangled accents
of her class of origin for the idiom of stardom. In the brother's
eulogy, she was reclaimed by her clan and simultaneously offered
back to the world as their ``classless'' princess.
</P>
<P>
   When the earl sat down, it was clear from the applause which
began among the crowd outside and then spread through the Abbey _
to include the younger members of the royal family itself _ that
his words had succeeded beyond any imagining. The elder Windsors
could only stare at the floor in silence, knowing that the Spencers
had taken their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the public anger directed at Prince Charles waned as
reality returned and people recalled that divorce is too sad a
business to be a matter of easy blame.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle between the families to appropriate Diana's
meaning was soon caught up in a real battle of institutions. The
finger of blame was pointed at the press and shifted to the royal
family. In turn the royal family was forced, in this ruthless
struggle for legitimacy, to make humiliating ritual gestures.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the public required the queen to give a
clipped eulogy to her former daughter-in-law, but the media,
battling to salvage its own reputation, forced her into it to save
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily _ and most unexpectedly _ a third institution, Tony
Blair's Labor government, intervened on the monarchy's side. At
first, it did not appear to be doing so. When Prime Minister Blair
appeared on camera to praise the achievements of the ``people's
princess,'' his choice of words suggested that he sided with the
people against the hard-faced family who had turned her out.
</P>
<P>
   But in insisting on a large public funeral, in urging the royal
family to make a public show of their grief, he loaned them the
formidable public-relations skills which had won him the election.
In the process, he managed the difficult feat of becoming a
national rather than a political figure, so that no one _ save a
few resentful Conservatives _ found it objectionable that a party
political figure should be seen on television reading the lesson
from Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
   In managing the monarchy's counterattack, while simultaneously
promoting himself as a national leader, and accomplishing all this
without appearing to profit from national distress, Blair may have
guaranteed himself the kind of power which Margaret Thatcher
enjoyed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from the first morning, when cameramen found young black
men weeping openly in front of Buckingham Palace, the public's
reaction set the pace at which other institutions, the media
included, reacted. Certainly the media sought to take control of
the popular mood, with headlines demanding that the queen show
herself to her suffering people.
</P>
<P>
   But the public saw through the media's attempt to turn the focus
of attention away from themselves to the failings of the monarchy.
Which is why, in the end, the public allowed the monarchy to regain
the initiative, and why, just possibly, a repentant public may
force a humbled press to respect the privacy of the grieving
princes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who stood among the crowds will long remember the quiet
but dignified sense that the moment belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   Such moments are quickly thrown away and the energies released
are easily squandered. But if someone has the wisdom to put the
people's sense of empowerment to productive use, the effects may
last long beyond that extraordinary week.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was impossible to stand outside Diana's death. People who
went to bed on Saturday night thinking, if they thought about her
at all, that she was a foolish and inconsequential woman, woke up
on Sunday morning to find themselves ambushed by their own sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions which overwhelmed the country were large but they
were never simple. It was never just a national outpouring of
grief. Sorrow is more intense when compounded of guilt and ours was
a guilty sorrow. We all had a hand in making the myths which killed
her.
</P>
<P>
   When we mourned her death, we mourned our own. People wept for
their own mothers and fathers, for lost children, as if all the
unconsoled losses of private life had been suddenly allowed to seek
public consolation. The people who placed bouquets on the railings
of Kensington Palace might have been decorating their own family
graves.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson of her death is how much unexpressed sadness and loss
there has been in our midst, how much ache and loneliness. The
churches do not seem to help. The therapists do not help. We talk
and talk. It does not help. In millions of us there seems to be a
vast amount of unmastered grief.
</P>
<P>
   Her death became the catalyst for these suppressed emotions
because we knew she had felt them herself. Her often confused
expressiveness gave us permission to break the Windsor code of
stoic reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly genuine sorrow was mixed with mawkishness and
self-pity. An older generation wondered whether the British had
lost their proverbial self-control. But by and large the grief was
restrained by a determination to honor her life and dignify her
death.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for a people's funeral for a people's princess
became a great popular uprising, not just against the royal family
but against the indignity of dying and the impoverishment of our
memorial rituals. The public wanted something grand for her because
they want something better for themselves than hospital deaths and
dry-eyed cremations. The popular uprising which forced an unwilling
monarch to pay public tribute to Diana was actually demanding the
right to define the protocols of public mourning.
</P>
<P>
   The native British genius for the invention of tradition crafted
her the kind of funeral which honors us all. For one hour life
stood still in homage to life. Now that the gun-carriage and the
lilies are gone, and the last electrifying notes of Taverner's
Alleluia have faded away, we have had the catharsis which only
great public ritual can provide. But by now we are also back where
we started, with the reality of her death, and the eventual fact of
our own.
</P>
<P>
   Had she died as the wife of the prince of Wales, her death would
have occasioned only discreet and manageable sorrow. But Diana was
never a safe and manageable figure. She was a scandal in life and
in death, a woman who had died in the company of her lover, a
defrocked royal princess who both embodied the aura of royalty and
incarnated its failure as an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was unique, no one knew how she should be honored,
and a mighty struggle took place for the symbolic appropriation of
her memory.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all, three great families _ the Spencers,
the Windsors and the Fayeds _ duelled in public over the ownership
of her symbolic remains. The ``blood family'' claimed her; her
putative adoptive family, the Fayeds, sought to convince us that
she had almost been theirs; and the Windsors, baffled and battered,
struggled lamely to say that they mourned her like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   While the three families struggled to control her legacy, two
institutions _ the modern media and the monarchy _ fought to save
their reputations from the stain of her death, and a third, the
Labor Party government, discreetly maneuvered to capitalize on the
discomfiture of the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this struggle was a force _ the British public _ which
at the week's beginning hardly sensed its power and by week's end
had swept all before it.
</P>
<P>
   In Earl Spencer's thrilling defense of the claim of the ``blood
family'' in Westminster Abbey, a very British process of social
alchemy took place. In life, Diana had shed the strangled accents
of her class of origin for the idiom of stardom. In the brother's
eulogy, she was reclaimed by her clan and simultaneously offered
back to the world as their ``classless'' princess.
</P>
<P>
   When the earl sat down, it was clear from the applause which
began among the crowd outside and then spread through the Abbey _
to include the younger members of the royal family itself _ that
his words had succeeded beyond any imagining. The elder Windsors
could only stare at the floor in silence, knowing that the Spencers
had taken their revenge.
</P>

   It might seem a case of typical British hypocrisy to be
canonizing Diana, when we could not get enough of reading about her
blunders when she was alive. But to call this hypocrisy is to miss
an important point about the celebrity cult.
</P>
<P>
   By now we know Elvis Presley was a drug addict, yet he is
worshipped. Marilyn Monroe was a depressive with a knack for
choosing the wrong lovers, yet she is still worshipped. The more
celebrities show their flaws, the more we love them after they die.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities live out their lives in public, to feed our
fantasies of glamor, but also to display our own weaknesses, so we
can feel better about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We can't blame the paparazzi for its excesses. Paparazzi may not
be edifying individuals, but we cannot blame them for our
appetites. Just as there is never a shortage of women willing to
serve in brothels, people queue up to be celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a difference between a media celebrity and a
prostitute: A prostitute offers her body, a celebrity has to sell
his or her life. Celebrities must ``share'' their anguish with us,
confess their latest sins, tell us everything they think, and above
all, feel. That is the deal, the Faustian pact: They can have fame
and fortune, but the public has the right to ``know.'' The
celebrity can have dinner at the Ritz every night, but only with
paparazzi in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The modern cult of celebrity is different from the traditional
deference paid to royal families. Monarchies depend on secrecy to
preserve mystique. The most traditional, and certainly the most
secretive, monarchy today is probably the Japanese. The lives of
its senior members are hidden behind a thick screen of courtiers.
The closest thing to a showbiz monarchy is Monaco's.
</P>
<P>
   The British royal family is in a halfway house. It is still a
secretive institution. When the queen allowed the BBC to film the
family's private moments some years ago, astonishingly, the Rubicon
was crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Diana had no special talent. But she was unique in that her
status was based on the royal mystique, which she used to become a
modern superstar. She rebelled against the royal family, but
insisted on her royal titles and privileges. She was an insider and
an outsider. This gave millions of British people the opportunity
to support her rebellion against the House of Windsor, without
becoming ``revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a chauvinistic side to this too. Writing in The
Guardian, Julie Burchill contrasted Diana's ``fresh, unpretentious
breath of roll-up-your-sleeves, best-foot-forward Englishness'' to
the ``Gothic gloom'' of the ``dysfunctional Graeco-Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an atmosphere of protest in the silent crowds waiting
for seven hours or more to pay their respects to Diana. I was
reminded of the Chinese crowds paying homage to Zhou Enlai in
Tiananmen Square, after his death in 1976. Defying official orders,
they came en masse to lay flowers and wreaths. They were not
revolutionaries, but their gesture was a silent rebuke to the Gang
of Four who still ruled China. The mood among the mourners for
Diana was summed up for me by a semiliterate letter on a bunch of
flowers laid on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   It began: ``You was a rose in a garden of weads.'' The message
to the House of Windsor was clear: She was one of us, and we will
never love you, the way we loved her.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who hope that the monarchy can be saved by
following Diana's example, by becoming more successful celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late for the fidgety, middle-aged Prince Charles to
become a superstar. His son, William, might have the necessary
qualities. He certainly has the looks. But apart from the cruelty
of making someone into a celebrity who might not wish it, there is
something wrong with a celebrity-king. A king is born. A celebrity
could be anyone. If we cannot get rid of celebrities, we might at
least get rid of kings.

   _  &UR; (Diana was loved for her beauty not her charity, and the more
unhappy she was the better she looked.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The day that Diana died was like Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, one can be out walking and pass a stranger
and, although perhaps no greetings are exchanged, there is a shared
knowledge of the significance of the date. As I walked past others
to the newsstand last Aug. 31 I wondered: Does the man behind the
counter care? Does the woman in line in front of me care? And how
much?
</P>
<P>
   Diana's story is a tug-of-war between words and pictures in
which pictures win every time. Verbal portraits of her have always
tended to be feeble _ especially her own. Words were not her thing.
Many published interviews with her were unsatisfactory, partly for
this reason. When she spoke, what she had to say was often
lackluster. Her best argument was her image.
</P>
<P>
   Her pictures did more than tell stories, they were a substitute
for them. Now her story has to go on without pictures. Once the
photographs of the crash are all published, there will be no more.
Newspapers have fallen ravenously on old photographs and made
themselves fat with them. But the glut of portraits of Diana since
her death has been disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than melancholy to look at these portfolios, this
picture pile-up of a life. The photographs themselves seem suddenly
dead. Their greatest charge was always that they were of a living
princess, a continuing story.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever Diana's story is in the keeping of
journalists and what we are being told about her has swerved into
an unconvincing Florence Nightingalenarrative. But her charitable
heart would have counted for little without her beauty. She was
loved for her beauty and because of her unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   And, for women, there was the special fascination and amazement
of observing that the more unhappy Diana was, the better she
looked.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only member of the royal family who looked royal,
the only female member not to look like a luminous frump. And so it
is no surprise that since her death there have been elegies for her
wardrobe, prolonged sartorial laments.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the clothes had to stand in for character, each
dress a quality. Each dress had its moment: the blue one that Diana
wore in Sydney, just after her marriage to Charles, and the white
one that she wore a little later, alive with crystals. It was the
white dress that seemed to mark her transformation from cygnet to
swan.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Diana's life had been handed over to a novelist who
produced a tragic ending for his own convenience. And if you were
reading the novel, you would say that the author (who clearly had
no interest in comedies of manners) had a failure of nerve, did not
dare see Di and Dodi into their future.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible author for this tragic narrative is an angry
child. Children cheer themselves up, when others have treated them
unfairly, by thinking: You'd be sorry if I was dead, and then
imagining their own funerals where their enemies shed tears.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if this is what has happened in a larger than life way
to Diana. And her critics are one-by-one coming around, or else
having to stay silent and watch the devoted legions mourn.

   _  &UR; (Diana was loved for her beauty not her charity, and the more
unhappy she was the better she looked.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The day that Diana died was like Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, one can be out walking and pass a stranger
and, although perhaps no greetings are exchanged, there is a shared
knowledge of the significance of the date. As I walked past others
to the newsstand last Aug. 31 I wondered: Does the man behind the
counter care? Does the woman in line in front of me care? And how
much?
</P>
<P>
   Diana's story is a tug-of-war between words and pictures in
which pictures win every time. Verbal portraits of her have always
tended to be feeble _ especially her own. Words were not her thing.
Many published interviews with her were unsatisfactory, partly for
this reason. When she spoke, what she had to say was often
lackluster. Her best argument was her image.
</P>
<P>
   Her pictures did more than tell stories, they were a substitute
for them. Now her story has to go on without pictures. Once the
photographs of the crash are all published, there will be no more.
Newspapers have fallen ravenously on old photographs and made
themselves fat with them. But the glut of portraits of Diana since
her death has been disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than melancholy to look at these portfolios, this
picture pile-up of a life. The photographs themselves seem suddenly
dead. Their greatest charge was always that they were of a living
princess, a continuing story.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever Diana's story is in the keeping of
journalists and what we are being told about her has swerved into
an unconvincing Florence Nightingale narrative. But her charitable
heart would have counted for little without her beauty. She was
loved for her beauty and because of her unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   And, for women, there was the special fascination and amazement
of observing that the more unhappy Diana was, the better she
looked.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only member of the royal family who looked royal,
the only female member not to look like a luminous frump. And so it
is no surprise that since her death there have been elegies for her
wardrobe, prolonged sartorial laments.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the clothes had to stand in for character, each
dress a quality. Each dress had its moment: the blue one that Diana
wore in Sydney, just after her marriage to Charles, and the white
one that she wore a little later, alive with crystals. It was the
white dress that seemed to mark her transformation from cygnet to
swan.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Diana's life had been handed over to a novelist who
produced a tragic ending for his own convenience. And if you were
reading the novel, you would say that the author (who clearly had
no interest in comedies of manners) had a failure of nerve, did not
dare see Di and Dodi into their future.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible author for this tragic narrative is an angry
child. Children cheer themselves up, when others have treated them
unfairly, by thinking: You'd be sorry if I was dead, and then
imagining their own funerals where their enemies shed tears.

to Diana. And her critics are one-by-one coming around, or else
having to stay silent and watch the devoted legions mourn.

NEW YORK ON MY MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shadow of New York looms ever larger in Boston these days.
</P>
<P>
   From West 34th Street, Macy's East confirms it is kicking a
beloved New England holiday tradition out of its downtown Boston
department store.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Crossing's Enchanted Village will be relocated _
hopefully _ to Boston City Hall Plaza, according to a press release
entitled ``Macy's Enchanted Village Statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The retail space that once housed the village will be converted
to office use.
</P>
<P>
   For nostalgic New Englanders, the quick conclusion is that
nothing good happens when out-of-state corporations buy out the
locals.
</P>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores, Macy's corporate owner, is actually
based in Cincinnati, not Manhattan. But Macy's flagship store is
located in the Big Apple. And the chain's overall image and appeal
is grounded in its sense of New York fashion, flair, and style.
</P>
<P>
   Federated acquired R.H. Macy Co. and its Jordan Marsh
subdivision in 1994. A new corporate division was created, called
Macy's East. It didn't mean much locally until 1996, when the
company decided to kill the 145-year-old Jordan Marsh name,
replacing it with Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction here was predictably dour _ especially since news of
the name change was accompanied by a notice to customers that
Macy's credit card finance charges would be 20 percent higher than
Jordan's.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's executives tried to lighten the mood with promises of
increased commitment to local causes. To symbolize their good
intentions, they served baskets of Jordan's famed blueberry muffins
at a business breakfast to discuss the name change.
</P>
<P>
   But as of this July 4, Boston's downtown Macy's stopped selling
blueberry muffins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't selling,'' says Macy's spokesman Ronnie Taffet.
``We were giving away more to the Pine Street Inn than we were
selling to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   No more muffins? And the Enchanted Village, if it exists at all,
will operate out of heated tents on City Hall Plaza _ possibly at
public expense?
</P>
<P>
   Macy's is talking about donating the animated recreation of an
old-fashioned New England winter. But it would be the city's
responsibility to operate it. Mayor Thomas M. Menino estimates it
would cost about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Menino reacted sternly at first to Macy's planned eviction of
the Enchanted Village. ``We're not going to let the Grinch steal
Christmas,'' he told the Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the mayor softened his tone. ``Ho, ho, ho,'' he
joked, insisting: ``Macy's is not the Grinch.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's pays for the annual tree-lighting display on Boston
Common. It sponsors Menino's annual holiday trolley tour to Boston
neighborhoods. And according to its official Enchanted Village
statement, ``the holiday excitement at Macy's ... will continue
with Santa in residence daily and a host of seasonal events and
entertainment through Christmas Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Macy's sponsors weekly special events in Downtown
Crossing. Macy's also works with the city's tourist industry to
help sell Boston as a destination, according to Patrick Moscaritolo
of the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more than delivered on what they said they would
do,'' said Moscaritolo, adding: ``Would it be wonderful if we could
freeze-frame everything and there could always be an Enchanted
Village? Of course. But businesses are constantly evolving.
Business plans are constantly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The global economy means there are fewer and fewer homegrown
businesses working directly with their community.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's is working hard to maintain a strong relationship with
Boston. Moving the Enchanted Village isn't so terrible. And it
would be even less terrible if Macy's would continue to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Macy's Santaland ``is alive and well'' on the eighth
floor of its Herald Square store in New York, according to Taffet.
</P>
<P>
   Ho, ho, ho.
</P>

CYBERCLASS IS IN SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a moment, Bruce Hunt felt like he'd leaped into an episode
of the space-age cartoon, ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks of his computer mouse, Hunt found himself in a
``virtual classroom'' with about a dozen other Kronos Inc.
colleagues scattered around the world, listening and watching as an
instructor in Chelmsford, Mass. briefed them on the latest features
of Kronos' labor management software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of spooky, having a voice come out of my laptop,''
said Hunt, a California-based product manager whose job is to
oversee the installation of Kronos software for the company's West
Coast customers. And it was strange, he said, to participate in a
live group discussion with people he couldn't see through his
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   But like many technology sales and service professionals who are
pressed for time, Hunt quickly concluded that spending an hour or
two in a virtual classroom on the Internet is a lot better than
wasting two or three days traveling between his regional office in
Long Beach and Kronos' Waltham headquarters for the typical product
training session.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Leon Navickas is counting on. His start-up company,
Centra Software Inc. of Lexington, Mass., is lining up some big
customers for its Internet software, called Symposium, which helps
companies reduce their training costs and boost productivity
through distance learning and collaboration over the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kronos, other major companies using Symposium include
AT&AMP;T Corp., Motorola Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Bay Networks
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But corporations aren't the only ones attracted to the
interactive, multimedia features of Centra's distance learning
software. Colleges and universities are also recognizing its
usefulness, especially for coursework that's designed for midcareer
professionals who can't take time off from their jobs to head back
to campus.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Tennessee, for instance, this year began an
executive MBA program for physicians that uses Symposium to conduct
on-line class sessions on Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   During focus groups, university administrators learned that
physicians were eager for advanced business instruction tailored to
the medical field but couldn't afford to spend more than four weeks
a year away from their practices.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, said management professor and program director
Michael Stahl, was to create a curriculum incorporating four,
one-week sessions on campus and a yearlong series of Saturday
morning classes on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Each Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon (eastern time), 21 doctors
from 12 states tap into their home or office computers to
participate in live, instructor-led courses in finance, accounting,
and other business-related topics.
</P>
<P>
   They watch and listen as the instructor presents material on
their computer screens, and they ask questions by ``raising a
hand'' _ tapping a key on their keyboard that causes a little
hand-shaped icon to pop up on the participants' screens.
Individuals can't speak up, however, until they are recognized by
the instructor, who maintains control of everyone's microphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often in a traditional classroom, one or two people may
dominate a discussion,'' said Dr. Arthur Porter, a prominent
Detroit physician enrolled in the course. ``With these mechanical
constraints, it puts in a little bit more discipline,'' said
Porter, who admits, nonetheless, that he found the first few
on-line classes to be ``a little disembodying.''
</P>
<P>
   But Porter, who is associate dean of the School of Medicine at
Wayne State University and senior vice president of the Detroit
Medical Center, a group of Michigan hospitals, says he's amazed
that he is able to continue working, keep up a busy travel
schedule, ``and still not miss class.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, he has attended his MBA class by simply
plugging his computer into a phone line in hotel rooms in London,
Cancun, and Jamaica _ even in a small town in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great is that you can log into a local phone number in
any of these countries, and end up spending three hours with your
colleagues back in Tennessee, or elsewhere in the United States.
The only thing you really have to remember is what time zone you're
in.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have been possible just a few years ago. But
as the Internet has matured, companies such as Centra and
Kentucky-based DataBeam Inc. _ which was recently acquired by Lotus
Development Corp. _ are finding ways to harness the power of the
Web to provide real-time, interactive collaboration in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, a Cambridge, Mass. unit of International Business
Machines Corp., pioneered the idea of groupware in the early '90s
with its introduction of Lotus Notes, a software program that
allows far-flung employees to collaborate on a single project or
document.
</P>
<P>
   Navickas, a 12-year Lotus veteran who once headed the Notes
research and development effort, left the company shortly before
its 1995 acquisition by IBM to build his own company that would
take the collaboration idea a step further.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Notes focuses on document management or workflow within
an organization, ``we're modeling a higher level of human
interaction,'' Navickas said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Symposium, he said, is to use multimedia technology
to mirror the energy of a roomful of people who are trying to
promote teamwork, problem-solving, and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Centra is targeting its Symposium software at the
sales, service, and support organizations of large, global
companies that want to become more competitive by reducing the time
it takes to bring new products to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology changes so quickly. Any competitive advantage is a
big plus,'' said Stephen Henry, director of educational services
for Bay Networks' North American operations. The big computer
network equipment company is using Symposium to keep its
salespeople and distributors up-to-speed on its latest products so
they can take the information to customers more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The other big advantage for companies that buy the $35,000
software is the cost savings and increased productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Navickas estimates that American companies will spend upward of
$60 billion this year on corporate training, but the lion's share
of the money will be spent on airline tickets, hotels, and meals.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on training is important when a brand-new product is being
introduced, but often that's not necessary for simple product
updates, companies say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to fly someone from Australia to Boston
for a two-hour class. It's cost prohibitive,'' said Michael
Courtemanche, a Kronos training specialist who has conducted more
than 30 on-line classes using Symposium software.
</P>
<P>
   On-line training, he said, works best when the material is
sharply focused for the audience and doesn't cut into employees'
work time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as what you're tyring to teach is in little bite-sized
chunks, it's ideal,'' he said, noting that no one has the endurance
to stare at a computer screen for more than an hour or two at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Richardson, vice president of research strategy at AMR
Research in Boston, said he believes there are many more
applications for the interactive technology that Symposium offers.
</P>
<P>
   His company, for instance, has purchased the software and
intends to use it for monthly analyst conference calls with
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all our guys are Jay Leno,'' he said. ``They can't do
monologues. We want to be able to dress up the conference calls we
do with clients. It's too boring to talk for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stahl, the University of Tennesse professor, predicts more
colleges and universities will latch on to the idea of interactive,
on-line education, especially for professional programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the executive's point of view, why should he or she
travel every other weekend to go to campus, when the campus can be
brought to the computer in their office as they sit there in a
warm-up suit with a cup of coffee?''

BAY STATE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY THRIVES DESPITE INROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Digital. Lotus. Wellfleet. Cascade.
</P>
<P>
   And numerous others.
</P>
<P>
   One by one the crown jewels of Massachusetts high-tech have been
scooped up &UR;  &LR; in recent years by out-of-state technology giants,
often from California's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   So you might call Massachusetts the ``Silicon Colony.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the corporate takeovers might seem to be a kiss of
death. Mergers and acquisitions can lead to massive job cuts and a
loss of corporate _ and regional _ independence and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the technology colony is flourishing. Measured by the
all-important yardstick of jobs, many of the former marquee names
in the Bay State's computer, software, and data communications
industries are prospering under out-of-state owners. Some have seen
local employment skyrocket as they create high-paying, skilled jobs
in engineering, marketing, sales, and other areas. The explosive
growth of the Internet, the convergence of voice and data
communications, and other technology trends have helped the Bay
State operations thrive as regional hubs for their corporate
parents.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the takeover wave has a price. The most obvious is
the loss of independence, as corporate decisions are now made
hundreds and even &UR;  &LR; thousands of miles away from Route 128, once
promoted in a local highway sign as ``America's Technology
Highway.'' Becoming a &UR;  &LR; regional outpost after years of visibility
and self-sufficiency as a publicly traded company inevitably
results in a loss of status and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in New England are not providing the ultimate leadership,''
says Richard M. Burnes, general partner at Charles River Ventures,
a Waltham-based venture capital firm. ``That's largely now in
Silicon Valley.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For years, the high-tech economy in Massachusetts was anchored
by behemoths like Digital Equipment Corp, Wang Laboratories Inc.,
and Data General Corp. The demise of the minicomputer in the late
1980s shook the local economy and dethroned the giants. With the
rise of the personal computer, much of the action shifted to
Silicon Valley, although Massachusetts boasted a few nationally
notable stars like Lotus Development Corp., the Cambridge PC
software maker. As computer networking and data communications
blossomed in the early 1990s, Massachusetts again claimed a visible
stake, fielding successes such as Wellfleet Communications Corp.
and Cascade Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, globalization and swift technological
changes drove many of the state's successful publicly traded
technology companies into the arms of bigger out-of-state
acquirers. Today, many of the state's former high-tech stars are
part of world-class corporations like computer maker IBM Corp. of
Armonk, N.Y., or Cisco Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp., the voracious
data networking giants from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   While the big technology players were being snapped up, a
generation of entrepreneurial companies were becoming the lifeblood
of the state's high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For the former marquee names, life as a subsidiary has not
been bad. Far from dismantling their newly acquired Massachusetts
operations, most parent companies are looking to build them up as
regional hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Silicon Valley, where job-hopping engineers and sales
people are both expensive and scarce, Massachusetts continues to
field a strong talent pool plus more affordable real estate _
assets that make it easier for a corporate parent to expand in the
Bay State, says John P. Morgridge, chairman of Cisco, the nation's
largest computer networking company.
</P>
<P>
   (Cisco of San Jose, Calif. announced on Friday plans to buy
American Internet Corp. of Bedford for $56 million, its sixth
acquisition in New England in 3 1/2 years).
</P>
<P>
   Wellfleet, a computer networking firm formerly based in
Billerica, merged with SynOptics Communications Inc. of Santa
Clara, Calif., and was renamed Bay Networks Inc., with headquarters
in Silicon Valley. Because of hefty growth in the use of routers,
cable modems, and other communications devices, the Billerica
operations have expanded dramatically, accounting for nearly half
of Bay Networks' annual revenue. &UR;  &LR; Wellfleet once employed 1,500
locally; that core has now mushroomed into 2,500 local positions at
Bay Networks, which itself has agreed to be purchased by Northern
Telecom Ltd. of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, with operations in Cambridge and Reading, employs about
8,500 people locally today _ 3,000 more since IBM acquired it three
years ago. Employment has taken off as software products such as
Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino reach a worldwide corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, the Santa Clara, Calif., computer networking giant, is
building a $65 million East Coast campus in Marlborough to pull
together its 1,500 Massachusetts employees, now spread out in
Boxborough, Marlborough, Westborough, and Southborough. Three years
ago, 3Com acquired Chipcom Corp. of Southborough, which employed
500 in the Bay State. The California parent has since added three
other Massachusetts companies plus a division of U.S. Robotics and
expanded all its acquired operations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For Eric Benhamou, 3Com chief executive, ``it really doesn't
matter where corporate headquarters are in a decentralized company
like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ascend Communications Inc.'s major investment in Bay State
companies _ it recently proposed buying Stratus Computer Inc. of
Marlborough, and it bought Cascade Communications last year _ means
there will be more Ascend employees in Massachusetts than in
California. Cascade has provided Ascend with the majority of its
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some Massachusetts operations have been downsized due to
overlapping jobs, particularly in finance and administration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In one notable buy-and-cut situation, more than 3,500
Digital &UR;  &LR; Equipment Corp. employees have lost their jobs since
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. acquired the former Maynard
computer giant earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The ``colonization'' of Massachusetts high tech has taken its
toll in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   When local operations are under outside ownership and
management, there's a loss of worldly ambition and drive to build
empires, says Paul Deninger, chairman of Broadview International
LLC, a mergers and acquisitions investment bank. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some say a Massachusetts technology industry full of
subsidiaries tends to be more isolated than &UR;  &LR; the industry on the
West Coast. Mitchell Kertzman, chairman of Sybase Inc., recalls how
the acquisition of the company he founded, Powersoft Corp. of
Concord, ultimately required him to relocate to Sybase's
headquarters in Emeryville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``So much more of the software industry is driven from Silicon
Valley and the Redmond, Wash., (Microsoft headquarters) areas that
I find the amount of networking I do, the interactions I have on a
routine basis with leaders in the industry, is far more active on
the West Coast than on the East Coast,'' says Kertzman. But he
believes Massachusetts will continue to flourish on a smaller
scale.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of corporate headquarters also can mean less civic
philanthropy. Although the Route 128 community largely has stayed
aloof from Boston's civic life, there have been some notable
exceptions. Digital founder Kenneth Olsen helped create the Boston
Computer Museum. Wang Labs founder An Wang bankrolled what is now
the Wang Center for the Performing Arts in Boston's theater
district. Today, with big Massachusetts technology players under
distant owners, prospects for such contributions seem dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   And while the economy is currently going gangbusters, some
speculate that Massachusetts, as a satellite operation, would take
more than its share of job cuts if the economy or technology
markets slumped.
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, despite its ``colonization,'' the state's
high-tech industry has prospered. And it isn't just with job
growth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Local operations under the ownership of deep-pocketed
corporate parents are better positioned to expand into new markets
and distribution channels. In computer networking, the Silicon
Valley companies that dominate _ Cisco, 3Com, Bay Networks, and
Ascend _ control the delivery of products and services to corporate
customers. That was a key reason why some Massachusetts
communications companies agreed to be acquired by their bigger West
Coast rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And even the exodus of talent that often follows a takeover can
have a positive effect. It's common for engineers and executives to
leave after a merger to start new companies, creating a process of
renewal in the local high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Desh Deshpande, cofounder of Cascade Communications, left
after the Ascend deal last year. He formed Sycamore Networks Inc.,
a 20-person Internet communications start-up in Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What excites me is growth, the challenge of inventing
something new and building it,'' says the 48-year-old Deshpande,
Sycamore's president. &UR;  &LR; Besides Sycamore, three other companies have
been started by former Cascade managers.
</P>
<P>
   That entrepreneurial spirit may continue to fuel the region's
growth _ even if many of the bigger, mature technology players are
now under outside management. As long as Massachusetts continues to
be a hotbed for start-ups, to pump out a highly skilled work force,
and to create innovative ideas and products, the state's high tech
economy will continue to flourish, say local technology executives.
</P>
<P>
   So is being a technology colony good enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we have innovation happening in the Boston area,
where talented teams are jumping on new opportunities and where
large companies continue to invest in the businesses they acquire,
we will all prosper,'' says Menachem Abraham, president of the
Concord-based unit of Lucent Technologies' data networking
division. &UR;  &LR; Abraham founded and sold his company, Prominet Corp., to
Lucent. Now, his group at Lucent employs 400 people and has job
openings for 100 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the problem in our area is that the new crop of
entrepreneurs who build successful companies are more interested in
becoming very wealthy quickly rather than presiding over a large
business empire, like Ken Olsen did at Digital,'' says Henry B.
Weil, a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Massachusetts high-tech industry for now
remains a colony.

ANALYST AIMS HIS DARTS AT INFLATED STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Cohen, the chief executive of a specialty finance company
from Philadelphia, let his exasperation show on a conference call
with investors who were losing their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The erroneous statements and simplistic analysis might have
been corrected before it went out if they were acting in good
faith,'' Cohen said as shares of Resource America Inc. were in the
midst of a one-day, 30 percent plunge Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The source of all the sudden agitation was a report distributed
to a small list of investment management clients by Mark Roberts
and his Off Wall Street Consulting Group in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is not well known outside a particular niche of the
investing world that will pay more than $30,000 a year for his
research. But he moves markets and makes enemies when his firm
issues one of its reports, which specialize in identifying inflated
stocks headed for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Resource America, Roberts had questioned the
company's accounting policies and some business relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The market, at least in the short-term, seemed to think the
analysis might be on target. Resource America shares continued to
trade at a wild pace Tuesday and their price drifted even lower,
despite a second conference call. It closed at 19 1/8, down 1 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard what they have to say (on the conference calls)
and we don't see how anything has changed,'' Roberts said Tuesday.
``Obviously the stock market, the more it hears, the less it
likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen isn't the only executive to fire back at Off Wall Street
Consulting after a tough report. The usual line of attack: The work
is wrong and a tool of short-sellers trying to drive the price of a
stock down.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonite Corp. executive Thomas Sandler trashed Roberts in a
January Barron's article, citing critical research dating to April
1997 when Samsonite stock traded at 46. But those same shares were
priced just above 30 at the time of the article and finished
Tuesday at 7 1/2. Samsonite officials did not return a telephone
call Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Pillotex Corp., a Dallas-based company that sells
$1 billion a year in pillows and other bedroom furnishings, huffed
about inaccuracies when the company was slammed by Off Wall Street
Consulting in June. The stock has fallen from 45 to 32 1/8 since,
though part of the decline may be attributable to the stock
market's summer swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1997 it was Miller Industries, an Atlanta-based towing
company with a stock that traded near 23 at its peak. Several
research firms questioned that value and Roberts wrote that it
would be fairly valued at about 10. The stock was priced at 6 1/8
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Pillotex and Miller Industries weren't returned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts doesn't disclose much about his customers. But he said
he has 30 to 40, one-third being mutual fund managers and the rest
operating hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said customers are both stock owners and short-sellers,
who bet the price of a stock will fall (hedge funds commonly own
and short stocks within their portfolios). But the research,
identifying investments that are overvalued, is clearly a tool best
suited for short-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of our sources,'' said Joseph McNay of Essex
Investment Management in Boston, which invests $4.5 billion,
including about $400 million in hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to find (research) companies that do good
short-selling work. Almost none is willing to put their name on
something that is negative. Management shuts you out; they hate
short-sellers. So it's not a popular business,'' said McNay, whose
son, Colin, once worked at Off Wall Street Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts insists he isn't bothered by the criticism, but the
reaction this week to his report on Resource America was especially
loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unusual because the (stock price) reaction was so
severe,'' he said. ``Either we're going to be right or wrong and
time will tell. In our case, we're right about 80 percent of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   And the other 20 percent? Roberts said a recommended short of
Safeskin Corp., a maker of disposable latex gloves, would have
resulted in a loss of about 130 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But his all-time bad call was a recommended short of America
Online Inc. Following that advice, he said, would have cost about
380 percent of an investment by the time he changed his mind about
the recommendation at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 52, hardly has the kind of background that would
suggest he makes a living throwing darts at companies and their
stocks. He studied French literature at Swarthmore College and
later as a graduate student at the University of California at
Berkeley. Roberts came home to Massachusetts to work in the family
business, a steel service center in Everett called Atlantic Steel.
He later ran another steel business, sold it, and helped build a
computer software retail chain in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts became involved with investing in New York and later
took a job as an analyst, then in his 40s, at Fidelity Investments'
institutional brokerage unit.
</P>
<P>
   He went out on his own in 1990 and quickly made a name for
himself with an early report: ``TCBY is in Deep Yogurt.'' The
report criticized TCBY Enterprises Inc., whose stock plunged to 5
from about 20 in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Off Wall Street Consulting has four other analysts
working from an office near Harvard Square, looking for stock
bubbles to burst.

PLAYERS TAKEN BY SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Revolution's collapse during a 5-1 defeat against
Los Angeles Saturday led to the resignation of coach Thomas Rongen.
But Revolution players insist they continued to believe in Rongen's
methods, though the team has the worst record in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm surprised, and I'm saddened by what happened, to be
real honest,'' forward Joe-Max Moore said Tuesday. ``Thomas is a
great guy and a great coach and he will have success wherever he
ends up. Unfortunately, he had one of the toughest jobs in the
league, in my opinion. He did as much as he could with what he
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zenga, a goalkeeper for the Revolution last season, will
guide the team starting with Sunday's visit to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who comes in at this point, if we don't win this
game, it's close to over for us,'' Moore said. ``We have to come to
play for 90 minutes and get a result. I don't think the majority of
players lost faith in Thomas. Most of the players have a lot of
respect for Thomas. He prepares the team extremely well. You don't
go from coach of the year to not being a good coach. He was given a
tough assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was the most outspoken player on the team after the loss,
criticizing teammates. He remains frustrated by the Revolution's
failings _ they have earned 91 points in 92 regular-season games in
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it with teams all over the world, where a new coach
comes in and players want to prove themselves, and sometimes it
creates a spark,'' Moore said. ``The timing of the change is a
little strange. I have a lot of respect for Walter as a player,
most people around the world do, but he doesn't know the players
and he hasn't been around team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to come in and decide who the starting 11 should be.
He will need a lot of help. He might be a great coach, but this is
a tough situation. If he gets results, everyone will be much
happier. We haven't had a winning product for three years here, and
everyone is frustrated. I don't want to be part of a losing team. I
want to be somewhere where we are winning consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Revolution captain Mike Burns:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Thomas and I would play for a
Thomas Rongen-coached team again in a minute. A lot of times the
coach is going to take the fall for the team's record and so a
decision was made. I've always been a big supporter of Thomas and
believe he is a good coach. Now, we have a six-game season and if
Walter comes in and we get in the playoffs, everything looks good.
Without a doubt, it's an uphill battle, no matter who the coach is.
It all boils down to one game. If we get 3 points in this game, and
we are 3 points behind with five games left, anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who will be suspended for a game after being ejected
midway through the second half against Los Angeles, is optimistic
about the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, just a change will be good for this team,'' Burns said.
``Walter knows some of the players, the organization, and everyone
has a lot of respect for what he has done on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his first coaching experience, so we'll see. It's a
no-lose situation for Walter because a lot of people have already
written us off. I know Walter and he is very charismatic and
knowledgeable about the game. If he can find a way to spark the
team and push the right buttons, and get us into the playoffs,
that's what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Team dissension became apparent after the Galaxy game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it can be corrected, if not we have no chance this
season,'' Burns said. ``We have to put personal feelings aside. We
don't have to like each other but we have to respect each other.
This is like a championship, a one-off game, and I hope we can push
aside everything because we are all professionals.

DOCTORS ARE WARY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A graphic is being sent to NYTNS clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling
212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home run hitter Mark McGwire may or may not be sending more
baseballs over the wall by taking a duet of dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But he's definitely sending the wrong message to millions of
young fans.
</P>
<P>
   That was the warning Tuesday sounded by a series of doctors
familiar with creatine and androstenedione, two naturally-occurring
substances sold over-the-counter that McGwire last week
acknowledged taking. The physicians admit they don't have all the
answers on whether the supplements are dangerous, but they say that
makes them nervous and therefore cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Start with creatine, an amino acid that is in the meat and fish
we eat and in muscles as creatine phosphate, a compound that helps
muscle cells replenish their supply of energy. In the late 1980s
researchers discovered that loading up on creatine could give
athletes the fuel they need for longer, harder workouts. But since
getting the doses needed would mean eating more meat or fish than
was practical, scientists developed synthetic powders that are
mixed with fruit juice or water.
</P>
<P>
   Last year creatine sales worldwide reached $350 million, with up
to 18 million people taking the supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But is it safe?
</P>
<P>
   ``From the studies we've done on short-term acute effects it
appears to be safe,'' says Charles Yesalis, professor of health and
human development at Penn State University and author of ``The
Steroids Game.'' ``In five to 10 years I will be able to speak to
you about its long-term effects.''
</P>
<P>
   That uncertainty is why the Association of Professional Team
Physicians, which covers all the major sports, takes a go-slow
approach. ``People are starting to take mass dosages, they're
loading up, and our physicians say loading adds strain to the
liver,'' explains Mark Allen, vice president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know, and the manufacturers prove this in all their
marketing propaganda, that it will build muscles, but the question,
`At what cost?' I can't tell you it's harmful because we don't have
that data, but I can't tell you it's not harmful. When you don't
know something, the best thing is to take a conservative stance.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is even more controversial, in part because its
benefits for athletes are less clear-cut while its risks could be
more substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-pronounce supplement is a steroid. In some people it
raises the level of testosterone, which can enhance performance by
building lean muscle mass; in others it can increase concentrations
of female hormones, or simply do nothing at all. It is unclear
whether it builds in tissues the way the much-used and abused
anabolic steroids do.
</P>
<P>
   Is androstenedione helping McGwire? ``It is likely not
contributing to his success at all,'' says Dr. Carlon Colker,
medical director at Peak Wellness, a Connecticut center that
specializes in research on human performance and natural
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Connelly is more upbeat, which isn't surprising since
he manufactures an enhanced form of the supplement at the company
he founded and heads, MET-Rx Engineered Nutrition. Taking his
androstenedione product elevates testosterone levels by as much as
30 percent for short periods which, when combined with
conditioning, yields ``strength increments and lower levels of body
fat, and a bunch of psychological effects in which sex drive and
libido are increased.''
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't singlehandedly explain McGwire's keeping pace
with Roger Maris's record-setting home run clip, Connelly adds,
``It is part of his success.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its benefits, the supplement could pose risks. Many
users ``are probably taking pharmacological amounts at industrial
strength,'' worries Dr. Chip Souba, chief of surgical oncology and
director of nutrition support at Massachusetts General Hospital.
``At those kinds of doses, over long periods, exactly what it
translates into is uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, NCAA, and International Olympic Committee banned
androstenedione. The Association of Professional Team Physicians
has asked for the supplement to be taken off the consumer market
and made available only by prescription.
</P>
<P>
   While that group and others are worried about the use among
professional athletes of creatine and androstenedione, what they're
even more worried about is the lessons such usage offers to young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Over just the last two days, as word has circulated about
McGwire's taking the supplements, MET-Rx has seen a tripling of new
orders for androstenedione and a doubling of existing orders, much
of which presumably is going to youthful users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ethical question that needs to be answered by Major
League Baseball: Is this what they want us to perceive as winning _
winning at all costs?'' asks Arnold Scheller, Celtics team
physician. ``I don't think it's sending a good message to the
younger population.''

LEWIS CASE RAISES QUESTIONS FOR INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN LIPSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Revelations surfacing pertaining to alleged cocaine use
by late Celtics star Reggie Lewis raise serious insurance
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Boston Celtics and Donna Harris-Lewis, who shared in
the reportedly more than $14 million of life insurance proceeds as
a result of Lewis's death, not only beneficiaries of life insurance
policies on his life but also beneficiaries of technical baskets
made after time ran out?
</P>
<P>
   A provision contained in all life insurance policies issued in
this state, as mandated by Massachusetts law, prevents insurance
companies from denying death benefit claims on policies more than
two years old even if a material misrepresentation was made on the
policy application.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more disturbing is the report that the Equitable
Life Assurance Society of New York paid a claim to a beneficiary on
a policy that was purchased on Lewis's life less than two years
before he died. If there was a material misrepresentation made on
the application at the time of its purchase, that policy should
have been rescinded and no claims paid.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the insurance company involved has a fiduciary
responsibility to its shareholders and policyholders to make
certain that only legitimate claims are paid. State insurance
regulators have a statutory obligation to enforce that
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the other widely reported 1991 policy purchases were
less than two years old on April 30, 1993, the date of Lewis's
controversial stay at New England Baptist Hospital, and more than
two years old at the date of his death _ July 27, 1993 _ there
could be further insurance company embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a Harvard Law School graduate to know that
if an applicant for a multimillion-dollar life insurance policy
conceals a history of cocaine use, it is a prima facie material
misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   That's why one of the insurors of Lewis's life insurance
policies requires the insured _ or a corporate officer or a partner
in a partnership, if that kind of entity is the policy owner _ to
affix a signature on the policy application to certify that it is
understood that coverage could be invalidated if any information
provided in answers to the questions asked on the application is
materially misrepresented. Other insurance companies have similar
wordings in their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies are risk takers, but insuring someone with a
history of cocaine use is one risk that is off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   At the insurance physical, the applicant is asked about any drug
history by the medical examiner. More than one company's medical
examination form contains the following question: ``Have you ever
used or are you now using valium or other tranquilizers;
barbituates or other sedatives; marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens,
or other mood-altering drugs; heroin, methadone, or other
narcotics; amphetamines or other stimulants; or any other narcotics
or controlled substances, except as legally prescribed by a
doctor?'' Others are only interested in only drug uses for a period
of several years immediately preceding the date of the application.
</P>
<P>
   After the questions pertaining to any present or past drug use
and others pertaining to the applicant's health are answered, the
insured is asked to sign the following statement, which appears on
most policy applications: ``To the best of my knowledge and belief,
the above statements are complete and true.'' Some insurers extend
that certification to include, ``It is understood that if any of
the above statements is a material misrepresentation, coverage
could be invalidated as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Before any company can proceed with the underwriting of a life
insurance policy, the applicant is also required to sign a broad,
all-inclusive authorization form that allows the insurance company
to obtain medical records from any source and talk to anyone,
including physicians, neighbors, and associates, regarding his or
her character, lifestyle activities, and general reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization form is, in effect, a blanket privacy release
related not only to the information the applicant provides to the
medical examiner but also to any other fact that may be uncovered
during the investigation of the applicant's medical and lifestyle
history.
</P>
<P>
   It then remains for the insurance company to determine the
validity of the information provided and also _ through the use of
everything from field investigators from credit reporting companies
to interviews with friends, associates, neighbors, employers, etc.
_ to determine the insurable interest of the parties and whether
there is any other information that could result in unfavorable
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies have significant experience in underwriting
multimillion-dollar life policies, and in the Lewis case it is
highly unlikely they didn't act prudently in the first instance to
ferret out the appropriate information they were authorized to
obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals contacted may have been unaware of damaging
information in the applicant's background or were reluctant to
disclose its existence, knowing the adverse consequences of such
revelations not only to the insurance applicant or his or her
family or employer but also to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Too often the distinctions between the time frame and under what
circumstances a life insurance policy can be rescinded or a claim
denied are misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   If a misrepresentation in the policyholder's life insurance
application is uncovered within two years of the date of issue of
the policy, recision by the insurance company is a slam dunk. The
two-year contestable period found in life insurance policies is
operable, and the insurers can and must take unilateral action
consistent with policy provisions.
</P>
<P>
   However, when an insured dies after a policy has been in force
for more than two years, the insurer is powerless to deny paying
the beneficiary even if it is determined that there was not only a
material misrepresentation but also fraud involved when the policy
was purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The statute mandating that, part of Massachusetts insurance law,
was last amended in 1907. It is obvious the legislators at that
time never contemplated the emergence or ramifications of the drug
culture, the need to know about the presence of the AIDS virus
(HIV) antibody, or that an insurance company would be selling
multimillion-dollar life insurance policies to corporations,
partnerships, and affluent individuals.
</P>
<P>
   So as it stands now, insurance applicants with an uninsurable
medical history or a serious history of drug usage can rely on the
fact that if they apply for life insurance, lie, conceal derogatory
information, make sure those who know them conceal vital
information, and live two years or more, their beneficiaries will
collect the policy benefit on their death.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of professional sports teams, particularly those who are
seeking taxpayer money to build new stadiums, would be well advised
to explore the availability of life insurance before signing
superstars to guaranteed, multimillion-dollar, long-term contracts
unless they are willing and have the ability to self-insure the
life insurance risk.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a material misrepresentation in the Lewis case, the
lessons to be learned will cause future underwriting evaluations
and background investigations for multimillion-dollar policies to
be more stringent. Life insurance companies don't like to be
snookered. The medical histories and lifestyle activities of
superstar athletes can be expected to be put under the microscope
when they apply for life insurance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeannine Guttman, editor of the Portland (Maine) Press Herald,
recalls the lessons of being the only women in a room full of male
editors. ``When you talk, your colleagues stare at the ceiling or
look at their watches or interrupt you,'' she explains. ``I think
when it comes to readers feeling (disenfranchised), we understand
it because we've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Steffens edits the Binghamton (N.Y.) Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin
and cares for her two children while her husband works out of town.
She believes female newsroom executives tend to be more creative
with their newspapers because they often have to be more creative
to make their lives work. ``The mother of invention,'' she notes,
``that's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For about a decade now, women in journalism schools have
signficantly outnumbered their male counterparts. Yet they are
still a distinct minority atop newspaper mastheads. (Only about 15
percent of the 850 members of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors are female.) Despite the numbers, some observers believe
that women editors whose experiences have informed their
journalistic values are the vanguard of a newspaper revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Top editors like Guttman, Steffens, The Charlotte (N.C.)
Observer's Jennie Buckner, Susan Deans of The (Myrtle Beach, S.C.)
Sun News, Tonnie Katz of The Orange County (Calif.) Register, Kay
Tucker Addis of The Virginian-Pilot and The Idaho Statesman's Karen
Baker are guiding some of the most reform-minded newspapers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In a profession traditionally averse to change, they write
columns explaining their decisions to readers. They reshape
newsroom hierarchies. They invite citizens to sit in on news
meetings. They hire nontraditional journalists. They search for
solutions to pressing local problems. And they embrace ``civic
journalism'' projects that directly engage readers by using
everything from polls to casual coffee shop chats to solicit
citizen views on important issues in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Women are not alone in shaking up their newsrooms. Some of their
male counterparts are engaged in similar efforts. But the
indisputable fact is that women editors are aggressively
experimenting with newspaper journalism. The touchy question is
whether being women makes them more inclined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Schaffer is executive director of the Pew Center for Civic
Journalism, which funds media outlets working on civic journalism
projects. Her experience suggests women are more likely than men to
try new methods of connecting with readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were able ... and maybe not afraid to develop more
intimate ties to the community,'' Schaffer says. ``I hate to
stereotype, but sometimes women can listen better. ... They're
willing to take risks to create new things.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of female editors accept that basic premise for reasons
that range from nature to nurture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a difference in how men and women approach
the situation,'' says Baker, who has been executive editor of the
65,000-circulation Idaho Statesman for a year. ``I think women are
sometimes more sensitive to people and not just the people on the
staff, but readers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old definition (is) that news is something that happens to
or near an editor,'' adds Susan Deans, who has spent eight years
editing The Sun News in rapidly growing Myrtle Beach, S.C. ``Women
tend to have different things happen near or to them.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No pigeonholing
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's tricky trying to establish linkage between gender and job
performance. And some female news executives are reluctant to do
so, worried that they will be pigeonholed as ``women editors''
instead of simply ``editors.'' Asked if female editors are more
naturally innovative, Geneva Overholser, the former Des Moines
Register editor and ex-Washington Post ombudsman, pauses and says:
``Probably so. But beware (of stereotypes).''
</P>
<P>
   Tonnie Katz, who has edited the 364,000-circulation Register
since 1992, says there wouldn't be a breast-feeding room next to
her office if there were a male editor at the paper. And she
pointed out that the Register's 1996 Pulitzer Prize for its
investigation of unethical fertility practices at a research
hospital was the result of women editors immediately understanding
the significance of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, who worked at both Boston dailies, calls herself a
journalistic maverick. But ``I know a lot of male editors who think
like me,'' she says. ``I think it's a personality quirk as opposed
to a gender quirk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women generally tend to be more collegial in seeking input
from others,'' says Addis, editor of the 199,000-circulation
Virginian-Pilot. But she thinks it's hard to connect innovation and
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there are some female editors who are products of a
system that was adventurous before they took the reins. In
addition, some of these editors run smaller dailies where it is
considerably easier to change the internal culture and create
intimacy with readers than at larger institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to ignore the changes that these newsroom managers
are implementing. Guttman, who was named editor of the Press Herald
in Maine (circulation 72,000) a year ago, writes a regular Sunday
column concerning journalism issues as part of what she calls a
``pen-pal relationship with readers.'' Every few weeks, she holds
an in-house seminar with staffers to discuss the paper's
performance. The Press Herald has engaged in several large-scale
civic journalism projects, including a eight-day series on alcohol
abuse in Maine that generated a statewide dialogue on the subject.
And several months ago, Guttman hired a full-time community
coordinator to help the paper reach out to its readers.

EIGHTH DISTRICT RACE PRODUCES SOME UNUSUAL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A bizarre tale of death threats, extortion, and
prostitution rings involving a former business associate of
congressional candidate John O'Connor is threatening to distrupt
the campaign as it heads into its final three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, a Democratic contender in the Eighth District, says he
is the victim of a shakedown attempt by the former friend and
associate, John A. DeFrancisco Jr., of Somerville, and has hired
bodyguards to protect himself after DeFrancisco allegedly
threatened physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrancisco is demanding $350,000 or he will leak damaging
information about O'Connor's businesses to news outlets, O'Connor
says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, a nationally known enviromental and community activist
who is using his wife's inherited supermarket fortune to launch a
political career, said he has refused to meet DeFrancisco's demands
and instead has asked the attorney general's office to investigate
what he says is an extortion attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But DeFrancisco denies making any threats against O'Connor and
his family and says he wants only what he is owed from their
business dealings and that some of his comments were ``taken out of
context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to portray me as a violent person,''
DeFrancisco said. ``It's a total set-up.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor hired DeFrancisco in 1994 to run one of his for-profit
firms _ a Cambridge-based company that sells a device that
significantly slows down corrosion of heating oil tanks.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrancisco confirmed he was interviewed on Monday by a state
trooper and an assistant attorney general assigned to the criminal
division. The attorney general's office Tuesday declined comment,
saying it does not confirm or deny investigations.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrancisco, meanwhile, accused O'Connor of creating a
fabricated story to discredit his allegations about their business
dealings and to silence him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like `Wag the Dog,''' he said, referring to the movie
about a president who creates a fake war to protect himself from a
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He said O'Connor, worried about his political career, wanted him
to lie about their relationship, because DeFrancisco has a criminal
record that stems from charges four years ago he was running a
$20,000-a-week prostitution ring.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor's friends and advisers say the strange developments
came about because the candidate has a history of using his wealth
to help people who are struggling or are down on their luck such as
DeFrancisco. He has financed tuitions, made large donations to
causes, and helped a host of poor and disadvantaged people with
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who have been helped by O'Connor have had scrapes
with the law, others are struggling with drug and alcohol problems.
But in this case, those aides say, O'Connor's charity and big heart
has come back to haunt him unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this guy threatening me and my wife _ and partcularly my
wife _ I have decided to legally take the gloves off,'' O'Connor
said. ``This hurts me. I am going to do everything in my power to
make sure this criminal pays for the crimes he has committed. We
can't let lawbreakers go unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had hired DeFrancisco in 1994 to run Tank Protectors
Inc., shortly after he had been indicted by the Middlesex district
attorney's office on charges he and his wife had operated a
suburban prostitution ring.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor says DeFrancisco, whom he has known since their
freshman year in college, had maintained his innocence and promised
him he would beat the charges. O'Connor, believing his friend, paid
for his legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the charges against DeFrancisco seemed far less serious
when the case was disposed of in March 1996. He pleaded guilty to
reduced charges of conspiracy to commit prostitution, a
misdeamonor, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. He served 18
days, was fined $25,000, and given 350 hours of community service.
He resigned as Tank Protection president.
</P>
<P>
   In a severance agreement signed in October 1996, DeFrancisco
received $53,000 in cash and other benefits. At the same time, he
also wrote a letter to O'Connor, still proclaiming his innocence,
but said he needed to save time and money and to ``move foward with
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor said DeFrancisco reappeared this spring just as he
was getting his campaign in full swing, angrily demanding more
compensation and claiming he had been cheated in the severance
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations stalled between his aides and DeFrancisco in
recent weeks, O'Connor rebuffed the demand, charging his old friend
was threatening him with physical harm and thinly veiled death
threats.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter breaking off negotiations, O'Connor's attorney,
Anthony J. Barsamian, outlined what they said were the threats they
said were made at various meetings in front of O'Connor's wife,
Carolyn Mugar, his lawyer, and a Mugar family financial manager, at
various meetings over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, addressed to Somerville lawyer John F. Zamperelli,
states: DeFrancisco ``has said at various times that unless the
demands were met, he would `hurt' John O'Connor, that he has
trained in martial arts and was therefore `capable of hurting
John', that he `has been thrown under a bus and now someone was
going to throw John under a bus,' and that he would `take this to a
level that John didn't understand,'' that John should go to
confession or do an act of contrition without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Connor attorney also alleged DeFrancisco had threatened to
expose certain O'Connor's business dealings, ``legal and illegal,''
and said his deadline for a settlement was the September 15
primary. DeFrancisco has raised allegations that O'Connor allowed
unemployment fraud to take place at his various profit and
non-profit firms.

FLEMMI, BULGER FORGED SHARED FBI BOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It seemed like a risky move.
</P>
<P>
   James ``Whitey'' Bulger was working for the Winter Hill gang
back in 1975 when he offered to introduce fellow gang member Stevie
Flemmi to one of his friends: FBI Special Agent John Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in a Somerville garage, Bulger confided to Flemmi that he
was ``doing business'' with Connolly _ and that the agent wanted
Flemmi to meet him, Flemmi testified Tuesday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger did not actually admit that he was an informant, Flemmi
said, but ``it was obvious he had a relationship'' with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bulger had told Flemmi earlier that Connolly had
reached out for him, and at that time Flemmi advised, ``It's a
pretty good idea, go ahead and meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it came as no surprise that Bulger had forged an alliance
with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But while exposing himself as an FBI informant might have
brought reprisals from some of his other gangster friends, Bulger
apparently knew he had nothing to fear from Flemmi, who had been
giving information to the FBI since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some background information on me before he made the
approach, that was obvious,'' said Flemmi. He speculated that
Connolly told Bulger about Flemmi's informant status.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way Bulger would have asked Flemmi to meet an FBI
agent unless he already knew that Flemmi was also an informant,
Flemmi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have a relationship (with the FBI), I would have
said, `What are you, crazy?''' Flemmi said. ``I would have looked
at him differently. I would have distanced myself from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their shared FBI bond brought Bulger and Flemmi closer.
</P>
<P>
   With Flemmi's consent, Bulger arranged for FBI agent Dennis
Condon to introduce Flemmi to Connolly at a Newton coffee shop in
late 1974 or early 1975, Flemmi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to meet me, it was a transition,'' said Flemmi,
whose previous FBI handler had been transferred to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the meeting, Flemmi had just returned to the
Boston area after living as a fugitive in Canada for five years,
dodging an attempted murder charge in the case of a lawyer who was
injured in a car bomb. The case was dropped when a witness recanted
testimony that had implicated Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi said he was eager to go straight, but Condon and Connolly
were ``very persuasive people.'' He said they convinced him to
fraternize with the local Mafiosi, then report any intelligence
they had on the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Flemmi said, he was using Bulger to funnel information
about local Mafia activities to Connolly. Later that year, Flemmi
said, he began accompanying Bulger to meetings with the agent.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 years, Bulger and Flemmi kept up a double life
as FBI informants while ascending in the underworld. But today,
Flemmi blames the FBI for pushing him back into crime to boost his
value as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't relish my relationship with the FBI,'' Flemmi said.
``I wasn't going to make a career out of it. I didn't plan it that
way. It just happened that way.'

CLAUSE UPHELD BY STATE SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN LIPSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The more-than-90-year-old insurance law that
established the two-year incontestability clause found in all life
insurance policies issued in this state was reaffirmed in a
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 case of Protective Life Insurance Company v. D.
Sullivan, the insured, who was HIV positive, was issued a $100,000
life insurance policy in November 1981 after he did not disclose in
his application that he was recieving medical treatment and
medications for his condition despite questions calling for this
information.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the policy was issued, when the insured made a
claim for a waiver of premium benefit, the insurer investigated the
claim and brought suit in the US District Court in Boston to
rescind the policy, claiming the insured had obtained coverage
through fraudulent misrepresentation. The court found that the
insured had indeed committed fraud and ruled in favor of the
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   That District Court judgment in favor of the insurer,
Prospective Life, was overturned by the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Margaret Marshall wrote in her opinion that since the
statute does not specifically exclude fraud as part of the
incontestability clause, its absence does not violate public policy
and should not imply such an exemption. She also added that the
insured's willful concealment of his medical condition was
deplorable and deserves condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that decision, earlier this year the life
insurance industry filed with the Massachusetts Legislature an
antifraud bill that would allow for one standard to be used within
the two-year contestable period. Thereafter, fraud still would
remain a valid ground for not paying a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the efforts of the AIDS Law Project of Gay
and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders and the Catholic Charitable
Bureau of the Boston Archdiocese, the bill never reached the House
floor for a vote.

WOMEN MOVE INTO THEIR OWN GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Hinda Miller is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Twenty years ago, Hinda Miller and Lisa Lindahl were avid
joggers but were growing tired of the lack of support _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1970s, there were six million women in the United
States running,'' said Miller. ``That's a lot of bouncing breasts.
We felt self-conscious, but loved our running.''
</P>
<P>
   So combining their need for better support with Yankee
ingenuity, the two Vermont women set out on a mission. First, they
went to a local bra store, took some samples into the dressing
room, and jumped up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing really caught our fancy or worked,'' Miller said
of the thin straps and underwire. So the research was on hold, but
the idea was still on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late one night, about six of us were having dinner and were
talking about it, and were kind of giddy,'' Miller said. ``One of
the guys pulled a jockstrap out of the hamper, stretched it over
his breast, and said `look, a jockbra.'''
</P>
<P>
   It made sense to Miller, a costume designer, who figured out how
to sew two jockstraps together and _ voila! _ the Jogbra was
created.
</P>
<P>
   And they weren't the only ones trying to figure out how to bring
women's equipment into the mainstream. Barbara Longstreth, who was
field hockey coach at Long Beach State in California, was importing
sticks from Pakistan and selling them from her station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   And Elaine Sortino, now the softball coach and assistant
athletic director at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, had
to cut part of the shinpads off and stuff padding in a
first-baseman's glove to outfit herself as a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference two decades makes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the original Champion Jogbra is in the Smithsonian
Institute, and the name has become associated with any type of
sportsbra; Longstreth's enterprise has become a mail-order business
for women's field hockey, lacrosse, and softball gear; and
fastpitch softball players now have real catcher's mitts to use,
not to mention shinguards that fit.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that baseball cleats and ice hockey skates sized to a
woman's foot; uniforms made gender-specific and not unisex, and
baseball gloves that are autographed by Olympians Dot Richardson
and Lisa Fernandez, and it's obvious that sporting goods
manufacturers are waking up to the fact that girls and women are
making up the fastest growing segment of their consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Girls playing fastpitch softball and ice hockey today might not
know or care what difference equipment makes, but their coaches do.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn King, a sophomore on the softball team at Boston
University, admits she has ``always used the same glove,'' but does
notice a big difference in shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, I always used to end up wearing men's cleats _
buying man's two sizes too small. But now I can buy women's
cleats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Solfaro, King's coach at BU, notices more than just the
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I caught, I had to use a fielder's glove,'' she said.
``And the catcher's equipment was way too big for women. It didn't
fit right. The uniforms have gotten better, too. We used to wear
men's uniforms, but like it or not, women have hips.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Whyte, of Saugus, who played on the US gold-medal ice
hockey team, said, ``I basically just used guys' stuff, the
majority still do.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant smaller-sized gloves and kneepads; either boys' or
``junior'' sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you end up wearing a boys' kneepad, the protection isn't as
good,'' she said. ``Not that women need to have as superior stuff
as men in the NHL, but I still think there needs to be a balance of
equipment that can be small but good quality, and has same level of
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Skates were a problem, too, she said, before manufacturers
started making them for women
</P>
<P>
   ``We're small, but heavy-muscled women,'' she said. ``So a woman
who weighs 150-160 pounds, and wears a size-4 skate, has to wear a
boys' size. A lot of women at the college level double stitch them
to reinforce at the boot, so the leather holds up better.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all her complaints, Whyte said she'd never use lesser
equipment as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've been burdened by not having women's stuff.
But it would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Dyer, the former Northeastern hockey player, now works for
Louisville Hockey as product manager for female hockey equipment.
The company hired her as an adviser in 1993 and, ``I started
talking about women's gear as soon as I got there.''
</P>
<P>
   As seamstress for the US women's national hockey team for four
years, Dyer knew the drawbacks well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players would all put on equipment and come see me, I was
the alteration specialist,'' she said. ``I'd get out the sewing
kit, and go around pulling and tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   She convinced Louisville that small adjustments would mean a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's little things, like the fasteners below and not at your
chest; gloves are narrower through the thickness of the fingers,
pants have more room in the hip, and the shoulder pads have a chest
protector.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dyer is well aware Louisville is looking at the bottom line
as it creates a new line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it takes a lot of money,'' she said. ``There are 27,000
registered women hockey players, and 425,000 men. So even if we
capture 90 percent of the market ... '' she said. ``But we're
working through it, and have a great product and the growth
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dyer said the company is careful not to put too much
spotlight on its women's line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the 800-series and say it's for females on the hang
tag,'' she said. ``But other than that, it looks the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, some players like Adam Oates prefer the
equipment _ like the gloves that are made with a combination of
nylon and leather instead of all leather _ for their flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Jarrell, the vice president of marketing at Easton agrees
that the company has to walk the line between gearing equipment to
women and appearing patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first foray into this five years ago didn't go well,'' he
said. ``We had bags, and batting gloves, that were purple and pink.
``And we found women don't want that. Our research shows they
appreciate equipment made for them, but don't want it to look
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Longstreth began her mail-order business _ with a retail store
near Philadelphia _ 12 years ago. She added a softball line eight
years ago, and sells brands ranging from Easton bats to Rawlings
gloves to Cooper chest protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Maurek, who was the softball coach at Temple University
for 17 years, oversees the division that she admits had a hard time
taking off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first summer, some of the major manufacturers were
reluctant to even entertain opening this as an account,'' Maurek
said. ``They said, `Are you sure you want to do that?' And some of
those are usually the first ones in line to tell how how good it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a long way to go, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even come close to rounding the corner, but there's
an awful lot of potential and still a lot of work to be done,''
said Maurek. ``But more manufacturers are are starting to see the
potential.''

PERSECUTION OF MCGWIRE IS A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wonder ballplayers loathe the media. Mark McGwire is stalking
one of baseball's most cherished records _ until now the feel-good
story of the baseball summer _ and suddenly he's engaged in a
tabloid-driven controversy that's painting him as a cheater and a
bad role model.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair.
</P>
<P>
   If you just dropped in from a two-week trip to Guam, here's the
background: An Associated Press reporter noticed a jar of
androstenedione in McGwire's locker last week. He asked the slugger
about the stuff, did some homework, and wrote about it.
Androstenedione, known in baseball clubhouses as ``andro,'' is an
all-natural, over-the-counter steroid (not of the dangerous
anabolic steroid family) that is used to help an athlete train
harder and recover faster. It is banned by the NFL, the NCAA, and
the Olympics, but allowed by the NHL, NBA, and Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   There. McGwire takes something that can be sold at any drugstore
and is permitted by his sport, and suddenly he's lumped with
Olympic swimmer Michelle Smith and sprinter Ben Johnson, a couple
of champs who got the gold using illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, America. The IOC has bans on caffeine limits. Juan
Antonio Samaranch would strip McGwire's medal if he went to the
plate after consuming eight cups of Maxwell House.
</P>
<P>
   The story of McGwire's historic home run chase is being
tarnished because folks are hearing bits of stories and reading
wild headlines and concluding that Big Mac is a pharmaceutical
creation.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is not some 98-pound weakling who went on the juice and
came back as Rambo. He is a huge, muscular man, who hit 49 home
runs in his first big league season 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Globe, a doctor claims that andro is part of
McGwire's success. This makes it sound as if the substance is
adding 40 feet to McGwire's long fly balls. This is ridiculous.
Andro might help McGwire stay healthy and aid his recovery time
from injuries, but the same could be said about aspirin, or any
other pain reliever.
</P>
<P>
   If a slugger eats Wheaties (sold over the counter, not banned by
MLB) wouldn't it be true that Wheaties are part of his success?
What about steak? Is prime rib part of McGwire's success?
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's case, it is misleading to write that he's using a
``performance-enhancing drug.'' He's a baseball player, not an
Olympic sprinter. There's nothing sold at drugstores that would
help any of us hit a home run in the big leagues (unless the store
has a book on hitting written by Ted Williams). Facing Randy
Johnson and hitting a ball over the fence requires bravery, timing,
hand-eye coordination, reflexes, leverage, and strength. Most of
all, it requires practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, how many other baseball players are taking the same
stuff? McGwire probably doesn't go more than a couple of days
without hitting against a pitcher who uses andro. While we're at
it, what about creatine, another dietary supplement sold over the
counter, also used by McGwire? What about MET-Rx (endorsed on radio
and in print by Mo Vaughn)?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, McGwire's been a good citizen, never one
to disgrace the uniform. Most recently he's dedicated his charity
efforts to awareness and funding for abused children. And now he's
got to read that he's a bad example to young athletes? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps andro will be proven unsafe. That is an issue for the
Food and Drug Administration and for Major League Baseball and its
Players Association. In the meantime, McGwire should be left alone
on this issue and go back to answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. We've all heard the stories about Roger Maris's hair
falling out from stress when he chased Babe Ruth's record in the
summer of 1961. Turns out Roger was lucky. He didn't play in 1998
when you can do something legal and be painted as a cheater.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Babe himself? The Bambino hit 60 homers in
1927, which was the seventh year of prohibition in this country.
Think the Babe might have had a little bathtub gin coursing through
his veins at any point during the '27 season?
</P>
<P>
   Hope not. After all, it would have been a bad message for
America's youth.

   BOSTON _ Mo Vaughn said he does not use androstenedione, a
naturally produced steroid used by St. Louis slugger Mark McGwire,
but decried the criticism directed at the man challenging Roger
Maris's home run record.

   ``Here's a guy on the verge of changing history, and some people
are a little bit upset. Everybody should be happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione acts in the production of the male hormone
testosterone, which can trigger muscle growth. It is banned by the
NFL, NCAA, and International Olympic Committee, but is legal in
Major League Baseball. It is sold over the counter in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he uses other strength-enhancing supplements, and is
a spokesman for MET-Rx Engineered Nutrition, which in its line of
products markets androstenedione. The Red Sox first baseman said he
does not use creatine, the dietary supplement and muscle-builder.
Vaughn said he uses another muscle-building product called PRO-hGH,
a food supplement that also is sold over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody sees that in today's game, it's a big man's game,''
Vaughn said. ``Strength is the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as long as we're not doing illegal things, and I'm not
doing anything illegal and I don't know guys who are, then it
shouldn't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he doesn't use creatine because it makes him feel
``tight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I used a steroid, I'd weigh about 280 pounds,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said that before he began using any products, he
consulted a doctor. He said he never has investigated
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Baker 3d, the Red Sox' strength and conditioning
coordinator, said the team's policy is to encourage players to
consult the team's training staff if they have questions about
supplements. The team physician, Arthur Pappas, is part of the
consulting process, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said that he has not researched androstenedione in depth.
``I haven't addressed it because to my knowledge, no one uses it on
the Red Sox, I haven't been asked about it, and I haven't seen it
in the clubhouse,'' he said. ``Does that mean we discourage its
use? No. But if we were asked about it, we would research it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never recommend anything that I wouldn't be
comfortable using myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker agreed that it would be naive to believe that there aren't
some major leaguers using illegal steroids. ``There are kids in
high school using steroids just so they can get jacked and look
good for girls,'' Baker said. ``What makes you think that grown men
wouldn't roll the dice so they could make more money?''
</P>
<P>
   Some players, like Red Sox outfielder Darren Bragg, say they use
creatine, though Bragg says he uses it only on occasion, and only
in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra uses an energy supplement drink,
Baker said, which is fortified with extra vitamins and proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Darren Lewis, who works out religiously in the
off-season with Giants star Barry Bonds, said he does not use any
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not for me,'' he said. ``My game is slapping the ball
around, a speed game. For me, it's more important to stay light and
lean.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was asked if he would recommend supplements like creatine
to teenage athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things today are so different than when I was a kid,'' he
said. ``It's a big business, even in colleges and high school. The
fact of the matter is, whatever makes money, they're going to
market the product, and they don't care who's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to got to make right choices. Until you get
well-educated about the whole thing, I'm not recommending anything
to anybody. Wait till guys go to college.''

DAWSON GETTING HIS KICKS IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It takes no more than a glance at the top of
Phil Dawson's locker at Foxborough Stadium to understand the nature
of this free agent kicker's football life in the final days of
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson, P. 8'' is written on a piece of white paper, taped to
the top of the locker. Guys returning from last year have engraved
name plates and the other first-year players at least have their
names on computer printouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson gets hand-lettering.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his status in Foxborough _ where he has survived to
kick another week as Adam Vinatieri continues to recovery from a
groin injury _ beats where he was a week ago by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was on my way home from Oakland at this time last
week,'' Dawson said before practice Tuesday. ``It's kind of been a
whirlwind week for me. I'm ready to know what's going to happen,
just like anyone else. But anytime you're trying to get your start
you're going to bounce around and that type of thing. But I sure
will be happy when the dust settles.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots shut down Vinatieri after their Monday night
game in Mexico City last week, they put in a call to Dawson and he
arrived at 1 a.m. Friday. Saturday night, he kicked a 37-yard field
goal late in the first half, then a 41-yard game-winner with 2 1/2
minutes left to beat the Redskins, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more happy with the opportunity,'' Dawson said.
``I'm very happy to be here. But I'm not one of those guys who's
just happy to be here. I'm a competitor and I want to do the best I
can. And I think I can be the best. I just needed an opportunity
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri plans to start kicking again Monday, which would give
him time to be ready for the opener Sept. 7 in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, the kicker said, developed in the early days of camp
while he worked on Olindo Mare-style pop-up, onsides kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got sore after doing them four or five days and
unfortunately I didn't give it any rest,'' he said. ``I kept
kicking and kicking and aggravated it. It was never a major pull or
tear, just soreness. We're rehabbing the heck out of it right now
to try to get it feeling good and get the swelling down. It feels
pretty good right now. We're being cautious. A groin injury for a
kicker is like a shoulder injury for a quarterback. You use it
every time you kick.''
</P>
<P>
   If Vinatieri is ready to go Monday, Dawson hopes he showed
enough against the Redskins and gets a chance to show enough
against Philadelphia this Saturday to get a shot somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   That's all he was looking for when he sought and received his
release in Oakland. With three kickers in camp, he felt he wasn't
getting the chance he expected, or needed. He missed his only field
goal attempt, a 48-yarder, with the Raiders and then when he didn't
get on the field in another exhibition, asked for his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, it looks like a decision has been made,'' he
said. ``I said I understand that. I'm not arguing with the
decision. But I would like to be out of here. I don't want to waste
anyone's time.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week he was a Patriot _ at least for a week or
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it all goes back to the confidence I have in being
able to perform at this level,'' Dawson said. ``I think a lot of
guys would have been scared to do what I did. Like, it's their one
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   His is a confidence born of a career at the University of Texas,
a career which opened with a 50-yard field goal to beat Pittsburgh
and ended with Dawson as a team captain with impressive numbers. He
was 13 for 16 with a long field goal of 54 yards last year and was
63 of 83 for his career, including 10 of 16 from 50 yards or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   He kicked and played on the offensive line at 5 feet 10 inches
and 190 pounds at Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, where he
was a teammate of Patriot running back Derrick Cullors.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors doesn't remember much about Dawson on the offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was our kicker, and he was great,'' Cullors said. ``I
was in college when he kicked like a 59-yarder to win a playoff
game.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cullors was not the least bit worried when Dawson lined up
for the game-winner Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was nervous and I was standing there and I told Ben
Coates, `I have confidence in him, I know he's going to make it,'''
Cullors said.
</P>
<P>
   He did. And now he gets another chance to show his stuff
Saturday.

IN REGGIE LEWIS DEATH SUIT, DEFENSE LOOKS FOR DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Moved on AM cycle.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH AND STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawyers and investigators defending the four Boston
doctors sued by the widow of Reggie Lewis are focusing on possible
drug use by the former Boston Celtic star as a contributing factor
in his heart attack in &UR;  &LR; 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A former acquaintance of Lewis has testified in a deposition
that he used cocaine with Lewis on two occasions while they were
enrolled at Northeastern University in the mid-1980s, according to
sources familiar with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the acquaintance, who in the deposition acknowledged
selling cocaine, heroin, and other drugs on the Northeastern
campus, testified that he gave Lewis cocaine free of charge 15-20
times and saw Lewis at several parties where cocaine was being
used, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the damage to Lewis's reputation, the allegations about
drug use are significant because they raise the possibility that he
lied about previous use of drugs during the application process for
an insurance policy taken out by the Celtics when he signed his
$16.5 million contract in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The lead attorney representing the widow, Donna Harris-Lewis,
the executor of Lewis's estate, declined to discuss any allegations
and said that the case ultimately will be decided on the doctors'
diagnosis and treatment of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that the doctors recklessly misdiagnosed Reggie
Lewis and he relied on their misdiagnosis and died,'' said Robert
G. Harley of the New York firm Harley and Browne.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. &UR;  &LR; and three other cardiac
specialists at Brigham and Women's Hospital have sought court
approval to depose Derrick Lewis, a friend and teammate of Reggie
Lewis when they were at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, Derrick Lewis told The Globe that he had used
cocaine with Reggie Lewis five or six times between 1985 and 1993.
Derrick Lewis made similar statements to the Wall Street Journal
but later recanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that Lewis had used cocaine surfaced soon after his
death but they were sharply denied by Harris-Lewis. Except for
Derrick Lewis, none of his former friends and teammates ever had
corroborated the allegations _ until the deposition of the
Northeastern acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least two others who have been deposed have also
testified about Lewis's alleged drug use. One, a former employee of
the Celtics' front office, told the lawyers that he was present
when Lewis used marijuana on several occasions in 1988, 1989, and
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Irwin Cohen, former Northeastern athletic director,
testified that he had been told by the school's team physician that
Lewis had tested positive for cocaine in March 1987 when the team
was screened for the NCAA tournament. However, Dr. Job E. Fuchs,
the now-retired team physician, told the lawyers that he could not
recall whether Lewis had flunked the test for cocaine, but said he
trusted Cohen to have an accurate memory of the conversation. He
testified that Lewis passed a second, later test for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony has been given over the past several months in
depositions taken by Mudge's lawyers, William J. Dailey Jr. and
John P. Ryan, of the Boston firm Sloane and Walsh. Harley and
Bridget Asaro, lawyers for Harris-Lewis, also attended the sessions
and questioned the witnesses about their recollections. Lewis's
widow has also attended most of the sessions, including those of
the former Northeastern acquaintance and the former Celtics
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Following Lewis's death, the Massachusetts Medical Examiner's
office conducted an autopsy and found that his heart was severely
scarred, a condition they attributed to an ``adenovirus 2,'' a
simple virus spread by coughing and sneezing. In addition, they
found damage to the aorta and his heart's mitral valve.
</P>
<P>
   Other cardiologists have been quoted anonymously as saying that
similar scarring of the heart can be caused by cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mudge and Donna Harris-Lewis have questioned about
30 people in private depositions in the case, which is scheduled
for trial next spring. But Harris-Lewis's lawyers are concentrating
on whether Mudge and the cardiologists provided adequate treatment
to Lewis during the three months he was in their care.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge drew fire following Lewis's death in late July 1993 for
having diagnosed a far less serious heart condition than diagnosed
earlier by a team of cardiologists and other specialists, who were
drawn from hospitals across the city. Mudge said at the time he
believed Lewis suffered from a fainting condition and, with further
monitoring, could return to playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The other doctors, who were later nicknamed the Dream Team,
examined Lewis for three days at the New England Baptist Hospital
following his collapse during a Celtics' playoff game in April
1993, and diagnosed Lewis as suffering from cardiomyopathy, a
potentially life-threatening condition that would have ended his
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Mudge's lawyers are focusing on the Lewises'
decision to transfer Reggie Lewis from the Baptist to the Brigham,
the sources said. They are trying to determine if one of the
reasons for the move may have been to avoid a drug test at the
Baptist. Donna Harris-Lewis has denied in interviews that the
doctors at the Baptist ever asked that a drug test be taken. No
such test was taken at the Brigham.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Reggie Lewis died, Harris-Lewis issued a statement
supporting Mudge and his efforts. However, in May 1996,
Harris-Lewis filed a malpractice suit against Mudge and his
associates, Drs. Peter L. Friedman, Mark A. Creager, and John D.
Rutherford, claiming their treatment of her husband was ``rendered
carelessly, unskillfully, and negligently.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mudge had said publicly that he believed that Lewis, under
medical supervision, could play basketball again, the Globe was
told in 1993 that the cardiologist in fact had given Lewis far more
cautious advice about his condition in private conversations. What
was said in those conversations and whether Lewis followed Mudge's
advice are issues also being explored in the lawsuit, sources
familiar with the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was 27 when he collapsed while working out at Brandeis
University, the practice facility used by the Celtics, with Chris
Havlicek, the son of Celtics star John Havlicek, and others. Three
months before, on April 29, 1993, he had collapsed while playing
for the Celtics in a game at Boston Garden, and the next day had
entered New England Baptist Hospital for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of drug use by Lewis surfaced following his death, but
the issue erupted in March 1995, when the Wall Street Journal
quoted two cardiologists, not connected with the case, as saying
that such scarring was consistent with cocaine use. That report
prompted the state Medical Examiner's office to conduct a new
examination of Lewis's heart tissue.
</P>
<P>
   That month-long reinvestigation, conducted by eight independent
medical consultants, found no evidence that the scarring on Lewis's
heart was caused by cocaine use. Instead, the investigation
confirmed the original findings of the autopsy: that the scarring
likely was caused by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern University also conducted an investigation in 1995
to determine if Lewis might have used cocaine or other illicit
drugs while at the school. That probe was ordered by Northeastern
President John A. Curry after Cohen told him of the conversation he
said he had with Fuchs about the results of cocaine testing of team
members.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis in 1991 signed a five-year contract with the Celtics,
he claimed he had never used cocaine or marijuana in his life.
Lewis checked off ``no'' in the box beside the question on drugs in
the insurance policy application.
</P>
<P>
   However, if it is determined that Lewis lied when he attested on
his insurance policy application that he never had used illegal
drugs, it is possible that the insurance company could seek to
reclaim some or all of its payments on the grounds that he
committed fraud.

NET GAIN IN BATTLE OF SEXES; DRUNK GIRLS ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
 MAGAZINE-REVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this sizzling summer of Monica-gate, what red-blooded
American hasn't surveyed the muck and mire of our national politics
and said, ``Enough, already''?
</P>
<P>
   And what better way to prove that the appetite for sinning and
spinning is sated than to peruse some of the latest political
periodicals _ looking for any story without a Washington dateline.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut in 1995, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s George magazine
has tried to synthesize celebrity and politics, leaving both a
little worse for the wear. The flashy bylines in the September
issue belong to the Reagans' wayward daughter Patti Davis (writing
about Monica, so we'll take a pass), and recording artist Liz Phair
explaining what she'd do as president (Merv Griffin as secretary of
commerce?).
</P>
<P>
   But one fun read is Billy Jean King's recollection of her
25-year-old, gender-stereotype shattering win over tennis hustler
Bobby Riggs. That 1973 Houston Astrodome extravaganza was one of
those culturally resonant sports spectaculars of the 1970s, the
precursor being the epic Ali-Frazier 1971 heavyweight championship
between the so-called draft-dodging Muslim and the so-called
``Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   King, then under 30, trounced 55-year-old male chauvinist pig
Riggs and is candid about her strategy. She just made the old guy
run out of gas by hitting the ball softly. The most interesting
tidbit is that George Foreman, then heavyweight champ, gallantly
escorted King to safety in the pandemonium that followed the match.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the event, King writes that ``for at least one night,
it got women and men to talk to one another about the equality of
the sexes.'' Maybe it was also the onset of Foreman's
transformation from destructive hulk to jovial giant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The September/October issue of Tikkun, the ``Jewish Critique of
Politics, Culture and Society,'' has a series on ``Spirituality in
America.'' But with my morality meter running on empty right now, I
opted for an unusual profile of Asa Yoelson (a.k.a. Al Jolson) by
actor Stephen Mo Hanan.
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that the blackface performer was not only
``the first open Jew to be celebrated by the American masses,'' but
the ``unlikely ... bridge'' through which early black artists like
Fats Waller and Duke Ellington ``entered popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty impressive legacy for a guy borrowing a minstrel
show model that dated back to the 1840s. But Hanan makes a case for
Jolson's primitive if pioneering crossover act by explaining that
the Lithuanian immigrant brought the street culture of Washington,
D.C., and the jazz riffs of turn-of-the-century New Orleans to a
mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Jolson was also noted for ``below-the-waist
gyrations not seen again from any white male till the advent of
Elvis'' and for singing several songs in ``female persona'' with
touches gleaned from gay friends. Makes it seem like Neil Diamond
wasn't the right guy to play him in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of the liberal journal Mother Jones has a
snazzy redesign and a clever eight-page assault on media mogul
Rupert Murdoch that looks like one of Rupe's tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   But that's too ideological. So the story that caught our eye was
a scary ``Ladies' Night'' feature on the increase in problem
drinking among college women. Seems they largely imbibe to ease
sexual inhibitions: One survey claimed that nearly two-thirds of
the women who had used alcohol in the past month did so to loosen
their libido.
</P>
<P>
   What's particularly worrisome is the evidence that alcohol is
more destructive to women than to men _ and it's not just about
body mass. Oral contraceptives, dieting, and PMS can all have an
impact on alcohol absorption. So does the fact that women have
fewer of the enzymes needed to break down alcohol in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is probably more theory than science, the story
also points to evidence that women who work in more traditional
fields such as nursing or education have fewer problems with
alcohol than those joining the boys in banking and high finance.
One more piece of ammo for the anti-feminism backlash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debut issue of Brill's Content media magazine generated huge
headlines with a story alleging that Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr improperly leaked grand jury information. The new September
issue has plenty of follow-up, including a long rebuttal letter
from the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is verboten, so instead we'll turn to a summer
piece about how baseball announcers _ who are either hired by the
team or must be approved by the team _ should never be mistaken for
journalists. We read about broadcasters who moan about close
pitches that go against the home team but wouldn't let fans know
about an impending trade because the club wants to keep mum on such
matters.
</P>
<P>
   One announcer who refused to tank for the home team was Jon
Miller, now of the Sunday night ESPN broadcast. Miller departed the
Baltimore Orioles after the 1996 season because owner Peter Angelos
(who makes George Steinbrenner seem like a statesman) wanted his
men behind the mike to be ``advocates for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing too earthshaking here. But at least baseball _ with Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa chasing Roger Maris and the potential for a
Yankees-Sox playoff showdown 20 years after Bucky ``Bleepin'' Dent
_ is having a good summer. That's more than you can say for anyone
in Washington.

CHARLEY'S RAINS DEVASTATE, RESTORE TEXAS AGRICULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The deadly storm system that hit the state
this week has been both cruel and kind to South and Southwest Texas
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoffs from Tropical Storm Charley are running from a
virtual wipeout on up to 8,000 acres of irrigated cotton in the
Winter Garden area to a boost for the red grapefruit crop, revived
ranch pastures in some areas and desperately needed irrigation
water in the still-parched Lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Texas drought is not over,'' cautioned Joe Paschal,
the Texas Agricultural Extension Service's livestock specialist for
the Coastal Bend and far South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For people raising cattle, sheep and goats, Paschal said, the
impact ranged widely. Rain bypassed or barely wet wide sections of
ranch country while reviving pasture and range land grasses across
other large areas. Even in many areas that were deluged, though,
the rain fell too fast and ran off without soaking the ground, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Charley nearly bypassed the Lower Rio Grande
Valley, which received some extremely spotty 0.3-inch to 1-inch
showers, farmers and produce shippers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm's heavy runoff into the Rio Grande's Falcon and
Amistad reservoirs is expected to be a godsend for the Lower
Valley's short- and long-term crop irrigation needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those folks are going through a living hell up there'' in the
Laredo-Eagle Pass flood areas, but ``it looks like a silver lining
for us,'' said Bill Weeks, president of the Mission-based Texas
Produce Association, a Lower Valley shippers and shipper-growers
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the potential of a larger citrus crop than last
year's, and we're looking at possibly the largest crop since the
1989 freeze,'' Weeks said.
</P>
<P>
   Grapefruit and orange production could reach 380 million pounds,
up from 348 million pounds last year, he said. The 1989 freeze not
only destroyed most of that year's crop but wiped out thousands of
trees.

<P>
   Irrigation water from the Rio Grande has been shut off this
summer to seven of 27 Lower Valley water-control districts, and
five more districts are on the verge of depleting their current
water allocations for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the region's irrigation water, as well as cities'
water supplies, is drawn from the river. The four- to five-year
drought in the Falcon and Amistad watershed areas has depleted the
lakes' reserves to their lowest levels on record, since a hurricane
filled them in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Now with heavy Charley runoff, delivery of irrigation water
could resume as early as next month, and the runoff could satisfy
more long-term needs, Weeks said.
</P>
<P>
   Produce growers and shippers are seeking an emergency allocation
to speed up the process. One priorty is citrus trees; about 25
percent to 30 percent of the citrus acreage has been without
irrigation water for up to two months.
</P>
<P>
   But the extra water may be too late for a significant portion of
the sugar cane crop, where 25 percent to 30 percent of the acreage
has also been without irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Mack Simpson, who farms in the Rio Hondo area, said
little or none of his 630 acres of sugar cane can be saved even if
the water arrives this month.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's biggest agricultural losses are expected to be up to
8,000 acres of irrigated cotton farther north in the Winter Garden
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably lost our cotton crop,'' said Charles Stichler, the
extension service's Uvalde-based regional agronomist and a Winter
Garden crops specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers from south of Uvalde to the San Antonio area had just
barely started their harvest when 5- to 22-inch deluges washed
cotton fiber away, pulled it out of the bolls to the ground or
lowered its quality with stains from splattering mud, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's left on the plants is being further damaged by molds and
seed germination in the bolls, he said.

   Steffens, who took over at the Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin (65,000
circulation) in June 1997, hooked up with a Binghamton television
station and university (which, she points out, has a woman
president) to conduct a ``Facing Our Future'' civic journalism
project to examine the area's economic prospects. ``We decided to
let citizens define what they meant by economic revitalization,''
she says. ``It was very cathartic for the community.'' Since
becoming editor, Steffens has also made a series of unorthodox
hires, tapping a former assistant district attorney to cover the
courts and a teacher as a copy editor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A quiet statement
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Idaho Statesman, where Baker has served as editor since last
September, has opened up newsroom meetings to readers, convened
weekly reader panels out in the Boise community, and initiated a
column called ``Life After Deadline'' in which staff members write
about personal experiences. On July 19, when the paper chose an
unorthodox way to cover the Aryan Nations march in Idaho _ by
surveying what ordinary people around the the state were doing that
day _ Baker took another unusual step. Over the objections of other
editors, she wrote a Page 1 note to readers explaining that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   And Katz's Orange County Register may be the most radically
risk-taking paper in the country. To solicit public feedback, the
Register brings in reader groups to critique the paper, hosts
hundreds of community meetings, polls citizens, and even puts up
suggestion boxes in Starbucks coffee shops. Internally, the
Register has reorganized the newsroom according to cross-functional
teams, calls its top editors ``the board of directors'' and
encourages bottom-up decision making, and is immersing staffers in
an eight-session curriculum designed to better connect the newsroom
to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a zealot when it comes to serving the community,'' says
Katz. And the Register's outreach ``gives the public a stake in the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that female editors might be more eager to generate
dialogue between the paper and its readers goes to the heart of the
gender theory. Writing earlier this year in The New Yorker, Ken
Auletta interviewed several dozen female executives in the
entertainment and information industries and ``heard them say that
women are better managers _ more nurturing, more collegial, more
communicative and more instinctual.''
</P>
<P>
   That communication stream seems to run both ways, both inside
the newsroom and out toward the community. Idaho Statesman editor
Baker explains that her weekly column is designed to ``let readers
understand how we make decisions. ... Our business is a mystery to
most readers. One of the things I've tried to do is demystify the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The other instinct that seems to guide many women editors is the
opportunity to effect change. Here the model may be Jennie Buckner,
editor of The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer (circulation 246,000). The
Observer was a 1995 Pulitzer finalist for a ``Taking Back Our
Neighborhoods'' civic journalism project designed to focus public
and private resources on reclaiming the city's most crime-ridden
enclaves. (In her office, Buckner displays a quote from the late
Knight-Ridder CEO Jim Batten that says: ``Newspapers, well edited,
well-published, are wonderfully situated to be instruments of
helping America find its way, solve its problems, seize its
opportunities.'')
</P>
<P>
   Piggybacking on that effort, The (Myrtle Beach) Sun News
initiated a similiar project that revitalized a beleaguered
neighborhood near that newspaper. When the paper used its pages to
solicit help for the residents, Deans says, it generated about 200
calls the first day alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why many of us got in the business,'' explains Deans.
``To make a difference.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A quiet statement
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept the theory that female and male editors
operate differently, there is the question of whether there will be
sufficient numbers of women at the top to change the newspaper
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more women in the pipeline,'' says Sandra Mims Rowe,
editor of The (Portland) Oregonian and past president of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``But I've been saying there
are a lot of women in the pipeline for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some observers say the kind of newspaper leadership
female editors are demonstrating is becoming the irresistible
reality _ for both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are certain qualities today that are admired in
editors that did not use to be admired,'' says Rowe. ``But they are
not gender specific. The model of the `take no crap' city editor
and managing editor ... is not accepted,'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Former Christian Science Monitor editor Katherine Fanning says
``there's something to the fact that women tend to have a different
style of management'' from ``the old hierarchical style'' that was
once in favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men that I know that are still in the business,'' she
adds, ``have had to learn.''

TERROR FIGURE'S FAMILY HAS BENIGN TIES IN THE UNITED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   AND AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the bin Laden name was associated with international
terror, it stood for wealth, and students at Harvard University
needed to look no further than their guidebooks to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ``generosity of the Binladin family,'' two
graduate fellowships were established at the university in 1992.
Both are devoted to Islamic studies, and both are named after the
prominent Saudi Arabian family, worth about $5 billion. (The name
appears as `Binladin,' one of several spellings, in a Harvard
University website.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was from this dynasty that Osama bin Laden, accused of
funding the bombing of two embassies, arose, inheriting
approximately $250 million before he fled to Sudan. He departed the
family construction empire nearly a decade ago _ taking with him,
US officials believe, the business savvy of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Osama bin Laden threatens to cast a shadow on not only the
Harvard fellowships but also a variety of the connections other
members of the bin Laden family have with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Harvard fellowship, one of bin Laden's
brothers is currently attending Harvard Business School, according
to a report in the London Independent. That brother, who shares the
same father with bin Laden but has a different mother, was
unavailable for comment last night.
</P>
<P>
   In a greater irony, the bin Laden family construction company
has won a $150 million contract to replace Khobar Towers, the US
military residence in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that was destroyed by
a terrorist bomb in June, 1996, killing 19 and injuring another
160. Some US officials believe Osama bin Laden was involved in that
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin beneficiaries have already begun to mount their
defense. Harvard spokesman Alex Huppe differentiated between the
family and the alleged terrorist, saying ``its clear the Saudi bin
Laden money is being put to good use here.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon, Major Joseph LaMarca, pointed to
the near-monopoly of construction contracts the bin Laden family
has won in Saudi Arabia, noting, referring to Osama, ``You can't
say he has any role in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, did people stop buying Hearst newspapers when Patty
Hearst was part of a terrorist organization?'' he said. ``You can't
tie one to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden was officially banned from Saudi Arabia in 1991,
while he was living in Sudan. While one former Central Intelligence
Agency analyst said the family link is now tenuous at best, several
US experts say the he is still in contact with some of his
brothers. Officials believe his siblings may number as high as 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still a family, just like Ted Kaczynski still has
family,'' Kenneth Katzman, a former CIA analyst, said. ``Some of
the brothers are still in active contact with him, just because
he's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, 41, stands accused of masterminding twin explosions
at US embassies in East Africa that killed 257 on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions took place on what, to bin Laden, may appear to
have been a crucial date: the anniversary of the first wave of the
1990 US military operation ``Desert Shield,'' in which thousands of
American troops were deployed to the Persian Gulf to combat Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, bin Laden has accused the United States of invading
his homeland, and it is the Gulf War that has driven the Saudi
exile to threaten a ``black day for America,'' as he did during an
interview with ABC News earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, following the African attacks, as well as further threats
made by a spokesman for bin Laden in the days following the
bombings, intelligence officials have announced their intent to
strike at the heart of his operation: his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But first, they are trying to piece together exactly what, and
where, it is, a task that US analysts describe as far more daunting
than the military strikes last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his financial interests are known: bin Laden poured $50
million into the Al-Shamal Islamic Bank in Khartoum, for example.
He also established Wadi al-Aqiq Company Ltd., a Sudanese
import-export company that markets agricultural products, according
to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are shakier reports: that bin Ladin has played a
major role in providing American manufacturers with gum arabic, a
prized substance used in soft drinks, candy and other products. Or
that he has secreted millions away in a variety of Swiss bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Yossef Bodansky, director of the US House Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, is that ``there is
no bin Laden Incorporated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't exist,'' he said. ``There is not something you
can go to and say, `That belongs to him 100 percent.' He is very
smart and sophisticated. ... He also knows that everyone will go
after him, so he has carefully concealed what he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department believes it has tracked down at least some
of his business dealings, and it credits bin Laden in a 1996 report
with having ``secured a near monopoly over Sudan's major
agricultural exports &UR;  &LR; of gum,'' as well as several other products.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan produces 70 percent to 90 percent of the world's gum
arabic, but Sudanese and American companies deny that bin Laden has
any role in the gum arabic trade.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and general manager of Gum Arabic Co. Ltd., which
holds the monopoly on Sudanese production, sent a letter Tuesday to
US partners saying that the allegation of a bin Laden role in the
company ``is not founded and is completely baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Omer Mubarak, and General Manager M.M. Karama
wrote that bin Ladin is not an investor, trading partner, financier
or beneficiary of the company's activities ``in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, still others argue that bin Laden's vast wealth has
been wildly exaggerated and point to the decision by the Saudi
government to freeze his bank accounts after pulling his
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Barri Atwan, the editor of the London-based Arabic paper al-Quds
al-Arabi, said that when he spoke with bin Laden in 1996, the Saudi
exile said he had also ``invested badly in Sudan,'' greatly
diminishing his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a State Department report, bin Laden's Al-Hijrah
for Construction and Development Ltd. built a massive road between
the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and Port Sudan, a contract that
would normally bring a handsome return. But bin Laden claims he was
never paid for the 1994 project, Atwan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sudanese were supposed to pay him 140 million pounds, but
they never paid,'' Atwan said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzman, the former CIA analyst, described the convoluted
financial web as the ``biggest problem'' investigators have faced
so far.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary pursuit, he said, is in its ``very early infancy.''
He added: ``They're not even off square one.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    MIAMI _ In what has become the manner of the times, the newly
proclaimed ``war on terrorism'' is taking on a shrill,
hyper-menacing tone that cannot help the U.S. deal with the
problem. Some commentators seem almost gleeful at finding a
dangerous new enemy to take the place of the Cold War threat.
 &HT;    There is an astonishing intensity in the way news is being
presented to maximize the drama. The TV reports _ and most people
get their news from TV now _ go on hour after hour, with
interruptions only for commercials, the weather and sports, whether
or not they have any information to offer.
 &HT;    It is as though nothing else is going on in the world except
Monica Lewinsky and terrorism. Journalists and ``consultants''
interview each other endlessly on what they think about the facts
they admittedly don't know. They spend so much time on camera that
they can't do much reporting beyond offering themselves as the
audience for ``spin control'' briefings, so they aren't prepared to
ask probing questions.
 &HT;    Even the sober, serious ones, such as Ted Koppel, discuss at
length the Armageddon that the terrorists may be preparing for the
United States. There is some official deliberation behind this. The
government feels a need to arouse people so as to have full support
for future action not yet thought through. Gone is the moderating,
skeptical tone of a Walter Cronkite searching for some perspective
and a basis for independent judgment. The more they talk, the less
they say.
 &HT;    It reminded me of the time when President Kennedy, seeking to
mobilize people for the nuclear-arms race, announced a program to
have everybody build a family atomic-bomb shelter in the back yard.
Fortunately, the idea was soon abandoned. A combination of dismay
and ridicule, and a gradual understanding that terrorizing the
country wasn't a good or sound way to strengthen it, shot the
program down.
 &HT;    The Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who has been around
promoting his nefarious plots for a long time but was unknown
except to Middle East experts, has suddenly provided a face to pin
on the murky image of terrorism. It's as though he could be held to
account for all of it.
 &HT;    Nobody asks for some clarification of just whom the new war is
to be fought against. Only Arabs, or are the Irish, the militant
Israelis, the Japanese cultists, the Colombian and Peruvian and
Algerian guerrillas to be included? Is terrorist some kind of
special breed to be identified by the color of skin, the length of
nose, facial hair, a headdress? Or is it only somebody who hates
Americans?
 &HT;    There is little explanation of the background of bin Laden and
the ``Afghanis,'' the people from many countries recruited to fight
the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan with Pakistani sponsorship and
American supplies and finance. The European press has made the
point.
 &HT;    The Financial Times called bin Laden ``America's Frankenstein,
``a reminder that dirty tricks and covert action spawn more dirty
tricks.''
 &HT;    Even the dangerous implications of the cruise-missile attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan are brushed aside in the effort to appear
faultlessly resolute. It has only just come out that the deputy
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston, was
sent to be in Pakistan when the missiles hit the neighborhood, so
he could convince the Pakistani military that the sudden strike was
not an attack from India.
 &HT;    A misinterpretation of who was targeting whom could have led to
a nuclear exchange between the two subcontinental enemies. That is
an extreme but factual example of why it's bad to stir up
exaggerated fears with worst-case terrorist scenarios.
 &HT;    For myself, I feel obliged to reserve judgment on the missile
strikes. I favor doing whatever is possible to deter terrorism and
punish its practitioners, but we don't know enough yet to tell if
this was a good way and what chances it had of being effective. A
sheer display of destructive power can serve the terrorists'
purposes by heightening tension and hostility.
 &HT;    It was shocking to hear some congressmen and commentators jump
to the assumption that President Clinton decided on the spectacular
retaliation for the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania to change the
subject from the round-the-clock Monica Lewinsky coverage. In
itself, it showed how much the scandal has damaged America.
 &HT;    There is a problem of credibility, having nothing to do with the
president's sex life but with the way important news is handled and
opinion manipulated. Maybe the American public, having been exposed
to this kind of infodrama since the O.J. Simpson show boosted
ratings, is inured to its insidious effect.
 &HT;    But it isn't reassuring. ``War on terrorism'' can become a war
on sanity.

CLINTON REACTION RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT NATION'S VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does it say about the country's moral health when most
Americans, if the slew of opinion polls are a fair gauge, seem to
be unperturbed that President Clinton admitted to lying when he had
denied having a sexual relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Is American society sliding down a slippery slope to a place
where there is no longer a core of commonly held values? Should a
president be expected to adhere to a code of conduct that makes him
an example of virtue to the country?
</P>
<P>
   Theologians, clergy, and others concerned about ethics are
wrestling with these and other troubling questions as the scandal
about Clinton's transgressions, and his private life, dominates the
national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for women and men who are leaders to
be people of integrity,'' said R. Judson Carlberg, president of
Gordon College in Wenham, Mass. and a nationally known speaker on
character and leadership development.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are role models, who have a
responsibility to pass along to future generations a solid
framework upon which to build our culture, and if we don't have
some agreed-upon base for our moral development then we begin to
erode our societal underpinnings,'' Carlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. Canon Martin Eppard, a member of a national
conservative clergy group, told reporters in Washington this week,
``The unfortunate fact of the matter is that we have become a
society that has lost its ability to blush.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can staunchly maintain that the testimony he gave in
January before a federal grand jury regarding his relationship with
Lewinsky was ``legally correct.'' But as a Christian he is clearly
a sinner, theologians and clergy assert.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, Clinton broke two of the commandments enshrined
in the Old Testament: He admitted to lying, and he committed
adultery.
</P>
<P>
   In some Christian congregations, particularly conservative
churches, Clinton, a Southern Baptist, would face disciplinary
action for his behavior that might include being put on probation.
In an interesting twist, the Rev. J. Philip Wogeman, pastor at
Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, where the Clintons
often worship, is a specialist in Christian ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Some clergy and theologians say they are troubled by what they
view as Clinton's failure to express true contrition during his
televised speech Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that the country is paralyzed because
to be able to move on, I think there is a strong need for
forgiveness,'' said Thomas Groome, a professor of theology at
Boston College and the author of a recently published book,
``Education for Life: A Spiritual Vision for Every Teacher and
Parent.''
</P>
<P>
   From a theological perspective, Groome added, forgiveness
requires ``saying you did wrong, secondly saying you're sorry, and
lastly saying, `Please forgive me.' But Clinton never did any of
those three.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid the seeming obsession with the scandal's salacious
details, some say, are serious issues about the unscrupulous abuse
of presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's someone using his authority to take advantage of someone
else,'' said Rabbi Moshe Waldoks of Temple Beth Zion in Brookline,
Mass. ``It's not that Clinton's behavior is uncommon. What's
reprehensible is to think it should be considered acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that in judging Clinton, Americans should remember
the idea of a merciful God. ``Our God is one who judges with
unclouded vision and always responds with understanding love _ a
model for our human lives,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell,
general secretary of the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the world of religion regard Clinton to be a
successful political leader but a failed moral leader _ a major
liability in a country they say is in desperate need of higher
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton has broken the covenant of honor that the American
people entrust to their president every four years,'' the Pilot,
the official newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston,
charged in an editorial in Thursday's edition. ``Without that
fundamental trust, we all flounder.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to resume his vaction on Martha's Vineyard
``among the `glitterati,''' the editorial said, ``one can only hope
that he becomes more acquainted with his better angels who will
speak to him of our common human need for reconciliation.''

<P>
   _In what critics charge is another example of the Vatican's
authoritarian style a liberal priest in Rochester, N.Y., hailed for
reviving a parish in decline has been removed for alleged practices
that violated church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Callan has conducted same-sex commitment
ceremonies, supported priest-like roles for women in worship, and
dispensed Holy Communion to non-Catholics _ all actions prohibited
by the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Callan's supporters believe that the priest's removal from
Corpus Christi was ordered by the Vatican even though it was
officially carried out by Rochester Bishop Matthew Clark, who is
himself considered a liberal American prelate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vatican's pressure demonstrates how not to run a church,''
Sister Maureen Fiedler, national coordinator of Catholics Speak
Out, a liberal Maryland-based church reform group, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Callan's downtown church has drawn a far-flung and diverse
membership and is well-known for its social and economic
ministries, including providing free legal, medical, and dental
services and operating a food pantry, homeless shelter, and
hospice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, I knew this day would come, that I would be
removed,'' Callan told the Associated Press last week. ``I was
hoping since it went on so long, that everybody would look the
other way and just let reform happen in the church. But I guess
it's not going to happen that easily.''

   _The Assemblies of God, one of the world's fastest-growing
denominations, will place its heritage on display when it opens a

early Assemblies of God leader, also will explore the broader world
of Pentecostalism.

THE '68 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION: WHERE FOLLY AND EGO COLLIDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- The Blackstone Hotel, which still stands at
Balbo Drive and Michigan Avenue, housed the original ``smoke-filled
room'' on its fourth floor, where Republican bosses, amid the aroma
of fine panatelas, planned the nomination of Warren G. Harding in
1920. In 1968, when I stayed at the Blackstone, stink bombs and
tear gas created a rancid aroma of protest and repression in the
streets of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Assassinations led to grief and turmoil 30 years ago, but the
Democratic National Convention of 1968 had a more profound impact.
That week-long tragedy combined unintended consequences and
avoidable outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Folly and ego collided, lengthening the Vietnam War, ushering in
the Nixon era, imperiling democracy, and engulfing the Democratic
Party in a boisterous bonfire of the vanities, yet to be quenched.
</P>
<P>
   In his book on 1968, ``The Year the Dream Died,'' Jules Witcover
reports that Robert F. Kennedy once called Eugene J. McCarthy ``a
vain man.'' Since all politicans are vain about something, even
integrity, the charge was probably true. But history will be kinder
to Kennedy and McCarthy than to other figures from that turbulent
week.
</P>
<P>
   The vanity prize goes to Lyndon B. Johnson, who celebrated his
60th birthday by threatening to rescind his five-month-old pledge
not to accept renomination. At issue was a platform plank about the
war in Vietnam. LBJ still thought the war was a swell idea and if
Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey wavered, Texas would nominate
Johnson. Humphrey never called the bluff, vain about his loyalty,
even loyalty to a dishonest bully, which LBJ was that week.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was the last convention that did not ratify the decision
of voters in primaries. As such, it was a crisis for democracy. Of
the primaries in 1968, McCarthy won six, Kennedy five, and Humphrey
none. In the primaries, McCarthy won 2.9 million votes and Kennedy
2.3 million. Both opposed the war in Vietnam. Only 666,463 voted
for Humphrey, the nominee, who supported the war.
</P>
<P>
   When bosses steal a convention, protestors fill the streets. One
myth persists in Chicago that antiwar activists were violent and
somehow menaced the police and National Guard. The opposite was
true. The cops outnumbered kids by four-to-one and while some
protestors were vile, insulting and provocative, a well-trained
police force would have kept order.
</P>
<P>
   Authority collapsed in Chicago because Mayor Richard J. Daley
condoned what an Illinois state commission later called ``a police
riot.'' ``What would you do when they called you all kinds of
names?'' the mayor asked later. The answer is: I would have done
what my commanding officer told me to do. He would have done what
his boss, the mayor, told him to, which in Chicago meant police
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Aug. 28, 1968, after hours of arguing, the
delegates approved a platform, then nominated Humphrey. After
covering the convention near the stockyards, I returned to the
Blackstone at midnight and witnessed what Senator Abe Ribicoff
called ``Gestapo tactics in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The cops also clubbed reporters, because as Daley said later,
``Many of them were hippies themselves.'' I resented that because I
liked cops and even looked like one.
</P>
<P>
   Before a taxi deposited me near the hotel, I removed all press
credentials and walked slowly along Michigan Avenue, unmolested. I
could have been from homicide or the FBI, but I never deceived
anyone. I greeted by the name on his uniform the cop guarding the
Blackstone's door. He was impressed and held it open. I then went
to my room to file by telephone notes on the carnage I had
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   That week, Soviet tanks moved on Prague to crush the
Czechoslovakian revolution, making the furor in Chicago seem
self-indulgent. Yes, some protestors were childish, but ego-smitten
adults like Johnson, Humphrey, and Daley bear the burden of the
history still smoldering from Chicago in 1968.

TOO MUCH FISHING, TOO FEW FISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People might get the picture if they were to go to Legal Sea
Foods, sit down with their mouths watering for the catch of the
day, open the menu, and find these specials:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Fresh Lake Leech in Muck Sauce, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   Grilled Algae Bloom with Sandfly Fritters, $15.95
</P>
<P>
   Fried Jellyfish with Greenhead Peas, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   Poached Garden Eel with Urchin Spine Fries, $18.95(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready to order? Based on the news this summer, it seems
as if this is all that will be left in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists in New England said we may soon face a lobster
collapse. Cod, fished to collapse on Georges Bank, are now near
collapse in the Gulf of Maine. Down in Chesapeake Bay, the blue
crab harvest was the worst in recorded history. This is on top of
deep ongoing concern about swordfish, bluefin tuna, shark, and the
fact that 70 percent of the world's fishing stocks have been
depleted.
</P>
<P>
   The howls from those observing our plunder are as fairly
absolute. On the Gulf of Maine, Steve Murawski, biologist for the
National Marine Fisheries Service, says, ``The fishing rate ought
to be cut to as close to zero as possible.'' Murawski believes that
lobsters are being caught at twice the rate of reproducing
themselves. ``There's no way in God's green earth that these
catches are sustainable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Murawski's warnings are part of a global alarm. This month, the
World Wildlife Fund released a report titled, ``Too Much Fishing
Fleet, Too Few Fish.'' The technology of catching fish has become
so much child's play that the fishing industry is capable of
snaring 155 percent more fish than the oceans can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Porter, the researcher for the report recommends that the
world fishing fleet be reduced by two-thirds in the hope that fish
species can recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a race for the fish,'' Porter said by
telephone from Washington. ``You could see a crash of the total
catch at some point. It gets more difficult to catch fish as they
get smaller and smaller and younger and lower quality. There's a
real possibility that things could get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter did not want to predict how many years it would take a
crash to drastically alter our menus. But pictures in the Globe's
Health/Science section last week should frighten people who
understand that food chains start with the smallest of creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures, provided by the US Geological Survey, showed how
fishing boats that drag their nets along the sea bottom catch far
more than fish. The draggers rake the floor clean of sponges,
anenomes, worms, and juvenile fish. They leave behind an underwater
moonscape of lifeless gray rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a persistent loss of diversity and of complexity,'' said
Eleanor Dorsey of the Conservation Law Foundation and editor of the
foundation's new book, ``Effects of Fishing Gear on the Sea Floor
of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary recommendations from conservationists are no less
diverse and complex: Fewer boats, fewer traps, no dragging.
International agreements on catches. Ending government subsidies
for fishing fleets. Vessel buyback programs.
</P>
<P>
   The primary response from the fishing industry is usually denial
about the damage it does, excuses that they have to keep up with
boats that violate the laws and swift retoolings to exploit the
next possible fish.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the closure of Georges Bank resulted _ only four
years later _ in the devastation of cod in the Gulf of Maine is
evidence how the fishing industry cannot police itself. Where the
National Marine Fisheries Service says the New England fleet of cod
boats should be cut in half, Barbara Stevenson, who owns three
groundfishing boats in Maine, recently told the Associated Press,
``A lot of things are getting a lot better; it's just that at the
moment Gulf of Maine cod is not getting any better.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a United Nations conference on the world's
fisheries in October in Rome. The debate between environmentalists,
the fishing industry, and the world's governments, some of which
have begun to wake up to the need for limits and others which
subsidize the depletion of the oceans, is at an impass unlikely to
be broken by those forces alone.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has to be broken by us, the consumer. That will
require major departures in culture, particularly in New England,
so wedded as we are to lobster, cod, haddock and swordfish. Some
restaurants have made a symbolic stand in recent months by taking
swordfish off their menu. Others play up farm-raised fish.
</P>
<P>
   That is a start, but much more debate about what fish to eat and
when to eat it has to occur before the fishing industry takes any
of this seriously. Judging by the latest news, we are headed to a
future where the only fish left will be the kind one would consider
only if one were shipwrecked and starving on a desolate island.

READING BETTER _ ELECTRONICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just three years ago in this space that former New
Republic editor Michael Kinsley named the breakthrough that would
transform electronic publishing: ``When you get a great computer
screen that you can take to the john with you _ that will be the
triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Kinsley launched the on-line magazine Slate.
Slate has many virtues, but one huge shortcoming: you cannot take
it with you to the john. It is best read on an expensive, powerful
computer, preferably one belonging to your employer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of this year, two Silicon Valley start-ups plan
to launch ``electronic books,'' essentially jazzed-up computer
screens with plenty of memory and a few fancy fillips that seek to
replace paper-and-paste books. I've spent the past two weeks with
Softbook, which will be the first to market and the cheaper ($300)
of the two rivals. It is also the company that returned my call.
</P>
<P>
   Softbook weighs 2.9 pounds. Bound in floppy leather, it has the
heft of a high school yearbook. Do you know how to plug in a phone?
Then you know how to use Softbook.
</P>
<P>
   The screen is easy to read, and works mainly by touch. To fetch
a book from the Electronic Bookstore, you plug in the phone line
and tap a couple of icons. For experimenters like me, the bookstore
_ really a computer in Palo Alto, Calif. _ offers several titles,
including ``Angela's Ashes,'' the ``Iliad,'' and Michael Wolff's
gossipy Internet expose, ``Burn Rate.'' Wolff's book took about two
minutes to download into my Softbook.
</P>
<P>
   (By the end of the year, the company says, thousands of titles
should be available, each costing a few dollars. Once purchased,
books can be downloaded repeatedly.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus began what Softbook CEO Jim Sachs infelicitously calls a
``booklike experience.'' To prolong the Palo Alto patois: Softbook
has lots of functionality. Translation: It can do a lot of things.
You can bookmark or even ``dogear'' pages electronically. By
pressing gently on a plastic toolbar, you advance the page. Using a
small plastic stylus, you can write anywhere on any page, and find
your notes instantly. Where Wolff writes, ``All technology is ...
transitional,'' I note: ``Duh.''
</P>
<P>
   You can highlight passages, and return to them easily, or select
a name or phrase, and flash immediately to each page where it
occurs. In about 60 seconds, I searched all of ``Burn Rate'' for
derogatory information about MIT's new media guru Nick Negroponte.
I am pleased to report that there was none. Just a few weeks ago, I
could have used this feature while reading the Patricia Cornwell
whodunit ``Unnatural Exposure.'' When the psycho-perp was unveiled,
I had to rustle back hundreds of pages to find out who she was.
With Softbook, this takes seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Softbook shuts down automatically when
you fold the plush leather cover over the screen, and, when
reopened, displays the last page you read. The battery, which can
be recharged while reading, lasts for several hours. The screen can
be backlit for reading in the dark. If Softbook sells Stephen King,
this will be the summer camp accessory for 1999!
</P>
<P>
   Problem One: I had trouble reading the Softbook in direct
sunlight. However, I have trouble reading real books in sunlight
too. Problem Two: I'd like Softbook to go on a diet. Yes, I could
read it in bed, but surely technological advances could slim this
gizmo down to the size of, say, the December issue of Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Those quibbles aside, I went in a skeptic, and emerged a
believer. For the immediate future, Softbook's scale of operations
may be limited by whatever deals it strikes, or fails to strike,
with publishers. But imagine if the holdings of your favorite
bookstore, or of the Library of Congress, were just a few touches
away. I've seen the future, and it reads very smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   You can try it out yourself. Starting in November or December,
Softbook will be sold from the company's Web site,
http://softbook.com. Not available in stores!

TERROR FIGURE'S FAMILY HAS BENIGN TIES IN THE UNITED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   AND AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the bin Laden name was associated with international
terror, it stood for wealth, and students at Harvard University
needed to look no further than their guidebooks to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ``generosity of the Binladin family,'' two
graduate fellowships were established at the university in 1992.
Both are devoted to Islamic studies, and both are named after the
prominent Saudi Arabian family, worth about $5 billion. (The name
appears as `Binladin,' one of several spellings, in a Harvard
University website.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was from this dynasty that Osama bin Laden, accused of
funding the bombing of two embassies, arose, inheriting
approximately $250 million before he fled to Sudan. He departed the
family construction empire nearly a decade ago _ taking with him,
US officials believe, the business savvy of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Osama bin Laden threatens to cast a shadow on not only the
Harvard fellowships but also a variety of the connections other
members of the bin Laden family have with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Harvard fellowship, one of bin Laden's
brothers is currently attending Harvard Business School, according
to a report in the London Independent. That brother, who shares the
same father with bin Laden but has a different mother, was
unavailable for comment last night.
</P>
<P>
   In a greater irony, the bin Laden family construction company
has won a $150 million contract to replace Khobar Towers, the US
military residence in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that was destroyed by
a terrorist bomb in June, 1996, killing 19 and injuring another
160. Some US officials believe Osama bin Laden was involved in that
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin beneficiaries have already begun to mount their
defense. Harvard spokesman Alex Huppe differentiated between the
family and the alleged terrorist, saying ``its clear the Saudi bin
Laden money is being put to good use here.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon, Major Joseph LaMarca, pointed to
the near-monopoly of construction contracts the bin Laden family
has won in Saudi Arabia, noting, referring to Osama, ``You can't
say he has any role in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, did people stop buying Hearst newspapers when Patty
Hearst was part of a terrorist organization?'' he said. ``You can't
tie one to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden was officially banned from Saudi Arabia in 1991,
while he was living in Sudan. While one former Central Intelligence
Agency analyst said the family link is now tenuous at best, several
US experts say the he is still in contact with some of his
brothers. Officials believe his siblings may number as high as 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still a family, just like Ted Kaczynski still has
family,'' Kenneth Katzman, a former CIA analyst, said. ``Some of
the brothers are still in active contact with him, just because
he's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, 41, stands accused of masterminding twin explosions
at US embassies in East Africa that killed 257 on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions took place on what, to bin Laden, may appear to
have been a crucial date: the anniversary of the first wave of the
1990 US military operation ``Desert Shield,'' in which thousands of
American troops were deployed to the Persian Gulf to combat Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, bin Laden has accused the United States of invading
his homeland, and it is the Gulf War that has driven the Saudi
exile to threaten a ``black day for America,'' as he did during an
interview with ABC News earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, following the African attacks, as well as further threats
made by a spokesman for bin Laden in the days following the
bombings, intelligence officials have announced their intent to
strike at the heart of his operation: his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But first, they are trying to piece together exactly what, and
where, it is, a task that US analysts describe as far more daunting
than the military strikes last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his financial interests are known: bin Laden poured $50
million into the Al-Shamal Islamic Bank in Khartoum, for example.
He also established Wadi al-Aqiq Company Ltd., a Sudanese
import-export company that markets agricultural products, according
to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are shakier reports: that bin Ladin has played a
major role in providing American manufacturers with gum arabic, a
prized substance used in soft drinks, candy and other products. Or
that he has secreted millions away in a variety of Swiss bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Yossef Bodansky, director of the US House Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, is that ``there is
no bin Laden Incorporated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't exist,'' he said. ``There is not something you
can go to and say, `That belongs to him 100 percent.' He is very
smart and sophisticated. ... He also knows that everyone will go
after him, so he has carefully concealed what he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department believes it has tracked down at least some
of his business dealings, and it credits bin Laden in a 1996 report
with having ``secured a near monopoly over Sudan's major
agricultural exports &UR;  &LR; of gum,'' as well as several other products.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan produces 70 percent to 90 percent of the world's gum
arabic, but Sudanese and American companies deny that bin Laden has
any role in the gum arabic trade.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and general manager of Gum Arabic Co. Ltd., which
holds the monopoly on Sudanese production, sent a letter Tuesday to
US partners saying that the allegation of a bin Laden role in the
company ``is not founded and is completely baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Omer Mubarak, and General Manager M.M. Karama
wrote that bin Ladin is not an investor, trading partner, financier
or beneficiary of the company's activities ``in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, still others argue that bin Laden's vast wealth has
been wildly exaggerated and point to the decision by the Saudi
government to freeze his bank accounts after pulling his
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Barri Atwan, the editor of the London-based Arabic paper al-Quds
al-Arabi, said that when he spoke with bin Laden in 1996, the Saudi
exile said he had also ``invested badly in Sudan,'' greatly
diminishing his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a State Department report, bin Laden's Al-Hijrah
for Construction and Development Ltd. built a massive road between
the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and Port Sudan, a contract that
would normally bring a handsome return. But bin Laden claims he was
never paid for the 1994 project, Atwan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sudanese were supposed to pay him 140 million pounds, but
they never paid,'' Atwan said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzman, the former CIA analyst, described the convoluted
financial web as the ``biggest problem'' investigators have faced
so far.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary pursuit, he said, is in its ``very early infancy.''
He added: ``They're not even off square one.''

MEDIA ARE SHORT-SHEETING THEIR OWN BED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day will surely come when the public will wash its hands of
the news media, when the people who pay our salaries by reading, by
watching, by buying our advertisers' products will purge us from
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The day will come when the paying customers will just plain tune
out the media. They might scream that they're mad as heck and they
aren't gonna take it anymore. Or maybe they'll toss the newspaper
into the trash, shut off the TV news and quietly go about their
business, never giving us so much as another moment's thought.
</P>
<P>
   When it happens, we'll have no one to blame but ourselves. We
can whine about the audience blaming the messengers for bad news,
but the fact is that we too often deliver messages that the
audience doesn't want to hear. The customers are fed up with
scandals that have no bearing on their lives, with news reports
reflecting a point of view that is foreign to their day-to-day
concerns and interests.
</P>
<P>
   How many different ways can the American people say they don't
care about President Clinton's sexual shenanigans before the media
get the point? How many different ways must the public voice its
disgust with sleazy ``gotcha'' journalism before the nation's
journalists realize that it's time to reconsider their priorities?
</P>
<P>
   The sad legacy of the brilliant Watergate reporting of Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein appears to be an obsession with scandal
_ real or imagined. Where no scandal exists, some ambitious news
hound will create one.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-haters who scream for the president's head on a
platter will dispute this, but the Monica Lewinsky scandal owes as
much to the hype and manipulation of the media as it does to the
reckless misconduct of the president and the relentless pursuit of
Clinton by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   According to a detailed account published in the August issue of
Brill's Content magazine, the scandal grew out of a curious
alliance: ex-Lewinsky friend Linda Tripp; book agent and Tripp
confidante Lucianne Goldberg; the independent counsel's office;
lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit
against the president _ and Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal that some say could drive Clinton from the White
House began more or less as a quest for a juicy news story.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the story has run far ahead of the facts.
The traditional purpose of a news story is to report what has
happened; this story is a prophecy clamoring for self-fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the media would report some facts, and if the
public found the facts to be sufficiently outrageous, a scandal
would ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Now the media declare that a scandal exists, with or without
facts to support it, and for all practical purposes command the
public to be indignant.
</P>
<P>
   The process has been turned upside down. No one is safe from it.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, baseball star Mark McGwire was enjoying
unamimous acclaim and universal admiration as he pursued the record
for most home runs in a season. Then a reporter decided to invent a
scandal by revealing that the once injury-prone McGwire uses a
dietary supplement to bolster his strength and durability.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the supplement is perfectly legal; that experts
say there is no evidence that it artificially enhances athletic
performance; that major-league baseball has no rules against its
use; that McGwire's fitness-trainer brother recommended the
supplement as part of an overall fitness program.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason in the world to report the information
except to create controversy. And once the story broke, the media
latched onto it as if they'd caught McGwire romancing Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   So now, through no fault of McGwire's, the media are doing their
best to deflate the excitement and enjoyment of baseball fans as
they root for McGwire to break the home-run record. Carve another
notch on the media's ``gotcha'' club.
</P>
<P>
   And mark the calendar as well. The media are one day closer to
the day when the customers decide to purge us from their lives.

CLERGY CLICK WITH CYBERWORSHIPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was a gut-wrenching story, the kind of tale the Rev.
Douglas Showalter usually hears in the privacy of his office
underneath the white steeple of the First Congregational Church in
Falmouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman's tale, of the beatings her son had suffered at
the hands of her sister _ who was now dying _ was posted on an
Internet message board that anyone with a computer and a modem
could read. And the woman was identified only as Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the medium, a far cry from the way most clergy conduct
pastoral counseling, Showalter gave Teresa the same kind of
encouragement and advice that he does in person. But his
interaction with her is a telling example of how the Internet and
the World Wide Web are revolutionizing the world of religion and
making cyberspace the new spiritual frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you still want to talk to people one-on-one and
provide that human touch that can be really necessary in times of
crisis,'' said Showalter, who created the forgiveness message board
that included Teresa's story. ``But you can't ignore the reality of
the Internet as a place where people are turning to for religious
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   From on-line pastoral counseling to Bible studies to prayer
requests, the Internet has become a powerful tool for
denominations, missionary societies, congregations, and other
religious organizations seeking to tap into America's rising
spiritual yearning.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Web provides an anonymous, safe, and fast way to
find a spiritual home. At the same time, it has helped many
churches and ministriesreach people in their 20s who may be
uninterested in walking into their neighborhood church but are very
keen on _ and skilled at _ surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of religion on the Internet goes beyond
publishing weekly church services. What strikes many scholars is
that many denominations are using the Internet to communicate with
and attract spiritual seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the dawn of this new technology, Christians have been
painfully absent and we're trying to change that,'' said Dave
Spalding, the president of Merrimack Valley Access Network in
Haverhill, Mass., who has created Web sites for churches and
Christian ministries in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Type the word ``God'' into Alta Vista, an Internet search
engine, and more than 10 million entries pop up. At one popular
Jewish Web site (www.shamash.org), visitors can discuss the Torah,
Jewish feminism, or what it's like to be a gay Jew.
</P>
<P>
   For a church, said software engineer Jeffrey Lomicka, ``the
Internet can provide a nonthreatening way to introduce yourself to
the public.'' Lomicka designed the Web site for Acton Christian
Community Church, where people can listen to the pastor's Sunday
sermons on line. ``It can be a lot more threatening to invite
someone to a church in person,'' he said, ``than to just have them
surf the Web and listen to the sermons and get a sense of what our
church stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the church's 80 or so members found the church the
old-fashioned way _ through the Yellow Pages _ Lomicka said a
couple of recent members came to the church after finding it on the
Internet. In fact, the pastor, the Rev. Eric Robinson, sent his
resume to the church over the Internet after his wife found the
Acton congregation on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religious groups are finding that if you're really
serious about evangelizing and preaching the gospel and bringing
the word of God to people, then you probably have to have a
presence on the Internet,'' said Quentin Schultze, professor of
communications at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., and
executive editor of the Internet for Christians Newsletter, a
biweekly on-line publication (www.gospelcom.net/ifc) with about
100,000 subscribers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Henderson, a Presbyterian minister based in New
Rochelle, N.Y., has created a site called the First Church of
Cyberspace (http://christianity.miningco.com/) complete with
sermons, scripture readings, and choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though there are many congregations, denominations, and other
religious groups that advertise their presence on the Web, we are
the first to organize within cyberspace itself,'' the church's Web
site claims. ``Making connections, constructing links, dropping
clues that point to the presence of the Creator within the creative
chaos of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultze said the Internet also has given religious dissidents a
louder voice and greater clout.
</P>
<P>
   In the Greek Orthodox Church, for example, people angry at
church leadership created a massive Web site last year
(www.voithia.org) filled with articles, e-mail, and reports that
have helped mobilize a widespread grass-roots campaign to reform
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has allowed many more folks in the pews to have a
say in what goes in their denomination,'' Schultze said. ``It can
create a much more democratic forum.''
</P>
<P>
   For some pastors, the Internet has eased the ever-challenging
task of preparing a Sunday sermon. A few taps on the computer
keyboard and they can access dozens of Web sites that include
various versions of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can type in a word or phrases like `love,' `Jesus,' or
`adultery' and immediately get back responses from the 10 or so
versions of the Bible,'' said Steve Wike, president and publisher
of Media Management, a Roanoke, Va., form that runs a Christian Web
site (www.goshen.net). The site contains a directory of 15,000
Christian-related groups. Wike said the Bible section is the most
popular link on the site, attracting pastors, Sunday school
teachers, and Bible group leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular religious sites on the Internet are
chat rooms and message boards that allow people to discuss and
debate faith issues. Indeed, the Internethas helped tear down walls
by offering ecumenical chat rooms where Christians, Jews, and
Muslims can wrestle with thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are opening up to each other's theological positions in
a way that may not be as easy if you put them all in the same room
_ that is, if you can get to be in the same room,'' Wike said.
</P>
<P>
   Some denominations, particularly evangelical Christians and
Muslims, are using the Web to gain converts. Ron Hutchcraft
Ministries, for example, a Christian group based in New Jersey,
claims to have attracted 500 new born-again Christians since
January.
</P>
<P>
   At Hutchcraft's site (www.gospelcom.net/rhm), you can accept
Jesus as your personal savior simply by clicking a sequence of
screens explaining biblical passages. ``Your Creator is the end of
the search for answers,'' the site promises.

   ABCs: Marjoram is a tender perennial native to North Africa and
Southwest Asia, cultivated in North America. Its velvety,
light-green leaves have a flavor similar to that of oregano. It
grows 1 to 2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions: Loose, well-drained soil; full sun; plenty
of water. Plant from transplants after last frost.
</P>
<P>
   Food pairings: Meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, stews, cheese
spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Caveats: Treat white flies, aphids and spider mites with
insecticidal soap.
</P>
<P>
   BAKED VEGETABLE MEDLEY
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size eggplant
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-size red onions, peeled, halved and cut into thin rings
</P>
<P>
   2 large garlic cloves, peeled, crushed and minced
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds potatoes (about 5 medium-large), washed, peeled and cut
into 1/4-inch rounds
</P>
<P>
   2 large zucchini (about 1 pound each), washed, trimmed and cut
into 1/4-inch rounds
</P>
<P>
   2 large green bell peppers, washed, trimmed, seeded and cut into
1/4-inch rings
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh marjoram
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups peeled, chopped plum tomatoes (1 small can)
</P>
<P>
   Trim stem and bottom off eggplant. Cut in half lengthwise and
then into crescent-shaped slices about 1/4 inch thick. Place
eggplant in a colander and sprinkle each layer generously with
salt. Place a weight (such as a pot lid) over eggplant and let it
drain for 1 hour. Rinse and drain well, squeezing gently to remove
excess liquid, and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over
medium heat and saute onions and garlic until wilted and clear,
about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil a large, deep
earthenware baking dish. Spread one third of onions and garlic on
bottom. Place half the potato slices, zucchini slices, eggplant
slices and pepper rings in one overlapping layer on top of onions.
Season with salt, pepper and marjoram. Spread another third of the
onions over first layer and top with half the tomatoes. Drizzle 1/4
cup of olive oil over tomatoes. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Cover baking dish loosely with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour
and 15 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender. Remove and cool
slightly before serving.

   PORK TENDERLOIN MEDALLIONS WITH FRESH MARJORAM
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   3/4 to 1 pound pork tenderloin, butterflied and lightly pounded
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size sweet red bell pepper, roasted, peeled and cut
into strips 3 or 4 inches long by 3/8-inch wide
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon whole fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram
</P>
<P>
   6 tender sprigs fresh marjoram, each about 6 inches long
</P>
<P>
   2 generous tablespoons toasted pine nuts (Toast in a pie pan in
a 325-degree oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about
5 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Paprika to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons sweet red vermouth
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper and rub with minced garlic.
Arrange the roasted pepper strips vertically to cover the meat and
sprinkle with fennel seeds and chopped marjoram. Lay the fresh
marjoram sprigs vertically, then tightly roll up meat from end to
end; place seam-side down in a baking dish. Rub olive oil into
meat; sprinkle generously with sweet paprika and rub it into meat.
Sprinkle with more salt and pepper if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Place in a preheated 450-degree oven for approximately 6 to 8
minutes. Remove from oven and reduce temperature to 300 degrees.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons sweet vermouth over meat and return
immediately to oven. Cook approximately 30 minutes, basting with
remaining vermouth the last 5 minutes. Do not overcook; red peppers
may stain the meat somewhat pink, so do not mistake stain for
uncooked pork.

EAT, READ, BE MERRY: NEW FOOD MAGAZINES ARE WORTH SAMPLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. DOWD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If anyone wonders what is one of the
fastest-growing segments in the publishing industry, take a look at
your local newsstands. Forget the teen-scene, computer and travel
magazines. Zero in on those dealing with food and drink in their
myriad forms.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the many ``health'' magazines pushing one form of diet or
another, we find more and more titles dealing with herbs, tea, beer
and the various ethnic cuisines. Sorting through the offerings to
find those that are worthwhile becomes quite a chore.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Culinary Trends, published quarterly by Culinary Publication
Inc., 6285 East Spring St., Long Beach, Calif. 90808. Cover price:
$5.95.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp color photography, lots of recipes, a lengthy list of
which chefs are moving to which jobs across the nation, a culinary
calendar and timely stories, such as one on seafood safety.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much this California publication lacks, and its
editors obviously strive to make it more than just another pretty
West Coast face.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most readable story in the current issue is ``The
South Florida Chef,'' a detailed look at a particularly innovative
regional cuisine and its practitioners. But the magazine also takes
us to Berlin, the Perigord region of France, a Caribbean cooking
competition in Puerto Rico, and behind the scenes at the new
International Institute of Culinary Arts in Fall River, Mass. This
title is a bargain, and definitely for the serious foodie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simply Seafood, published quarterly by Waterfront Press Co.,
5305 Shilshole Ave. NW, Seattle, Wash. 98107. Cover price: $2.95.
</P>
<P>
   If getting recipes from the top prize-winners in the magazine's
``Seafood Chef the Year Awards'' doesn't intrigue you enough to
plunk down a mere $2.95, how about an article entitled ``Rocky
Mountain Seafood''?

   This English import gives the lie to the stereotype about
British food being on a par with the U.K. dental plan. It calls
itself ``The world's most beautiful food magazine.'' I can't agree
(Saveur tops it, for example), but it certainly is chock full of
lavish photographs from thumbnail size to two-page spreads.
</P>
<P>
   But pictures can take you just so far. What about content?
Despite a side trip to Bermuda, Food Illustrated is, for the most
part, by, for and about U.K. people, cooking and products.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, there is plenty to read and contemplate here _ no
one-topic emphasis, but instead lots of smartly-chosen topics. In
this issue: what to eat this month, mini book reviews, a look at
``Mexican New Wave'' cooking, the joys of fresh buffalo mozzarella
and the start of a series on great chefs (this installment looks at
signature recipes of the greats and the ethics of ``borrowing''
recipes).

<P>
   This is a regional food magazine for the Hudson Valley _ or,

</P>
<P>
   The new quarterly, based in Middletown, has released its
inaugural issue as a complimentary project. A good idea for a first
issue, but if editor Jerry Novesky can maintain the quality of the
first issue, its $3.50 cover price won't be out of line.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-page publication has a color cover and black-and-white
inside pages. It contains a variety of stories on food and wine,
with such bylines as culinary historian Peter Rose and wine expert
Stephen Kolpan of the Culinary Institute of America.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Janet Crawshaw says the new publication is meant to
help publicize the Hudson Valley as a culinary destination.
However, it tends to ignore the northern part of the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring it, the new publication looks a bit too parochial
and bypasses a fair amount of the food scene.

FINE-TUNING MEDICINE: HEALERS TAKE NOTE OF WHAT AILS MUSICIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Pull a hamstring or groin muscle and sports
medicine specialists know what to do. But what about the
debilitating pain associated with clarinet wrist, trombone elbow or
fiddler's neck?
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Center for Music and Medicine isn't a household name,
but soon this new collaborative effort between the University of
North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth and University of
North Texas in Denton could be a major national center for research
and treatment in the budding field of performing arts medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Rubin, who is director of the rheumatology
department at the health science center, and Kris Chesky, a
professor of music at UNT, said advances in research, treatment and
prevention of performing arts pain may soon filter to middle and
high schools to stem the pain, psychological problems and the
ensuing drug and alcohol abuse common among musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Violinists complain of elbow problems, guitarists can develop
shoulder and wrist pain, and many pianists report something akin to
carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as pain in their necks and lower
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use the model of sports medicine,'' Rubin said. ``We
now have people who specialize and they understand the problems
that athletes get and we are better at taking care of these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said professional musicians are generally underserved by
medical professionals because there hasn't been enough research
into medical problems particular to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many musicians play six or more hours a day,'' Rubin said.
``You get pain in the neck, arms, shoulders, fingers. Who do you go
to for help? Many physicians don't know about the specifics of
playing an instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Chesky said their program emphasizes research and
prevention. There are clinics that deal with pain after it
develops, but none that takes such a fully developed and holistic
approach, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That includes developing different techniques for playing
instruments, and perhaps alterations in the instruments themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The research goes beyond ]isolated pain into the use of drugs
and alcohol that develops among some performers, perhaps to
mitigate the pain or the depression from not being able to pursue
one's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know first hand that musicians have a difficult time with
many issues,'' said Chesky, who has played trumpet for more than 20
years. ``The physical demands of playing night after night, also
the social difficulties, working in environment with alcohol and
drug abuse, working late at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Chesky said research has primarily focused on the problems of
classical musicians. He said that with the 1,400 music students at
UNT, ``we have the full range of musician types here to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said: ``What we would like to be is a clearinghouse for
musicians, voice problems in singers, leg problems in dancers,
alcoholism, stage fright, the psychological problems of artists and
hearing problems. And we have a unique situation here. We have a
medical school and a huge music school at UNT, the second-largest
music school in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Fort Worth a major medical center, Rubin said, but
it is also home to a vibrant arts community, a symphony orchestra,
an opera and ballet company, the new Bass Performance Hall, and
music schools at Texas Christian University, the University of
Texas at Arlington and Texas Wesleyan University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere else,'' Chesky said, ``is there a medical school/music
school marriage where the clinical is closely tied to the research,
which is closely tied to the education of musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to educate people about medical problems of musicians
and we want to educate the music teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   A questionnaire developed by Chesky and available on the
Internet _ www.scs.unt.edu/surveys/msurvey/index.html _ has
attracted wide interest, with responses from more than 4,000
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the financial support of both universities has been
supplemented by grants from the National Academy of Recording Art
and Sciences. The National Endowment for the Arts has also
expressed interest in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Chesky said they are eager for input from other health
professionals along with calls from foundations interested in
helping fund their research.

JURY LEADER IN PEPPER SPRAY CASE SAYS POLICE ACTION WAS EXCESSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The forewoman of a deadlocked jury considering a
lawsuit against sheriff's deputies who smeared pepper spray around
the eyes of protesters said the police action was disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't sit down in a nonviolent way and protest on
behalf of your beliefs without being subjected to the police
swabbing your eyes with pepper spray or some other chemical agents
... I think that's sort of going back to the days of the cattle
prod and the fire hose,'' the forewoman, Pat Schimke, said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of six men and two women reached a 4-4 impasse Tuesday
in deciding whether Humboldt County deputies were guilty of using
excessive force against environmental protesters. U.S. District
Judge Vaughn Walker declared a mistrial and set Nov. 16 for
retrial.
</P>
<P>
   No other police department has been known to condone the wiping
of pepper spray liquid on non-violent people. A videotape of the
swabbings _ showing the demonstrators writhing and screaming in
agony _ was televised last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harris, a lawyer for the nine young environmental activists
who brought the civil rights lawsuit, called it a test of whether
police officers around the country may similarly use the spray. The
case, he said, ``will set limits on what we as a society will
accept from our law enforcement agencies in terms of their use of
force against political protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Delaney, a lawyer for the sheriff's department in the
Northern California county, said the jury's failure to unanimously
find by a preponderance of the evidence that the deputies used
excessive force ``certainly shows that it is not an abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the deputies acted properly and used the spray to avoid
other injuries while countering the passive but increasingly
resilient methods of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stemmed from three separate pepper spray episodes
during protests last fall against the logging of redwoods in and
around the Headwaters Forest on California's North Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Most were first-time protesters who were using metal devices _
called lock boxes _ to attach themselves to one another and their
demonstration sites. Several were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper spray is incapacitating, causing those who come into
contact with it severe pain and symptoms that range from coughing,
twitching eyes, temporary loss of upper body control,
disorientation and anxiety, said Macon Cowles, the plaintiffs' lead
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Schimke said the four jurors who saw the dabbing as excessive
believed the deputies could have used less painful methods to
remove the protesters, including waiting them out, talking to them
or cutting through metal sleeves they were using to make their
removal difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But others believed the deputies did just fine. ``Some made the
argument that police need to use anything in their toolbox that was
necessary,'' said the forewoman, who was among those who found the
force was excessive and the only juror to comment on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a philosophical difference,'' said Schimke, a
retired medical technician from the Children's Hospital in Oakland.

<P>
   A SHORT HISTORY OF CAESAR SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The widely accepted Caesar salad creation story is the one that
says an Italian chef named Caesar Cardini made the salad with a few
things he had on hand in his Tijuana restaurant in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Food Lover's Companion'' (Barron's, $12.95),
the classic Caesar is torn romaine lettuce tossed in a dressing of
Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, coddled egg, oil and anchovies,
along with grated Parmesan and croutons.
</P>
<P>
   But few restaurants today actually make a salad similar to the
classic _ and when's the last time you saw one made tableside?
Today's Caesar dressings are more often than not a creamy variety,
which doesn't seem to be what Cardini had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   At least two factors can be credited for what a purist would
call the Caesar's moral decay. First there was the salmonella
scare; a raw egg is often used in the classic dressing. Some chefs
answer that problem by using pasteurized eggs, which have been
briefly heated to kill bacteria. Other chefs believe that enough
lemon juice in the dressing will ``cook'' the egg with natural
acid.
</P>
<P>
   The faux Caesar offensive could also be blamed on anchovies.
They're not necessarily cheap, so chefs may well have decided to do
without _ and how many diners whose preferences run to Chili's and
T.G.I. Friday's would object, anyway?

CAESAR THE DAY WITH THESE AWARD-WINNING SALADS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The more established chefs in the competition topped
their Caesar salads with wood-roasted salmon and flatbread shards,
or sided them with tuna tartare in crisp won ton baskets.
</P>
<P>
   It was newcomer James Neel, however, who won the annual Great
Caesar Salad competition with a simple, traditional recipe, mixed
the old-fashioned way in a wooden bowl with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Neel, the kitchen chief at the white-hot new Al Biernat's
restaurant in Dallas, was one of seven noted area chefs invited to
the competition last Sunday at Dallas' Fairmont Hotel, sponsored by
the American Institute of Wine &AMP; Food.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chefs _ such as Grady Spears of Fort Worth's Reata _
had competed before, but this was Neel's first try. ``The chefs
have always been so enthusiastic in wanting to do more than just
the salad, and they're always trying to outdo each other,'' says
Paula Lambert of Dallas Mozzarella Co., who founded the event seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Neel served his salad with triangular sesame-Parmesan flatbread
crisps and a very spicy crab cake _ about the size of an Oreo
cookie _ on the side. Simple and smart, the salad held just the
right balance of garlic, lemon and anchovy flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Neel's competitors were doing extraordinary things
with their salad accouterments. Chris Huff of Dallas' Palomino
topped his salad with wood oven-roasted salmon and shrimp, then
piled salad and seafood into a lavosh (crisp flatbread) tower.
</P>
<P>
   Clark McDaniel, executive chef at Angeluna in Fort Worth,
decorated his salad with fried anchovies and big sheets of fresh
Parmesan. Always the Asian cuisine enthusiast, McDaniel used sambal
(an Indonesian condiment), tamarind puree and fish sauce in his
Caesar dressing, and offered side servings of tuna tartare in
crispy baskets of paper-thin fried won tons.
</P>
<P>
   Englishman Nick Barclay, owner-chef at the Dallas restaurant
bearing his name, went with an English theme, with a dressing
including English mustard and croutons made from English
walnut-herb bread.
</P>
<P>
   Lines were longest at the Reata table, where Spears and several
helpers piled salad on plates, then crowned them with jumbo beef
tenderloin tamales. Reata's Reggie Parks, who recently left Star
Canyon in Dallas to join Spears, spent parts of three days stuffing
and tying the 500 tamales.
</P>
<P>
   After the lines dwindled and the ballots were cast, last year's
winner _ Jim Severson of Sevy's in Dallas _ took the podium. The
envelope was opened, and Neel's name was announced. He was awarded,
appropriately, a head of romaine lettuce.

   FIGHTING-TERRORISM (Washington) _ The United States must
increase its reward for the capture of Osama bin Laden, accused of
masterminding the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa, says an

<P>
   INDIA-ROY (New Delhi) _ With their pride still measured in
megatons, and a strut still in their step after showing they can
explode nuclear bombs with the best of them, most of India's elite
did not want one of their own telling them, ``The air is thick with
ugliness and there's an unmistakable stench of fascism in the
air.'' This assessment came from Arundhati Roy, who ascended into
international literary stardom last year with her first novel,
``The God of Small Things'' (Random House), In a haunting
8,000-word essay by Ms. Roy, ``The End of Imagination.'' Deeply
personal, poetically penned, unsparingly harsh, it lambastes the
nation's main political parties and calls the bomb a ``final act of
betrayal by a ruling class that has failed its people.'' By Barry
Bearak.

WINNING IS LOSING MONEY IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Providence Health Plan sent a shudder through the
market last week by walking away from Medicaid and the state's
Basic Health Plan. It had bid to offer the insurance in 1999, but
when it found that the new, higher rates for its services would be
among the lowest _ and hence most popular _ in the market, it cut
and ran. Its 70,000 members, mostly low- to lower-middle income,
will have to switch to other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect does not fill those other carriers with enthusiasm.
``We don't have any expectations to make any kind of profit in this
business,'' says Ed Freutel, vice-president at Regence Blue Shield,
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Losses have not been equally spread among the government plans.
Regence is near break-even on Medicaid. It lost $13.3 million last
year on the Basic Health Plan, most of it in the unsubsidized pool,
which serves customers with incomes double the poverty line and
above.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, Regence raised rates 30 percent in the subsidized pool
and 130 percent in the unsubsidized pool. Suddenly it was the most
expensive in the market. Since December, its Basic Health Plan
membership has plunged from 50,000 to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Regence customers fled to NYLCare, which has the
lowest unsubsidized Basic Health Plan rates. NYLCare now has 43
percent of the business statewide, to the grief of its owners. Next
year it will raise rates in that pool by 120 percent, passing on
the Old Maid to someone else _ judging from the rate table, QualMed
and Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   David Ford, president of NYLCare Health Plans Northwest, says
that it's huge claims for prescription drugs. That tells him people
in this pool are suffering from serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Basic Health Plan's administrator, Gary Christenson, says
it's also maternity claims. In a normal health plan, 15 to 20
percent of hospital admissions are for maternity. In the
unsubsidized Basic Health Plan, 64.6 percent of hospital admissions
are for maternity.
</P>
<P>
   Another statistic: In 1996, 13.7 percent of people in Washington
had no medical coverage. But less than 3.6 percent of the mothers
bearing children had no coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Where did they get it? Quips insurance broker Brian McCulloch,
``The Baby Pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's happened. In the past four years, the state of
Washington, in a rush of progressivism, has decreed that no
insurers may deny policies to any person who applies. Health exams
are forbidden. Everybody, from athletes to AIDS patients, pays
standard rates. If the individual had insurance before, the new
insurer must provide coverage immediately; otherwise in 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   In employee groups the rules have long been similar. But in a
group, you have little or no power to ``game'' the system. The
carriers have to take you, and you have to take them. But as an
individual, you can shop around for whatever coverage you think you
might need _ and they have to take you.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers quickly figured that whoever had the richest plan would
be a dead duck. They cut benefits, and reduced their offerings from
4 percent homogenized to skim milk.
</P>
<P>
   And that left Washington state holding an ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   Are you sick? Really sick? Buy into the Basic Health Plan. It
has no deductibles and no million-dollar cap on lifetime benefits.
It has full coverage for addiction treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Are you pregnant? Buy into the Basic Health Plan. In the
individual market, no carrier is required to cover maternity, but
if it does, it must provide coverage immediately. For those
carriers, that's about $10,000 each. All the carriers except Group
Health have eliminated maternity coverage on individual policies.
But the Basic Health Plan offers it.
</P>
<P>
   The Basic Health Plan is, in today's market, not a basic plan at
all. ``Unfortunately, the unsubsidized plan is becoming the state's
high-risk pool,'' said Dennis Braddock, chief executive of
Community Health Plans of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? That depends on whether you think medical
insurance should be offered in a market, with lots of variety, or
as a benefit, with every plan up to a high standard.
</P>
<P>
   To those in the second camp, like Insurance Commissioner Deborah
Senn, the problem is that health-care mandates signed by Gov. Mike
Lowry in 1993 were partly repealed by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Senn's deputy, Robert Harkins, says the system ``doesn't offer
benefits on an equitable basis and spread that risk throughout the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance carriers take the opposite tack: It mandates too
many benefits, and interferes too much in the judgment and pricing
of risk. The
</P>
<P>
   carriers' hands are tied, and their customers can ``game the
system.''

STYLE IS THE SECRET TO GOOD COMMUNICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talk may be cheap, but communication is no
bargain. Ask the supervisor of any dolt who can't follow ``simple''
instructions. Or the underlings of a dictatorial boss. Or anyone
who has ever been divorced.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Eric Douglas is concerned, good communication is a
matter of style. The author of the recently published ``Straight
Talk'' believes that people will do better in work and in life if
they understand not only their own communication style, but the
styles of associates.
</P>
<P>
   He says being a good communicator isn't the same as being
articulate. People who are articulate make their points well, but
might not be good listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the smart person's trap,'' he said in an interview. ``I
see everything clearly, so you can't teach me. A conversation often
becomes a matter of defending conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, president of Leading Resources Inc. in Sacramento and
senior associate with San Francisco media consultant BMR
Associates, uses the book to outline what he sees as the four basic
communication styles:
</P>
<P>
   _ Directors: People who are always on the move, quick to make
decisions and assign tasks. They like to set goals and get things
done, but don't have much time for small talk. Think of Orson
Welles' character in ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Expressers: People who like to talk, using gestures and
animated expressions to make their points. They're creative and
willing to take chances, and do a lot of thinking out loud. Think
of David Letterman or Carol Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thinkers: People who like to solve problems and have a strong
sense of detail. They make lists and ask lots of questions. Think
of Jeff Goldblum's character in ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Harmonizers: People who speak warmly to others, who are steady
and dependable rather than decisive or daring. Others turn to them
in times of trouble. Think of Ingrid Bergman's character in
``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   The book then breaks each style into four smaller groups,
depending on secondary styles, for a total of 16 communication
styles. Someone who is primarily a Director and secondarily an
Expresser, for example, is called an Initiator.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy the book, you can find your style and its
traits and suggestions for free through a quiz on Douglas' Web site
at www.straight-talk-now.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Douglas recalls the time he taught 12 MBA students,
telling them that being conscious of their styles' strengths and
weaknesses could make them better managers. He compared it with
math students who give a wrong answer, then learn from it for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   One student said he didn't understand, and that Douglas was
asking him to change his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him his style,'' Douglas writes.
</P>
<P>
   ```Initiator,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ```What do you remember about Initiators?'
</P>
<P>
   ```They leap to conclusions before they've gathered all the
data,' he said. `They need to be more open to understanding other
points of view.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he paused.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh, I think I get it now.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Douglas said ``Straight Talk'' is far
different from the widely known Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which
helps people identify themselves as one of 16 personality types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication styles are not innate,'' he said. ``We choose
them and can choose when to change them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the most effective groups have people with a wide range
of styles. ``If a workgroup has too many Directors or Thinkers _ or
whatever you choose _ the culture of the organization is going to
be the culture of that group.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas also said that although Directors like to take charge,
that might not be in the best interests of the company. ``The most
successful managers I've seen are not Directors. They tend to
combine all four styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies with too many people of one type can run into trouble.
Douglas said that having too many Directors at the same level, for
example, can lead to conflicts because they all want to be in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinkers are going to love calling a problem-solving meeting,
even when that isn't called for,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said understanding other people's styles helps you choose the
most effective way to communicate with them, and sometimes you can
explain how their actions are hurting a group without making it
seem like a personal attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're taking an objective piece of data _ their communication
style _ and showing how it might not be appropriate for the whole
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said that when one person is the stumbling block at a
meeting _ or is not participating _ others need to ask themselves
whether that person's style is actually helping everyone else by
making sure they don't overlook something crucial, or if the person
is simply being a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When people cause problems, ``Somebody needs to ask them what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said that question will often either lead the people to
acknowledge that they're the roadblock or explain why they think
there's a problem with the group or the meeting. Sometimes people
get put off for legitimate reasons, he said, such as if the
meetings are filled with too much conflict or have turned into a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, Douglas said, it's more effective to ask others
in the meeting how the dissenter is slowing them down. That, too,
can help the meeting run more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Another common stumbling block is when people make assumptions
based on inconclusive data, Douglas said. One effective way to get
a meeting back on course, he added, is to make sure people spell
out what data they're using and make sure everyone agrees it is
valid.
</P>
<P>
   If someone disagrees with you and your powers of persuasion
aren't working, Douglas suggests steering the conversation to one
question: ``What kind of information would you have to have to
change your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   If you can come up with that information, you won't just be
talking; you'll be communicating.

that it would no longer intervene in propping up the country's

opening of trading on the currency markets, the ruble fell five
percent -- after a 10-percent slide on Tuesday. Officials halted
trading after the first hour, and later said they would invalidate
all transactions that had happened on Wednesday. In further
evidence of falling confidence in the deteriorating economy, the
run on the banks has begun with hundreds of Russians standing
outside banks demanding money. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ The search for U.S. dollars is
reaching a fever pitch during the current economic crisis in
Russia. A drastic change in the situation either Monday or Tuesday
for the better not withstanding, the dollar supply has dried up and
Russians and expatriates are unable to lay their hands on
greenbacks. American Express Corp., a major money-changer here, is
holding up wire transfers from the States. It has been almost
impossible since Monday, Aug. 17, for Visa and American Express
card-holders to get cash from ATMs here. One woman said she was
preparing to cash dollars for rubles and was accosted outside a
currency-exchange booth by Russians begging to buy her $20 bill.
And then there's me, the absolute wolf of Wall Street, who shrewdly
exchanged $1,000 for rubles at the 6.2 rate on Monday, literally
minutes before the government announced its devaluation. Go figure.

BEVERLY HILLS COMEDY IS SERIOUS ABOUT POVERTY, GENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tamara Jenkins' new movie, ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' is
sneaky. Disguised as a comedy, the film tackles such weighty
subjects as the sexual objectification of women and the effects of
class consciousness on a decidedly downwardly mobile family.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God none of that is evident in the advance publicity or
people would likely stay away from this movie in droves, which
would be a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' said Jenkins, sitting in a conference room
at San Francisco's Hotel Monaco, fumbling with a cigarette and
waving her unruly black curls from her face. ``The European press
really picked up on the class angle, the way the movie tried to
deal with the issue of poverty in America through humor, how the
characters handle their place in society _ Europeans eat that stuff
up.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Jenkins laughs. She is very serious about ``Slums,''
which she both wrote and directed. It's her first effort for a
major studio and she clearly has a lot riding on its success. But
it's not like she's going to get all worried and stop having a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   She even jokes about how audiences will react to the film's
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Manhattan, they can be just brutal,'' says Jenkins, a
transplanted Easterner. ``They'll sit there and yell `Stink bomb!'
and less refined comments. The thought of my little trailer being
put out there all alone is a bit frightening _ though I've heard
people are laughing. In the right places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums'' is set in 1976, and concerns a 15-year-old girl
struggling to understand the peculiarities of her nomadic family
while at the same time coming to terms with her physical
maturation, expressed in the form of the large breasts she has
grown seemingly overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Either story line would make an interesting film. When presented
together, there is enough post-viewing conversation fodder to fuel
a marathon gabfest.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that one of the difficulties in making the film was
explaining to some of the men in the production team that sprouting
large breasts is not necessarily a wonderful thing for a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys would be incredulous, like `Don't they like having
breasts? We loved it when the girls got breasts. We'd line up to
dance with them and rub our elbows against their breasts.' I had to
say, `Well, did you ever stop to think what that might have been
like from the girls' point of view?' After awhile, they got the
message,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums'' stars Natasha Lyonne as the 15-year-old, growing up in
an all-male household where her father and her two brothers felt
within their rights to comment on her chest size.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an adolescent, if you wake up and have breasts, the world
starts treating you differently. A lot of this has to do with the
history of objectification of women and a lot of it has to do with
the preconceptions people _ men _ have about women with large
breasts; that they are highly sexed or want to call attention to
themselves,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And young women have to contend with all of this in a public
way, relatives saying, `My, you've really filled out,' and those
are among the kinder things. You never see people say to boys, `My,
your balls are sure getting bigger.' It's like your body becomes
sexualized way before you are emotionally able to deal with it.
You're not necessarily prepared to be treated as a sexual object.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne had to use stunt breasts for the film, a set of falsies
to fill out her comparatively modest natural assets.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that she hopes the female perspective of the film
doesn't limit her potential audience. Having the film labeled as a
``women's film'' gives her the shivers.
</P>
<P>
   The class issues in the movie should help make the appeal more
universal. The movie brood's father, played by Alan Arkin, is
determined to keep his children within the Beverly Hills city
limits to provide them access to a superior school system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their glitzy area code, however, the family lives on the
fringe, staying in one dilapidated apartment after another, often
skipping out on the rent with midnight excursions. Such contrast
makes the children acutely aware of their station in life,
something Jenkins plucked directly from her own upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part came straight from my life,'' she says. ``We lived
in Beverly Hills, but we were poor. We were surrounded by wealth.
And outsiders, particularly in adolescence, can become obsessed
with fitting in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one sequence, after moving to a nicer apartment with the
financial help of a relative, the children try to analyze whether
they have, in fact, now become part of the bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed having these kids discuss their place in the world
using Marxist terminology in such a quintessentially American
city,'' Jenkins said, allowing herself a dose of pride at her
efforts. ``They so much want to just blend in, to be as close to
`normal' as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jenkins hopes the audience won't be limited to women, she
also hopes that the women who see the film will connect with the
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely told from a female perspective, and I think
women will be pleased to see their point of view on the screen,''
she said. ``I think if there were more women in the film industry,
it might not be so out of the ordinary, but for the time being,
there aren't that many movies being made by women with women in
mind. At least, not yet.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains

heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

 &HT;    
 By GRIGORY YAVLINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years ago, the so-called reformers running Russia concluded
that three things were essential for economic growth: a stable
exchange rate, low inflation and the re-election of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    The challenge was to achieve each as quickly as possible, after
which the economic transformation would be largely secured.
 &HT;    But it was a trap. Financial stabilization was achieved, but not
economic growth. And with the re-election of the president, in a
notoriously unfair process, a kind of political stabilization was
achieved, but not political reform. Aid was given by the West, but
not in a determined manner that would encourage change.
 &HT;    The result is more costly by the day. Economic stagnation is one
reason. Russia's gross domestic product is half the level it was 10
years ago under communism. Another is that the so-called ``shock
reforms'' _ particularly the ill-fated voucher privatization _ only
drove the economy to barter. Up to 75 percent of the entire
economic turnover runs on barter, promissory notes and other money
surrogates.
 &HT;    In such a duty-free economy, the main problem is not the failure
to collect taxes, but the absence of an economy from which taxes
could be drawn. The government has covered its deficits with
foreign and domestic loans at exceedingly high interest rates.
 &HT;    Now the government cannot pay its bills, its staggering debts or
even its interest payments. It is being forced back to devaluation,
inflation and the same financial instability as before. The only
option offered is more debt _ $22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Japan, to add to the $5.5 billion
already borrowed.
 &HT;    This time, there is likely to be more political instability. For
six years, people have been patient. They have lived without jobs
and without money, waiting for the results of the reforms because
they understood that they were necessary. They are broke, and if
prices begin to skyrocket, they could take to the streets.
 &HT;    It is already starting. People are calling for Yeltsin's
resignation _ not only coal miners and communists, but politicians,
businessmen and other elites, as well as students and people
throughout the regions. It is like a wave; left unchecked, it has
revolutionary potential.
 &HT;    This is Russia, and thus the question of what should be done is
almost a philosophical one. With no reliable mechanism available to
remove the president, it is likely and probably best (in
constitutional terms at least) that he serve out his term, through
the presidential elections in 2000. No one knows whether the newly
appointed administration can address the depth of the economic and
political crises, sustain the confidence of the people and of
investors, and carry support from the State Duma.
 &HT;    This would require a fundamental shift of politics in Moscow and
may seem utopian. But at least now even the robber barons
understand that serious mistakes have been made. Even they can see
that the ruble crisis is a symptom of the broader crisis of
confidence throughout the country.
 &HT;    Only Russia can save itself, but the West can help. To be
effective, however, it must be serious. Economic assistance must be
linked to deep structural as well as political reform.
 &HT;    Western policy must move beyond its reliance on the single
personality of the president to build relationships with a far
broader range of politicians, parties and institutions.
 &HT;    Russia has to transform almost everything, and the necessary
reforms cover the whole gamut: stopping corruption, developing
civil society at grass-roots levels, increasing decentralization,
reducing bureaucracy, building real political parties, securing a

 By GRIGORY YAVLINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years ago, the so-called reformers running Russia concluded
that three things were essential for economic growth: a stable
exchange rate, low inflation and the re-election of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    The challenge was to achieve each as quickly as possible, after
which the economic transformation would be largely secured.
 &HT;    But it was a trap. Financial stabilization was achieved, but not
economic growth. And with the re-election of the president, in a
notoriously unfair process, a kind of political stabilization was
achieved, but not political reform. Aid was given by the West, but
not in a determined manner that would encourage change.
 &HT;    The result is more costly by the day. Economic stagnation is one
reason. Russia's gross domestic product is half the level it was 10
years ago under communism. Another is that the so-called ``shock
reforms'' _ particularly the ill-fated voucher privatization _ only
drove the economy to barter. Up to 75 percent of the entire
economic turnover runs on barter, promissory notes and other money
surrogates.
 &HT;    In such a duty-free economy, the main problem is not the failure
to collect taxes, but the absence of an economy from which taxes
could be drawn. The government has covered its deficits with
foreign and domestic loans at exceedingly high interest rates.
 &HT;    Now the government cannot pay its bills, its staggering debts or
even its interest payments. It is being forced back to devaluation,
inflation and the same financial instability as before. The only
option offered is more debt _ $22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Japan, to add to the $5.5 billion
already borrowed.
 &HT;    This time, there is likely to be more political instability. For
six years, people have been patient. They have lived without jobs
and without money, waiting for the results of the reforms because
they understood that they were necessary. They are broke, and if
prices begin to skyrocket, they could take to the streets.
 &HT;    It is already starting. People are calling for Yeltsin's
resignation _ not only coal miners and communists, but politicians,
businessmen and other elites, as well as students and people
throughout the regions. It is like a wave; left unchecked, it has
revolutionary potential.
 &HT;    This is Russia, and thus the question of what should be done is
almost a philosophical one. With no reliable mechanism available to
remove the president, it is likely and probably best (in
constitutional terms at least) that he serve out his term, through
the presidential elections in 2000. No one knows whether the newly
appointed administration can address the depth of the economic and
political crises, sustain the confidence of the people and of
investors, and carry support from the State Duma.
 &HT;    This would require a fundamental shift of politics in Moscow and
may seem utopian. But at least now even the robber barons
understand that serious mistakes have been made. Even they can see
that the ruble crisis is a symptom of the broader crisis of
confidence throughout the country.
 &HT;    Only Russia can save itself, but the West can help. To be
effective, however, it must be serious. Economic assistance must be
linked to deep structural as well as political reform.
 &HT;    Western policy must move beyond its reliance on the single
personality of the president to build relationships with a far
broader range of politicians, parties and institutions.
 &HT;    Russia has to transform almost everything, and the necessary
reforms cover the whole gamut: stopping corruption, developing
civil society at grass-roots levels, increasing decentralization,
reducing bureaucracy, building real political parties, securing a
truly independent press, reforming the judiciary and instigating a
raft of measures in the economic sphere.
 &HT;    Shock therapy cannot be applied. Reforms must occur at a speed
that supports, rather than damages, democratic development. Like
the pedals of a bicycle, institutional and political reform must
turn together.
 &HT;    But unless a definitive course is set to achieve these changes,
an open economy will never be effective, and stabilization will
never be achieved. Merely giving cash now while Russia burns is a
waste.

had chosen her successor as director of the Canadian Center for

 ENOUGH, ALREADY, ON McGWIRE'S DIETARY SUPPLEMENT  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The man must bring the national nightmare to an
end so that we can all get on with our lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's time. We have stock tables to check, stones to hurl at the
next guy who moves into a glass house.
</P>
<P>
   The man needs to swallow his pride, keep his anger in check over
what he considers a reckless invasion of his ``private life'' and
throw himself on the mercy of the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a private life. He belongs to the American
people. He is a role model, occupying a position of public trust.
He owes each and every citizen and sincere look in the eyes and a
confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guilty,'' Mark McGwire needs to say _ and mean. ``All the
reports and rumors are true. I'm guilty of using a dietary
supplement in conjunction with my exercise program. I'm guilty of
using a supplement that is available over the counter and legal in
50 states. I'm guilty of using a supplement not red-flagged by the
Food and Drug Administration, in violation of none of the rules of
major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make excuses, but I can't. The plain truth of the
matter is, I must accept full responsibility for willfully engaging
in a behavior that is neither illegal, nor immoral, nor against the
rules of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   To call the thunderstorm around baseball's leading home-run
hitter a ``controversy'' would be to give it a legitimacy it
doesn't deserve. The revelation that McGwire uses androstenedione _
better known to its users as ``andro'' _ has led to the most
ridiculous debate since Abbott and Costello pondered over who's on
first.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors classify andro as an anabolic steriod that allows
the body to produce additional quantities of testosterone, the male
hormone that allows athletes to train longer and recover from
injuries faster than they normally would. Other doctors question
whether andro has any appreciable effect on the long-term
production of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of conclusive evidence of andro's helpful or harmful
effects hasn't deterred a panel of assorted doomsayers from
determining that McGwire has defiled the home run race. They live
for these moments, these stolen opportunities to tear down anything
or anybody audacious enough to rise into prominence. They live by
the credo: If you can't beat 'em, tear 'em down.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is a soft touch for charitable causes, a man who donates
$1 million a year to campaign against child abuse, and even he
isn't immune to the cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the doom and gloom set tell it, McGwire has tainted his
accomplishments, endangered his health, corrupted the youth of
America and weakened the office of president. The presumption is
that McGwire is guilty of some sort of wrongdoing if he breaks the
season record for home runs. The International Olympic Committee
has banned andro. The National Football League has banned andro.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league baseball hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is operating under the law of baseball and the land.
Anybody who has a problem with McGwire taking a dietary supplement
that may or may not help him produce extra testosterone, that may
or may not carry health risks, needs to take it up with the FDA
first and major-league baseball second. Besides, the IOC list of
banned substances is good for more laughs than CBS's lineup of
sitcoms. The IOC is the same body that bans over-the-counter cold
remedies while allowing dope-smoking snowboarders to win gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion that McGwire is a monster created by chemistry
ignores how he hit 49 home runs as a rookie _ long before he
happened upon his regimen of better baseball through body-building.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire admittedly began using andro about a year ago, which
wouldn't explain the 52 homers in 423 at-bats in 1996. Or the 39
homers in 317 at-bats in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire works out religiously. He studies pitchers. He had an
uppercut swing made for home runs when he entered the majors, and
he has had more than a decade to smooth off the rough edges. He is
an intelligent hitter who knows the strike zone. Tying his success
to using the latest in dietary supplements is as insulting as
attributing Maris' 61 homers in 1961 to having a short right-field
porch in Yankee Stadium, or hitting in front of Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth had a short porch in right when he hit 60 homers, and
he didn't have to face pitchers who threw sliders, and he didn't
have night games, and he didn't play against African Americans. Do
those things diminish Ruth or Maris? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe time will tell us that McGwire, sadly, has used andro at
the expense of his health. In the end, it is McGwire's body.
McGwire's health.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People knowingly try things _ cigarettes, pizza, beer, caffeine,
candy _ all the time. McGwire insists he has thoroughly researched
what he is doing. Even if he hasn't, it's his business. He is old
enough to decide for himself whether or not to use a legal product
that doctors cannot say with certainty can cause testicular
atrophy, rages (perhaps the byproduct of the testicular atrophy),
acne, breast enlargement (another possible cause of rage) and acne.
</P>
<P>
   And please, let's keep the kids out of this.
</P>
<P>
   Only a hypocrite would accuse McGwire of doing a disservice to
impressionable young athletes across the country by setting an
unseemly example. The only reason people know that McGwire uses
andros is because an Associated Press reporter snooped around his
locker. If kids start buying andros by the case, it's because they
read and/or heard that McGwire was using the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At last look, there weren't any television commercials or print
ads starring a hulking redhead who says, ``Hi, I'm Mark McGwire. I
used to be a regular 98-pound weakling, unable to hit a pop fly out
of the infield. Then I tried an amazing new product. Andros. I used
to spend hour after hour in the weight room, building up my
strength. Thanks to andros, I can get the same results lying on the
couch eating donuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, too, that there is a watchdog group out there that
is responsible for seeing to the safety of the kids.
</P>

   Parents.

FOR STATE, FEDERAL OFFICIALS, THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ As Hurricane Bonnie churned toward land
Wednesday, state and federal officials took a breather before
disaster hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything that we feel like we should do at this
time,'' Richard Moore, secretary of crime control and public safety
said. ``The entire coast has been emptied and Bonnie's track bears
out that we should have emptied the entire coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 71 shelters as far inland as Fayetteville were opened and
850 National Guard troops were dispatched to Clinton, Greenville,
Lumberton and Kinston where a supply of generators, chain saws and
heavy equipment was stashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot deploy any more resources until we know where to
send them,'' Moore said. ``We would be getting ahead of
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   So as storm barrelled toward the coast, officials in the
Emergency Operations Center in the basement of the state
Administration Building watched satellite images and waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of waiting until the storm passes,'' said Maj. Gen.
Rudy Rudisill of N.C. National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Jim Graham, state agriculture secretary,
announced a program for farmers to rent generators for tobacco
barns, poultry houses and other uses. The department obtained the
generators from a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right now in the middle of harvest, particularly corn,''
Graham said. ``Bonnie's going to affect the corn.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not as concerned, he said, about tobacco because 60
percent of the state's cash crop had been harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes and hospitals are first in line for generators
from the National Guard, said Sara Kempin, spokesman for the
Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.

CALIFORNIA THINKS LAWSUIT OVER DEATH PENALTY IS FRIVOLOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lawsuit seeking to bar doctors from
participating in executions may be an attempt to stop something
that isn't happening.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen California physicians Tuesday asked a state appeals
court to reinstate their suit seeking to prevent the state from
using doctors to carry out the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Christine May, a spokeswoman for the California Department
of Corrections, said technicians, not doctors, insert the
intravenous line that delivers the lethal drugs to the condemned
prisoner. A physician's only role is to attend and certify the
death, which is required by state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, they do not participate,'' May said,
adding that all those involved, including the physicians in
attendance, are volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Schear, the lawyer representing the doctors, said
documents from the department dated as recently as 1996 showed that
physicians were part of the execution team, although their exact
role was vague. He also said if the state isn't using doctors to
carry out executions, they should not oppose the request for an
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   The facts surrounding the department's practices have not been
explored in court because the lawsuit was dismissed in 1996 before
it could be heard by a jury. At the time, a San Francisco Superior
Court judge said the state Legislature had established a public
policy that provided for the death penalty and included the
involvement of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Major medical groups like the American Medical Association and
the California Medical Association oppose the participation of
doctors in executions. Schear said it amounts to unprofessional
conduct on the part of physicians who have taken an oath to protect
the interests of patients. He said it could harm a patient's trust
in his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Schear said his clients do not oppose the practice of using
psychiatrists, who are also medical doctors, to certify that
convicts are mentally competent to be eligible for execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more distant from the actual execution,'' he said. No
executions are currently scheduled in California, although there
are 510 people on death row, according to the corrections
department.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court is expected to decide whether to reinstate the
lawsuit within the next two months.

   TRADEMARK-SKYLINE (New York) _ For years, Bobby Short has been
singing at the Cafe Carlyle that he feels New York is really ``my
personal property, right down Broadway to City Hall.'' Careful,
Bobby. That slice of New York skyline you think is yours may in
fact be trademarked. The Art Deco spire of the Chrysler Building is
a registered trademark (No. 1126888). So is the neo-classical
facade of the New York Stock Exchange (No. 1761655). Even the
Manhattan White Pages needed permission to depict ``Patience,'' one
of the marble lions guarding the New York Public Library on Fifth
Avenue (Trademark No. 1838167). By David Dunlap.

<P>
   SCIARC-STUDENTS (Los Angels) _ Back to school, the time of
notebooks and protractors and sales circulars, has become one of
the basic seasons of American marketing. Even adults decades out of
the classroom can succumb to the pitch; it evokes certain primal
school-day sights and smells and textures. At the Southern
California Institute of Architecture (SciArc), the once-renegade
school whose influence has shaped the look of design in Los
Angeles, back-to-school means something different. There,
first-year students don't buy stuff; they build their own desks. By
Phil Patton.

   HOME-RENOVATION (Undated) _ We didn't start with the idea of
renovating our house in Pleasantville, N.Y., a 3,000-square-foot
Cotswold cottage on steroids. The house, built in 1907, has what
the folks in real estate like to call character, which means that
it takes a lot of character to live there, because nothing works
properly. No, we started with the idea of moving. By Ben Cheever.

<P>
   CANADA-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Last week Phyllis Lambert, the
formidable doyenne of architecture, whose youthful rebellion
against her father, liquor tycoon Samuel Bronfman, resulted in the
construction of the Seagram Building in 1958, announced that she
had chosen her successor as director of the Canadian Center for
Architecture in Montreal. Kurt W. Forster, founding director of the
Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities at the Getty
Center in Los Angeles and, currently, chairman of the Department of
Art and Architecture at the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich will assume the directorship of the center on March 1, 1999.
The Swiss-born scholar, 63, is expected to bring a considerable
measure of international cache and academic integrity to the center
that Ms. Lambert founded, using her own inheritance money, in 1979.
By Julie Iovine.

   NJ-ARTS-CARPET (Newark, N.J.) _ Usually it's a bronze statue, an
old schoolhouse or a stately home that becomes the symbol of a
town. But the new contender in Newark is a colorful 12- by 92-foot
carpet, an addition to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center,
installed last Thursday in the entrance foyer. ``It's
Afrocentric,'' observed Lynne Falanga, of Watchung, N.J., who
attended a concert at the center on Sunday. ``They're incorporating
the neighborhood into the arts center, and that's the best part
about it.'' By Joseph Giovannini.

SoHo area is losing out to Chelsea as the center of the downtown
gallery scene and filling ever more rapidly with hotels, cosmetic
boutiques, home furnishing stores and designer shopping
opportunities. Its farewell melody to the art world may be Rachel

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR BACKS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN DEFIANCE OF LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, brushing aside the threat of
lawsuits, supports an effort to keep San Francisco's
affirmative-action program in place for another five years despite
a voter-approved initiative that bars race and gender preferences
for government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   City Supervisor Amos Brown unveiled a ``carefully crafted''
proposal on Monday that would continue the city's
Minority/Women/Local Business Enterprise program, which assists
minorities in bidding on municipal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said his preference was to maintain the city's
affirmative-action program despite the approval of Proposition 209
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors has extended the old ordinance for the
past two years, but Supervisor Brown's proposal would replace the
old ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proper hearings will be conducted and I believe it will
ultimately be passed and signed into law,'' the mayor said. ``I
think it will stand any court challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   University of California Regent Ward Connerly, who headed the
campaign to pass Proposition 209 in 1996, said on Monday he was
``just drooling at the prospect'' of a legal challenge to San
Francisco's affirmative-action program if it is extended.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, a frequent critic of Connerly, said the Sacramento
businessman is ``entitled to file any lawsuit he may wish. All I
would suggest is that he should at least read it unlike what he
normally does.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, asked if he feared a lawsuit, the mayor said, ``I don't
go through life with a cloud over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   He and city officials believe the proposed ordinance meets the
U.S. Supreme Court standard for allowing affirmative action as a
remedy where discrimination can be shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our affirmative-action program began through a Supreme Court
test and it survived a challenge according to that Supreme Court
test before Proposition 209 came along,'' Supervisor Michael Yaki
said. ``So we are simply following extending that program ... (and)
ensuring diversity and opportunity for minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   A city report on $2.5 billion in municipal contracts awarded
from 1992-95 showed blacks received 1.44 percent of the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses owned by white women received 1.37 percent; companies
owned by Arab Americans and Native Americans received no contracts.
Asian Americans received 3 percent of the construction money and
Hispanics got 5.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Companies owned by white men received 88.92 percent of the
construction contract dollars.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Shirley Fong-Torres, founder and owner of Wok Wiz Walking Tours
in San Francisco's Chinatown, guides a group of mature travelers
across narrow, bustling Grant Avenue and past Pagoda Gate with its
two stone lions.
 &HT;    ``Notice the curved roof line on many of the buildings,'' she
points out. ``The Chinese are very superstitious. They believe that
evil spirits travel in a straight line. By curving the roofs, evil
spirits stay away.''
 &HT;    Accompanying Fong-Torres' group is our friend, Millie Alexander,
who tells us about the continuing growth of ethnic communities in
the San Francisco area.
 &HT;    Chinatown is a favorite attraction for many first-time visitors
to San Francisco. While they expect to see cable cars, the Golden
Gate Bridge and many different types of boats on the water, ``what
comes as a surprise are the large number of newly arrived
immigrants now living in the City by the Bay,'' Alexander says.
 &HT;    The picturesque 24-block community of Chinatown continues to
provide housing and social interaction for thousands of new Chinese
and Asian immigrants, she says. They love it because it reminds
them so much of home. They love the sound of mah jong tiles
clicking against one another in boisterous games. They love the
pungent smell of healing herbs prescribed by white-coated herb
doctors. And they love the sight of roasted ducks hanging in
restaurant windows, inviting them inside for a delicious meal.
 &HT;    The entire city is a kaleidoscope of ethnic diversity.
 &HT;    The Hispanic culture marks the Mission District, with salsa
music blaring from inside dance clubs. Taquerias serve handmade
tortillas, and colorful murals adorn walls, fences and garages.
 &HT;    On the other side of the hills not far from the ocean is Geary
Street, where the golden onion domes of the Holy Trinity Russian
Orthodox Cathedral bring a touch of home to Russian emigres.
 &HT;    Although they're eager to begin a new life in America, they
still long for familiar foods such as piroshkis and pelmeni. Many
bakeries, delicatessens and restaurants specialize in Russian food
and advertise with signs printed in both English and Cyrillic
letters.
 &HT;    ``We shouldn't be a melting pot in America but a salad bowl,''
says Dorothy Quock, a guide with Wok Wiz Walking Tours. ``Each
culture should keep its ethnic identity, yet still be part of the
mix.''
 &HT;    ``San Francisco has had a long history of accepting (sometimes
reluctantly) different nationalities into its salad bowl,'' says
Alexander, who has lived in the Bay Area for many years. She
explains that since the days of the 1849 Gold Rush, the city has
had mass migrations of Italian fishermen, Chinese railroad workers,
Mexican laborers and, most recently, Vietnamese boat people, all
seeking happiness in the Golden State.
 TOURING THE CITY  
 &HT;    For the visitor, this multi-ethnic flavor presents an
extraordinary sensory experience in sights, sounds and tastes. And
Alexander adds that it's all reachable by buses, streetcars and
cable cars at discounted prices for mature travelers.
 &HT;    Personal guides go to famous neighborhoods such as Pacific
Heights and Telegraph Hill, Castro Street and the Haight Ashbury.
 &HT;    ``Because of its cultural diversity, San Francisco has a flavor
that does not exist in other cities,'' says Thomas Weed, who runs
Tours for One, a personalized guide service, (415) 387-3448. ``I
learn what interests the visitors, and then we go exploring in
those neighborhoods.''
 &HT;    To fully enjoy San Francisco, however, the mature traveler
should bear in mind several facts, says Alexander:
 &HT;    The city is located on the tip of a peninsula with the Pacific
Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other side. This
means that micro-climates abound, especially during the summer
months. While the sky can be sunny and blue at Pier 39, it may be
gray and foggy at the Cliff House. Consequently, sweaters and
jackets _ even lightweight coats _ are appropriate for the city's
mercurial weather.
 &HT;    San Francisco is also located on 43 hills with Lombard Street
being the steepest and most famous for its eight curves. Cars full
of uneasy passengers carefully navigate these S-turns while more
ambitious pedestrians climb up and down Lombard Street on the
sidewalk stairs.
 &HT;    Not all the city's famous attractions are on hills. Fisherman's
Wharf, Golden Gate Park, Union Square and Ocean Beach are on level
ground that requires comfortable walking shoes. Attractions located
on hilltops are accessible via cable cars, taxi cabs and tour
buses.
 &HT;    For touring other city sights, Muni, the public transit system,
charges visitors ages 65 and older a 35-cent fare instead of $1 to
travel around the city all day.
 SAN FRANCISCO RESOURCES  
 &HT;    Because San Francisco is so popular with visitors, advance hotel
reservations are a must, Alexander warns, adding that in the first
three quarters of 1997, San Francisco hosted 11.4 million visitors.
 &HT;    To help with accommodations, the San Francisco Convention and
Visitors Bureau has a city-wide hotel-reservations service. By
calling toll-free (888) 782-9673, mature travelers can make
reservations at more than 70 hotels. Be sure to inquire about their
senior discounts.
 &HT;    In addition, the visitors bureau has a new Web site,
www.sfvisitor.org, to help visitors plan their trips. The
Information available includes travel tips, frequently asked
questions (FAQs), maps and links to other San Francisco resources
on the Web.
 &HT;    One useful guidebook published by Good Life Publications is
``Good Life San Francisco,'' and purchasers ages 50 and older get
30 percent off.
 &HT;    Book tours like Wok Wiz Walking Tours through your hotel.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Dozens of new travel guidebooks have recently arrived in
bookstores and on Internet bookstore sites. Here's a selection of
the best.
 &HT;    ``Time Out Dublin,'' edited by Peter Fiennes (Penguin, 1998,
$14.95) is Time Out's first guide to the booming Irish capital.
Hip, street-smart and savvy, it runs the gamut from gay bars to
hurling matches.
 &HT;    Accommodations, from bed &AMP; breakfasts to The Clarence, the chic
hotel owned by the rock band U2, are also well-covered.
 &HT;    There are detailed descriptions of the best pubs, such as
Mulligan's, which offers ``a legendary pint of Guinness _ perhaps
the most celebrated and discussed in the entire town.'' And there
are suggestions for excursions out of Dublin, such as to Thor
Ballylee, home of the poet W.B. Yeats. All told, it's the only
guide that the Dublin-bound should need.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet has published a slew of new guides of late. Among
them are ``The Deep South: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama'' by Kap
Stann, et al (Lonely Planet, 1998; $19.95), which offers close to
600 pages on plantation mansions, blues clubs and gumbo
restaurants.
 &HT;    Their ``London,'' by Pat Yale (Lonely Planet, 1998; $14.95), is
a much-needed guide to one of the most expensive cities in Europe
and a good source for restaurants and hotels that are easy on the
wallet.
 &HT;    But the best of the lot is ``Chicago,'' by Ryan van Berkmoes
(Lonely Planet, 1998; $15.95), a detailed labor of love.
 &HT;    The author knows his city very well. He's informed, informative
and opinionated. He offers a wry 90-minute tour of the Art
Institute of Chicago.
 &HT;    After watching the Cubs lose, he suggests a stop at Bernie's
Tavern, which ``doesn't jack up its prices on game days to fleece
unsuspecting fans, as the many upscale joints in the neighborhood
do.'' And he advises walking around Chicago as the best way to see
it ``except when huge chunks of windblown sleet are smacking you in
the face.''
 &HT;    Like the smart aleck on the next barstool, van Bermoes is
cranky, funny and obviously loves the Windy City. His book is the
next best thing to a personal tour.
 &HT;    Two books have staked out one of America's most beautiful areas,
the California coast. ``The California Coast; A Traveler's
Companion,'' by Donald B. Neuwirth and John J. Osborn (Countryman
Press, 1998; $17.95) is readable and easy to use.
 &HT;    Besides noting scenic high points, hotels and restaurants, the
book offers profiles of people like Rim Fay, a retired Los Angeles
lifeguard, and Rene Avant, a coast ranger. Pack it for a family
driving tour.
 &HT;    The other guide worth perusing is ``Coastal California,'' by
John Doerper (Compass American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). With
photographs by one of America's best-known outdoors photographers,
Galen Rowell, this book is a rich look at the history and the
culture of the area. Birders, wine lovers and sightseers will be
well served by it.
 &HT;    The Compass series is one of the best around for those who crave
well-written background information. But this one also shines with
practical details about hotels and restaurants _ not to mention
tattooed La Jolla surfers, ocean kayakers and the Channel Islands.
 &HT;    With Rowell's stunning photographs and Doerper's sensitive and
intelligent prose, this is an ideal travel guide.
 &HT;    The Compass series has also produced ``Underwater Wonders of the
National Parks,'' by Daniel J. Lenihan and John D. Brooks (Compass
American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). Spectacular photography and
a wide range of locations makes this a terrific read.
 &HT;    From Devil's Hole cave in Death Valley to St. John in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Isle Royale in Lake Superior to Biscayne National
Park in Florida, this book shows a watery side of America's
National Parks that is rarely glimpsed.
 &HT;    Moon Travel Handbooks, noted for their detail and no-nonsense
prose, has recently tackled New England. Their ``Maine Handbook,''
by Kathleen Brandes (Moon, 1998; $18.95) offers a close look at the
state that calls itself ``Vacationland.''
 &HT;    On her top 10 list of attractions, Acadia National Park ranks
first, L.L. Bean's store in Freeport ranks fourth.
 &HT;    She notes that what ``looks like a squished spider on Maine's
license plate is actually, of course, the state's favorite menu
item _ a lobster.''
 &HT;    But Maine's wilderness is what she really loves. Brandes remarks
that ``looking out over Maine from Mt. Katahdin today, as Thoreau

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Dozens of new travel guidebooks have recently arrived in
bookstores and on Internet bookstore sites. Here's a selection of
the best.
 &HT;    ``Time Out Dublin,'' edited by Peter Fiennes (Penguin, 1998,
$14.95) is Time Out's first guide to the booming Irish capital.
Hip, street-smart and savvy, it runs the gamut from gay bars to
hurling matches.
 &HT;    Accommodations, from bed &AMP; breakfasts to The Clarence, the chic
hotel owned by the rock band U2, are also well-covered.
 &HT;    There are detailed descriptions of the best pubs, such as
Mulligan's, which offers ``a legendary pint of Guinness _ perhaps
the most celebrated and discussed in the entire town.'' And there
are suggestions for excursions out of Dublin, such as to Thor
Ballylee, home of the poet W.B. Yeats. All told, it's the only
guide that the Dublin-bound should need.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet has published a slew of new guides of late. Among
them are ``The Deep South: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama'' by Kap
Stann, et al (Lonely Planet, 1998; $19.95), which offers close to
600 pages on plantation mansions, blues clubs and gumbo
restaurants.
 &HT;    Their ``London,'' by Pat Yale (Lonely Planet, 1998; $14.95), is
a much-needed guide to one of the most expensive cities in Europe
and a good source for restaurants and hotels that are easy on the
wallet.
 &HT;    But the best of the lot is ``Chicago,'' by Ryan van Berkmoes
(Lonely Planet, 1998; $15.95), a detailed labor of love.
 &HT;    The author knows his city very well. He's informed, informative
and opinionated. He offers a wry 90-minute tour of the Art
Institute of Chicago.
 &HT;    After watching the Cubs lose, he suggests a stop at Bernie's
Tavern, which ``doesn't jack up its prices on game days to fleece
unsuspecting fans, as the many upscale joints in the neighborhood
do.'' And he advises walking around Chicago as the best way to see
it ``except when huge chunks of windblown sleet are smacking you in
the face.''
 &HT;    Like the smart aleck on the next barstool, van Bermoes is
cranky, funny and obviously loves the Windy City. His book is the
next best thing to a personal tour.
 &HT;    Two books have staked out one of America's most beautiful areas,
the California coast. ``The California Coast; A Traveler's
Companion,'' by Donald B. Neuwirth and John J. Osborn (Countryman
Press, 1998; $17.95) is readable and easy to use.
 &HT;    Besides noting scenic high points, hotels and restaurants, the
book offers profiles of people like Rim Fay, a retired Los Angeles
lifeguard, and Rene Avant, a coast ranger. Pack it for a family
driving tour.
 &HT;    The other guide worth perusing is ``Coastal California,'' by
John Doerper (Compass American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). With
photographs by one of America's best-known outdoors photographers,
Galen Rowell, this book is a rich look at the history and the
culture of the area. Birders, wine lovers and sightseers will be
well served by it.
 &HT;    The Compass series is one of the best around for those who crave
well-written background information. But this one also shines with
practical details about hotels and restaurants _ not to mention
tattooed La Jolla surfers, ocean kayakers and the Channel Islands.
 &HT;    With Rowell's stunning photographs and Doerper's sensitive and
intelligent prose, this is an ideal travel guide.
 &HT;    The Compass series has also produced ``Underwater Wonders of the
National Parks,'' by Daniel J. Lenihan and John D. Brooks (Compass
American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). Spectacular photography and
a wide range of locations makes this a terrific read.
 &HT;    From Devil's Hole cave in Death Valley to St. John in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Isle Royale in Lake Superior to Biscayne National
Park in Florida, this book shows a watery side of America's
National Parks that is rarely glimpsed.
 &HT;    Moon Travel Handbooks, noted for their detail and no-nonsense
prose, has recently tackled New England. Their ``Maine Handbook,''
by Kathleen Brandes (Moon, 1998; $18.95) offers a close look at the
state that calls itself ``Vacationland.''
 &HT;    On her top 10 list of attractions, Acadia National Park ranks
first, L.L. Bean's store in Freeport ranks fourth.
 &HT;    She notes that what ``looks like a squished spider on Maine's
license plate is actually, of course, the state's favorite menu
item _ a lobster.''
 &HT;    But Maine's wilderness is what she really loves. Brandes remarks
that ``looking out over Maine from Mt. Katahdin today, as Thoreau
did in 1857, you get a view that is still a mass of green
stretching to the sea, broken by blue lakes and rivers.''
 &HT;    Also deserving a look are ``New Hampshire Handbook,'' by Steve
Lantos (Moon Travel Handbooks, 1998; $18.95) and ``Massachusetts
Handbook,'' by Jeff Perk (Moon Travel Handbooks, 1998; $18.95).
 &HT;    Finally, ``Frommer's San Francisco from $60 a Day,'' by Erika
Lenkert and Matthew R. Poole (Macmillan Travel, 1998; $14.95) is a
find for anyone who's tried to beat the high cost of visiting the
city by the Bay.
 &HT;    Cheap eats? Readers will learn about dim sum at the Hong Kong
Flower Lounge, pizza to go at Golden Boy Pizza in North Beach and
Latino specialties at Pozole in the Castro District.
 &HT;    There are loads of recommendations for cheap sleeps throughout
the city, as well as sightseeing and shopping tips that should
please anyone who's watching their budget in San Francisco.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   These days, when the sun is shining and daylight lingers into
late evening, Berliners are outside talking about their city. The
question is always the same, accompanied by a sweeping gesture
toward the crane or bulldozer inevitably positioned nearby: ``You
think it will work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor interested in urban development, contemporary
architecture or, indeed, world history, Berlin is a veritable candy
store for the mind. All over town the city's physical past is being
confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital.
</P>
<P>
   There is the newly transplanted heart at Potsdamer Platz, where
the steel-and-glass towers of Sony and Daimler Benz near
completion. The area was the commercial center of prewar Berlin _
but it was also the site of Hitler's bunker, of the wall and the
mined no man's land behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Reichstag, birthplace of the Weimar democracy in
1918, but also the setting for the infamous fire used by the Nazis
to seize power in 1933. Refashioned by Sir Norman Foster, the
British architect, the building will once again house the German
Parliament in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a less monumental scale, there is the old Jewish quarter in
the Mitte district. Due to conflicting claims, much of the area was
off limits to investors after the wall fell, resulting in a
squatters' paradise and a flourishing subculture that left its mark
in the neighborhood's trendy galleries, clubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the sideshow. For in reclaiming its status
as government capital, Berlin is determined to reclaim its 1920s
role as cultural capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The city boasts three state-subsidized opera houses, five
symphony orchestras and three ballet companies. Some 15,000 seats
are available nightly for concerts and musical theater. And a
dizzying array of privately sponsored alternative performances and
exhibitions recall Berlin's history as home to the avant-garde.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 2 through Oct. 5 the 48th annual Berlin Festival
Weeks will focus on Vienna from 1750 to 1950. Claudio Abbado will
conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in the opening concert,
an evening of Wolfgang Rihm and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The
festival box office is at 48 Budapesterstrasse; information and
tickets: (49-30) 254 89254, fax (49-30) 254 89111.
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy their Viennese music in a somewhat less
conventional setting, the director Georg Tabori and the Circus
Roncalli are staging ``The Magic Flute: Mozart's Opera in the
Circus With Elephants, Goats, Apes and other Collaborators.''
Performances are Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.,
Sunday at 6 p.m. through Sept. 23. Tickets are available at
Fullhouse Service, 48 Budapesterstrasse, or at the circus box
office, 111 Friedrichstrasse. Tickets from $9.80 to $59, calculated
at 1.73 marks to the dollar: (49-30) 254 89254.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sept. 30, the National Gallery in the Hamburger Bahnhof,
50-51 Invalidenstrasse, (49-30) 397 8340, presents ``Sensation,''
works by young British artists from the Charles Saatchi Collection.
The show made waves at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Hours:
Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4.60. Tickets for ``Sensation'' are
$6.95.
</P>
<P>
   The first Berlin Biennale opens Sept. 29 with ``Berlin/Berlin.''
Over 70 artists, architects, filmmakers, musicians and designers
who have worked in Berlin will participate in the interdisciplinary
event.
</P>
<P>
   Installations, videos, photographs and paintings will be shown
in three historic buildings in Mitte: the Academy of Arts at
Pariser Platz (next to the Brandenburg Gate); the former
Postfuhramt, 17-19 Tucholsky Strasse; and the Kunst-Werke art
center, 69 Auguststrasse. Hours: Tuesday through Thursday, and
Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to
midnight. Telephone: (49-30) 285 99148. The Biennale closes Jan. 3.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to immerse oneself in the rhythm of Berlin is to
step into its noisy unfinished center. Emerge from the Potsdamer
Platz S-Bahn station to a sky filled with 30 cranes, lifting,
swiveling, loads dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half-hour tours through the construction sites at
Potsdamer and Leipziger Platz are given as part of the ``Showcase
Berlin'' summer program. The English-language tour (No. 9) begins
Thursday at 10:30 a.m. through Sept. 3. Tickets ($9.85) can be
bought beneath the Info Box building by the S-Bahn station.
</P>
<P>
   If Potsdamer Platz offers a glimpse at Berlin's self-styled
future, Tacheles, 54-56 Oranienburger Strasse, bears witness to the
city's disappearing past.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1909 as part of a noble shopping passage connecting the
Friedrichstrasse to the Oranienburger Strasse, the building was
scheduled for demolition in 1990 when an idealistic group of East
and West German artists occupied the space.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn may be the last chance to visit the ruin in its
dilapidated glory. The artists expect to be evicted before the end
of the year by the new investors, who have presented plans to
integrate the space into a larger commercial complex.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk into the heart of the old Jewish quarter leads to
the Hackeschen Hofe, 40-41 Rosenthaler Strasse, eight connecting
Jugendstil buildings and courtyards that successfully combine the
public life of cafes, galleries, clubs and fashion boutiques with
private housing.
</P>
<P>
   Two museums opened this June. The Picture Gallery at the
Kulturforum, Kemperplatz, (49-30) 2090 55 55, unites some 1,000
masterworks of European painting, an encyclopedic collection
divided in two for the past half-century by the exigencies of war
and the wall. The understated building relies almost exclusively on
natural overhead light. Open Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. Thursday until 8 p.m., weekends from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission: $4.60.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Museum, in the former American military movie theater
at 135 Clayallee, offers a multimedia depiction of the history of
Berlin and the Allies from 1945 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items on display are an original raisin bomber from
the Berlin airlift, the Checkpoint Charlie house and a piece of the
wall. Open daily except Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (49-30) 818
1990. Admission free.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;

imperial squares, the Gendarmenmarkt, with its twin cathedrals and

technologically equipped business centers comply with more modern

   The Kempinski Hotel Bristol Berlin, 27 Kurfurstendamm, (49-30)
884 340, fax 883 6075, remains a grande dame among Berlin hotels,
with 301 traditionally luxurious rooms on the Kurfurstendamm. The

finest in town. Doubles with breakfast from $231.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;

   Situated in the house where Rahel Varnhagen conducted her famous

   These days, when the sun is shining and daylight lingers into
late evening, Berliners are outside talking about their city. The
question is always the same, accompanied by a sweeping gesture
toward the crane or bulldozer inevitably positioned nearby: ``You
think it will work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor interested in urban development, contemporary
architecture or, indeed, world history, Berlin is a veritable candy
store for the mind. All over town the city's physical past is being
confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital.
</P>
<P>
   There is the newly transplanted heart at Potsdamer Platz, where
the steel-and-glass towers of Sony and Daimler Benz near
completion. The area was the commercial center of prewar Berlin _
but it was also the site of Hitler's bunker, of the wall and the
mined no man's land behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Reichstag, birthplace of the Weimar democracy in
1918, but also the setting for the infamous fire used by the Nazis
to seize power in 1933. Refashioned by Sir Norman Foster, the
British architect, the building will once again house the German
Parliament in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a less monumental scale, there is the old Jewish quarter in
the Mitte district. Due to conflicting claims, much of the area was
off limits to investors after the wall fell, resulting in a
squatters' paradise and a flourishing subculture that left its mark
in the neighborhood's trendy galleries, clubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the sideshow. For in reclaiming its status
as government capital, Berlin is determined to reclaim its 1920s
role as cultural capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The city boasts three state-subsidized opera houses, five
symphony orchestras and three ballet companies. Some 15,000 seats
are available nightly for concerts and musical theater. And a
dizzying array of privately sponsored alternative performances and
exhibitions recall Berlin's history as home to the avant-garde.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 2 through Oct. 5 the 48th annual Berlin Festival
Weeks will focus on Vienna from 1750 to 1950. Claudio Abbado will
conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in the opening concert,
an evening of Wolfgang Rihm and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The
festival box office is at 48 Budapesterstrasse; information and
tickets: (49-30) 254 89254, fax (49-30) 254 89111.
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy their Viennese music in a somewhat less
conventional setting, the director Georg Tabori and the Circus
Roncalli are staging ``The Magic Flute: Mozart's Opera in the
Circus With Elephants, Goats, Apes and other Collaborators.''
Performances are Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.,
Sunday at 6 p.m. through Sept. 23. Tickets are available at
Fullhouse Service, 48 Budapesterstrasse, or at the circus box
office, 111 Friedrichstrasse. Tickets from $9.80 to $59, calculated
at 1.73 marks to the dollar: (49-30) 254 89254.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sept. 30, the National Gallery in the Hamburger Bahnhof,
50-51 Invalidenstrasse, (49-30) 397 8340, presents ``Sensation,''
works by young British artists from the Charles Saatchi Collection.
The show made waves at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Hours:
Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4.60. Tickets for ``Sensation'' are
$6.95.
</P>
<P>
   The first Berlin Biennale opens Sept. 29 with ``Berlin/Berlin.''
Over 70 artists, architects, filmmakers, musicians and designers
who have worked in Berlin will participate in the interdisciplinary
event.
</P>
<P>
   Installations, videos, photographs and paintings will be shown
in three historic buildings in Mitte: the Academy of Arts at
Pariser Platz (next to the Brandenburg Gate); the former
Postfuhramt, 17-19 Tucholsky Strasse; and the Kunst-Werke art
center, 69 Auguststrasse. Hours: Tuesday through Thursday, and
Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to
midnight. Telephone: (49-30) 285 99148. The Biennale closes Jan. 3.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to immerse oneself in the rhythm of Berlin is to
step into its noisy unfinished center. Emerge from the Potsdamer
Platz S-Bahn station to a sky filled with 30 cranes, lifting,
swiveling, loads dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half-hour tours through the construction sites at
Potsdamer and Leipziger Platz are given as part of the ``Showcase
Berlin'' summer program. The English-language tour (No. 9) begins
Thursday at 10:30 a.m. through Sept. 3. Tickets ($9.85) can be
bought beneath the Info Box building by the S-Bahn station.
</P>
<P>
   If Potsdamer Platz offers a glimpse at Berlin's self-styled
future, Tacheles, 54-56 Oranienburger Strasse, bears witness to the
city's disappearing past.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1909 as part of a noble shopping passage connecting the
Friedrichstrasse to the Oranienburger Strasse, the building was
scheduled for demolition in 1990 when an idealistic group of East
and West German artists occupied the space.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn may be the last chance to visit the ruin in its
dilapidated glory. The artists expect to be evicted before the end
of the year by the new investors, who have presented plans to
integrate the space into a larger commercial complex.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk into the heart of the old Jewish quarter leads to
the Hackeschen Hofe, 40-41 Rosenthaler Strasse, eight connecting
Jugendstil buildings and courtyards that successfully combine the
public life of cafes, galleries, clubs and fashion boutiques with
private housing.
</P>
<P>
   Two museums opened this June. The Picture Gallery at the
Kulturforum, Kemperplatz, (49-30) 2090 55 55, unites some 1,000
masterworks of European painting, an encyclopedic collection
divided in two for the past half-century by the exigencies of war
and the wall. The understated building relies almost exclusively on
natural overhead light. Open Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. Thursday until 8 p.m., weekends from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission: $4.60.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Museum, in the former American military movie theater
at 135 Clayallee, offers a multimedia depiction of the history of
Berlin and the Allies from 1945 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items on display are an original raisin bomber from
the Berlin airlift, the Checkpoint Charlie house and a piece of the
wall. Open daily except Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (49-30) 818
1990. Admission free.

SAILORS RECALL THEIR WARTIME DUTY ABOARD A TRUSTED FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ohio, Massachusetts)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It had been 53 years since Ed Whitmore stood on
the deck of a World War II destroyer escort, 53 years since he'd
hunted German U-boats, 53 years since his crew had plucked the
bodies of dead American sailors from the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, he was among 510 members of the Destroyer
Escort Sailors Association and their spouses who were in Albany to
visit the USS Slater, the last destroyer escort still afloat in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore, now 85, moved slowly across the Slater's gray gun
deck, recalling the days when he was commander of another destroyer
escort, the USS Otterstetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to stand here and look at this ship,'' he said with
the sun brilliant overhead, the Hudson River placid below. ``I can
still see the salt water running across the deck here, three feet
deep.'' It was November 1944. A brutal storm in the North Atlantic.
He was the skipper and waves were battering his ship, rolling it 40
degrees, 45 degrees, 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up at night sometimes,'' Whitmore said. ``I can still
see the ship rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore had come from Akron, Ohio, to attend the 23rd
convention of the Destroyer Escort Sailors Association. Others had
come from California, Florida and Maine. The association was
meeting in Springfield, Mass., but members took a day trip to
Albany, marking the single largest group to visit the Slater since
the 306-foot-long warship arrived here in October of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the government produced 563 destroyer escorts between
1942 and 1945. But nearly all were later scrapped, used as targets
or given to other nations, said Martin Davis, director of the
Destroyer Escort Sailors Association. The Otterstetter became a
target for a guided missile.
</P>
<P>
   The Slater served in the Greek Navy from 1950 to 1990 before
being saved for restoration. ``This is a gem,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph F. Freese, the association's executive administrator, said
the ship is important for World Ward II veterans, as well as for
younger generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, this will be the first time to see this, and
the last time,'' he said. There may be another chance, however: The
Destroyer Escort Sailors Association plans to hold a convention in
Albany in 2000, said Gordon Lattey, a board member of the Destroyer
Escort Historical Foundation, which is restoring the Slater as a
maritime museum.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said these conferences allow veterans to share memories
from a defining chapter in their lives. With the average age of
sailors 20 and commanding officers 27, the war marked the first
time that many of them had been away from home and their first
venture overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert St. Jean said he was 17 when he first stepped aboard the
Otterstetter as a carpenter's mate. ``They brought me up,'' he said
of the ship's crew. St. Jean, now a 79-year-old resident of
Russell, Mass., helped guide the Slater up the Hudson River from
New York City, and he stood on the gun deck Tuesday wearing a white
shirt and pants covered with silk-screen images of a destroyer
escort, plus a white sailor's cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best commander in the Navy,'' St. Jean said,
putting a hand on Whitmore's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that,'' Whitmore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got back alive didn't we?'' St. Jean said. ``What more
proof do you need?''

MODERN MUZAK: IT'S NOT YOUR PARENTS' ELEVATOR MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time for a root canal. Inside the dentist's waiting room,
nervous patients thumb through ancient magazines. A drill squeals
from the back room. Mouths go dry, throats gulp. But then, seeping
from the ceiling, comes a gentle melody in soft lapping waves. By
the time the work starts, the patient is calm and relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the promises of Muzak, the ubiquitous music heard
in Crate &AMP; Barrel and Citibank, in malls and McDonald's. Here it
calms and there it soothes, not to mention the Muzak company's
sales pitch: that properly chosen background music can boost sales
and increase productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But now, instead of the Muzak stereotype of endless blenderized
instrumental versions of songs like ``Afternoon Delight,'' the
company is offering the rapper Puff Daddy and the grunge rock band
Nirvana, lyrics and all, in the quarter of a million businesses
that buy Muzak's wares.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Seattle-based company unveiled an extensive image
makeover. It's all part of a new campaign to take this often
ridiculed business into the next millennium as a hipper, more
creative version of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   Over the company's 65-year history, it has doggedly built its
reputation _and melodies _ on what it called ``the science of
business music.'' Muzak was founded in the early 1920s by Maj. Gen.
George Owen Squier, a retired Army Signal Corps officer. Something
of a protogeek, General Squier experimented with ways to deliver
music directly into homes via electrical lines.
</P>
<P>
   His company, originally known as Wired Radio, began transmitting
over telephone lines, later expanding its broadcasts into hotels
and restaurants. A 1937 study by British industrial psychologists,
``Fatigue and Boredom in the Workplace,'' reinforced Squier's
efforts, finding that under certain ``planned sound conditions,
productivity in work areas is stepped up,'' according to Muzak's
company history.
</P>
<P>
   This morale-boosting science remained Muzak's mantra for
decades. In a brochure sent to prospective clients in the
mid-1990s, Muzak touted the ``subtle psychological lifts'' of its
specially designed tunes. A patented process the company called
``Stimulus Progression'' was developed to counter an employee's
``work efficiency dips'' (photos show a scientist taking notes
while a young man covered in electrodes listens to Muzak).
</P>
<P>
   This is the way stimulus progression works, according to Muzak:
most employees have a dip in productivity around 10:30 a.m. To
counter that, stimulating music _ chosen for its variations in
tempo and instrumentation _ is piped in through office intercoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muzak can motivate achievement,'' the brochure says.
``Stimulate sales. Inspire creativity. Decrease absenteeism. And
increase productivity. Muzak creates the sound of better business
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Muzak's vice president, Alvin Collis, said the sound has
changed. ``Background music used to play a covert role in a
particular environment,'' he said. ``Now businesses recognize that
they can put the power of music to work to create emotional
connections. It's all about team building.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Muzak has jettisoned the flavor of its past
promotion for a spunkier, MTV-style approach. New brochures ditch
the graphs and wires of the old days for shots of Muzak tattoos and
snowboards.
</P>
<P>
   The staff members are no longer electrode-wielding men with
clipboards tweaking the mixing boards; now they're Gen-X musical
hipsters. (In fact, Muzak has long attracted struggling musicians
from the Seattle area; former employees include the founders of
legendary indie label Sub Pop records, plus grunge rockers from
bands like Tad and Mudhoney.)
</P>
<P>
   But despite this new approach, Muzak still relies upon a
high-tech, highly orchestrated system of design and distribution.
The process begins with Muzak's 18 ``audio architects,'' who
oversee the creation and selection of more than a million songs in
Muzak's database. These songs fall into two basic categories:
foreground and background.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of foreground music, which makes up the vast
majority of Muzak's catalog, are pop songs in their original form.
With 60 channels available to Muzak subscribers, the company wants
to offer a varied mix of styles; songs are chosen accordingly.
Instrumental background music, also known as environmental music,
is what people most associate with the company, though it's only a
small portion of Muzak's services. Audio architects research
sources like Billboard magazine and MTV, choosing songs that will
be re-recorded instrumentally. This recording process, however, is
proprietary. Declining to describe it, Collis said, ``That'd be
like giving the recipe of Coke.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Muzak no longer talks about ``stimulus progression,'' it
still uses ``quantum modulation,'' the company's term for how songs
are classified in its database. After a song is commissioned in its
original form or transformed into environmental music, it is
evaluated by an audio architect.
</P>
<P>
   The architect rates the song in 45 detailed categories: the mood
of the music; its instrumentation; its color (dark or light), and
whether it is by a male or female vocalist. Once analyzed, the
songs are assigned what the company calls ``quantum modulation''
figures and stored in the database for future retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, audio architects assemble 24-hour playlists, ranging
from country to pop hits, for 60 broadcast channels. Songs are
selected, Collis said, to provide the necessary blend and balance
of stimulation throughout the day. ``We want to create an
atmosphere that is dynamic and constantly changing,'' Collis said.
``We don't want to be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   With the database updated, Muzak representatives meet with
prospective clients to create an ``audio image'' _ a musical
personality. They examine the client's marketing goals, mission
statement and products, then suggest an appropriate Muzak program.
A shoe store in a rural area needs to keep kids mellow; maybe the
country channel might be appropriate. An urban sneaker store wants
to enhance the customer experience; how about Muzak's channel with
Puff Daddy songs?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone wants Puff Daddy and Shania Twain. No problem. A
customized channel can be tailor-made. Fulfilling the vision of
General Squier's Wired Radio, the music is then sent by modem from
the Seattle headquarters to satellite uplink stations in Cheyenne,
Wyo., and Raleigh, N.C. Subscribers receive the transmissions via
18-inch dishes on their roofs. Muzak also provides compact disks if
clients would rather program sounds on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The company's current customer base of a quarter of a million
businesses compares with 125,000 subscribers in 1978. And its
earnings have risen to $50.5 million for 1997, from $26.7 million
in 1989, according to company figures. Aside from smaller
background music companies in local markets, Muzak dominates the
industry. While some businesses choose to use for background music
something like, say, an easy listening station, Muzak says that the
frequent commercial breaks are a downside to such practices.
According to Muzak's Lauren Hower, the problem for the company is
when offices or retail stores prefer to work without any music at
all. ``Our biggest competition is silence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, listeners might be hard pressed to find ``You Light
Up My Life'' wafting through elevator shafts. In the 1940s uzak was
pumped into elevators to soothe fearful riders. Those days, as
Collis is quick to point out, are long gone. Elevator music, he
said, ``is just an urban myth.''

   Buying a new home can be an adventure, but it can also be a
nightmare if the house has major defects that go unnoticed until
after you move in. Ideally, the seller should disclose all
potential problems before the sale, but, unfortunately, many do
not, so buyers must make a careful inspection of the house before
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines for inspection of a house's exterior were presented
in the Home Clinic last week. Once inside, evaluate the overall
design and layout of the house. Start with the entrance way; the
front door should open into a foyer, not directly into the living
room. This will keep the cold outdoor air from cooling the room,
and it will allow visitors to remove wet coats and overshoes before
entering the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Generally the rooms in a house can be divided into three
categories: work rooms (kitchen, pantry and laundry), living rooms
(living and dining rooms, den and recreation rooms) and personal
rooms (bedrooms and bathroom). Rooms in the same category should be
near one another. Bedrooms, for example, should be close to the
bathroom. You should not, however, have to go through one bedroom
to get to another.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of rooms with an odd shape, like a narrow L- or triangle
configuration. It will be difficult to fit furniture into them.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens and bathrooms are the two most used rooms in a house.
They are also the most expensive to renovate, so look carefully at
them. In the kitchen, look at the placement of the cabinets and
appliances. Most food preparation tasks require moving back and
forth between the sink, stove and refrigerator. They need not be
adjacent, but they should be within six feet of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Before looking into the bathroom, check the ceiling of the room
directly below. Water stains here could indicate a plumbing problem
in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the faucets. Beware of cheap bargain fixtures; they wear
out quickly. Open the faucets to run water in the sink and tub. The
water flow should be strong and consistent. Shut off the faucets
and watch to see if the waters drains quickly. If it doesn't, the
drainpipe opening may be clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Test the toilet by flushing a wad of crumpled up toilet tissue.
See how long it takes for the bowl and tank to refill; it should be
less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Most water leaks in the bathroom occur because water seeps
through broken grout or missing caulk around the ceramic tiles.
Examine the tiles carefully to see if the grout is sound.
</P>
<P>
   As you walk through other rooms, try opening and closing the
doors and windows. Doors that won't close properly may be out of
alignment. This can occur if the house is settling unevenly. Other
telltale signs of settlement problems: gaps at the floor-wall
junctions and floors that are not level.
</P>
<P>
   When examining the walls, take the time to look behind
furniture. Some homeowners try to hide wall defects by placing a
bookcase or sofa in front of them. Look at the outlets on the
walls. Are they grounded receptacles? Do not assume that an outlet
is grounded simply because it has holes for three prongs. The best
way to check a receptacle is to plug in a circuit analyzer. This
simple device is available at electrical supply stores for a few
dollars. It can pinpoint a number of circuit problems in the
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Go down to the basement to look at the electrical service panel.
Ideally, it should have a 200-amp capacity (though you can get by
with 150 amps).
</P>
<P>
   The inspection guidelines presented here will give the
prospective home buyer a basic guide to finding potential trouble
spots in a house. Before buying any home, however, it is a good
idea to hire a professional inspector to go through the house and
evaluate the structural, electrical, heating, plumbing and
mechanical systems.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I always saw myself as the kid who stepped up out
of the front row and onto the stage and had the guitar for a while
and carried that particular flame,'' Bruce Springsteen once told
me. ``I wasn't interested in immediate success or how much each
particular record was selling. I was interested in becoming part of
peoples' lives and part of fans' lives and hopefully growing up
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that is the great rock 'n' roll dream. It is a
fantasy both political and parental, a musician's desire to be
elected by the people as an intimate voice and nurturing authority
figure. It is not just about being successful. It is about being a
true believer in rock 'n' roll and its power to speak louder than
words, to be a disembodied best friend who understands what you are
feeling and lets you know that it's OK to feel that way. In the
same way that the best parent is one who still remembers what it
was like to be a child, the best rock 'n' roll musician is often
one who still remembers what it was like to be a fan, to lie in
bed, headphones on, an album lyric sheet in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cutrufello, a 27-year-old singer and guitarist who released
her major-label debut on Tuesday, ``When the Night is Through''
(Mercury), is just such a member of the faithful. She is a
fan-turned-musician chasing the great rock 'n' roll dream, which
has grown ever more elusive in a time when pop radio has become a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Born to interracial parents who were musicians, adopted by two
female schoolteachers in New York and a student of 20th-century
transportation at Yale University, she is a populist fighting
against a background that constantly threatens to marginalize her.
The burden of her past is something she discovered after graduating
from Yale and chasing her muse down South _ learning about country
and roots music in Nashville, Austin and Houston, where she lives
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I would never just be a Nashville or a Texas
artist, I'd always be the one from Yale or the one from the north
or the black one or what have you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ms. Cutrufello was touring as a back-up musician
for Jimmie Dale Gilmore, one of Texas folk's most gentle, wounded
and gifted spirits. Nearly everyone at the shows left talking about
the amazing guitarist who looked like Tracy Chapman. Ms.
Cutrufello, who, with her powerful, assertive stage presence,
constantly upstaged the self-effacing Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   On her own in concert, Ms. Cutrufello knows how to give the
appearance of pouring every ounce of her being into each note, with
every picked string eliciting a grimace and every lyric sung with
an intensity intended to drive it into the heart of the listener.
Watching her perform sometimes feels like being in the presence of
the next Bruce Springsteen or Melissa Etheridge, but at other times
it feels like playing into the hands of a self-invented rock hero
with a manual on how-to-become-a-legend in her back jeans pocket.
She is an acolyte of rock authenticity in search of a crossroads.
In the years to come, she will either find that crossroads or
discover that it has long been paved over.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Cutrufello has mastered the intensity of live
performance, she hasn't figured out the same trick in the recording
studio. Full of revved-up barroom rock, teeming with bluesy guitar
lines, honky-tonk attitude and elements of rhythm-and-blues, folk
and '60s rock, ``When the Night Is Through'' sounds like it was
meant to be a classic, though it falls short of the mark. It is
just promising. As on stage, she tends to overdo it, trying to load
her voice with more experience and age than she has.
</P>
<P>
   But the technique works better in front of an audience than in
the studio. At times, like when she growls, ``Ain't it good to be
alive on a sunny day,'' Ms. Cutrufello manages to turn simple
statements into powerful rock that connects with the listener. At
other times, the album dissolves into well-intended cliche. But Ms.
Cutrufello is only at the beginning of her journey for
self-definition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the cheap seats at a recent Dodgers game, Ms.
Cutrufello discussed her development and ambitions. Where most
musicians strive to be different and unique, Ms. Cutrufello tries
to blend into the crowd. ``That's what's important to me, the
things people have in common,'' she said. ``I'm into speaking for
people who don't have a voice of their own-because I didn't for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for this chaser of the rock 'n' roll dream, who are those
people who don't have a voice? ``Everyday, average people,'' Ms.
Cutrufello replied. ``People you meet at sports bars, not
necessarily people who closely follow music. I'm talking about the
bars where there's a jukebox that plays a song every 10 minutes
because that it's job and a song comes on and someone says, `Who is
that?' And someone else goes, `I don't know, but I love that
song.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Springsteen originally wanted to be a baseball player,
Ms. Cutrufello _ who recently fulfilled another dream, that of
singing the National Anthem at the Houston Astrodrome _ also began
with the game. In fact, we have the baseball industry to thank for
her music. A tomboy, she lived for the sport until the 1981
baseball strike. ``I moped around the house for a year,'' she said.
``That's when I picked up the guitar. I stopped following baseball
for 12 years after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her ambition in high school was to come to Manhattan and
perform musical theater, a road trip through the American Southwest
and a few Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle albums soon thwarted that.
After leaving Yale she hit the Texas honky-tonk club scene. ``I
worked really hard to learn that style and be respectful of it and
figure out my place in it,'' Ms. Cutrufello said.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that Ms. Cutrufello's place wasn't in country
music. ``She came to Nashville, and I let her get a sense of the
country music business,'' remembered her manager, Holly Gleason.
``It wasn't that she disliked the people, but it wasn't her
destiny. She realized that in Nashville she would have been black
before she was anything else. We were at the bar one night and she
slammed her beer down and said, `Rock deal!' I said, `What?' She
said, `Rock deal! I want a rock deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gleason found her one in no time _ with the same talent
scout at Mercury who signed Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the album's oldest songs is ``Sister Cecil,'' which Ms.
Cutrufello wrote in college about her adopted younger sister,
Cecil. Through Ms. Cutrufello was adopted when she was 5 months
old, Cecil came into the family at the age of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cecil showed up, she was a scared little kid, small for
her age,'' Ms. Cutrufello remembered. ``Her shoes didn't fit and
all her clothes were in a box. She was like a dog that had been
kicked when it was young. It took a couple years for her even to
let us give her a hug. I think there's a little bit of that in all
of us _ a little bit scared, unsure of ourselves, haven't quite
figured out what this whole life thing is yet. And I know that rock
'n' roll helped order some of the world for me in that respect and
I think that's a great thing to be able to give back.''

<P>
   I will never have a neat office. But even a mentally healthy
person who has accepted her own messiness can sometimes get a
little, well, depressed at having lost control. So the other day,
as I sourly surveyed the old-computer graveyard in the corner, the
floppy disks strewn like cocktail coasters and the baby playing on
the floor with a spare power cord, I decided to clean up . . . my
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect plan. It would enable me to avoid physical
contact with smelly cleaning products and the thorny questions of
what to do with an expired passport and a crumpled coupon for a
free car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a set of system tools that came with Windows 98 would
exercise control over at least a portion of my environment.
</P>
<P>
   I made a bold list:
</P>
<P>
   1. Get rid of unnecessary files.
</P>
<P>
   2. Reorganize hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove extraneous programs.
</P>
<P>
   I admit it looked a little harsh on paper, at least for someone
whose previous philosophy consisted mainly of equal parts fear and
panic. So I started slow, bypassing Windows 98's new Maintenance
Wizard, which lets you automatically run a number of the system
tools simultaneously. Instead, I opted to run each tool separately,
starting with Disk Cleanup, to remove unnecessary files. Disk
Cleanup told me I could free an additional 4.92 megabytes of space
on the hard drive by emptying my Recycle Bin and deleting some
obsolete files that my browser had cached.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded reasonable, but for all I knew, Disk Cleanup could be
the kind of reckless program that would throw away an expired
passport. I clicked on View Files to see the earmarked files. They
consisted mainly of Web pages I would probably never visit again.
</P>
<P>
   So I took a deep breath, and clicked OK.
</P>
<P>
   With that action, I felt suddenly liberated. I had shed far more
than a mere 4.92 megabytes. I had taken control.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I ran Disk Defragmenter. It took nearly an hour for it to
sort all the scattered bits of data on my hard drive, group
together related pieces and identify my most frequently used
programs for faster access. It was time well spent. Then I boldly
deleted a half-dozen or so superfluous programs that I had
installed to evaluate during the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What I wanted to do next was to sort through all the files on
the disk and delete useless, duplicate versions. But since I could
find no system tool to do that, I decided to ask Kip Crosby,
co-author of ``The Windows 98 Bible,'' for a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   I clicked on the icon to start Eudora to send him e-mail and
realized immediately that I had done something wrong. Eudora
refused to respond. Instead, a window appeared to inform me that
the program could not locate an essential file called MSVCRT40.dll
in my Windows System folder.
</P>
<P>
   My heart sank. I must have deleted the file. But how?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way of knowing,'' Crosby said cheerfully, after I
reached him by phone. It turned out the missing file contained a
chunk of code that the operating system relies on to run any number
of programs that execute common functions. ``Maybe you deleted it
as part of an application that you removed,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Eudora needed the file, wouldn't it have created a
separate copy during installation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily,'' Crosby said. ``If two programs installed
the same file in the same folder, one copy would overwrite the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   My only choice was to go over to my husband's computer, copy the
missing file onto a floppy, then transfer it to my computer. This
took longer than expected (surprise!) because the floppy, which I'd
bought for use on a Macintosh, had to be reformatted. Plus, I had
to take a break to retrieve the baby from the computer graveyard,
where she was trying to insert her foot into the CD-ROM drive of an
expired Power PC.
</P>
<P>
   The fix worked, but I realized only after I replaced
MSVCRT40.dll that another version had existed all along on my hard
drive, in the Tools 95 folder. But Eudora could not see it because
the central database called the Windows Registry typically points
programs toward the Windows Systems folder.
</P>
<P>
   This reminder that I was not in control of my computer is the
sort of thing that used to scare me. But no more. It turns out that
computers are like life. You cannot avoid honest mistakes.
Sometimes you fix them, sometimes you can't, sometimes they fix
themselves. In any case, be glad you tried something new.
</P>
<P>
   With Eudora cured and the baby's efforts rerouted toward banging
a defunct keyboard against the cat, I felt brave enough to test a
program (recommended by Crosby) called Dupeless. Published by PC
Magazine last spring, Dupeless is designed to identify duplicate
files and remove them.
</P>
<P>
   After I obtained the program from
 &UR; www.hotfiles.com/utilities.html &LR; , Dupeless found 272 duplicates on
my hard drive. All I had to do was check off the ones I wanted to
delete.
</P>
<P>
   But I had been burned once already, so I phoned Dupeless'
creator, Neil J. Rubenking. ``Is it safe to delete a weird file if
you have a bunch of copies?'' I asked him. ``Also, I see a bunch of
duplicate .dll files. That got me into trouble before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenking gave me some tips:
</P>
<P>
   If you have duplicates, do not delete the version in the Windows
Systems folder _ that's the one likely to be shared by programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, instead of immediately deleting duplicates, send them to
the Recycle Bin for a few days, until you're sure you will not need
to retrieve any.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, examine the contents of each file. If you
cannot identify its purpose, leave it for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I threw out another four megabytes of unnecessary
junk and the coupon for the car wash. The whole room looks cleaner.

REVIVING THE GLORY OF STRING QUARTETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Aug. 30)  
 (JT)  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's odd how quickly the world forgets about chamber players.
For a time they may occupy something close to center stage in the
public imagination, then, almost without warning, they disappear
from the scene. The process may seem natural where retirement or
death is concerned. Still, it is hard to see why the performers
should vanish from the communal memory.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the presence of several faces, rather than one, is a
factor. Certainly, conductors, star soloists and opera singers
often dominate discussion long after they have stopped practicing
their art. Some (like Toscanini, Horowitz, Heifetz and Callas)
virtually transcend death, haunting their successors as
unassailable specters. But matters are different for chamber
musicians, even great ones. The Budapest and Amadeus Quartets cast
giant shadows over the world of chamber music not long ago, but who
talks of them now? And who clamors for reissue of their old
records?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Testament, a small British label, has seen fit to buck
convention by reissuing waves of old string quartet recordings on
CD. Not long ago, it brought renewed attention to the Hollywood
String Quartet and the Pro Arte Quartet of Belgium, and now it
shines a light on two post-World War II European ensembles, the
Smetana Quartet and the Quartetto Italiano.
</P>
<P>
   Testament's Smetana series actually began a few years ago, with
a pair of Dvorak and Janacek CD's. Now four generously filled disks
of music by Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky and
Brahms expand our appreciation of the taut yet expressive style of
this ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Prague in 1945, the Smetana Quartet didn't assume its
final form until 1956, when Milan Skampa, the violist, joined Jiri
Novak and Lubomir Kostecky, the violinists, and Antonin Kohout, the
cellist. The group disbanded in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Quartetto Italiano, in its early years, and the storied
Kolisch Quartet, the Smetanaperformed without scores and honed its
playing relentlessly. As a result, it achieved an extraordinarily
balanced and focused sound, but its playing was also distinguished
by vibrancy and sinew.
</P>
<P>
   On an album of Mozart, Haydn and Schubert from the mid-'60s (SBT
1118), the Smetana's talents show to excellent effect. Its
performance of Mozart's ``Dissonance'' Quartet starts creepily, but
a cheery spirit soon prevails. Only a labored Menuetto disappoints
amid the tight energy of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Two Haydn Quartets, the ``Bird'' and the ``Lark,'' are even
better. The Smetana connects uncannily with this music, melding
authority and high-stepping joy with soaring, sparkling bowing and
robust tone. And the controlled verve in Schubert's
``Quartettsatz,'' which concludes the disk, is no less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   An album of three Mozart works (SBT 1117) includes the Smetana's
first recordings with Skampa, in the Quartets in D minor (K. 421)
and E flat (K. 428), both from 1956. Though an attractive folklike
quality suffuses the performances, the music's inherent elegance is
never compromised, and the group's unwavering ensemble is
remarkable. In the E flat Quartet, effervescence competes with
concentrated intensity. Contrast comes in the A major Quartet (K.
464), recorded in 1966, with a more fluid, relaxed pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Smetana adds another cellist, Milos Sadlo, in a 1973 account
of Schubert's glorious String Quintet, approaching the work with
bold attacks and sustained drama (SBT 1120). The Adagio may be too
swift, but the players lend irresistible Gypsy verve to the finale.
Brahms' B flat String Quartet, an often disappointing work, is also
included and becomes, in the Smetana's hands, a showcase for
flights of string fancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Romantic spirit surfaces again in a disk devoted to
Schumann, Schubert and Tchaikovsky (SBT 1119). Schumann's Piano
Quintet, with the able Pavel Stepan at the keyboard, opens the disk
on a note of infectious exuberance. The Smetana is at its most
ebullient here, digging into the composer's sweet phrases with
relish. A gentler but still sprightly touch graces Schubert's E
flat Quartet (D. 87). And the group offers a schmaltz-free yet
moving account of Tchaikovsky's First Quartet; even the famous
Andante Cantabile sounds fresh. The performances were recorded in
the mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Smetana Quartet reissues, which concentrate on the
ensemble's prime, Testament's three Quartetto Italiano disks focus
on an earlier period: the 1950s, when that group's playing was
characterized by winning spontaneity and natural charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Quartetto Italiano was formed in 1945 by four music students
who had met in Siena, and was forced to change violists a mere two
years later. Piero Farulli assumed the vacant chair, joining Paolo
Borciani and Elisa Pegreffi, the violinists (who married each other
in 1952), and Franco Rossi, the cellist. From then until 1977, when
Farulli suffered a heart attack, the quartet's personnel remained
unchanged. The group disbanded in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Italiano, one of the most refined of quartets, deftly
combined innate musicality with unforced urbanity. In later years,
a cool perfection crept into its interpretations, but here, in
vibrant yet poised performances, elegant phrasing, a light, airy
tone and gentle bowing carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   A disk of works by Vitali, Vivaldi, Galuppi, Boccherini and
Cambini (SBT 1124) brings together material from two of the group's
finest LP's (``The Italian String Quartet in the 17th Century'' and
``The Italian String Quartet in the 18th Century,'' recorded in
1956 and 1957), and makes for an excellent introduction to its
craft. Lavishing attention on what is essentially an assortment of
bonbons, the Italiano fuses a slightly astringent tone with
impeccable, mellow phrasing. The results, like a fine Barolo wine,
are a treat.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of Haydn, Mozart and Schubert quartets (SBT 1125),
mostly from 1956, provides more substantial pleasures. The
recording of Haydn's ``Bird'' Quartet offers significantly less
rhythmic thrust than the Smetana account but no dearth of
ebullience.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Italiano's complete survey of Mozart's string
quartets on Philips (recorded between 1966 and 1973) remains justly
famous, the two Mozart items here hold special appeal. The ``Hunt''
Quartet is full of un-self-conscious dash, with a quirky Minuet and
a songful Adagio lending character. The G major Quartet (K. 156),
which was recorded in 1959, is also endearingly rendered, its
punchy Minuet almost blared by the players. The disk closes with
the first complete recording of Schubert's Quartet in C (D. 32). By
turns sober and bright, this performance has yet to be improved on,
almost 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting disk is one devoted to Prokofiev,
Stravinsky, Milhaud and Malipiero (SBT 1123). Though the Italiano
was an exemplary interpreter of the Classical and Romantic styles,
it was also a sincere advocate of more modern repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Prokofiev's folk-inflected Second Quartet proves a superb
vehicle for the group in a 1955 account that is as heartfelt as it
is technically adept. In Stravinsky's Three Pieces for String
Quartet, recorded in 1959, the Italiano zealously spins sharp
phrases and clean lines.
</P>
<P>
   Darius Milhaud dedicated his 12th Quartet to the memory of
Faure, but it more recalls the Debussy and Ravel Quartets, of which
the Italiano was a celebrated interpreter. In its 1954 account of
the Milhaud, the ensemble gives a loving, supple tribute to a minor
but attractive work.
</P>
<P>
   A compatriot of the Italiano players, Gian Francesco Malipiero
wrote eight string quartets. His Fourth, featured here in a 1955
recording, is a muscular yet lyrical ode. The group, treating it as
a work of consequence, elevates the music.
</P>
<P>
   Authoritative, lucid notes by the Scottish-born quartet scholar
Tully Potter add to the value of both the Italiano and the Smetana
CD's.
</P>
<P>
   Testament's commitment to the art of string quartet playing may
not single-handedly rescue a form of music-making in need of
greater attention. But the label forcibly reminds listeners that
past glories have present implications and that chamber players of
today descend from various traditions. Keeping that history alive
helps to preserve options and prevent homogeneity. Other labels,
big and small, should follow Testament's lead.

   &UR; Gazing Globes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wonder if you can tell me something about the history of
gazing globes. They seem to be very popular in gardens all across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   A. They seem to go in and out of fashion quicker than the image
shifts as you approach one. Over the last few years, the popularity
of gazing globes, those mirrored balls in various colors that are
commonly seen on concrete pedestals in the middle of a lawn, has
been rising.
</P>
<P>
   Glass globes should not be included in the same class as plaster
gnomes and pink flamingos. Globes date at least to 13th-century
Venice, where they were seen as symbolic of fertility. The colors
used in the glass also contained meaning: red was said to preserve
love, green guaranteed a good harvest, blue prevented war (if only
it were that simple). They became basic equipment for witches, who
would stare into them and enter a trance.
</P>
<P>
   Glass globes became garden ornaments sometime before 1625, when
Francis Bacon suggested letting the sunlight play on them. By the
1870s, they were being made in America and were especially popular
in Southern gardens. These days, the globes are thinner glass,
coated inside with a reflective powder, mirroring and distorting
over a huge angle.
</P>
<P>
   One reason they are popular may be the variety of ways we can
use them. Sitting in isolation out on the front lawn, they become
objects in themselves and pretty weird ones at that. But gardeners
with more imagination place them on the ground among the plants or
on the bank of a pond, where they can have an effect on the viewer,
condensing and changing the garden itself. Moved on whim and
contemplated with some leisure, mirrored globes can change the
perspective of garden and gardener alike.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sticky Attack &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! My birch trees are being attacked and killed by
sapsuckers. What can you tell me about why they attack certain
trees, what can be done to protect the trees, and is there any way
to discourage the birds from girdling the trunks with holes?
</P>
<P>
   A. Your birches are a busy place as the yellow-bellied sapsucker
uses them not only for food, but also for communicating with other
birds in the area. But the sapsuckers aren't killing the trees
because the neat little rows of holes they drill, sometimes
horizontal and sometimes vertical, do not cut off much of the
supply of nutrients and water flowing up and down the tree's
vascular system. When they rap for communication, they hold their
beaks in a way that doesn't injure the tree. The cause of the
decline may be birch borer or another problem, but the sapsucker's
interest is just coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sapsuckers especially like birch and apple trees, but they use
more than 275 species of trees, shrubs and even vines as a place to
obtain a one-stop balanced diet. When they find a tree they like,
they may return to it year after year. Unlike their woodpecker
cousins, sapsuckers are not attracted to stressed trees and are not
looking for insects under the bark. They simply find the soft inner
bark and the sap nutritious, and when the holes fill, the sap
attracts and traps insects. When the bird returns after doing
whatever it is that birds do between meals, there is a bonus of a
little extra protein.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to discourage the attack, depending on the size
of the tree and your climbing ability. Sapsuckers are migratory
birds, and make their tree choices when they arrive, from late
March through April. Individual trees can be covered with light
plastic netting, although that is usually done only for commercial
fruit and nut trees. The visual effect of a tall birch covered in
netting, swaying mysteriously in the evening breeze may be somewhat
disconcerting. Besides, the birds are beautiful and the damage
isn't serious, so why not just relax and get out your binoculars? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43d St., New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening(AT)nytimes.com.
Those of general interest will be published. Unpublished questions

BATCHES OF BUTTERFLIES CAN BE BOUGHT OR SIMPLY STUDIED FROM AFAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wide Web captures everything in its sticky threads,
including just about anything anyone would ever want to know about
butterflies. Flitting from link to link can yield serendipitous
sitings and other drops of nectar.
</P>
<P>
   At www.holeinhand.com, for example, the site for a butterfly
farm in Hazelton, Pa., you can discover how to purchase live
butterflies to release at ``weddings, graduations, corporate
events, divorces, anniversaries, grand openings, births and
funerals.'' Before shipment, all butterflies are hand-fed and
exercised to guarantee health, according to the site, though the
concept of butterflies doing calisthenics stretches the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The Butterfly Web Site (butterflywebsite.com/series.htm), touts
the releasing of butterflies at events as ``more ecologically sound
than rice or balloons,'' though make sure to release lepidoptera
that are native to your region, so as not to disturb the gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   The site discusses how butterfly farms can be started on just a
windowsill or desktop. Under frequently asked questions, there's a
listing of how to say butterfly in 51 languages, including
Indonesian (kupu-kupu), Malaysian (rama-rama) and the Australian
aboriginal tongue, Wiradjuri, (buuja-buuja). There's also a
bulletin board section, where you can join the three dozen others
who have read postings like ``Butterflies in my coneflowers.''
</P>
<P>
   For a listing of pictures and natural history of the butterflies
by state and other parts of North America, check out
butterflywebsite.com/articles/npwc/butterflychecklist.htm. This
site is as good as some nature guides, where one learns that in
Washington the Bramble Green Hairstreak lays its eggs singly on the
flower buds of its host plants. And take a look at
www.discovery.com/area/science/micro/butterfly.html to see a
butterfly wing magnified 650 times.
</P>
<P>
   You can also trace or help report the progress of the annual
migration of monarch butterflies, through the Journey North
(www.learner.org/jnorth/current.html). And at the same site,
classrooms in the United States and Canada can pair up with those
in Mexico to send symbolic butterflies south for the winter.
``Mexican students will watch over them _ and return them next
spring as the real monarchs journey north,'' the site says.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly-related volunteer opportunities can be found on the
Web, too. Amateur and professional butterfly watchers are needed to
monitor trends in butterfly populations for five consecutive days
or five years, (www.cfe.cornell.edu/oneshots/butterfly.html).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing page is not simply about
butterflies, but about the myths and superstitions humans have
concocted about them, like those found at
(www.insects.org/ced4/symbollist3.html). One example given says
that according to Funk and Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary of
Folklore, Mythology and Legend, ``To get a new dress all a girl
need do is to catch a butterfly of the desired color and crush it
between her teeth while muttering a magic formula,'' and ``Some say
that if a butterfly is put in a gun, it is impossible to miss the
target.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who wondered why some angels were pictured with
butterfly wings in medieval times, and even for those who did not,
the site explains: ``The Serbians look on the butterfly as the soul
of a witch and believe if they can find her body and turn it around
while she is asleep, the soul will not be able to find her mouth
and re-enter, and the witch will probably die.''
</P>
<P>
   It may sound odd, but after all, the Greeks used the same word
for both butterfly and soul.

THE ART OF DRIVING IS ALL THE RAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once you have come to terms with the number of computers inside
your car, try looking at the number of cars on your computer _ Web
sites devoted to just about all aspects of the automotive
experience. And when it comes to popular driving topics on the Web,
road rage is all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage, the phenomenon of agitated drivers' becoming
aggressive, dangerous and potentially lethal to other drivers, has
triggered a number of sites set up to record license plates and
automotive offenders on the Web. Yahoo keeps a comprehensive index
of recent news stories and Web pages about the topic
(headlines.yahoo.com/FullCoverage/US/RoadRage).
</P>
<P>
   Two rage pages in particular take vastly differing views on the
subject. The Principles of Driving Psychology
(www.aloha.net/dyc/ch11.html) is a paper published on the Web by
Dr. Leon James that explores attitudes and moral implications
concerning transportation manners among individuals. A lengthy
treatise on human behavior behind the wheel, the page also offers a
test called What's Your Moral Driving IQ? (Sample yes-or-no
question: ``When I encounter road-hugging pedestrians, I feel like
pushing them out of my way.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you are in the mood for more rage than road, try the scathing
site How to Drive Like a Moron (members.aol.com/doggiesnot).
Decorated with illustrations and animations that bring to mind the
look of Comedy Central's crudely animated ``South Park'' cartoon,
the site sarcastically compiles just about every possible
bad-driving habit as part of its instruction in the art of idiot
behavior. In the Shopping Center Parking Lots area, for example,
the site suggests: ``Always park on the lines, taking up as many
spaces as possible. Diagonal parking is preferred.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size and traffic congestion, the New York
metropolitan area most likely has more than its share of angry
drivers. For those wanting to know what they're getting into before
leaving the office, there's the Metro Commute site, which will let
you check a number of local regions for accident alerts,
construction areas and traffic warnings and posts an illustrated
map regularly (www.metrocommute.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you've finally made it home and find yourself locked in the
Web's slow lane, you can even check out the Internet Traffic Report
(www.internettrafficreport.com) to see how much congestion the Net
is under. And remember, whether you're driving a Jeep Cherokee or a
Dell Pentium, let's be careful out there.

PUTTING A VIRTUAL DOGGY IN YOUR WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do we train pets, or do they train us?
</P>
<P>
   It's a disturbing question when your pet is a string of ones and
zeroes. It's even more disturbing when the digital pet in question
isn't some low-resolution key-chain toy with no intelligence or
personality. Demanding as they are, Tamagotchis aren't complex
enough to sustain a real relationship _ they're more like goldfish
or sea monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   But what about something that wags its tail, learns tricks,
likes to play fetch and pants contentedly when scratched behind the
ears? What about something that engages in spontaneous games of
tug-of-war, buries its toys, knocks things over on your desktop and
looks guilty when it has been bad?
</P>
<P>
   What about something that acts so much like a puppy that you
can't help adoring it and scolding it _ despite yourself?
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with Petz. Dogz 3, PF Magic's virtual answer
to man's best friend (CD-ROM for Windows 95, $29.95, to be released
in October), looks and acts so much like a genuine canine that you
end up behaving like a genuine pet owner. (PF Magic will
simultaneously release Catz 3, but software that fastidiously
ignores you is somehow less impressive.)
</P>
<P>
   Like real pets, these artificially intelligent puppies and
kittens need affection and care. You have to feed them, but you
also have to play with them, reward them when they're good and
punish them when they're bad. If you want the virtual doggy in the
window, you have to sign a pledge to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it's a software licensing agreement that demands
emotional commitment. A dialogue box pops up, you enter your name
and the contract appears:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that I, J.C., play with Petz 3:
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise to give Oscar, my Dachshund, love and affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise to feed and play with Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise to pet Oscar and reward good behavior with treatz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that if neglected or abused, Oscar will run away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accept this Adoption Pledge, please press the Adopt
Button.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've agreed to all these care and feeding conditions, you
are the proud owner of a brand new virtual puppy that, given enough
food and love, will grow to full adult size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you will need accessories for this.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Petz 3 Toy Closet on the disk is stacked with
food and water bowls, treats, rattles, Frisbees, bones, pillows,
chew toys and other doggie playthings. Should you be inclined to
subject your pet to the indignity of clothing, there is also a
Clothes Closet full of baseball caps, socks, sweaters and other
ridiculous costumery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the notes that accompany these items (``Dogz love to
dress up with the Plaid Sweater''), even virtual canines look
extremely sad when clothing is inflicted on them and will initially
try to wriggle out of it.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find the right doggie knickknacks on the disk, you
can always hit the Web site,  &UR; www.petz.net &LR; , where more than
500,000 people have registered their Dogz and Catz and regularly
download new breedz and toyz, at no charge. For now.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've stocked up on pet necessities, you can watch your
virtual puppy play in several locations: the backyard, with a white
clapboard fence and the sound of lawn mowers in the background; the
family room, with a fireplace you can turn on and off; the kitchen,
or a beach where your dog can gambol in the sand and get its nose
bitten by a crab.
</P>
<P>
   You can even take your puppy out on the desktop, where it will
scamper over your carefully aligned file folders and bound up to
your cursor, toy in mouth, while you have other programs running.
(Finally, something to do while waiting for Web pages to download _
play fetch!) Toss a Frisbee across the screen, and the dog will
eventually learn to leap and catch it.
</P>
<P>
   If you ignore the dog, it will push its water bowl around for a
while and finally curl up to sleep. Sometimes you can hear its
little doggy snores. But even when it's just snoozing silently, it
provides a sense of companionship. It keeps you company. So you end
up working on this kind of domesticated desktop with the dog's food
and water bowls and chew toys lying all over the place while you
crunch numbers on a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the Petz program is running, a thin blue bar at
the bottom of the screen is prompting you to interact with your
cybernetic companion: ``Double-click anywhere to call your Petz to
your cursor . . . Reward and train your Petz for good behavior by
feeding and petting them . . . Discipline your Petz with the Spray
Bottle when they are naughty . . . Teach your Petz to do tricks _
hold a treat out for them and see.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the big difference between Dogz and Tamagotchis
becomes obvious. Tamagotchis are annoying because, when you take
care of them, there's no real reward _ just a break before they
beep for more attention. They're bratty. Dogz, on the other hand,
really know how to emote. They know how to express need. And they
love you to pieces when you give them what they want.
</P>
<P>
   When Dogz are thirsty, their tongues hang out and their eyes
sort of plead. The dialogue bar flashes ``Quench your Petz' thirst
with some cool, refreshing water.'' So you set the water bowl down,
and the little fella runs over to it. The computer executes the
``dog lapping water'' sound file. And the pup looks happy and licks
your cursor, and you feel swell. Dogz know how to deliver the
emotional payoff that motivates users _ behind those adorable
little muzzles is some rather sophisticated artificial intelligence
code. And it's training you.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I've lost track of how much time I spent teaching
my virtual dog to catch a Frisbee on the computer screen. But when
Oscar finally leapt up and caught the thing in his mouth, I felt
like a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Humanz can do tricks. Hold a treat out for them and see.

   TEMPE, Ariz. - Five-year-old Nikolay Dimitrov speaks Bulgarian
fluently, but still can't understand English.
</P>
<P>
   Piroska Barabas, 10, switches between Hungarian and English in a
flash.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Norman Tan prefers English but can carry on in
Cantonese or Mandarin too.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four nationalities. Twenty-five different languages. One
school.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hugh E. Laird Elementary in Tempe. The school is a
melting pot of cultures, a mini-United Nations and a picture of
America in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of our diversity,'' explains Mary Lou Torres,
principal of Laird, where about 64 percent of the population is
minority. ``This is the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Arizona are seeing more of a racial
mix,'' says John Wright, vice president of the Arizona Education
Association. ``That's being reflected in our schools. And I believe
the cultural diversity it brings will be a benefit to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, many schools across the country are witnessing
dramatically changing populations.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, about 43 percent of the students in primary and
secondary schools are members of a racial minority, according to
Rose O'Keefe of the Arizona Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tempe districts, that translates into 67 different
languages at its campuses. Phoenix Union High School District
boasts 70 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than one-third of all students are members of a
racial minority, according to Annette Kolodny, who takes a look at
21st-century education in her book ``Failing the Future.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage is even higher in California, New Mexico, Texas,
Mississippi and the District of Columbia. In those states, Kolodny
says, more than half of the students are minorities. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ASU, CHURCHES SEND SOME
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fueling this trend are immigration and higher birth rates for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   School officials at Laird attribute its diversity to Arizona
State University and church groups who sponsor families from
war-torn and economically ravaged countries.
</P>
<P>
   Situated less than two miles from Laird, ASU has many
foreign-born students who, while pursuing their degrees, send their
children to Laird, if they live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   That's why second-grader Aishen Shi is attending Laird. Her
family moved to Phoenix from China so her father could obtain a
doctorate in engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, it seems like we add one or two more
nationalities,'' said Torres. This year, for instance, Romania and
Argentina were added to Laird's list of countries.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' office is a testament to the school's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   On a bookshelf behind her desk rests an assortment of trinkets
from around the world. In a delicate box, a miniature calligraphy
set from Korea is on display. From Singapore, there is a statue of
a ``merlion,'' a beast that is half-lion and half-fish.
Representing Costa Rica is a cup and saucer and from Thailand, an
urn.
</P>
<P>
   Having classmates from so many different cultures benefits
children in many ways, according to parents and experts.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, children grow up with fewer prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see the color of a person's skin,'' says Laurie
Staalberg, an American who has a fifth-grade son and first-grade
daughter attending Laird. ``Their friends are their friends. They
don't care what country they come from. It's very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``40 Ways to Raise a Nonracist Child,'' Mary Ann
French and Barbara Mathias write that one of the best ways to
eliminate racism is to encourage children to play with youngsters
from different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto L. Pulido, an assistant professor of racial relations at
ASU, explains: Being exposed to so many different cultures in such
a positive environment ``creates a more sensitive community, and
the children benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The view of the world is also much larger for these children. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NO HUNGARIAN ICE CREAM?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a break in class, for instance, Norina Asante, from Ghana
in Africa, and her best friend Piroska Barabas, the young
Hungarian, talk about differences in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Piroska chatters about what her country looks like and how
people there live. Then she states in complete disbelief: ``But
they have no playgrounds. And we couldn't get any ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Norina returns the banter, talking about life in Ghana. One
benefit of her country, she confesses: ``You don't have to worry
about people stealing you there like you do in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding hands, the girls talk about how they met in the first
grade. Barabas was crying because she didn't speak any English and
couldn't understand the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held her hand,'' says Norina, bobbing her head and sending
the multitude of braids on her head shaking. The two then skip off
to another part of the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the richness of cultures is evident.
</P>
<P>
   In Jean Behrens' fourth-grade class, students are quietly
studying English when Norman Tan breaks out in Cantonese. A
classmate who recently arrived from China is asking him about the
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   As they talk, a girl from Latin America marvels at the sight and
boasts: ``He can speak three different languages. I only speak
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Norman explains that the two were discussing the
``physical properties'' of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   But language isn't the only new subject to learn. American food
can be very perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Laird kindergartners ate lunch in the English as a
second language classroom. There they would learn about American
food.
</P>
<P>
   Why are hamburgers called hamburgers when they have no ham? What
are the English names of foods they already enjoy _ like cabbage,
broccoli and lentils?
</P>
<P>
   The school week for many of these children doesn't end on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese children, like Norman, must attend ``Saturday
school,'' where they learn to read, write and speak the language of
their homeland. That way, Norman explains, if they return to China,
he'll know the language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like English better,'' confesses Norman. ``Chinese is too
hard.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Cheesy covers aside, John's talent apparent
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Musical footnotes such as this odd relic rarely deserve more
than passing mention. But this intriguing compilation from the
vaults is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded during Elton John's salad days for a variety of labels,
the 16 tracks on this collection offer a rare glimpse of the
part-time Atlanta resident before he navigated the slippery slope
from unknown studio musician to pop music superstar.
</P>
<P>
   There is much here that John no doubt would prefer remain locked
away. His cheesy covers of Badfinger's ``Come and Get It,'' White
Plains' ``My Baby Loves Loving'' and Brotherhood of Man's ``United
We Stand'' are wince-inducing. And the AM-radio production values,
Mormon Tabernacle Choir harmonies and tinny string backdrops that
warp these ersatz classics make them sound as dated and shallow as
any Osmond Brothers LP.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface of these obvious cut-and-run commercial
recordings, there is some real gold that reflects John's
distinctive musical signature. His soulful retread of Cat Stevens'
somber ``Lady D'Arbanville'' hints marvelously at the introspective
side that would mark his later work with Bernie Taupin on tracks
such as ``Your Song'' and ``Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.'' At the
other extreme, his raucous, wide-open readings of Stevie Wonder's
``Signed Sealed Delivered'' and Creedence Clearwater Revival's ``Up
Around the Bend'' echo the R&AMP;B boogie of such early hits as ``Take
Me to the Pilot'' and ``Honky Cat.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is an eclectic mixture with at least as many
misses as direct hits. But John's soulful vocals and personalized
piano riffing distinguish the collection, making it more than
simply a retrospective worthy of the K-Tel brigade.
</P>
<P>
   ``16 Legendary Covers from 1969/70''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John. Purple Pyramid. 16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A guilty pleasure for Elton fans.

 &HT;    Audio minireviews: The latest word on the latest sounds

   -- SOUNDTRACK
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to Titanic''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Sony. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   How much more money can be wrung out of the highest-grossing
movie of all time? Apparently, the makers of this follow-up to the
25 million-selling ``Titanic'' soundtrack think, a smidge more. But
far from being a slapdash effort, ``Back to Titanic'' is a tasty
sampler of leftovers and re-recorded numbers from the original
soundtrack. The Irish jig music from the below-decks party scene is
included, as is the formerly promotional-only recording of the
Celine Dion megahit ``My Heart Will Go On,'' with dialogue added.
All in all, a quality product, and timely too, because it's sure to
get a big sales boost from the video release of ``Titanic'' on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   -- ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``See Through Me''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Bramblett.
</P>
<P>
   Capricorn Records. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Known primarily for his keyboard and sax work with Sea Level,
Gregg Allman and Steve Winwood, this journeyman session player and
Georgia native takes center stage on his first solo album in 20
years. Bramblett has made little effort to modernize during that
time _ ``See Through Me'' mines a very organic, very 1970s groove.
The title track recalls the extra-crispy R&AMP;B of Delbert McClinton;
``I Burn for Someone'' walks the same lonely city streets Bruce
Springsteen drifted down on ``Darkness on the Edge of Town.'' If
the lyrics tend toward the generic,
lost-soul-in-search-of-redemption variety, the evocative,
heart-grabbing melodies carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   -- COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping Stone''
</P>
<P>
   Lari White. Lyric Street. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of fiddle and pedal steel as the backdrop for lyrics
describing Daddy turning on the sprinkler and kids running through
it ``in our underwear,'' then catching fireflies and putting them
in a jar, they can't say Lari White ain't country enough anymore.
That was the knock when RCA pulled the plug on her record deal a
couple of years ago. She's back to prove them wrong. The title
track may be an autobiographical comment on her journey: ``This
ain't no stumbling block, it's just a stepping stone.'' This solid
set is terrific proof.
</P>
<P>
   -- POP
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Masses''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists.
</P>
<P>
   1500/A&AMP;M. 16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   This tribute to Depeche Mode by musicians inspired by the
pioneering synth British pop group isn't nearly as calculated as
other recent ``tribute'' projects. What's more, the quality of the
assembled material is both inventive and as nearly addictive as the
original versions. The only previously released track is an
excellent cover of ``Never Let Me Down Again'' that the Smashing
Pumpkins recorded in 1993. Other surprise treats include a
synth-stripped, rocked-up version of ``Policy of Truth'' by
Dishwalla and the unexpectedly touching cover of ``Somebody'' by
Veruca Salt. The oddest contribution is fellow influential Brit act
the Cure doing ``World in My Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   -- BLUES
</P>
<P>
   ``Come On In''
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Burnside.
</P>
<P>
   Fat Possum/Epitaph. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether listeners hear R.L. Burnside's music as
amped-up electric blues, an insult to tradition or blues for the
millennium, it's worth hearing. Burning away under the sound
supplied by Burnside's family band and the high-tech mixing of Tom
Rothrock (perhaps best known for his work with Beck) is a solitary
Mississippi hill country bluesman with a guitar. It's as simple as
fife-and-drum music, yet so relentlessly insistent that it can win
acceptance as trance blues or punk blues. Key cuts include
``Rollin' Tumblin','' ``Been Mistreated'' and three takes of ``Come
On In.''

   Marisa Babjak laughs when she thinks about the noose pin she
sold to the judge in Florida, but she has other, more serious
things on her mind now. Like visiting the Orange County, Calif.,
morgue on a slow night to take a look at a few toe tags. She thinks
the toe tags will lend themselves nicely as a stern message to
friends and loved ones, as in, ``You're dead meat if you don't
write.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpleasant reality filtered through humor sells well for Ms.
Babjak, 39. She markets mystery-related items by catalog and
through her Web site, Femmes Fatales (mall6.register.com/femfatal).
There you can scroll through a limited list of gift items, like the
Mad Mother Shower Curtain, police patches from the former Soviet
Union, T-shirts and all manner of pins _ guns, hatchets, thumb
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Femmes Fatales opens a window on hundreds of mystery-related
Internet sites where people have taken up residence to chat, read
about their favorite authors, buy gifts and books, solve whodunits
and answer trivia questions. There are other Web pages dedicated to
Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, and modern authors like Sue
Grafton and John Grisham.
</P>
<P>
   Links to many of those can be found at Mysterious Strands
(www.idsonline.com/userweb/cwilson/mystery.htm).The sites tend to
leave trails, or links, to other sites, making it easy to find a
slew of others.
</P>
<P>
   There are true-crime sites, like Black Dahlia
(www.bethshort.com), and other reality-based fare, like the Smoking
Gun page (www.thesmokinggun.com). For a serving of rock-and-roll
and mystery, there's www.paulisdead.com, which invites you to solve
the drowning of a fictional rock star, Paul Lomo.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jiro Kimura, 49, of Kanazawa, Japan, writes a regular column on
the Internet mystery scene for Hayakawa's Mystery Magazine and
opened the Gumshoe page in January 1996 (www.nsknet.or.jp/jkimura).
``I usually write in Japanese to make money,'' she said in a recent
e-mail exchange, ``but I wanted to write something in English too
for non-Japanese mystery fans. I thought the Web site would be the
best way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the site, which is impressive in its simplicity, she
describes what's new and lists some of her favorite bookmarks.
``The Internet is just another means by which mystery fans
communicate with one another,'' Ms. Kimura said in her e-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Often that communication leads to a face-to-face visit at the
many mystery conventions held each year. At Partners &AMP; Crime, an
independent bookstore in New York City's Greenwich Village
(www.crimepays.com), e-mail correspondents who have been at the
shop's site looking for first-edition copies or original art make a
point of stopping at the store when they are in town, said Kizmin
Reeves, a partner in the store.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge world out there and it's really quite
diverse,'' said Patty Suchy, who runs Novel Explorations
(www.erols.com/novelexp), a travel company based in Columbia, Md.,
that this winter held a mystery-theme vacation cruise. ``People
become more aware to the possibilities on the Internet,'' she said,
where they can find like-minded groups and other places to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those with a particular interest in Sherlock Holmes, there
is the Sherlockian Holmepage
(watserv1.uwaterloo.ca/credmond/sh.html), created in 1995 by Chris
Redmond, author of ``A Sherlock Holmes Handbook.'' The idea, he
said, was to have a page pointing to all things about Sherlock
Holmes on the Web. ``Sherlockians have always been great at letter
writing and newsletters,'' he said. ``A lot of that has shifted on
the Web.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dahlinger, a writer in Secaucus, N.J., has signed onto two
mailing-list sites for mystery aficionados, mostly to do research,
she said. One is by invitation only, she said. The other, Hounds of
the Internet (www.bcpl.lib.md.us/lmoskowi/hounds/hounds.html), is
open to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Many authors and publishers are using the Internet to publish
the first couple of chapters in their books to get fans hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Babjak, who lives in Lakewood, Calif., said her Femmes
Fatales catalog and site grew out of her hobby of making and
selling gift items to mystery fans at conventions. Femmes Fatales
(French for ``deadly women'') was created with the help of her
husband, Jim, in 1995 to broaden her business and her love of
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   New morbid items may show up for sale at Femmes Fatales.
Customers like police officers, coroners and an entomologist Ms.
Babjak has nicknamed ``Maggot Man'' keep requesting more unique
items. When you think about it, she says, when's the last time you
saw a T-shirt for a bug guy?

 &HT;    Fugees' Hill taps roots of black pop
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An instant contender for album-of-the-year honors, the solo
debut of Fugees frontwoman Lauryn Hill is something to marvel at.
This autobiographical song cycle is an evolving treatise on
womanhood, spirituality, hip-hop and black history that seductively
weaves together seemingly every scrap of African-influenced musical
tradition you can imagine. Right down to the album's cover, a
likeness of the 23-year-old singer carved into the top of a school
desk that recalls the image of Bob Marley on the reggae star's
``Catch a Fire'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hip-hop is all about referencing and reinventing, but
Hill goes beyond the obvious in assimilating strands of reggae,
1960s and '70s R&AMP;B, Stevie Wonder's utopian melodies, guest
appearances by Carlos Santana and jazz violinist Regina Carter, and
even a sample of the Doors' ``Light My Fire.'' She seeks to embody
what critic Greg Tate once called the ``unified field theory'' of
African-American pop and, at the same time, assert herself as the
higher consciousness of hip-hop. ``People feel Lauryn Hill,'' she
sings on the cautionary ``Final Hour,'' ``from New-Ark to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   What shapes the album's complex mixture of protest, prophecy and
philosophy is a profound moral sensibility: a righteous vibe. Track
to track, Hill celebrates roots that stretch back centuries while
evoking a kind of biblical authority. Her duet with Mary J. Blige,
``I Used to Love Him,'' offers these lines of praise _ ``Father you
saved me and showed me that life / Was much more important than
being some foolish man's wife'' _ while on the sweet, redemptive
``To Zion,'' a tribute to her new son, Hill parallels her pregnancy
with the Annunciation. Coming from Tori Amos, that might seem
pretentious. Here, with Santana's unmistakable guitar in the
background, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill''
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill. Columbia. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>

 &HT;    Lesser names steal `Dance' thunder
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Credit Epic Records with good intentions. For this soundtrack to
the new Vanessa L. Williams movie, which sets a story about
professional ballroom dancers to an infectious Latin beat, the
label uses name acts _ Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada and Williams
herself _ to draw in listeners, then exposes them to purer Latin
artists, including Ruben Blades and Albita.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the bankable names threaten to douse the
fiery spirit that infuses this highly danceable disc. Sergio Mendes
gets the party started with the propulsive ``Magalehna,'' then
Estefan clears the floor with the flavorless disco workout
``Heaven's What I Feel.'' Cuban vocalist Albita revs things up
again with the ebullient salsa number ``Fiesta Pa' Los Rumberos,''
only to have Secada break the mood with the Muzak-ready ballad
``Want You, Miss You, Love You.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and her co-star, Puerto Rican singing sensation
Chayanne, croon two versions of the movie's love theme, ``You Are
My Home.'' The first is a slick ballad complete with goopy strings
and generically ``Latin'' guitars. Naturally, it's the single. The
second reconfigures the song as an upbeat salsa number, with far
better results. These two versions emphasize the soundtrack's
schizophrenic feel, which should have listeners of all stripes
leaping for the program button on their CD player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me _ Music From the Motion Picture''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Epic Records. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A spicy sampler of Latin music, but skip the bland bits from the
big names.

 &HT;    4 slain girls remembered
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``4 Little Girls'' (unrated)
</P>
<P>
   In September 1963, a bomb went off in the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham, killing four young girls. It was a
seminal act of cowardly savagery. And it had the unintended effect
of changing the bombers' world forever. In the words of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, ``We were able to transform a crucifixion into
resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's Oscar-nominated documentary works as both a portrait
of the murdered children (three of them 14, one 11) and a cruelly
poignant perspective on the civil rights movement, which the
bombing switched into a higher gear. The film gives us insight into
the now unthinkable segregation rules of the Deep South. We see
black-and-white footage of Police Chief ``Bull'' Conner's men
assaulting protesters with dogs and fire hoses. And Lee gets in his
licks against then-Gov. George Wallace, contrasting his
``segregation forever'' stance in the '60s with his current,
unconvincing claims that his best friend is an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie's second half could have used some tighter
organization, ``4 Little Girls'' is seeded with emotional land
mines. Heartbreaking moments occur unexpectedly as siblings and
parents remember the girls taken from them 35 years ago.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Keep summer spirit alive with blasts from the past
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the summer of 1998 fades into history, everybody probably has
at least one favorite summer movie they'd like to see again. But
with theaters changing bills to make room for the fall openings,
that might not be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few suggestions should you find yourself at the video
store and still in a summertime mood.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you liked ``Deep Impact'' ... check out ``On the Beach''
(1959). Set in the ``near future'' _ that would be 1964 _ Stanley
Kramer's film looks at the end of the world through a 1950s prism
of nuclear paranoia. After an atomic blast irradiates the Northern
Hemisphere, an all-star cast (including Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner,
Fred Astaire and a pre-``Psycho'' Anthony Perkins) await their
inevitable fate in Australia. The picture was actually shot in
Australia _ the first major Hollywood production to go on location
there. Gardner was heard to remark when she arrived, ``I'm here to
make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- If you liked ``There's Something About Mary'' ... check out
``Kingpin'' (1996). The Farrelly brothers had already had a hit
with ``Dumb and Dumber,'' but this riotous gross-out comedy about
bowling was, at the time, more than most audiences could take. Too
bad, because it's a marvel of mock-epic idiocy _ part ``The
Natural,'' part ``Ren and Stimpy.'' Woody Harrelson plays a bowling
phenom from the '70s whose career was sabotaged by the sleazy
reigning champ, Bill Murray. He gets a second chance coaching an
Amish lad (Randy Quaid) with a golden arm. As in ``Mary,''
anything's fair game: prosthetics, bodily fluids and more bad hair
than should be legally allowed in one movie.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you liked ``The Mask of Zorro'' ... check out ``The Mark
of Zorro'' (1940). A protege of 20th Century Fox mogul Darryl F.
Zanuck, Tyrone Power was more or less hand-picked by Zanuck to play
Zorro in this lavish remake of the Douglas Fairbanks silent
swashbuckler. To make up for not lending Power to a rival studio
for ``Golden Boy,'' Zanuck also hired that movie's director, Rouben
Mamoulian. Like the current Antonio Banderas-Anthony Hopkins film,
Power's version both buys into the derring-do and has fun with it
(in a '40s way). One nice bit of continuity: The master swordsman
who trained Fairbanks also coached Power. He gave him Fairbanks'
sword, too.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you liked ``Out of Sight'' ... check out ``Get Shorty''
(1996). It took star John Travolta, producer/co-star Danny DeVito
and director Barry Sonnenfeld to finally get Elmore Leonard
onscreen as he should be. This breezy adaptation of Leonard's novel
about murder, money and script meetings in Hollywood often follows
the book word for word. Miami loan shark Chili Palmer (Travolta)
travels to Los Angeles to chase down a bad debt. But when he meets
the guy who owes the dough _ cheesy Z-movie producer Gene Hackman _
Chili pitches him a screenplay instead of pitching him off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you liked ``The Truman Show'' ... check out ``The
Prisoner'' (1968-69).
</P>
<P>
   This made-in-Britain TV series ran only two summers (17 episodes
altogether), but it was one of the most distinctive programs ever
aired. Like ``The Truman Show,'' it's set in a deceptively
picturesque town (actually, a resort on Cardigan Bay in Wales)
where nothing can be taken at face value. However, as the title
suggests, the tone is considerably more ominous. The Prisoner
(a.k.a. No. 6) is a former government agent being held against his
will. Why? Any number of reasons. To extract top-secret
information. To keep him from sharing top-secret information.
Perhaps simply to test him. Star Patrick McGoohan created and
produced the series and also wrote some of the scripts.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you liked ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' or ``The Horse
Whisperer'' ... check out almost any of the Spencer Tracy-Katharine
Hepburn movies. It doesn't matter whether it's 1942's ``Woman of
the Year'' (about a political columnist and a sportswriter), 1952's
``Pat and Mike'' (about a star athlete and her trainer) or 1949's
``Adam's Rib'' (about married lawyers), because the setup is always
the same: high-handed, high-strung, stylish dame brought off her
pedestal by a gruff, down-to-earth, no-guff guy. Interestingly,
Tracy's contract guaranteed him first billing. When once asked
about this less than gallant behavior, he replied, ``A film isn't a
lifeboat.''

 &HT;    Mini views: Reviews of the latest on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Men With Guns'' (R) _ Writer-director John Sayles' (``Lone
Star'') mournful journey into a modern heart of darkness. Federico
Luppi (``Cronos'') plays a sheltered doctor in an unnamed Latin
American city who ventures into the mountains to check on the
students he trained three years ago to treat the country's poor
Indian natives. The mountains have been raked with guerilla warfare
for some time. And the deeper the doctor goes into them, the less
clear it becomes who is the enemy and who are the ``men with guns''
responsible for the carnage that he encounters everywhere. A
haunting modern parable, the film has the power of a terrible
dream. In Spanish, English and Indian dialects, with subtitles.
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Leading Man'' (R) _ Torn between his wife (Anna
Galiena) and actress mistress (Thandie Newton), a successful London
playwright (Lambert Wilson) agrees to an odd proposal: He'll let
the Hollywood actor (Jon Bon Jovi) who's starring in his new play
seduce his wife, in order to take the pressure off. Things don't go
as planned. Despite an attractive, talented cast, director John
Duigan's backstage comedy never really creates the wicked fun you
know it's after. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Woo'' (R) _ An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to
find true love amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is
the title character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy
behavior of guys that she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy
Davidson) with the determination to prove his innate canine drive.
Unfortunately, the movie walks a very fine line between making Woo
wacky and making her seem criminally insane. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World'' _ Actually, it's
not a new world, it's the old one: England, to be precise. And once
our Native American princess arrives there, this mediocre,
straight-to-video sequel dolls her up in European dresses and
makeup, sapping whatever all-natural life she had in the first
flick. The songs are forgettable, too. Priced to buy, $26.99.
Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Real Blonde'' (R) _ A fine ensemble cast reels around
the fringes of show biz in Tom DiCillo's entertaining episodic
film. Matthew Modine, Catherine Keener and Maxwell Caulfield are
thirtyish types working in (or trying to work in) various Manhattan
glamour jobs (acting, fashion, etc.). Heftier names such as Daryl
Hannah, Kathleen Turner, Denis Leary, Marlo Thomas and Buck Henry
turn up in assorted cameos. No major insights here, but it's
easygoing and funny. Grade: B

 &HT;    Author learns the political world in writing latest novel
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can accuse Richard North Patterson of not doing his
research. For his latest novel, ``No Safe Place'' (Knopf, $25.95),
the best-selling author of legal thrillers such as ``Degree of
Guilt'' and ``Silent Witness'' interviewed George Bush, traveled
with Bob Dole on his campaign, hung out with Secret Service agents,
and joined the roving band of reporters covering the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are honest with you if they know you are writing
seriously about this political world, and not doing a cartoon,''
says Patterson, 51, whose books have sold 6 million copies. ``One
thing I set out to do was to revive the political novel as a
serious form. What we've had in political fiction seems to be roman
a clefs or ridiculous books about conspiracies where someone
hijacks Air Force One. The last great political novel was `Advise
and Consent,' and that was written 40 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Patterson learned in his research was the lengths to
which reporters will go to unearth a political scandal, a key
element in his new novel. ``No Safe Place'' focuses on the
presidential campaign of Sen. Kerry Kilcannon, a charismatic Irish
politician haunted by the assassination of his brother during his
campaign in California 12 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the campaign, a right-to-life fanatic murders
three people at an abortion clinic and sets out to kill Kilcannon.
Complicating matters further is a secret affair that Kilcannon had
with one of the journalists covering the campaign _ an affair that
resulted in an abortion. When a reporter is handed a psychologist's
notes documenting the affair, he is torn between going with a
one-source story or ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   In the current atmosphere of tabloid journalism and the Monica
Lewinsky matter, Patterson admits such soul-searching may be rare.
``The prevailing belief seems to be that the press _ and the public
_ is entitled to know everything. Given the power of the press to
destroy careers, and indeed lives, any reporter with a conscience
is going to feel the qualms I portray here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's road to political novelist has been as circuitous as
a presidential campaign. As a lawyer in Birmingham in 1976, he
became hooked on Ross MacDonald novels and decided to write a
mystery himself. His first effort, ``The Lasko Tangent,'' won the
Edgar Allan Poe Award for best first novel. But by the mid-1980s,
his books were not selling and he quit writing for eight years.
When he tried again in 1992 with ``Degree of Guilt,'' the timing
was right for legal thrillers: It sold more than 250,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   After writing three more novels about the legal system,
Patterson decided to leave the courtroom for the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a natural evolution,'' says Patterson, who divides
between San Francisco and Martha's Vineyard with his third wife and
six children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in politics and social problems.
Pursuing the presidency is the modern odyssey. It is the most
difficult, invasive and grueling process an American can go
through. The risks are fantastic. Your opponents are scrutinizing
your every move. You have no safe place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   -- CHOICE DICKEY: Until now, if you wanted the best of James
Dickey's poems, you had to buy several different books. That
changes next month when Ohio University professor Robert Kirschten
publishes ``James Dickey: The Selected Poems'' (Wesleyan University
Press, $35), a collection of the poet's major works in one volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many visionary poets of the ecstatic imagination,''
Kirschten says, ``Dickey experimented in a wide variety of literary
styles. This volume brings together the finest work from each of
the periods in Dickey's extremely controversial career.''
</P>
<P>
   Included are ``Sleeping Out at Easter'' from ``Into the Stone
and Other Poems'' (1960), ``The Lifeguard'' from ``Drowning With
Others'' (1962), ``Cherrylog Road'' from ``Helmets'' (1964), and
``The Sheep Child'' from ``Falling'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
   -- LITERARY LINDY: Two very different books on Charles A.
Lindbergh are headed for stores next month. The major work is
``Lindbergh,'' A. Scott Berg's definitive biography, and the other
is ``Under a Wing,'' a personal memoir by Reeve Lindbergh, the
aviator's youngest daughter. Berg, the National Book Award-winning
author of ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,'' was granted access to
thousands of boxes of Lindbergh family papers by Anne Morrow
Lindbergh. ``Under the Wing,'' which was excerpted in The New
Yorker, gives an inside account of life with a stern father who was
larger than life. Also in the works is a film by Steven Spielberg
based on Berg's biography.

 &HT;    Here are paperback suggestions for readers who like to read
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers who like reading about reading will find plenty of pithy
axioms in Anna Quindlen's ``How Reading Changed My Life''
(Ballantine, $8.95). The Library of Contemporary Thought original
paperback will be especially enjoyable to baby boomers who grew up
hooked on books. Quindlen's essay is blessed with an amorphous
structure. Open it anywhere and ingest quotes like these:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``All of reading is really only finding ways to name
ourselves, and, perhaps, to name the others around us so that they
will no longer seem like strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``There are very few books in which male characters, much
less boys, are portrayed as devoted readers.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``At age thirteen, `David Copperfield' often seems less of an
invitation to `Bleak House' than a clarion call for Cliffs Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, readers who like reading Southern literature will
enjoy Padgett Powell's introduction to ``New Stories From the
South: The Year's Best, 1998'' edited by Shannon Ravenel
(Algonquin, $12.95). ``The literature of the South,'' Powell writes
in the preface, ``is full of people running around admitting or
denying their whippedness. The blend of this confession and denial
can be complex ... but finally that is the key: the people have
been whipped, and whipped good.'' Powell, Frederick Barthelme, Tim
Gautreaux, John Holman, Sara Powers and Mark Richard are among the
19 writers featured. Booklist says the collection illustrates that
the short story form continues to survive and evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Other new paperbacks include:
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Magician's Assistant'' by Ann Patchett (Harcourt Brace,
$13). When a magician dies, his widow, who had been his assistant
for 20 years, finds that the family he claimed he lost in an
accident is alive. Reviewers used words like ``elegant,''
``lyrical'' and ``beguiling'' to describe the novel.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Chin Kiss King'' by Ana Veciana-Suarez (Plume, $12.95).
A Miami neighborhood is the setting for this tale of three
generations of Cuban-American women and their care for a baby born
with a birth defect. The Boston Globe called it ``a powerful and
haunting story of the world of our spirits and spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Into the Forest'' by Jean Hegland (Bantam, $12.95). Two
sisters, living in a country on the brink of anarchy and collapse,
must forage through the forest, and their past, to survive.
Publishers Weekly says the book is ``a truly admirable addition to
a genre defined by the very high standards of George Orwell's
`1984.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's
Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion'' by Edward J. Larson
(Harvard, $14.95). Larson, a University of Georgia professor, won
the Pulitzer Prize in history for this account of the Scopes trial
and its impact on the teaching of evolution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Leaving a Doll's House'' by Claire Bloom (Back Bay,
$13.95). The stage and screen star recalls her accomplishments and
romances, including her turbulent 18 years with novelist Philip
Roth. While our AJC reviewer found that ``Bloom's voice on the page
just isn't likable,'' Newsweek noted that Bloom ``puts the
memorable back in memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``When Work Doesn't Work Anymore: Women, Work and Identity''
by Elizabeth Perle McKenna (Delta, $12.95). Women don't have to
choose between having a career and having a life. Time magazine
said that ``all working men and women can benefit'' from McKenna's
suggestions.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Four book history of Dahlonega is pure gold
 &HT;    (Embargoed until August 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people are writing books about their families and their
hometowns. Before they get going, I want to recommend that they
read Anne Amerson's four books about Dahlonega, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   So many hometown books are dull. One about a city I know pretty
well was written by an alleged historian. If it has a wisp of
history in it, I didn't find it. It is mainly a collection of mug
shots of local business leaders _ valuable for the town museum,
maybe, but not interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Amerson's ``I Remember Dahlonega,'' volumes 1-4, are great
fun to read and valuable keepsakes for future students of Lumpkin
County, the gold mining era and the people who settled there.
</P>
<P>
   I have to confess that the last of the series came when I was
somewhere else, got swallowed up by other books, and I didn't get
around to reading it until it fell on my head the other day. I took
it home to bed and read it before I slept.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dahlonega may be more colorful than most hometowns. I
love the names, for instance. There was a gold miner named Charles
and Napoleon Bonaparte Tankersley. (The ``and'' is part of the
name.) He was called ``Bony Tank.'' His descendants still live in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other families named Wimpy, Dowdy and Gooch. You
find yourself wishing you knew them all. I am especially sorry that
it's too late to get acquainted with Oscar Cannon, an amazingly
gifted woodworker who made spinning wheels and board games named
``Fox and Geese,'' using corn-like checkers to represent the fowls.
Mr. Cannon was doing this work at 97 years old. He died in 1995 at
age 98.
</P>
<P>
   There are gifted quilters in this mountain town. A young woman
named Nancy Patchell created an original for the Paralympic Games
in Atlanta. There is a picture of it in the book, and a good
discussion of the art of quilting.

   It reports that Ms. Patchell embroiders Bible quotations on many
of her works. A particularly moving one was ``This is the day the
Lord has made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.'' It was, the
author reports, an expression of her faith, and it sustained her in
her grief after her 12-year-old son was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The old courthouse, now a gold museum, has always been one of my
favorite places, and I was interested to read that when they
rebuilt it, they found the mud between the brick contained gold
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I missed another wonderful artifact _ mad stones. It
seems that a mad rock was used to draw poison from wounds caused by
snake bite and dog bite _ and you just may find one in Dahlonega,
because rock hounds abound there.
</P>
<P>
   You can even buy rocks at a shop on the square if you don't want
to prowl the mountainsides prospecting. But you will miss
beautiful, interesting scenery if you buy instead of finding.
</P>
<P>
   Many Georgians grew up reading the colorful Dahlonega Nugget,
which has been published since 1890. Jack Parks, former editor,
retiring in 1982, is remembered as being politically savvy and the
friend of people like Sens. Richard Russell and Walter George and
congressman Phil Landrum.
</P>
<P>
   But when President Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur, it did
not make the front page of The Nugget. The reason, Parks wrote, was
that ``news from Yahoola and Frogtown crowded the general off the
front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestatee Publications, Anne Amerson's company, published these
lovely books. You can reach her at 706-864-6589 or write Chestatee
Publications, 689 N. Chestatee St., Dahlonega, GA 30533.

 &HT;    Tri-fold, bi-fold or money clip: Chic wallets hold it all
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are always functional, sometimes fashionable but mostly
they're out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Today's sleek, streamlined wallets are small enough to slip
neatly into a pocket, yet large enough to do double-duty as a
stylish evening clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Women make the majority of wallet purchases, according to
retailers and manufacturers. Fifty percent of the wallet purchases
in the United States are made by women for women; women also make
70 percent of the wallet purchases for men.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Ratledge, of Norcross, has received plenty of wallets
during his 70 years, but still favors his 20-year-old,
barely-there, brown pocket secretary, which he enjoys pulling out
to the amusement of store clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Dunwoody investment banking partner Richard Lawry, of EGL
Holdings Inc., carries two 10-year-old black wallets _ one in his
jacket pocket for non-essentials and one in his back pocket for
credit cards, a driver's license and money.
</P>
<P>
   Wallet turnover for women occurs more frequently. Aida Flamm, of
Atlanta, has several and changes them, depending on which handbag
she carries. Her current favorite is a thin green alligator skin
that holds four credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Wallets made of fabric are this season's trend for women.
Water-resistant nylon or polyester microfiber offer a cutting-edge
look, especially in black, chocolate brown or red. Microfiber
wallets fall into the $28-$40 range.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular choices are crochets, denim and embossed faux
alligator looks. Leather, both textured and smooth, continues to be
the mainstay for wallet makers in classic brown, burgundy and tan,
as well as black, the number one color for men's and women's
wallets. Leather can go for $60-$120 or more; and if you prefer
exotic skins, look for prices starting at $250.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite wallet styles for women are the tri-fold clutch, the
zip-around with an accordion-style interior and the 7-inch rec-
</P>
<P>
   tangular wallet/checkbook combo.
</P>
<P>
   Popular fashion choices are anything from Coach, Fossil and 9
West. In designer wallets, Fendi, Chanel, Prada and Gucci get the
nod. Some can go for $500 for a leather clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Men won't be left holding an empty bag when it comes to stylish
choices, either.
</P>
<P>
   The bi-fold is popular because it's roomy enough for credit
cards and paper money and has a removable plastic picture insert;
the tri-fold holds credit cards, bills, has a removable picture
holder and even a compartment for keys.
</P>
<P>
   There's good news for men who like to travel light _ the money
clip wallet is your best bet and prices start at $18. This thin
design boasts a clip for paper money with a small credit card/bill
holder attached.
</P>
<P>
   The average life span of a leather wallet is anywhere from three
to five years, but some men have difficulty letting go.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Bosca, vice-president and design director of the Hugo
Bosca company, theorizes that it's sentimentality that causes men
to carry on with their wallets long past their average life span.
</P>
<P>
   He also said some men simply might not care what their wallets
look like because it's not a part of their outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   Lawry has a simpler explanation: ``You know where everything is
in an old wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKING CHARGE OF YOUR WALLET
</P>
<P>
   To keep your wallet from taking over your pocket or handbag,
Margaret Hughes, a member of the Georgia chapter of the National
Association of Professional Organizers, has these streamlining
tips:
</P>
<P>
   -- Have an annual wallet cleaning on your birthday. Throw out
old receipts, expired coupons, out-of-date IDs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Simply carry the essentials. Your wallet is not a photo album
of your life nor is it a file cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you do have a checkbook in your wallet, make sure you can
close it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep your folding money in an orderly fashion: from small to
large bills all facing in the same direction.

 &HT;    Benben back on T.V. with his own show
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new fall TV season has a number of stars from past series
who are starting over with new characters and shows. This week, we
look at five of them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who: Brian Benben
</P>
<P>
   -- Best known as: Martin Tupper, book editor on HBO's ``Dream
On'' who was put down by everyone he encountered, yet somehow
managed to bed a beautiful woman every week (being on HBO may have
had something to do with it).
</P>
<P>
   -- Next known as: Brian Benben, local TV news anchor (demoted to
reporter) on ``The Brian Benben Show.'' (Debuts Sept. 21 on CBS.)
He's using his own name, but not playing himself.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dramatic stretch: Once again, he's put down by everyone he
encounters. He has a lot less sex though, now that he's on CBS
instead of HBO. ``I'd be hard out to describe the differences,'' he
says. ``I'm not wearing a fez and caftan.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Between shows: He and his wife, actress Madeline Stowe, spent
a lot of time on their ranch near Fredericksburg, Texas, and had a
daughter, May, now 2. Made a sitcom pilot for CBS that didn't get
picked up.
</P>
<P>
   -- Behind the scenes: Benben and producer Robert Borden
considered different titles, including ``Benben'' and ``The Benben
Show.'' ``People thought it was a children's clown show,'' says
Benben. ``I'm not kidding. You know, eight people get out of the
little car and the last person is Brian Benben.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Looking back: ``I started out doing the theater in New York,
and I never did comedies. I only did dramas, and I was always
playing the biggest scum you'd ever seen _ the nasty guy. You move
the bureau that hasn't been moved in 20 years and the thing that
crawls out _ that's what I played.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Why he's back: ``When you spend three years not working,
you've got to come up with the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Coming Friday: Christina Applegate

 VIRTUAL VIRTUOSOS OF THE HOLLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is not just a place for crass commercialism, vapid
flirtation and the homogenization of American life. It is a
timeless storehouse of priceless, rare, indigenous oral tradition.
Honest. If you don't believe it, head on over to
sunsite.unc.edu/hollerin/hollerin.htm and get a load of grown folks
hollerin' their hearts out. It's a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try this at work. The vocal samples, all in streaming
(more like screaming) Real Audio, sound like Tarzan's first
yodeling lessons or a cross between an apoplectic elephant and a
submerging submarine. But they're virtuosic, the brightest and best
of the National Hollerin' Contest, held each June in Spivey's
Corner, a hamlet in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Web site, hollering is thought to be one of the
earliest forms of human communication and falls into four
categories: functional, communicative, pleasure and distress, with
the last known for its ``falsetto and a sense of urgency,'' though
nearly all hollering might be said to fit that description.
Folklore researchers have found hollering to be most prevalent in
black communities of the Southeast, though on this site and in
Sampson County, N.C., home of the competition, most hollerers are
white.
</P>
<P>
   The art form's roots reach back to the 1700s, the site says,
when men transporting logs by river from Sampson County developed a
system of hollers to avoid bashing into one another and to call for
help if they ran aground. Hollers can be heard up to three miles
away and were used on isolated farms to find lost children and
summon help in case of house fires. A skilled hollerer could call
in his or her hogs, cattle, sheep, dogs, children or spouse, and
the art was particularly handy for separating animals grazing on
common land.
</P>
<P>
   The contest began in 1969 with the help of Ermon Godwin, 70,
whose grandfather Bud Godwin ``was a hollerin' man'' and whose
9-year-old granddaughter appeared on David Letterman's show as the
junior hollerin' champion. He figures he can identify, just by
their hollers, all 30 contest champions. ``It has brought a sense
of feeling to our people here in Spivey's Corner, especially for
the young people,'' Godwin said. ``We have something unique to give
to the world, though we're just a little crossroads community of
49.''
</P>
<P>
   You can hear hollerin' quartet versions of ``Amazing Grace,''
``Old Gray Goose'' and ``The Lion Sleeps Tonight,'' as presented by
Suzie Bolotin, in audio and video, with arpeggios that could
challenge a violinist reared on Vivaldi.
</P>
<P>
   And where else can you hear the North Carolina Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Graham do a hollering impression of a mule, with
high, eerie overtones and alarming similitude?
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is a project of Paul Jones' class in
cyberpublishing and cybercasting at the University of North
Carolina School of Journalism. His students were surprised when
they taped Ms. Bolleton. ``They thought they were going to get 15
seconds and they got 3 minutes 50 seconds,'' he said, not to
mention having a hollerin' champion who is a Klezmer singer who won
with a Zulu song.

SOUTH TEXAS MATRIARCH SURVIVES FLOODING ORDEAL

c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ When three generations of Calderons fled the
rising waters of San Felipe Creek here this week, Leonara Calderon,
a stubborn octogenarian who uses a walker due to old age and
Parkinson's disease, refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we've had these floods before,'' one of her sons, Pat
Calderon, 56, recalled the 82-year-old saying not long before
spending several harrowing hours floating on a couch near the
ceiling of her living room.
</P>
<P>
   The Calderons live in similar stone houses along Calderon Lane,
which was quickly flooded early Monday when 18 inches of rain sent
nearby San Felipe Creek out of its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Calderon made it through waist-deep water and was supposed
to return with a truck to get Grandma Calderon, but couldn't get
back because of the high water.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Calderon said on Tuesday, ``I put my mother on the bed, but
the water kept coming up _ coming up and coming up. I grabbed hold
of the mattress and dragged it into the living room and shifted her
over to the love seat, which gradually began floating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept holding onto the love seat so it wouldn't topple
over,'' he said. ``The water was up to my chest, then my neck.
Luckily the TV fell over and I climbed on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that scene in the `Titanic' with the girl holding
the boy up,'' said Calderon, a fifth-grade teacher. ``I kept
holding on as the water rose higher for five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, with the water about 7 feet high, my mother
asked, ```Mi hijo (my son), what are the ceiling fans doing here?'
She couldn't quite grasp what was happening, which was good. She
was very calm, didn't at all panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow word spread that Leonora Calderon was trapped.
</P>
<P>
   With rumor confounding rumor, a local radio station and an Eagle
Pass TV station both prematurely reported the matriarch's demise,
even though her son's heroics had helped her survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still getting condolence calls,'' Pat Calderon said
Tuesday as he salvaged photographs and other family mementos from
the house, where a love seat rested incongruously atop a bar
counter.
</P>
<P>
   As for his mother, she's doing well under the circumstances, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning I found her staring off into nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   ```Are you all right?' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She snapped out of it and smiled at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Grandma was safe, the Calderons estimated they lost
$250,000 to the flood.
</P>
<P>
   An uncle's Lincoln rested on a customer's Chevy pickup at the
family-run auto parts and body shop around the corner. Each of
their houses had 3 inches of mud on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And Billy Calderon lost 220,000 baseball cards he had been
collecting with his sons for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my Griffeys. That hurt. Just gone. All gone,'' he said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Her name was Chi Chi. She was a showgirl.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show.
</P>
<P>
   When Clarita Fazzari danced the mambo, her silky brown
undulating body made men's faces burn and reminded women to watch
their men. Some say she shook so vigorously in a fringed bikini top
and sarong, she looked like a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   They called her Chi Chi, the Cuban Fireball. On summer evenings,
Hollywood stars, yachtsmen and their dates lined up to see her
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, disc jockeys have replaced live bands, and Fazzari,
who's from a generation of female entertainers who would sooner
reveal her age than forgo the limelight forever, is mostly retired,
splitting her time between homes in Las Vegas and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But her son, Valentino Fazzari, who grew up in the nightclubs
where his mother entertained, is banking that she can still draw a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Clarita ``Chi Chi'' Fazzari will dance the mambo at the second
Festival Catalina on Saturday afternoon at the Wrigley Stage in
Avalon. Other acts will include bands playing musica romantica,
ranchera, rock en espanol, and mariachi; a local children's
folklorico dance troupe; and the Pete Escovedo Orchestra with
Sheila E.
</P>
<P>
   While Catalina hosts more than 50 special events every year,
with themes varying from blues to country music jams, Festival
Catalina is the only event _ other than a Cinco de Mayo festivity
for schoolchildren _ that celebrates the cultural heritage of the
island's large population of Latinos, about 40 percent of its 3,500
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino Fazzari, 37, of Studio City promotes Latin
entertainers and organized the festival to honor his mother and
Catalina's Latino community. The festival is free to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin heritage on the island is so flavorful and so
strong, it's ridiculous there wasn't an event that gives these
people an opportunity ... to celebrate the heritage they rightfully
believe in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The way Clarita Fazzari recalls it, the Santa Catalina Island of
the 1950s and '60s was a glamorous outpost, only 26 miles from Los
Angeles but seemingly closer to a tropical paradise.
</P>
<P>
   When the S.S. Catalina steamship pulled into town, it carried
more than 2,000 passengers who, while waiting to disembark, threw
coins into the water and cheered as local youths dove for them.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling mariachis serenaded couples on Crescent Avenue, a road
that runs along the bay where boat lights shimmered.
</P>
<P>
   Fazzari, who is of Scotch Irish, Cherokee, Chinese and
Afro-Cuban descent, had no formal dance training, instead learning
the mambo in the parks of Cuba that came alive on Sundays with men
banging drums and bottles and mambo dancers swirling seductively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't need a partner,'' she said. ``You just got out
there and danced. Like Americans go jogging, Cubans danced.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a Marine Corps master sergeant, loved the night
life. He was stationed in San Francisco and often took his daughter
out with him.
</P>
<P>
   One night, he gave her permission to compete in a dancing
contest. She won and was soon booked in clubs up and down the West
Coast and, later, Havana. She married an Army enlisted man she met
while entertaining at a military base. And in 1955, she moved to
Catalina so she could work at the Chi Chi Club. Her husband stayed
in San Francisco, where he ran a chain of furniture stores.
</P>
<P>
   With her bare legs, tanned belly and high heels, her act was
considered risque.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Elvis Presley's time, when they wouldn't show him
from the waist down,'' she said. ``I was bad because I shook. But
it drew them in because they wanted to see what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Chi Chi Club's bamboo and burlap decor
was a painting of a topless Tahitian woman in a sarong, with her
hands on her hips and a hibiscus tucked behind one ear. One night a
customer came in, took one look at Clarita Fazzari and asked if she
was the woman in the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Taylor, a former longtime mayor of Avalon and owner of the
club, told the customer ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home and I was hysterical crying,'' she said. ``To be
known with no top on was a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   But the name stuck. Soon many of the customers called her Chi
Chi, and in time she became proud of her stage name.
</P>
<P>
   While his mother entertained, Valentino Fazzari would sleep in
the dressing room. As a young boy, he'd sneak downstairs and hide
under the booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the side of the stage before she went on, I was just
mesmerized by her beauty,'' he recalled. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clarita Fazzari brims with stories from the old days.
</P>
<P>
   An underage William Wrigley Jr., heir to his father's
chewing-gum fortune that included ownership of Catalina Island,
sneaking into the club.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``close friend'' Marlon Brando sending a helicopter to pick
her up and take her to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne sauntering down Crescent Avenue, doling out coins to
the kids who chased after him.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Taylor choosing her as the first Miss Catalina. She became
a one-woman welcoming committee who'd prance around in a bikini,
holding hands with her two sons and her pet gibbon ape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Catalina,'' Clarita Fazzari said. ``I thought it was
my island. I didn't think it belonged to the Wrigleys. I got that
island fever.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1968, when the Fazzaris bought the club from Mayor
Taylor, times were already beginning to change. Competition from
Los Angeles strip clubs was making it hard to keep the Chi Chi Club
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the Chi Chi Club burned.
</P>
<P>
   In their pajamas, Clarita Fazzari and her sons ran to watch the
flames consume the bamboo siding. They rebuilt, this time forgoing
bamboo for safer stucco.
</P>
<P>
   As the '70s wore on, lower-cost air fares allowed Angelenos to
travel to more distant getaways. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In a last attempt at reviving it, she converted the Chi Chi
Club to a topless bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused an uproar,'' she remembered. ``The people in the
town didn't want it, but the place was packed. We put a sign
outside: `If it should offend you, don't come in'.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she sold the club and left the island in a futile
attempt to try to save her failing marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the same,'' she said. ``The magic was gone. The
spell was gone that was over me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in some ways, Clarita Fazzari never has left the island or
her club. The fire may have destroyed the painting of the topless
Tahitian woman from which Fazzari derived her nickname, but before
she left Catalina, Fazzari posed for a photograph to re-create the
image.
</P>
<P>
   Her visage still adorns Chi Chi Club T-shirts today, worn by
club bartenders and tourists alike.
</P>
<P>
   Even at her age, Fazzari's quest for the limelight has not
dimmed. She ran for president in 1988 as a write-in candidate and
spent six months as a volunteer in the Israeli army in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   And now her son is taking up the cause of restoring to the
island some of the glamour of Chi Chi's days. Last October, he
revived the Miss Catalina beauty pageant, a competition where
contestants wore evening gowns and retro-style, Esther
Williams-designed swimsuits with gardenias in their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Julien Foreman, public relations manager for the Catalina Island
Visitors Bureau and Chamber of Commerce, said events such as
Festival Catalina are important in a place where tourism is the
main industry.
</P>
<P>
   And some residents expressed hope that the festival would help
teach Latino children about their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids here are second-, third- and
fourth-generation Latinos,'' said Lourdes Thoricht, who teaches
folklorico to the high school students scheduled to perform at the
festival. ``For them it's a big part of their heritage that they
might not know otherwise.''

MESSAGES THAT POP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I need an Internet provider that offers POP3 capabilities.
How can I find one?
</P>
<P>
   A. For those who need a little background: POP stands for Post
Office Protocol, a method that e-mail applications use to download
messages to the computer from e-mail servers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Once the message gets to the e-mail server, the user can dial in
to his or her Internet service provider and download the message. A
POP3 server, if you've ever wondered about the term (you may have
seen it in your e-mail program's settings box or as an occasional
flash on-screen as the program checks your mail) is where incoming
e-mail sits until you log on to download it. In addition to the
popular POP3, there is IMAP, the Internet Message Access Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   With the right settings and e-mail program, POP3 is useful for
people who want or need to retrieve their messages from any
computer that has Internet access, although the IMAP standard is
often considered better at handling mail from different
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Some online services use their own proprietary software, so call
the prospective company's tech-support line and ask whether it uses
POP3. If you already have online access, explore the support area
of your provider's Web site.

TRY EXPLAINING MONICA'S NO-NO TO YOUR NANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - My Nana was getting aggravated.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't blame her. She was stuck in a hospital room with an
inflamed gall bladder while her pain medication was lolling about
someplace in the hallway as vicious stones bounced around inside
her.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, we were minutes away from watching the
president's apology for fiddling around with Monica Lewinsky, and
the coverage clogged every channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand all of the fuss,'' Nana said, shaking her
head at the TV. ``There wasn't this much news when Frank Sinatra
died, and he was much more important to this country. He was a real
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a chair next to the bed was Nana's sister, Aunt Ida,
an exact duplicate of Nana, right down to their 4-foot-10 size,
their wavy light-brown hair and their tan Easy Spirit shoes _ and
she wasn't pleased about the lack of television viewing choices,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I was more concerned with keeping Nana's ID bracelet
on her wrist, lest we discover three years from now that we brought
the wrong Nana home and then have to share custody with another
family.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, just to be safe, I pulled a bobby pin from her
hair and scratched the letters N-A-N-A into the polish of four
fingernails on her right hand after she got a pain shot and passed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is crazy, I tell you,'' Aunt Ida agreed. ``Who
wants to see the president naked? Now I got all these pictures
going through my head. I don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Monica Lewinsky had seen naked pictures of Bill Clinton, I
can assure you that this whole thing never would have happened in
the first place. I've only seen photos of him with his shirt off,
and that was enough to make me do the cootie dance. Big nipples,
size of silver dollars, on saggy man boobs, and they were purple.
The color of eggplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of girl would keep a dress for such a long time with
that . . . stuff on it?'' Nana said, pointing to the TV. ``That
pig! What, they don't have dry cleaners in Slut Town?''
</P>
<P>
   I was amazed. My Nana, the 81-year-old embodiment of everything
good and pure, who has never had a bad word to say about anyone,
was getting testy. And, most horrifying of all, she knew what
``stuff'' was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, she's a tramp,'' Aunt Ida said, waving her hand. ``She's
just one of those girls, Laurie, what do you call them, they follow
men who do the rock and roll?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Groupies,'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groupies!'' Aunt Ida finished. ``They'll do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. A grouper. Like Ava Gardner was to Frank Sinatra,''
Nana added, shaking her head and wringing her hands. ``He got into
so much trouble with her. So much trouble . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't play with your wristband, Nana,'' I said cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they mean by `inappropriate relationship'?'' Nana
asked as the president spoke across the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means they were fooling around,'' Aunt Ida said. ``But in
different . . . ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' Nana queried.
</P>
<P>
   Oh boy. Now you see what you've done, Monica Lewinsky, you
stupid, stupid tart, I thought. Because of you, I have to explain
to my Nana, while she's in a hospital bed with an enlarged gall
bladder, what oral sex is. Do you see the damage you've caused? Do
you see where your sinful path has led?
</P>
<P>
   Ever so reluctantly, I bent down and whispered into Nana's ear
exactly how Lewinsky got to know President Clinton ``in the
biblical way,'' and when I was done, she looked up at me,
bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the hell you just said,'' Nana whispered
back. ``You know that's my bad ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to do the devil's work twice, I repeated the carnal
carnage in the good ear.
</P>
<P>
   She scrunched up her face. ``Oh, that's disgusting,'' she
replied, thinking it over in her mind. ``I don't understand why
they call it `moral' sex. Was it approved by a priest?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied slowly. ``Just by Monica's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This president,'' Aunt Ida said, ``He wears his privates on
his sleeve like they were cuff links.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a nice girl, Ida,'' Nana reminded her. ``She's a
floozy. Even President Kennedy didn't pick girls up off the street.
What's this all over the inside of my hand?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your address and phone number,'' I said quickly. ``We'll
wash it off when you get home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the coordinating map on my arm,'' Aunt Ida
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops,'' I said, embarrassed. ``I guess you got too close. It
comes off with gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   A nurse entered the room armed with a shot of Demerol and pulled
the curtain around Nana's bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is really binding you,'' I heard the nurse say to
Nana. ``Let's take this off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' I asserted to the curtain. ``Leave the wristband
on. Nice trick, but I've got her marked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a nurse,'' I heard Nana say from the other side of the
curtain. ``Do you know what `moral' sex is? My granddaughter says
it's dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you have a piece of paper that says, `I've Been
Switched and I Miss My REAL Family! Call Police!' taped to the back
of your neck?'' the nurse asked Nana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I felt something itchy,'' Nana said.
</P>
<P>
   After Nana got her shot and the curtain was pulled back, the
nurse shot me a look and left the room. That's when I noticed a
white pair of Nana's slacks folded at the foot of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what the nurse took off?'' I asked Nana, and she
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nana,'' I started, ``you've had these on the whole time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've been here for three days,'' I said. ``Why didn't
you tell me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I wanted them on,'' she answered. ``I was worried that if
I had to walk to the bathroom, someone might see my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky could learn a thing or two from you, Nana,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' she replied, the Demerol kicking in. ``I was married
for three years before I had your mother. I have my paper from the
priest. That's very moral, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded, and smiled. After she drifted off to sleep, I pulled
another bobby pin from her hair and scratched the letters I-L-O-V-E
into the polish of the five fingers on her left hand. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One can never be too thin or too rich, the saying goes. When it
comes to flat-panel monitors for personal computers, being rich is
almost a prerequisite to being thin.
</P>
<P>
   If price were no object, flat-panel displays would probably take
over the computer monitor business overnight. These slender new
displays, which are essentially desktop versions of the liquid
crystal displays attached to high-end portable computers, take up
only a fraction of the desktop space hoarded by conventional
computer monitors, which are known as cathode-ray tube displays.
</P>
<P>
   The newest models of LCD monitors offer big, bright images that
are adequate for all but the most demanding PC user. They consume
less power, weigh just a few pounds and have noticeably less
flicker, and thus produce less eye strain, than their CRT cousins.
And they are more stylish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite steep price reductions in the last few months,
flat-panel displays still cost more than twice as much as
conventional CRT computer monitors with comparable screen size and
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, prices for flat-panel displays have fallen by
as much as two-thirds. For example, in June 1997 the list price for
a 14-inch Think Panel LCD Model 9514 from IBM was $3,000. Today it
is $999. Earlier this month, Apple slashed the price of its 15-inch
Studio Display LCD to $1,299, from $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting prices are a result of better manufacturing
efficiencies, weak financial conditions in Asia where all the LCD
makers are located and increased competition among display sellers
here. On top of that, computer companies are preparing to introduce
a new generation of digital LCD displays this fall that hold the
promise of even better performance and lower prices. There are some
complications with the new digital displays, which will be
discussed below.
</P>
<P>
   But even as LCD prices have tumbled, so too have prices for
conventional CRT monitors. Many computer makers are selling 17-inch
CRT monitors for less than $500 today, and 14-inch and 15-inch
computer monitors are so cheap _ typically less than $200 _ that
some companies are giving them away as incentives to spur computer
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see CRTs going away any time soon,'' said Paul
Semenza, director of market analysis at Stanford Resources., a
market research and consulting firm in San Jose, Calif. ``They're
cheap, and extremely reliable.'' For example, Semenza said, some 14
million conventional monitors were sold (separately or bundled with
computers) in the first half of this year, compared with 55,000
LCDs.
</P>
<P>
   Given the price difference, even the most technologically ardent
consumers _ the fabled ``early adopters'' _ may find it hard to
look a spouse squarely in the eye and argue that the flat-panel
monitors are worth double or triple the price of an equally good or
superior CRT display. Analysts say flat-panel monitors will not
capture significant shares of the consumer market until the price
ratio between LCD and CRT is 1.5 to 1 or lower, and that is not
expected to happen any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Young, vice president of DisplaySearch, a market research
company in Austin, Texas, said prices for flat-panel monitors are
most likely to continue falling this year before stabilizing in
1999, when demand catches up to supply.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some flat-panel customers can justify the price
differences. Hospitals and medical offices favor LCD displays
because, unlike CRT monitors, their signals do not interfere with
nearby sensitive equipment. Banks and financial institutions array
them on the previously groaning desks of traders who need multiple
monitors to track different markets. Office workers crammed into
small cubicles love them for their relatively petite footprint,
which yields more working space, or room for more clutter, on the
desk surface.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, these thin displays would seem to be ideal
for apartment dwellers who are torn between a desire for a bigger
monitor and the lack of space for it. The Internet has fueled a
demand for bigger screen sizes, but CRT's typically are as many
inches deep and wide as the screen size, measured diagonally.
Apple's 15-inch Studio Display, in comparison, has the same
viewable area on screen as Apple's 17-inch CRT, and it can fit on a
shelf 10 inches deep and 15 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the decision between fat and thin monitors is the
introduction this fall of a new generation of digital flat-panel
monitors from IBM, Compaq Computer and others.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers are digital, processing information as binary
signals that are either on or off. But almost all CRT monitors for
sale today are analog devices, meaning they process image
information as signals of varying electrical intensity. As a
result, desktop computers typically come with a video graphics card
that converts the computer's digital signal into an analog wave
form that the monitor can interpret.
</P>
<P>
   But flat-panel displays are intrinsically digital, mapping their
images on a rigidly defined grid of tiny ``on'' and ``off'' cells.
This is not a problem for the LCD panels attached to laptop
computers, which send digital signals directly to the digital
display. For LCD monitors to work with most desktop computers,
however, they must convert the incoming analog signal back to
digital.
</P>
<P>
   Besides adding complexity and cost to the LCD monitor, this
digital-to-analog-to-digital dance is further complicated by
variations in the timing of the computer's video card. Not all
cards synchronize signals the same way. If the signals are not
precisely on track, unwanted video artifacts can occur. Straight
lines may veer, pixels may pop out of line.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, it makes sense for shoppers, whenever possible,
to test the LCD monitor on the computer that will be driving it.
Variations in different video cards can cause the same monitor to
behave beautifully or to be quirky, depending on what it is plugged
into.
</P>
<P>
   Doing away with the analog-to-digital converter in the LCD
monitors would eliminate some of the complexity and cost, driving
prices down another $100 or so but only if the computer itself has
a digital video card. For the majority of PC owners today, buying a
digital card would more than erase the savings on the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the promise of better performance from all-digital
systems is leading some vendors, like IBM, to offer customers a
choice of buying digital cards along with digital monitors when new
systems are introduced in October (pricing has not been disclosed).
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is already offering a digital LCD panel as an option on
its Presario line of home computers, and at least two other major
PC makers will add digital flat-panel options this fall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a major catch, though. IBM's digital flat-panel
displays will adhere to a new video interface standard called Plug
and Display (P&AMP;D), which has been endorsed by a number of major
makers of computers, video cards and monitors. The first P&AMP;D
computer and video card systems will begin appearing in the fall
and will work with both analog and digital flat panels.
</P>
<P>
   To get digital flat-panel monitors into the marketplace sooner,
however, Compaq and some other companies adopted an interim
standard called Digital Flat-Panel Port (DFP). In essence a subset
of Plug &AMP; Display, the DFP system uses a different and, of course,
incompatible set of connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives acknowledged that DFP is a ``transition
technology'' and said the company is committed to supporting the
Plug &AMP; Display standard when it becomes practical.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that a simple and inexpensive hardware adapter
can be developed to allow DFP systems like Compaq's to connect to
Plug &AMP; Display video systems in the near future. No such adapter
yet exists, however, so in the meantime the conflicting standards
are confusing not only consumers but also the companies that make
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   William Lempesis, executive director of the Video Electronics
Standards Association (VESA), an international standards
organization for video display systems, said efforts are under way
to try to resolve the incompatibility between the two rival
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once a computer is equipped with a digital video card and a
compatible digital LCD monitor, however, the chance of a happy
marriage is quite high as long as the relationship between the
computer and the LCD is monogamous. Monitor swapping is problematic
because, for now at least, most other computers will have analog
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, another suggestion: If the LCD monitor is to be community
property, consider one of the current analog versions. If it is to
be used exclusively with only one computer, it may make sense to
wait until the new digital models show up later this year
especially if one is buying a new computer to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Technical discussions aside, the flat monitors may have some
intangible benefits, too. James Pyler, marketing strategist for
visual products for IBM in Raleigh. N.C., recalls putting an early
LCD model on his desk several years ago and being quickly
surrounded by crowds of admiring co-workers. ``They're different
than the standard monitor, and as a result, they make you look like
you're more important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the co-workers who came over to admire the LCD later
became his wife. He prefers to think she was attracted to him, and
not the monitor.

LOOKING FOR PERFECTION? DON'T LOOK TOO CLOSELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   For people who have more money than space, flat-panel displays
sound almost too good to be true. Naturally, there is a catch or
two, or six or seven, said Raymond Soneira, creator of the popular
Displaymate utility program that helps both manufacturers and users
get optimum performance from their monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are quirkier,'' Soneira said of the flat-panel monitors,
which have a liquid crystal display (LCD). The flat-panel screens
require more adjustments to achieve the best picture, and even then
they may exhibit odd and perplexing behaviors that would be
unacceptable in displays of cathode-ray tubes, or CRTs.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being in a football stadium and trying to get hundreds
of fans to align themselves perfectly and to flip an assortment of
colored cards precisely on cue all day long. Multiplied by
thousands, that is the daunting challenge of the transistors that
drive the picture elements (pixels) on an LCD monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers cling to the belief that paying such a high
premium for a monitor should guarantee perfection. Alas, many
dealers have a more relaxed definition of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   LCD panels typically have one or more bad pixels, including some
that are stuck annoyingly in either the ``on'' or ``off'' position.
Laptop computer screens often have similar freckles.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular wisdom, LCD monitors do in fact flicker,
Soneira said. But the flicker is much less noticeable than with
CRTs, so people who stare into a computer screen for most of the
day generally report less eye fatigue with LCDs. This, besides
space saving, is one of the prime benefits of flat-panel monitors.
Also, on a properly tuned LCD monitor, smaller text is more
readable.
</P>
<P>
   Early LCD monitors, besides being wildly expensive, were
technically finicky. Viewing angles were narrow, meaning the user
had to align his eyeballs almost precisely at the center of the
screen to see images at their best. Straying to the side, or up and
down, even by a few inches, made images change color, become
distorted or lose contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The newest LCD monitors, specifically the type known as TFT
(Thin Film Transistor), like those used for laptops _ are much
better, although every one we tested showed some degree of color
shift as a result either of a change in viewing angle or of
variations in lighting across the screen. In terms of retaining
contrast at wider viewing angles, though, newer LCD displays are
comparable to CRTs.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting is a crucial distinction between LCD and CRT monitors.
The cathode-ray tube generates its own brightness across the screen
as electrons excite layers of phosphors and cause them to glow. But
LCD screens are illuminated only by a background light that
typically runs around the perimeter of the screen. These
fluorescent backlights are known to dim and darken over time.
</P>
<P>
   Because LCD desktop monitors are still new, one can only
speculate on the life span of the screen. Manufacturers are coy
when asked about it, and concede that no one really knows whether
it will be practical to replace fading backlights.
</P>
<P>
   LCD monitors have only one optimum, or native, resolution. CRT
displays, in contrast, typically can switch among several standard
resolutions. Problems often arise when the LCD monitor tries to
display a non-native resolution, resulting in poor image quality.
</P>
<P>
   Some LCD models _ not all _ offer high native resolutions (up to
1,280 by 1,024 pixels) and colors (16.7 million shades) that rival
their sumo-size counterparts. Of the half-dozen flat-panel monitors
tested for this article, however, none could display large areas of
black reliably. While colors are quite good, they often lack the
richness, or saturation, of CRT displays.
</P>
<P>
   Some LCD screens also have slower response times than most CRTs,
Soneira said, which can lead to disappearing cursors when the mouse
is moved quickly, or substandard, jerky performance when
full-motion video images are displayed. However, we found no
problems when playing DVD movies on the screens.
</P>

   The Displaymate software for Windows has a list price of $79.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When President Clinton meets with President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow, each may take comfort from the other's domestic political
difficulties. It is important, however, that any focus on their
respective troubles also includes a careful examination of pressing
international security challenges.
 &HT;    At the top of this agenda should be a discussion of how to
reinvigorate U.S.-Russian cooperation to combat the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
 &HT;    Although the United States and the Soviet Union often cooperated
closely on nonproliferation policy during the Cold War, by now
their partnership has begun to deteriorate. Here are some of the
symptoms of this unraveling:
 &HT;    _ The current stalemate in strategic-arms control negotiations;
 &HT;    _ Major disputes over Russian nuclear and missile exports to
Iran and India;
 &HT;    _ Disagreement about the activities of the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq;
 &HT;    _ Lack of meaningful intelligence-sharing concerning illicit
trafficking in nuclear arms and material;
 &HT;    _ The absence of cooperation on important regional security
issues in South Asia, the Middle East and North Korea;
 &HT;    _ Increasing domestic pressures in both Russia and the United
States to give priority to short-term economic and political
considerations rather than long-term international security and
weapons-control objectives.
 &HT;    These strains are increasing at a time when the global
nonproliferation regime is facing urgent challenges that demand
coordinated leadership from the world's two leading nuclear powers.
 &HT;    Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan could lead to the
dismantling of the global nonproliferation regime based on the 1968
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The
leadership _ or lack thereof _ displayed by the United States and
Russia over the India-Pakistan crisis may well determine whether
the non-proliferation regime endures.
 &HT;    A second challenge is coping effectively with the nuclear legacy
of the Cold War, including the safeguarding of Russia's enormous
stocks of fissile material and the downsizing of Russia's bloated
military-industrial complex. Russia and the United States must both
deepen and broaden their cooperation if these objectives are to be
achieved.
 &HT;    In addition, both parties will increasingly need to cooperate to
combat the problem of terrorism involving weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    Even concerted pressure by the United States and Russia would
probably not roll back the nuclear programs in India and Pakistan.
Instead, Moscow and Washington should take steps to bolster the
nonproliferation concept by ``de-glamorizing'' nuclear weapons and
fostering nuclear disarmament.
 &HT;    With the START II treaty deadlocked in the Russian parliament,
an alternative means of accomplishing this objective would be to
jump-start the disarmament process by taking steps to reduce U.S.
and Russian arsenals of tactical nuclear weapons. The United States
could take a major step in this direction by unilaterally
withdrawing its few remaining tactical nuclear weapons based in
Europe, which have little military value, but enormous symbolic
significance to Russia.
 &HT;    This step would help defuse a potential contest in the region,
where many Russian officials have argued that Russia will have to
increase its reliance on tactical nuclear weapons in response to
NATO enlargement. It could also help revive the stalled START
process, and serve as a first step toward formally codifying the
1991 Bush-Gorbachev declarations on the withdrawal of non-strategic
nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    The United States and Russia should also work together to
support initiatives by non-nuclear weapons states for legally
binding security assurances and the creation of nuclear-free zones.
The five countries of post-Soviet Central Asia _ Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan _ are currently drafting a
treaty to create a such a zone in Central Asia.
 &HT;    Russian and U.S. efforts to publicly encourage and facilitate
this effort would send a positive signal to non-nuclear nations
about the benefits of nonproliferation, and would also have
symbolic importance, given the region's proximity to India and
Pakistan.
 &HT;    One bright area of U.S.-Russian cooperation in recent years has
been joint efforts to increase the security and accountability of
nuclear materials in Russia.
 &HT;    As part of a continuing effort to consolidate former Soviet
nuclear materials and increase their security, Presidents Clinton
and Yeltsin should consider launching a joint initiative to buy up
the relatively small but significant quantities of highly enriched
uranium stored at sites in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Ukraine,
and Uzbekistan. Depending on the political relations among the
parties, some of the material could be returned to Russia, while
the remainder would be exported to the United States.
 &HT;    As part of such a program, Russia and the United States should
also collaborate on refitting the research reactors in these
countries to run on low-enriched uranium, which presents a much
lesser proliferation threat than uranium.
 &HT;    In addition, the United States and Russia should begin to do
more than simply talk about cooperating on issues of terrorism.
Concrete steps should be taken to implement prior
intelligence-sharing agreements, to expand physical protection from
the threat of radiological sabotage and to improve enforcement of
existing export-control laws and regulations.
 &HT;    Perhaps the greatest difficulty in forging a more effective and
coordinated strategy for future U.S.-Russian cooperation is that
proliferation issues occupy a different place in the hierarchy of
national policy in Russia than in the United States. This
different, lower ranking is not because Russian policymakers
disagree with their U.S. counterparts about the dangers of weapons
of mass destruction. Instead, it is a perception of the issue's
minor relevance to the immediate economic and political situation.
 &HT;    President Clinton needs to take advantage of the Moscow summit
to refocus attention on the pressing nature of the proliferation
threat _ a paramount security challenge to both nations and one
that requires concerted cooperation.

Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies. Scott Parrish is a senior research associate at the

   The world's top tennis players will not be the only ones
sweating, lunging and sprinting when the U.S. Open championships
start Monday in Queens, New York City. Thousands of the nation's
computers will be doing the electronic equivalent, as their owners
put them through their paces in the name of tennis enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The two weeks of the U.S. Open are among the busiest times for
many of the hundreds of tennis-oriented Web sites on the Internet.
Not only do people want to know such details as how easily Martina
Hingis squashed an opponent on a given day, but they also are
inspired to learn how to improve their own wristy forehand and
speed up their lazy feet.
</P>
<P>
   According to IBM, which creates the official Web pages for all
four of the major tennis championships (the Australian Open, the
French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open), the U.S. Open site
usually gets the most traffic. Last year, the site measured 63.7
million hits, according to Jeff Ramminger, who lead the design of
the U.S. Open site.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those hits come from tennis enthusiasts like Cheryl
Hand, a nurse from Birmingham, Ala., who browses the Internet, not
just during the big tournaments but nearly every day. In fact, she
spends more time reading online tennis magazines and checking
results on the professional tours than she does on the court
improving her own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the other day, I was watching Pete Sampras play on
television and I saw him lose because of a bad line call on match
point,'' Ms. Hand said. ``I looked on the Internet to see what he
said about the call afterward because he was a little vocal about
it on the court.'' Indeed, Ms. Hand eventually logged onto the
official Pete Sampras Web site and sent an e-mail expressing her
sympathy about what she saw as poor officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That call just really upset me, so I felt that I had to give
my 2 cents,'' Ms. Hand said. She has yet to get a response from
Sampras, nor does she expect to get one.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to find information about the game is to
go to a site like Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) and click on its recreation
and sports subject heading. Browsing among the offerings opens a
window into the diversity of the Web's tennis subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can experience tradition at the Wimbledon Championships
site (www.wimbledon.org), community at the Gay and Lesbian Tennis
Alliance (www.glta.org), and levity at Alt.Tennis, an instructional
site that promises ``explicit, uncensored, alternative ways to play
tennis'' (www.alttennis.com), which includes between-the-legs shots
and faking out your opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And visitors can see for themselves how tennis on the Web,
perhaps like no other sport, is driven as much by Hollywood-style
glamour as by talent. For example, Anna Kournikova, a teen-aged
Russian tour player who has never won a professional championship
but still draws considerable attention with her starlet looks and
midriff-baring outfits, is listed as the subject of more than 20
sites on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Jana Novotna, of the Czech Republic, this year's
winner of the Wimbledon women's title, perhaps the most prestigious
in the game, has just four Yahoo-listed sites to her name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the general tennis bulletin boards on the Web
appear to be filled with postings about personalities: which pro is
better, more polite, more attractive. However, discourse on the
specialized sites is typically more elevated, particularly when it
comes to asking questions about the quality of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that some may find especially advantageous about the
Web is the multitude of tennis equipment for sale on line often at
cheaper prices than those in sporting goods stores. With locations
like www.tennis-warehouse.com and their vast stocks of equipment, a
tennis enthusiast may never have to step into a pro shop again.
</P>
<P>
   A Site That Is Much Like The Open
</P>
<P>
   WWW.USOPEN.ORG
</P>
<P>
   Given the festive atmosphere, loquacious crowds and proximity to
Manhattan, the U.S. Open has a reputation as one of the most flashy
of the major tennis championships. So it follows that the
tournament's official Web site is the cyberspace equivalent of
Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is to provide what television coverage cannot, then
the site is successful. No other Internet outlet appears to be as
authoritative on the Open nor, for that matter, as whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   In the Interactive Open area, the Netcam shows visitors images
of matches that are updated every 30 seconds. Or they can absorb
some of the championship's atmosphere with an option called
Opencam, which gives computer users the chance to direct stadium
cameras themselves. For those seeking information rather than
amusement, the site offers ample choices, from daily news stories
to point-by-point updates of match scores.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the U.S. Open site is practical, with directions to the
tournament by subway, train and car, a schedule of television
broadcasts and ticket information. A section is devoted to the
biographies of hundreds of players, from reigning champions to
obscure qualifiers (ever wonder how much money Massimo Ardinghi, of
Italy, has won in his career?). To pick the brain of a top player,
visitors to the site can join one of many online discussions with
top competitors that are scheduled throughout the two-week
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Though these chats may be popular, it remains to be seen whether
players will have anything more elucidating to say via keyboard
than in the typical television interview. For even more personal
communication, there are electronic post cards _ an e-mail window
with a tennis-theme background _ that can be sent to competitors.
Whether the players respond, of course, is up to them.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Advice for Playing Better Plus Lots of Gear and Gab
</P>
<P>
   WWW.TENNIS.COM
</P>
<P>
   Watching or reading about tennis professionals chasing a ball
from one side of the court to the other can certainly be
entertaining, but it provides a limited view of the sport. Among
the Web sites offering a more complete version is the one created
by Tennis Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The site devotes considerable coverage to teaching average
players how to improve their tennis strokes, strategy and fitness.
Of course, there is no guarantee that incorporating such advice
into one's game is easier when gleaned from the Internet than from
a magazine, book or a live tennis lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tennis Magazine, the Web site rates the quality of new
racquets and shoes. But readers of the electronic magazine can
offer their own evaluations and ask questions about equipment in a
chat room dubbed ``gear gab,'' found in the ``bbs central''
section.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this free site has many other features not found in the
monthly magazine, which requires a paid subscription. Among them
are daily updates from the pro tours, weekly rankings,
instructional tips and more chat areas.
</P>
<P>
   (Many of the postings seemed to be the work of adolescent minds,
given the number of expletives and exhortations of ``Sampras
rules.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tennis.com is planning extensive coverage of the U.S. Open, with
photographs and daily stories about matches and the ambiance.
Visitors to the site can also get TV broadcast times, ticket
information and match schedules.
</P>
<P>
   This site is probably the slickest and most mass-market oriented
of all the tennis magazines on the Web. For people with time to
browse only one publication, it is a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on Fundamentals
</P>
<P>
   WWW.TENNISSERVER.COM
</P>
<P>
   If there is an equivalent of the neighborhood tennis club
newsletter on the Internet, the Tennis Server could be it. The site
has little in the way of impressive graphics and video clips, but
it does feature extensive coverage about the fundamentals of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Names like Michael Chang and Venus Williams are only
occasionally mentioned here. Instead, the site focuses on what is
relevant to weekend-playing amateurs, with columns about mental
toughness (the writer has a Ph.D. in psychology), improving strokes
and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the writing is in the form of personal experience as if
it were being offered by the local club pro. The quality of advice
appears to be good and often unique, at least to someone who has
taken a few hundred tennis lessons during his lifetime. There is
also a guest column that seems to deal with whatever is on the mind
of that month's author. A writer in a recent issue, for example,
told a story about how his tickets to the U.S. Open were stolen by
a pickpocket.
</P>
<P>
   Even a novice player who can barely hit a forehand will probably
feel comfortable here. Information is available on such basics as
the rules governing tennis, tennis clubs and organizations around
the country, and how to store tennis racquets.
</P>
<P>
   Two often neglected groups that this site serves are junior and
senior players. There is a column that takes turns addressing these
two groups: one month, how to better develop junior talent; the
next month, protecting yourself from skin cancer while on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Helpful in Finding Matches, On Court and Perhaps Off
</P>
<P>
   WWW.TENNISW.COM
</P>
<P>
   It may be comforting to know that there are tennis matches
waiting for you in such far-flung places as Ecuador and Qatar. Or
that James, a Yale student, is looking for a single,
career-oriented woman as a tennis partner ``and possibly more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis Worldwide Magazine, an all-purpose Web publication about
tennis, has a particularly personal and somewhat eclectic touch.
The site features conveniently categorized classified sections for
those seeking everything that is tennis related. Among them,
playing partners (and, apparently, a mate), ``certified officials''
who will answer readers' e-mail questions about regulations, and a
section devoted to jokes (``What's the noisiest of all games?
Tennis, because you can't play without raising a racket'').
</P>
<P>
   One especially useful tool here is the Tennis Mall, which links
readers to tennis equipment manufacturers, resorts and tennis
academies. Also interesting are the seven chat rooms with such
titles as ``antiques and collectibles forum,'' ``instructor's and
coach's forum,'' and ``junior tennis forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ample opportunities for conversation, the site offers
minimal coverage of breaking news from the professional tours. The
two or three feature articles that are added to the site each month
often address broad er issues like ``Is Tennis Dead Again?'' and
``U.S.A. Player Devel opment.'' This site would probably appeal
most to regular tennis play ers because of its insider approach.

AT HOME WITH DEWEY NICKS: ADVENTURES IN THE STAR-STRUCK ZONE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY M. SPINDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dewey Nicks' ebullient fashion photography reminds
you that people have forgotten how to have fun in fashion. Dewey
and Stephanie Nicks' ebullient lifestyle reminds you that people
have forgotten how to have fun  &UR; in life. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the night Frank Sinatra died. The rest of the
country might have popped ``Songs for Swinging Lovers'' on the CD ;
and Mrs. Nicks and their gang headed out to relive Rat Pack
Hollywood. Which meant hitting Matteo's, the Italian restaurant
Sinatra loved _ but perhaps not for its food; Don Rickles, a
regular, might joke that you need to put the tray tables up when
you finish.Then they went to Merv Griffin's new place, The Coconut
Club, at the Beverly Hilton, for some big band dancing. In true Rat
Pack style, they were kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sinatra tribute didn't stop there, because after that,
they went home, to a living room straight out of ``Ocean's
Eleven,'' the 1960 Rat Pack movie where the men try to rob five Las
Vegas casinos simultaneously _ and where the women are asked to
leave the room with two snaps of the finger and the explanation,
``No chicks.''
</P>
<P>
   The house, on Stone Canyon Road, is convincing enough as a
period set that the photographer Matthew Ralston considered renting
it to recreate scenes from ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (1968) for a
Madonna video. And Nicks, whose snapshot-style fashion photos are
the champagne antidote to the heroin chic images that depressed
fashion for so long, often uses the house as his backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when even Hollywood, city of dreams, is in danger of
becoming as homogenized as every other Star-Gap-Republic-infested
town, Nicks and his pack, which isn't ratty but does revere the
rats, have made it their mission to celebrate, maximally, what sets
Hollywood apart. Need a car? Why not get the Lifestyle Car Clubto
soup up a 1996 Buick Roadmaster station wagon? (``You're not sure
if it's a hearse or a limo,'' Nicks said of the result.) Throwing a
pool party? Why not hire a team of synchronized swimmers to
entertain and have it catered by Chasen's.? And when you want to
get a house, why not get two? A monastic concrete cottage by Irving
Gill, the father of California minimalism, built in 1917, to use
for an office. And a 1950's one that reflects the ultimate
living-by-the-pool life in Los Angeles, the kind of life Frank and
the boys took with them to the Palm Springs desert.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicks met his wife to be nine years ago, she was producing
photo shoots for Spiegel catalogs and living on the 61st floor of
the John Hancock building in Chicago; he was living in the Gill
house , and creating upbeat, funny photography for Vogue's
charismatic fashion editors, Elizabeth Saltzman and Lisa Eisner. It
was Ms. Eisner who introduced him to Roy McMakin, a furniture
designer who designed the office furniture for the new Getty
Museum. Back then, McMakin was living in the Gill house while
lovingly restoring Irving Gill's trademark arches and composed
courtyards. Gill, a protege of Louis Sullivan, died in 1936,
unheralded, to be rediscovered in the 1960s. His houses recalled
California's Hispanic past; their Cubist-inspired geometry and
Mission symmetry anticipated European modernism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove up the driveway, walked in, and said, `I want to buy
this house,' Nicks recalled. ``It was the first thing I said to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Brad Dunning, now one of Los Angeles' hottest
interior designers, was working on the Gill house. He and Nicks
shared a lifelong passion for architecture and the designer began
helping Nicks find Palm SPrings locations for his work. Nicks was
among the first fashion photographers to gravitate to the resort
town. The light was so perfect, the lines of the architecture so
clean, Nicks said that ``Shooting there taught me how to shoot in a
studio.'' It was the whole look of the place that inspired him: the
car ports, the matching Rolls Royces in the driveway, the pristine
golf courses that dictate entire neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you meet the people, who happen to be 60 years old, and
they're all about fitness and tan skin and wearing special jewelry
and a particular color pants,'' Nicks said. ``And I thought, this
is cool. This is what my friends should be like, but they're all
worried about being called back for an audition. There was an ease
of life I was really attracted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on photo assignments with Dunning, Nicks would often
create elaborate modernist sets; then, when the shoot was over,
he'd destroy them. When they found the Stone Canyon house, it
became a set they could keep. Sold as a tear-down, the house had
been built in 1959 with every shoddy construction practice of the
day. Beneath the suburban facade, they saw a desert home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of carpet,'' Nicks said. ``And it had a giant
bell for the telephone, so the last owner was obviously was an old
woman. The phone would ring, and it was like school was out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all L.A. homes, it has a Hollyweird pedigree. Richard
Harris lived there, as did Maud Adams, the onetime James Bond girl.
The minute Nicks walked into the house, he saw it exactly as it
looks now. ``I knew it was going to work,'' he said. He hired
Dunning, and Finn Kappe, the architect, whose father, Raymond
Kappe, was a founder of the Southern California Institute of
Architecture. Although the house has no pedigree, Dunning called it
``trickle-down Neutra and Craig Ellwood,'' combining Richard
Neutra'sfree-flowing plans and industrial materials and Ellwood's
love of the glass box. ``It was a tract house with aspirations of
glamour.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Two Moroccan-style lighting fixtures were all they kept of the
original interior. The proportions of the house were blown up,
almost like an effect from a darkroom: the pool was widened, the
doorways were heightened and broadened, the front courtyard was
opened up to give a view to the hillside behind the house and the
kitchen cabinets were raised. Terrazzo tile was laid throughout the
house, ending only when the terrazzo tumbles into the pool. ``I was
always inspired by the movie ``The Party'' with Peter Sellers,
where the water went through the house,'' Nicks said. Part of the
decision to put tiny chrome legs beneath the new cabinets was to
give the terrazzo a volcanic-lava quality, to suggest that it had
spilled right through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Like a true student of the Rat Pack, Nicks has made High
Fidelity a theme at the house. An early 1970s Mark Levinson sound
system was put together by the actor Vincent Gallo, who's an
audiophile and who Nicks met when he shot him for L'Uomo Vogue. A
speaker was put in the pool, for a surreal surround-sound while
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the furnishings came from Palm Springs consignment
shops, including a painting of a bull once owned by George
Montgomery, the B-movie actor and artist. It hung over the
fireplace in the house he shared with Dinah Shore.``He's a great
taste hero of mine,'' Nicks said. An exhibit of Montgomery's work
in Palm Springs has, he said, ``a bronze, a bronze, a bronze and a
note from Reagan saying, `Thanks for the bronze.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eisner says that when things get too serious at the house,
Nicks will say ``This needs a granny touch here'' and throw in
something that doesn't belong. ``That's been our whole thing with
Brad,'' Nicks said. ``He has a great sense of humor, and it's not
some church.''
</P>
<P>
   But owning the Gill house is a bit more of a responsibility.
McMakin had treated the Gill house with reverence. The quirky
Craftsman furniture he made for it was still there. McMakin's
restoration brought back the stucco and cement walls, as well as
one of Gill's trademark archways, which had been removed and stored
at the back of the house. He even restored the first layer of paint
on the porch, light blue, to create the illusion that the broiling
Hollywood sun was throwing cooling shadows on the tilt slab
construction walls. With its many angles, ``you could have 20
people in that house and never even know it,'' Nicks said. Design
elements that at first might seem decorative, like curved walls,
are functional: dust doesn't stick in the corner. Six doors in the
hallway close to create a private phone room. But the house is
never really fully restored: It needs constant upkeep, as the
cement cracks and the stucco bubbles. ``It's like the Golden Gate
Bridge,'' Dunning said.
</P>
<P>
   This house, which transcends trends, is the serious side of the
Nickses, the side that led to their making their first documentary,
``Hell House,'' which is about a Fundentalist morality play acted
out in a religious house of horrors, with Satan as a tour guide.
They are submitting it for consideration to Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   For fun, they always have Stone Canyon. ``I used to say all the
time on shoots, `Let's find a house that, like, the groovy
grandparents own and the kids got the keys for the weekend,'''
Nicks said. ``They bring all their friends. And it has things like
old record players, and records. A bar. A big giant living-room
table you can put 20 people around.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple throw parties, like Nelson Riddle orchestra night, so
friends don't have to meet in restaurants, the L.A. social curse.
``Stephanie and I wake up and take a swim in the pool at seven in
the morning, and say, how lucky are we to be living in this
house,'' he said. ``I worked hard, and I'm glad I was able to make
that happen, but I don't really think I deserve that lifestyle.
That's reserved for Dean Martin _ and Matt Helm. Matt Helm wakes up
in the morning and takes a swim, not me. I'm from St. Louis, man, I
don't know about that.''

 &HT;    SIGNS OF PANIC ON THE STREETS AS RUBLE TUMBLES OUT OF CONTROL
 &HT;    With JOURNAL-RUSSIA-$ADV27.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Anxious Russians camped outside commercial banks
seeking to withdraw their money Wednesday as the Central Bank
conceded it no longer could prevent a freefall of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario for Russia's struggling post-Soviet
economy appeared to be unfolding in the most frantic day yet of the
financial and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Currency trading was suspended in Moscow just after it began
when the ruble fell five percent against the U.S. dollar, coming
after a nearly 10 percent drop on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, apprehension was verging on panic. Hundreds of
commercial banks and currency-exchange points closed after the
ruble plunge, sending alarmed Russians descending on banks in a
largely unsuccessful effort to withdraw their deposits or convert
their rubles to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have $2,000 in this bank and I want to get as much out as I
can while I can. The doors have been locked for an hour, but I'll
sleep here if I must,'' said 35-year-old engineer Leonid Seleveyez,
who waited in a driving rain with about 100 other Russians outside
a branch of SBS-Agro Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Further steep slides seemed inevitable as the central bank,
dangerously low on hard-currency reserves, announced it could no
longer afford to protect the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was suspended on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange
(MICEX) with the ruble at 8.26 to the dollar, but on the street the
rate hit 10 rubles to the dollar and lower. The declines came after
Russia on Tuesday night announced a plan to restructure about $40
billion in Russian short-term domestic debt held by domestic and
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, Prime Minister-designate Viktor Chernomyrdin is
struggling to form a new government after President Boris Yeltsin
sacked the entire cabinet on Sunday. The newspaper Izvestia called
Yeltsin's surprising move ``changing parachutes mid-jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin abruptly flew to Ukraine for meetings Wednesday
night with Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), in an appeal for further assistance. The IMF
is scheduled to deliver a $4.3 billion installment of a $22.6
billion bailout package agreed to last month, however the aid is
tied to assurances by the previous Russian government under Sergei
Kiriyenko that it would pursue economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House said there were no plans to hold
emergency consultations with world leaders on aid to ease the
Russia crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no shortcuts in restoring market confidence, and the
next steps are up to the Russians,'' White House deputy spokesman
Barry Toiv told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Moscow financial analysts predicted the ruble, at
6.2 to the U.S. dollar just two weeks ago, could plummet to 15 to
the dollar by next month. In announcing a controlled devaluation on
Aug. 17, the central bank had said it would not allow the ruble to
dip below 9.5 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, further devaluation means their salaries and
pensions are worth less while prices on store shelves, particularly
for imported goods, continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate is changing so rapidly that we are at a loss. We
don't even know at what prices we should sell,'' said Inga
Shapoval, manager of a pet-supplies store in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On the currency market, traders and banks looking to rid
themselves of rubles then began buying German marks after trading
for dollars was suspended. The ruble ended the day 41 percent lower
in value against the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets throughout Europe declined on the grim news
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's central bank appeared paralyzed by the developments
clearly beyond its control, choosing to pretend that Wednesday
never happened. It declared void all ruble-dollar trading that had
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the bank announced that currency trading would
resume Thursday with the ruble rate set at 7.86 to the dollar, the
official rate at the end of trading on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate meant little as it became apparent that Russia can
no longer manage the value of its currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central bank is not in adequate control of the situation
and does not see concrete ways out of the situation,'' said
Alexander Ivanishev, an investment analyst at Credit Anstaldt.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank said that it had spent $1.8 billion since Aug.
17 from its dwindling foreign currency and gold reserves to support
the ruble, making any further consequential intervention
impossible. Its reserves were $15.1 billion on August 14.
</P>
<P>
   After whirlwind profits in Russia since Yeltsin's reelection in
1996, some Western investors predicted the flight of foreign
companies from Russia if the consumer economy crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the distinct feeling of a party at 4 a.m. after the
apartment has been trashed and the guests have left,'' said one
American investment analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win broader support from the opposition-led
parliament, Chernomyrdin has been holding talks with Communist
leaders on a possible coalition government. His ability to consider
including longtime Yeltsin foes in a new government was regarded by
analysts as a further sign that the ailing Yeltsin has ceded
unprecedented powers to Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin dismissed rumors sweeping Moscow, U.S. and
European financial markets that Yeltsin might be forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press service categorically denies this and declares that
it is stupid,'' said Alexei Gromov, deputy chief of the Kremlin
press service.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin remained secluded at his government estate outside
Moscow, reportedly consulting by telephone with Chernomyrdin about
his trip to the Crimea region of the Ukraine. In addition to
meeting with IMF officials, Chernomyrdin also talked with Leonid
Kuchma, the president of Ukraine, and Alexander Lukashenko, the
president of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on the outcome of his talks with Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's trip took officials at the foreign ministry by
surprise, and raised speculation that Chernomyrdin may be seeking a
closer political alliance with the hardliners running the two
former Soviet republics. One senior foreign ministry official
called the meeting ``some kind of real improvisation.''

 &HT;    SIGNS OF PANIC ON THE STREETS AS RUBLE TUMBLES OUT OF CONTROL
 &HT;    With JOURNAL-RUSSIA-$ADV27.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Anxious Russians camped outside commercial banks
seeking to withdraw their money Wednesday as the Central Bank
conceded it no longer could prevent a freefall of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario for Russia's struggling post-Soviet
economy appeared to be unfolding in the most frantic day yet of the
financial and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Currency trading was suspended in Moscow just after it began
when the ruble fell five percent against the U.S. dollar, coming
after a nearly 10 percent drop on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, apprehension was verging on panic. Hundreds of
commercial banks and currency-exchange points closed after the
ruble plunge, sending alarmed Russians descending on banks in a
largely unsuccessful effort to withdraw their deposits or convert
their rubles to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have $2,000 in this bank and I want to get as much out as I
can while I can. The doors have been locked for an hour, but I'll

ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS TAKE A SEAT, BUT FIRST THEY BUILD IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back-to-school, the time of notebooks and protractors and sales
circulars, has become one of the basic seasons of American
marketing. Even adults decades out of the classroom can succumb to
the pitch; it evokes certain primal school-day sights and smells
and textures. At the Southern California Institute of Architecture
(SciArc), the once-renegade school whose influence has shaped the
look of design in Los Angeles, back-to-school means something
different. There, first-year students don't buy stuff; they build
their own desks.
</P>
<P>
   The process is not just a basic exercise in hands-on
construction and design but a ritual of initiation into the student
body and the philosophy of the school. Stripped-down and basic, at
one level, the desk is a model of a certain sort of design, like
the Levittown Cape Cod customized with a patio and trim, the
stripper Chevrolet fitted out with new wheels and an aerodynamic
package, the mail-order computer souped up with peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Working from plans drawn by one of the school's first teachers,
the architect Robert Mangurian, the students assemble each
student's desk in teams. The modified assembly-line approach sets a
pattern for each student's relationship with his peers. In this and
other ways, the desk is a lesson in more than design. It is also
one in designing education.
</P>
<P>
   The desks end up jammed together in open rooms that are alive
with activity almost around the clock. As the school year goes on,
said Randall Wilson, the head of the school's wood shop where the
desks are built, students change them. ``The desk's framework can
be individualized and customized,'' he said, ``so it begins to
abstract over time in many wonderful ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students, Wilson added, enclose their space with fabric or
old doors so, he said, the desk takes on a shack-like quality, and
the big rooms full of desks in turn assume the look of a
shantytown. The students take their desks with them when they
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The initiation project began as a kind of furniture design at
the most basic level. It was inspired, Wilson said, by Gerrit
Rietveld's De Stijl crate furniture. But it also reminded me of
Donald Judd's minimalist-sculpture-turned-furniture or even of the
inexpensive coffee tables found in the mall outlets of the This
Side Up chain.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Wilson began experimenting with replacing
wood screws and white glue with a metal fastener called the Simpson
connector. SciArc ended up ordering so many connectors _ about 100
desks are built each year _ that a sales representative from the
Simpson Corporation flew out to see what was going on. This year,
the chipboard surface that tops the frame of 1-by-4's is to be
replaced by one made of a material derived from wheat straw: a
token of SciArc's emphasis on sustainable design, using renewable
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Building the desk ties new students to the history of the
school. It is a link to the school's radical origins, its birth in
a countercultural secession by students and faculty from California
State Polytechnic University, Pomona, in 1972. ``It was a social
experiment,'' said Michael Rotondi, the former director of SciArc
and a member of its first graduating class. The first buildings, in
Santa Monica, were refurbished by the students; the existing
building on Beethoven Street near Marina Del Rey, not far from the
planned Dreamworks complex in Playa Vista, is a converted
industrial building.
</P>
<P>
   Social and environmental concerns remain high here, although
many of the first students and longtime faculty have achieved
mainstream success. The rugged ethos and plain style of the desk
sometimes surface in the architecture of alumni and faculty, from
Michael Rotundi, the former director of SciArc and a member of its
first graduating class, to Eric Owen Moss to Michele Saee, in
buildings where exposed studs are combined with drain pipes used as
columns to produce structures with fantastic angles and scarps.
</P>
<P>
   But contemplating the desks at SciArc left me with another
notion. The desk project could serve as a model for education in
general, whose framework corresponds to a basic canon, later to be
supplemented and specialized, like the much challenged but
longstanding idea of ``liberal'' education. The desks put me in
mind of my own education; they made me promise myself to read books
I've been planning to read for years, from Thucydides to George
Eliot. These are overlooked 1-by-4's; I sometimes feel the absence
of them squeaking and creaking beneath my ideas.
</P>
<P>
   During the long winter months, which the back-to-school sales
tell us can't be far off, there will be time to add ornament and
fabric and panels to customize and decorate.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Bobby Short has been singing at the Cafe
Carlyle that he feels New York is really ``my personal property,
right down Broadway to City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful, Bobby. That slice of New York skyline you think is
yours may in fact be trademarked.
</P>
<P>
   The art deco spire of the Chrysler Building is a registered
trademark (No. 1126888). So is the neoclassical facade of the New
York Stock Exchange (No. 1761655). Even the Manhattan White Pages
needed permission to depict ``Patience,'' one of the marble lions
guarding the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue (Trademark No.
1838167).
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Center has applied for trademark protection of its
centerpiece skyscraper, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, along with
representations of the skating rink, Prometheus and Atlas. Radio
City Music Hall is considering trademarking its signature art deco
interiors. The Flatiron Building and Grand Central Terminal are
other eligible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a growing number of landlords are seeking to control the
ways in which images and likenesses of their distinctive buildings
are used by others. They mean business, too.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange has sued the New York-New York Hotel
and Casino of Las Vegas for building a one-third-scale model of the
exchange's facade on the gambling floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never taken the position that somebody who walks in off
Las Vegas Boulevard will think they're in the Stock Exchange,''
said Doreen Costa of Baker &AMP; Botts, lawyers for the exchange. ``But
somebody may believe that this use is licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   And in New York the owners of the Chrysler Building have
demanded that Fishs Eddy, a tableware store, stop selling a line of
dishes called 212, which depicts the building's Jazz Age spire
among other New York landmarks in a skyline border.
</P>
<P>
   The chill from these cases is being felt not just by souvenir
makers, who reproduce buildings on mugs, magnets or salt-and-pepper
shakers, but by designers, publishers, photographers and
horror-film makers in search of fresh landmarks to crush.
</P>
<P>
   Their needs can conflict with those of owners determined to
treat architectural features as valuable _ and exclusive _ assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the responsibility of the ownership to protect the good
will that is symbolized by the mark,'' said Keri Christ of Milbank,
Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, lawyers for the owners of the Chrysler
Building, the Flatiron Building and Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is analogous to the situation where a celebrity or a
famous person has a property right in their name and likeness that
enables them to control the commercial exploitation of their
identity,'' she said. ``Why would you want to deny that kind of
protection to a famous landmark?''
</P>
<P>
   Because, said Julie Gaines, the co-owner of Fishs Eddy, ``it's
un-American!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they say we can't use the Chrysler Building?'' she
asked. ``We wanted to do a plate that represented New York City.
Leaving off the Chrysler Building would be like leaving off the
World Trade Center.''
</P>
<P>
   David Childs, a partner in Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, which has
designed corporate icons like Lever House on Park Avenue, was
outraged to learn that the stainless-steel Chrysler spire was a
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean you can't use stainless steel?'' he wondered.
``Does this mean your building cannot come to a point?'' For that
matter, he asked, ``What about Imhotep?''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, William Van Alen's design for the top of
the Chrysler tower does bear an elongated resemblance to Imhotep's
Step Pyramid at Sakkara, Egypt, built almost 4,800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of trademarking a building is not as ancient as that,
but it is not freshly concocted. It goes back at least to the
1930s, when courts held that White Castle had an exclusive right to
its distinctive diner design.
</P>
<P>
   In 1879, the engineer Gustave Eiffel obtained a patent on his
structural system for the Statue of Liberty. (The statue's image is
firmly in the public domain.)
</P>
<P>
   Patents, which protect inventions, are not usually sought for
one-of-a-kind structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of things that are more likely to be patented are
Fotomats, telephone booths, fast-food restaurants, styles of
layouts,'' said John Kittle, the director of the design examining
group in the Patent and Trademark Office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Copyrights, which protect original artistic works, are more
often claimed by architects.
</P>
<P>
   Platt Byard Dovell Architects adds a ``(COPYRIGHT)'' to each
drawing. ``Putting a `C' in a circle says to the owner, `You can't
copy my drawing,''' said Paul Byard, a partner in the firm and a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Trademarks are indicators _ designs, symbols, words or phrases _
that distinguish the goods and services of one party from those of
others. Federal registration is not required, although it helps in
legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The official registration for the stock exchange's trademark
describes it as ``a representation of an actual building facade
with the wording `New York Stock Exchange' located beneath the
pediment.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange is suing the New York-New York hotel in part
because ``the use of our mark helps them convey the message, even
if implicitly, that `we're a bit fairer than other casinos,''' said
Ms. Costa, the lawyer for the exchange. (In court papers, the hotel
has denied this charge, but it would not comment further.)
</P>
<P>
   As a trademark, a building is no different from any other
three-dimensional object that plays such a role _ the Weber grill,
the Pepperidge Farm Goldfish cracker or the Coca-Cola bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Coke bottles featured prominently in the case of the Rock 'n'
Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, which has sued to
prevent a photographer, Charles Gentile, from selling posters
showing the pyramidal facade of its building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical structure of the museum, the I.M. Pei-designed
building, is `the Coke bottle,''' declared Chief Judge Boyce Martin
Jr. of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio, in a
dissenting opinion in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its building symbolizes something unique and protectable under
the trademark laws,'' he wrote. ``Like the Coke bottle, the
building is also a container. Instead of containing a soft drink,
the museum envelops an array of tangible and intangible elements.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two-judge majority disagreed, lifted an injunction
against Gentile and sent the case back to district court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we view the photograph in Gentile's poster, we do not
readily recognize the design of the museum's building as an
indicator of source or sponsorship,'' they declared. ``What we see,
rather, is a photograph of an accessible, well-known, public
landmark.''

<P>
   Souvenir makers are already well acquainted with owners who
object to seeing their buildings on ashtrays, baseball caps and
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockefeller Center does mind,'' said Jack Gindi, the president
of City Merchandise in Brooklyn, makers of 1,200 different items.
So do Radio City Music Hall and the Hard Rock Cafe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect their wishes,'' he added. ``If they don't want free
publicity,'' he said, ``it's fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reproduction on a larger scale was the subject of a case
involving Donald Trump's boomerang-shaped Trump Plaza, at Third
Avenue and 61st Street, built in 1983 to designs by Philip
Birnbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by another developer for a project on the opposite
corner, Birnbaum envisioned a monumental gateway to upper Third
Avenue and designed the second tower as a near twin of Trump Plaza.
Trump sued and won a settlement in which the second building, the
Savoy, was redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the unlikely possibility of duplication, most owners are
more concerned about the dilution of images on which they have
staked their money and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   When the lion sculpture ``Patience'' appeared on the front of
the 1997-98 White Pages, it was accompanied by a notice that the
representation is the trademark and property of the New York Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``As institutions become more nationally and internationally
recognizable, their logos become almost tangible extensions of the
institutions themselves,'' said Robert Vanni, general counsel to
the library.
</P>
<P>
   This belief is shared by Newmark &AMP; Co., which acquired an
ownership interest last year in the Flatiron Building at 23rd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the Flatiron Building image is seen, it's going to
impact who we attract to the building,'' said Barry Gosin, the
chief executive of Newmark. He said he was more concerned about the
unauthorized use of the tower as a business logo than he was about
its destruction in ``Godzilla,'' although he added, ``I don't think
anyone called to say, `We're crushing your building.'''
</P>
<P>
   Movie and television production companies count on being able to
film well-known buildings from public places without securing the
owners' permission or paying fees.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Reed Scott, New York City's commissioner of film,
theater and broadcasting, said the prospect of trademarked
landmarks ``seems like a bad move to me and endlessly
complicating.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless filmmakers stick to the Empire State Building.
Having been scaled by King Kong 65 years ago, the building accepts
its place in the public domain _ even in ``Independence Day,''
which showed the tower being atomized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in good company,'' said Lydia Ruth, a spokeswoman for
Empire State Building Co. ``They got the White House, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Empire State Building belongs to everyone,'' she said.
``The last thing I'd want to do is restrict the use of the
building. I know it's kind of diminished when it's got a
thermometer stuck inside. But we love to see the building
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Chrysler Building take a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Jack Kent
Cooke, who then owned the building, registered the Chrysler spire
as a trademark. The tower was built in 1930 by Walter Chrysler, and
although Chrysler Corp. moved out long ago, it has no objection to
the name being on the building, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Speyer Properties and Travelers Group, which acquired
the property in January, filed a trademark application in May for
the ``configuration, overall appearance and design'' of the entire
building _ not just the spire _ for possible use on more than 400
goods and services, from real-estate development to horse blankets.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, they demanded that Fishs Eddy ``immediately and
permanently discontinue all use of the mark,'' in part because
purchasers might believe that the china is authorized, endorsed or
sponsored by the owners. They also demanded that Fishs Eddy
``immediately arrange for the prompt destruction of all remaining
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the owners, Ms. Christ, said in an interview
later that Fishs Eddy was not being singled out. ``This is part of
a diligent enforcement program,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaines of Fishs Eddy thought about replacing the Chrysler
Building with Central Park on the border. What stiffened her
resolve to fight back, she said, was Ms. Christ's assertion that
the depiction of the Chrysler spire on the china was ``inconsistent
with the high standards of quality'' associated with the trademark
_ particularly given the number of knickknacks that capitalize on
the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Tamarin of Hall Dickler Kent Friedman &AMP; Wood, the lawyer
for Fishs Eddy, said: ``Most buildings that are landmarked are
going to have similar problems. For years and years, nobody used
them as trademarks. No one associates them with any particular
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishs Eddy is selling more 212 china than ever, thanks to
publicity over the Chrysler issue. ``I can't even keep the pattern
in stock,'' Ms. Gaines said. She has expanded the line to drinking
glasses and has even test-baked Chrysler-shaped cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get caught,'' Ms. Gaines vowed, ``I'll eat the
inventory.''

ARCHITECTURE'S DOYENNE PASSES BATON IN MONTREAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland)  (lb) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phyllis Lambert, the formidable doyenne of architecture, whose
youthful rebellion against her father, the liquor tycoon Samuel
Bronfman, resulted in Mies van der Rohe designing the Seagram
Building in New York, announced last week that she had chosen her
successor as director of the Canadian Center for Architecture in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Forster, founding director of the Getty Center for the
History of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles and, currently,
chairman of the Department of Art and Architecture at the Federal
Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, will assume the
directorship on March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-born scholar, 63, is expected to bring a considerable
measure of international cachet and academic integrity to the
center that Ms. Lambert, 71, founded, using her own inheritance
money, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself worrying about what would happen if I were
knocked down by a bus,'' Ms. Lambert said last week, ``and I wanted
to be sure that the center was in the most imaginative and
competent hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, the Canadian Center for Architecture
_ a museum, library and study center wrapped in a $40-million
edifice designed by Peter Rose _ has amassed a collection strong on
contemporary architecture and sponsored timely and intellectually
challenging exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CCA is one of the few institutions that regularly has
exhibitions of international importance of the sort that MOMA once
did but hasn't done in a long time,'' the architect Richard Meier
said, referring to New York's Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition
now on display, ``The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life''
(through Nov. 8), has attracted significant attention for its
provocative scrutiny of the seemingly mundane suburban lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lambert will continue as chairwoman of the board of trustees
and remain an active member of the acquisitions committee. Her
immediate plans, however, are to concentrate on developing an
exhibition dedicated to Mies van der Rohe's years in America, which
will open at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 2000
and travel to the center in the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Forster, who has been living in Zurich since 1992, will be
moving in February to Montreal. He anticipates a smooth transition
from academia to the museum world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the Getty, where there were 35,000 books and a
lot of confused ideas about what might be possible,'' Forster said.
``My first obligation is to follow exactly the course Phyllis has
set, and then broaden and sharpen it.'' He added that he is
contemplating a series of exhibitions exploring the role of
defining moments in architecture, such as the year 1910, when Le
Corbusier decided to leave Berlin for France.
</P>
<P>
   Forster's appointment, in fact, may be a kind of defining moment
of its own. ``This is terrific news,'' Terence Riley, chief curator
of the department of architecture and design at the Museum of
Modern Art, said. ``He's a natural to follow Phyllis. And to her
credit, she has selected a personality as strong as her own. This
will heat up the scene, and that's good for everyone.''

AS CANADIAN DOLLAR DECLINES, U.S. VISITS RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., August 30)  
 (JT)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ A dollar is a dollar, except
perhaps these days in Canada, where one American dollar is now
worth about one and a half Canadian dollars, giving Americans a big
boost as soon as they cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   And they are making the trip north in record numbers so far this
year, according to Canadian tourism officials. American visitors
are up 11 percent here in Vancouver, just slightly ahead of the 9.7
percent increase nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously though, the disparity in the value of the American and
Canadian dollars _ a wider gap than ever before _ is something that
not all Americans are aware of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed,'' said Patrick Fairchild, a school janitor from
Victor, N.Y., who traveled to Toronto with his family recently to
take in ``Les Miserables'' and see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other American visitors, Fairchild said he had not
even thought about the exchange rate before crossing the border.
His good fortune only hit him when he took $35 to a currency
exchange and got $47 in Canadian dollars; he could have done better
at another money exchange, but he was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to hit Niagara Falls on my way back,'' Fairchild
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials say that because of the similarities between
the United States and Canada, and because Canada's currency is
called a dollar, tourists from the United States tend to assume
that the money is interchangeable. John C. Olsthoorn, of the
Canadian Tourism Commission, said that is especially so for
Americans who do not live near the northern border and are not
familiar with Canadian money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to raise awareness a bit, but not highlight it
in flashing lights because the dollar will change the other way at
some point,'' Olsthoorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the perception problem is that the decline in the
Canadian dollar _ called a loonie because the $1 coin bears the
image of a common loon _ has not been sudden. Rather, the loonie
has been in a long, gradual slide since 1976, the last time one
Canadian dollar was worth the same as one American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was only this spring that the loonie broke through
its historic low against the dollar. That has been followed by
numerous further declines, which have generated a fair amount of
news coverage and suddenly made Americans aware of the fact that
their dollars can go much further north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   A loonie is now worth just over 65 cents. Canada no longer uses
paper $1 or $2 bills; a $2 coin is commonly called a toonie.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early for statistics showing precisely how
Americans in Canada are spending their windfall, Canadian tourism
officials say that many appear to travel to more-remote locations
or to upgrade accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those individuals who would have stayed at a middle-range
establishment are now booking rooms in the upper end of what's
available in places like Vancouver, Victoria and Whistler,'' said
Roderick J. Harris, president of Tourism B.C., the provincial
tourism office for British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   For American travelers, the decline of the loonie has provided a
more transparent advantage than the currency troubles of some other
countries. For example, in Mexico, where the peso was devalued
precipitously in late 1994 and early 1995, resorts in Cancun and
other places priced hotel rooms in dollar equivalents, as did
Mexican airlines. That wiped out most of the potential advantage
from the peso's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Canada, tourism officials say. Harris said hotel rates
have been flat or just slightly higher, in part because the Asian
economic crisis has hurt many Pacific Coast resorts and forced them
to keep rates competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the declining loonie has not been accompanied by
any noticeable jump in inflation in Canada, which makes shopping
attractive, at least until Canada's high national and provincial
sales taxes are added. Americans are eligible for tax refunds if
they save original receipts and fill out official forms. The
process is not painless, but the forms are widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Harris recommends that American travelers change their money
into Canadian dollars before leaving home. He does not take into
account the exchange rate, but rather is focusing on a way for
Americans to be able to appreciate just how much more they have
available to spend during their time away.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to change dollars in Canada, there are
plenty of options. Rates at money exchanges, banks and the front
desks of larger hotels tend to be fairly consistent, the only
difference often being whether a commission is charged.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Pacific's Hotel Vancouver will change up to $1,000 a
day for its guests without a commission, said Oliver Muschamp, a
guest-service agent at the hotel. He recommends that guests change
as much as they want on arrival, and then apply whatever is unspent
at the end of the stay to the hotel bill.

 &HT;    Pin-trading popular pastime at Little League World Series
 &HT;    By Kim Grizzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ When Mike Lilley told Justin Hardee he
missed his chance, he wasn't talking about a great pitch or a
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, baseball's not the only game in town here.
Pin trading appears to be the second most popular sport at the
Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how far back the whole trend goes, but that's a
big event here,'' said Nancy Scudder, media relations
administrative assistant for the Little League.
</P>
<P>
   Players and fans carry zippered pouches to show off their
collections and allow them to trade for pins from Japan, Mexico and
Saudi Arabia. North Carolina pins are a pretty hot commodity here,
since a team from the Tar Heel state hasn't been to the series
since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great hobby,'' Scudder said. ``It's an
international thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Aldridge, 11, of Greenville just took up pin trading, but
he already has an international collection going and was trying to
work a trade with a fan from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got started yesterday,'' Aldridge said. ``I got a '97
Saudi from somebody on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen everybody down here do it. I've seen people with
bags full _ suitcases full. It's just the thing to do down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Players from Greenville have started their own collections.
Hardee started collecting at the Southern Regional in St.
Petersburg, Fla. This week, he's traded pins with Japanese players
and picked up some new ones like the ``uncle'' pins from team
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team hosts, they have their own pin, so people want to get
an 'uncle' pin,'' Scudder said. ``Our Little League photographer
has his own pin. Our World Series drivers, they have their own
pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors like Honda, Hershey and Gatorade also have their own
pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot of fun,'' Scudder said. ``It's not just kids
that do it. It's people of all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Idamae Danley, 57, laundry supervisor at the Holiday Inn, has
been collecting since 1981. She has one from Guam and two from
Saudi Arabia in her collection, which is large enough to fill three
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, when they come here and stay, they bring us pins,''
said Danley, whose daughter, Tina Alter, works at Little League
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Danley wants a North Carolina pin, and they're hard
to come by. Kids at Howard J. Lamade Stadium are getting two for
one in trades for the Carolina pin.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors can pick up official Little League pins at souvenir
stands for $3 apiece. There's a pin-trading tent behind the
stadium, but deals are being made in the stands, on the hill and in
area hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But what will the pins be worth back home in Greenville? It's
hard to say. Unlike baseball cards, the pins don't have
publications that list their values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value may only be to the traders,'' Scudder said.

 &HT;    Like heaven for Little League World Series entrants
 &HT;    Eds: Singular Tar Heel is cq. Greenville plays tonight
(Wednesday) at 8 p.m.
 &HT;    By Kim Grizzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Pete Carraway is in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the scoresheet says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm charting the game, and where it said 'location' I put
heaven,'' Carraway said after a victory this week by his Greenville
Tar Heel All Stars, marking their first appearance in the Little
League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   No team from North Carolina has been in the Little League World
Series in more than 40 years. There's never been a team from
Greenville, and, statistically speaking, there's not likely to be
another. So the hometown fans are making the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 500 Greenville fans turned out to see Tar Heel in its
first game, and the numbers increased from there. After one loss,
the team played Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in a game they had to win
to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left home late last week, Carraway told his pastor
that he felt a little bit like Moses. But unlike the Old Testament
prophet, who only got a view of the promised land from a
mountaintop, Carraway has been allowed to cross over and enter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey that has taken nearly 40 years. After playing
semi-pro ball, Carraway coached his first Little League team in
1961. He's never seen a team go this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream for Pete,'' his wife, Grace, said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the second-row bleachers, Carraway, 79, took in the
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell when you get here, TV doesn't do it justice,'' he
said of scenic Howard J. Lamade Stadium, leaning on his ``staff,''
a wooden bat he takes to games.
</P>
<P>
   Carraway bought it in 1940 and used it when he coached his first
Little Leaguers. Black tape circles one end, but it's still used to
hit grounders and pop flies during tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the time, Carraway takes it on the road to Little
League games up and down the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things you don't know why you do,''
Carraway said of carrying the bat. ``It kind of got to be a
trademark. If I'm going to where baseball is being played, I carry
it with me. When people see me, they expect to see this bat in my
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   When folks from Greenville go to a ballgame, they also expect to
see Marvin Jarman. Jarman, so well known in Greenville that he's
had a street named after him, was noticeably absent during the
regionals in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for Marvin Jarman,'' read a sign shown during the
ESPN2 broadcast of the final game.
</P>
<P>
   He's here, but had to accompany a student back to Greenville for
classes. Pitt County students started classes last week, but you
couldn't tell that by looking in the stands Monday. Kids sporting
painted faces and Southern Regional Champions T-shirts did the wave
and held up signs for their friends back home.

   ``WE MISS YOU, KATHRYN. FLY UP,'' one read. Another simply
stated ``Thanks St. Peter's.'' (Guess the school excused her

Hodges, whose younger brother, Kevin, pitches for Greenville Tar

   ``Our team was one game away from being in the World Series in
our age group.''

INTO THE VOID AT COLUMBUS CIRCLE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the selection of a design for the old Coliseum
site on New York's Columbus Circle and plans afoot to spiff up the
circle's core, this may be the time to appreciate the power of this
place to stir the imagination over the years.
</P>
<P>
   We still think that Billie Tsien's 1983 project, ``Dig a Hole to
China,'' is the best and the darkest of the many proposals ever put
forward. If realized, this anti-monument would certainly put the
Franco-British Chunnel to shame.
</P>
<P>
   And Columbus himself would love it. He's getting awfully tired
of standing there all by himself on top of that column year after
year, as if he were St. Simeon Stylites. With Tsien's project, the
explorer might finally bump into the real Indies, five centuries
after he sailed forth to find them.
</P>
<P>
   First shown with a group of other visionary schemes at the old
Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies on West 40th Street,
Tsien's concept is a tribute to those who eagerly gaze into the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien, a principal in the New York firm Tod Williams Billie
Tsien &AMP; Associates, has since gone on to design such acclaimed
works as the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, Calif.; Hereford
College at the University of Virginia, and the Museum of American
Folk Art planned for West 54th Street in Manhattan. These buildings
show a natural progression from ``Dig a Hole''; Williams and Tsien
are masters at manipulating spatial voids and simple geometric
forms. In La Jolla and Charlottesville, they have created
hauntingly sublime landscapes. But this would be the firm's first
truly international park.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not overlook the design's immense functional appeal.
It would take a large pit indeed to hold all the models, plans and
renderings that have piled up over the years with successive
efforts to transform this civic space, from Morris &AMP; O'Connor's
1935 proposal for a Municipal Art Center to Moshe Safdie's
ill-fated pair of prismatic towers in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this could become the symbolic Memory Hole for all of
the many New York visions, both unbuilt and demolished, that have
accumulated throughout the city's history: The grand City Beautiful
groupings. The Lower Manhattan Expressway. Rem Koolhaas' design for
the expansion of the Museum of Modern Art. Just think how terrific
it would be to leap, like Alice toward Wonderland, and see the
Coney Island Steeplechase, the old Penn Station, the Trylon and
Perisphere whizzing rapidly by one's gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'd have to wear a dress or other outfit that opens
like a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe it should work the other way around: instead of
tossing old buildings and ideas into the hole, we could fish for
new ideas from the other side of the world. If we gathered enough
pagodas, we could stack them up on top of the Coliseum building and
save ourselves the trouble of putting a new building there. The
southwest corner of Central Park could be turned into rice paddies.
We could call them Trump International Rice Paddies. Lincoln Center
could be enclosed within walls punctuated by dragon gates and
declared a new Forbidden City.

<P>
   A firm handshake, a neat appearance and a thorough knowledge of
your field used to be just about all you needed to land a job or
make a good impression at a meeting. But in today's workplace,
technology that allows meetings to take place between distant
points requires yet another quality _ stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   While the market for home videophones has not taken off, the use
of videoconferencing _ which allows people to ``meet'' at several
locations using video and audio links _ has skyrocketed in the
corporate world in the last several years, as companies try to cut
travel costs and speed products to market.
</P>
<P>
   Videoconferencing equipment sales grew at a rate of 40 percent
to 50 percent a year in the early 1990s, reaching $1.4 billion last
year, said Elliot Gold, president of Telespan Publishing in
Altadena, Calif., which publishes a weekly newsletter on the
teleconferencing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for ``group systems,'' which are designed for corporate
meetings held in conference rooms, and the smaller PC-based
``desktop systems'' have plummeted. In the last two years, the
price of a group system made by 3M dropped to $6,000 from as much
as $60,000, Michael Begeman, manager of 3M Meeting Network, said.
``The only ones who could afford videoconferencing a few years ago
were really big companies,'' he said, adding that declining costs
have ``suddenly put videoconferencing into the price range of small
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of videoconferencing means that a job
candidate may now be asked at the spur of the moment to walk around
the corner for an interview using a videoconference hookup with a
prospective employer in another city. A salesperson may be required
to make a presentation to a room full of people via a
videoconference hookup. Or a newly formed work team with members in
offices around the world may be asked to brainstorm on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Most people experience some stage fright the first time they are
asked to participate in a videoconference _ and with good reason.
``People judge you by the standards of television,'' said Andrew
Gilman, president of Commcore Consulting Group, a communications
training company in Washington. ``They're used to watching Ted
Koppel or Tom Brokaw on screen, who know how to act in front of a
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the limits of the technology, there is often a slight
delay in the video image, which at first can cause confusion. The
first time that Fernando Agramonte, a client representative for IBM
in New York, used videoconferencing in a course he took last year
at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., it took him a while to
adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to speak slower because I couldn't tell if my point was
getting across,'' Agramonte said. ``I was looking at the screen,
but I didn't know if the person I was talking to could see me the
same way I could see her, or if she could hear me. There was a
small delay. I would see her move or speak, and I'd hear the words
maybe a split second afterwards. It was like `The Twilight Zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most people, after using a system a few times, get used to any
delay and begin to relax. The goal, said T.J. Walker, president of
TJWalker.com, a presentation-training company in Manhattan, should
be ``not to make you look like a TV star, but to avoid the things
you're doing that unknowingly distract people from your message. We
try to prevent people from visually putting their foot in their
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Following are some tips for successful videoconferences:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before taking part in a videoconference, try to find out what
type of equipment is being used and whether there is a noticeable
delay in the audio and video images.
</P>
<P>
   While most PC-based desktop systems are plagued by long delays
and jerky video, they are rarely used to conduct large meetings or
job interviews. The best use of a desktop system is for just two
people to collaborate on a document on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's group videoconferencing systems operate at 384
kilobits per second or higher, which means movement of people on
the screen is fluid, voices are clear and there is practically no
perceptible delay. At 128 kbps, the picture is more jerky and there
is a noticeable pause between the moment a participant says
something and the moment it is received at the far end.
</P>
<P>
   Because most videoconferencing calls take place over one or more
ISDN (integrated services digital network) phone lines, a one-hour
call from New York to California using 384 kbps would cost a
company $65 to $70 an hour, according to Kevin Flanagan, spokesman
for Picturetel of Andover, Mass., the leading seller of
videoconferencing equipment. By comparison, a system running at 128
kbps, which uses a single ISDN line, would cost $20 to $25 an hour
for the same call.
</P>
<P>
   If you discover that the system you will be using has a delay,
be prepared for overlapping dialogue and long pauses. Speak more
slowly, let people know when you are finished talking, so they can
have their turn, and try not to interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rehearse a job interview or presentation before starting a
videoconference, using videoconferencing equipment if possible. If
not, use a home video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Hoffman of Media Mentors, a communications training
company based in Philadelphia, suggests sending out detailed
reports or charts to meeting participants before the conference
begins. Although many systems allow you to display graphs, charts,
slides and other visual aids, it can be cumbersome if you are
unfamiliar with the equipment. Keep your message simple; one rule
of thumb is to use no more than three key points.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ Get to the conference site early enough to assess the
situation. In most cases, a technician will have set up the camera
and you will not be required to operate it. If you need to run it
for slides, graphs or charts, you need to give yourself plenty of
time to learn how to operate the control board, including how to
pan and zoom the camera and which buttons to push to move the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you and your material are properly positioned for the
cameras. You should be close enough so that people on the other
side can see your expressions. Once you walk into a room for a
videoconference, avoid idle talk _ assume someone is watching and
listening.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch what you wear. Avoid lots of white, red or black. White
reflects too much light, which makes the face dark. Black clothing
causes the face to be overexposed. Red tends to smear. Wear a light
blue shirt, instead of a white shirt, with a suit, and choose solid
colors instead of complex patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Begeman of 3M Meeting Network advises people to stay away from
small prints, thin stripes and plaids. Bulky or baggy clothing
makes you look heavier on screen, tinted eyeglasses give you
raccoon eyes and glittery or dangling jewelry is distracting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid too much side-to-side movement during a videoconference
call, but don't sit rigidly, either. Walker of TJWalker.com
suggests leaning 15 degrees into the camera. ``People focus on your
message more if your face is prominent,'' Walker said. ``Leaning
forward hides the gut and any rolls in the neck. It's the one thing
that can dramatically improve your appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that smiling slightly makes you look confident; without
a smile, you may look like you're frowning. People tend to freeze
and sit on their hands _ a mistake. ``Your message might be
perfect, but the impression is, `Who is this nervous stiff?'''
Walker said. Instead, gesture with your hands, which will
automatically give your voice more energy and inflection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quirky mannerisms that may barely be noticeable in a
face-to-face meeting are magnified in a videoconference and can
detract from the image you are trying to project. Ms. Hoffman of
Media Mentors cautions against twirling hair or a mustache,
fiddling with your glasses or rocking back and forth in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a temptation, especially in the beginning, to be
mesmerized by your own image on the monitor. And if you use it to
check your hairdo or straighten your tie, others will see you doing
it.
</P>
<P>
   The average person blinks 50 to 70 times a minute, according to
Gilman of Commcore. So don't be afraid to blink. On the other hand,
blinking much more than that will make you look nervous, and maybe
even shifty. Tapping a pen during a videoconference can be annoying
to those involved, since the microphones generally pick up
background noise as well as the sound of voices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Videoconferencing has its own rules of etiquette. All
participants should be given the chance to introduce themselves. It
is poor form, for instance, not to let everyone know that your boss
is sitting just out of camera range.
</P>
<P>
   Never read a speech or presentation at a videoconference,
advises Walker. ``People will be bored out of their minds, and will
start playing tic-tac-toe.'' Moving while someone else in the group
is talking is considered upstaging. And don't get up and walk
around the room during an important presentation. Side
conversations are distracting, so if you need to talk privately,
use the ``mute'' button.
</P>
<P>
   Begeman of 3M Meeting Network said that if you are involved in a
videoconference that includes people from several different
locations, it is a good idea to jot down names of people on a grid
so you can refer to it as you speak, using names whenever possible.
This is a good way of grabbing their attention.
</P>
<P>
   In a videoconference job interview, Begeman suggests making it a
habit to pause a second or two after each question is asked, so
that when a difficult question arises and you need time to think
through a response, the pause will not seem out of place. And when
the hard question comes, don't break eye contact when you answer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as you end the videoconference and head back to your
office for the inevitable critique, Begeman recommends that you
remember that ``Very few people are born good at this.''

AFRICAN-INSPIRED DECOR ILLUMINATES NEWARK ARTS CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Usually it's a bronze statue, an old schoolhouse
or a stately home that becomes the symbol of a town. But the new
contender in Newark is a colorful 12-by 92-foot carpet, an addition
to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which was installed last
Thursday in the entrance foyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Afrocentric,'' observed Lynne Falanga, of Watchung, N.J.,
who attended a concert at the center on Sunday. ``They're
incorporating the neighborhood into the arts center, and that's the
best part about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With its rhythmic geometries and blended earth colors, the
runner joins the brightly patterned yellow, green and crimson glass
mosaics in the bathrooms and etched copper elevator doors in the
lobbies as civic icons of an unexpected kind: the center is one of
the first major cultural institutions in the United States to base
its motifs on African decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   The new carpet, its rusty reds giving way to deep blues and
grass greens, and the etched doors and the mosaics (in place since
the center's opening last October) draw on visual traditions
abstracted from West African textiles, ceramics, sculpture and
architecture. Afrocentric motifs are rare in civic buildings,
especially concert halls, whose decorative schemes historically
have been based on Europe's aristocratic palaces and classical
buildings or on abstract modern compositions.
</P>
<P>
   The rug, mosaics and doors were created by the Los Angeles
environmental graphics firm Sussman/Prejza &AMP; Co., in collaboration
with Barton Myers, the architect of the complex. The decoration
signals the cultural background of Newark's largest constituency.
``It was important to have the architecture reflect Newark's ethnic
diversity,'' Gail Thompson, vice president of design and
construction for the center, said.
</P>
<P>
   This visual subtext was not part of the project when it started.
When the architects built a large model, it was clear the
voluminous foyer needed focus. Enter Sussman/Prezja, best known for
the banners it made for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, which
employed rainbows of chromatic ethnicity: magenta from Mexico,
saffron from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration for the runner came from a painting by Paul Klee,
which fortuitously catalyzed the idea of African decoration. ``You
can look at Klee and clearly see he was involved in the discovery
of African arts,'' Sussman said. ``The way color meets color and
line intersects color suggested African imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   Sussman and Holly Hampton, a principal in the firm, who is
African-American, quickly discovered that certain African figures _
the snake, for example _ recurred with widely separated tribes.
Other similarities _ the presence of dots and the tendency to
flatness in surface patterns _ also occurred across cultures, as
did the tendency to fill an area with pattern. (``Very little
void,'' Sussman said.)
</P>
<P>
   The designers first proposed several adaptations of the snake in
the runner. ``It scared everybody,'' Sussman said. ``Everybody felt
more comfortable with a concept that was less overtly symbolic.''
The snake became zigzags, and Hampton began exploring pattern.
``The idea was to give the impression of a woven cloth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged at her drafting table was a runner of muted earth
hues in a nonrepetitive, asymmetrical pattern. ``The design didn't
want to be static and fixed, but an experience that would change as
you walked along,'' Hampton said. ``You see it at a distance, and
then close-up, but can't understand it at a glance. It's not a
one-liner.''
</P>
<P>
   The designers worked with the carpet manufacturer to decide how
much open space was needed in the runner, which was woven in
Thailand. ``It's like music, with dense passages and then silent
spaces that make the passages more intense,'' Sussman said.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant impression comes from the pervasive rusty orange,
which heightens the warm glow of the foyer interior at night. The
huge runner centers the room and the weight of the colors grounds
the space, while the syncopated geometries give it rhythm. The
small rectangular shapes relate to the brick facades of the arts
center, which were inspired by the industrial vernacular of the
surrounding factories. The brick, glass and steel building is
itself a symbol of the city's revitalization, some 30 years after
the Newark riots.
</P>
<P>
   The carpet made its public debut Sunday for a Julio Iglesias
concert. Following the patterned runner, a 4-year-old played
hopscotch. One concert goer, Louise Cadorette, from Elizabeth,
N.J., said: ``The colors are very earthy, and they give character
and a sense of tradition to the building. It's alive.''

LIFE IN A CRATER WILL DO, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN CHEEVER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
</P>
<P>
   Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
</P>
<P>
   Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
</P>
<P>
   The lone and level sands stretch far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any evidence that Percy Bysshe Shelley was writing
about home renovation? Because my wife and I are having our house
renovated. And we feel a lot like Mr. and Mrs. Ozymandias.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't start with the idea of renovating our house in
Pleasantville, N.Y., a 3,000-square-foot Cotswold cottage on
steroids. The house, built in 1907, has what the folks in real
estate like to call character, which means that it takes a lot of
character to live there, because nothing works properly.
</P>
<P>
   No, we started with the idea of moving, inspired by a photograph
of a new mansion in Bedford, N.Y. The Bedford mansion glittered
like a shiny new penny of colossal proportions. The interior was
almost 7,000 square feet. There were pillars on the outside and
eight toilets inside.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty mansions were planned for the development, each designed
to look like the biggest house in town. The McMansion we thought of
as ours had an enormous kitchen, more than two stories high. I
pictured myself making pancakes in it on Sunday mornings. Our boys,
grown suddenly younger and more picturesque, would peer lovingly
down on me from the railing outside their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen ran into a family room that had acres of polished
wooden flooring and a large stone hearth at the far end. I believe
real estate agents call them gathering rooms. Isn't that where you
take the hay at harvest time?
</P>
<P>
   I saw caterers in black pants and white tuxedo shirts drifting
gracefully through our gathering room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinot grigio, Mr. Cheever?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why yes, I believe I will.''
</P>
<P>
   The basement was huge and _ conjure this _ dry as a whistle.
Whenever it rained, we piled into the car, raced to Bedford and
checked the basement. No water. None. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Why so amazed? Well, I knew about water and lies. Eleven years
ago, when we were preparing to buy the house in Pleasantville, I
noticed that a hose had been left on in the pool. The moment we
took possession, I shut off the spigot.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I heard a horrid groaning sound as if a sperm
whale had beached itself at the foot of our lawn. I galloped down
the hill and found that the water level had plunged 2 feet, and
that all three pool skimmers were drawing air.
</P>
<P>
   Our pool is a long way from the house. That is because the pool
started life as a culvert. The transformation has not been entirely
successful. Sometimes, in a heavy rain, it fills up with mud. A
pool man once told me, ``You know, you should turn this into a nice
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   If the pool doesn't hold water very well, then our basement
does. It is spring fed. And our pipes burst regularly, especially
the ones over the walk-in closet.
</P>
<P>
   When a pipe burst in the bedroom closet one Saturday night, I
turned off the water and looked up the number of a 24-hour
emergency plumbing service. Twenty-four hours later, two men
appeared: the talker and the worker. The talker rubbed his hands
together with glee. The worker was very earnest, and very young.
</P>
<P>
   The pipes in our house are connected _ it's a fairly common
setup. But our pipes are also fragile. The young worker banged one
pipe. Another broke. By the time I got them both out of the house,
I had three new leaks.
</P>
<P>
   We were going to put this all behind us and live a new, elegant
life in Bedford. With new pipes and no history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we would have done it, if it weren't for the pictures.
My wife and I drove to the Bedford mansion one day and took
snapshots of each other there, standing by the hearth in the
gathering room. This is us, we thought. The new, the proactive
Cheevers. Striding confidently through life.
</P>
<P>
   Then we had the pictures developed. The house looked imposing,
but who were those tiny, worried people? Was the owner committed to
the employment of the vertically impaired? Were these his servants?
We might be able to buy the house _ the price had been reduced, and
then reduced again _ but we would never own it.
</P>
<P>
   So that's how we came up with the idea of a renovation, which
seemed like a small thing. Doesn't it always? The Pleasantville
house had been altered and enlarged over the years, but the owners
had kept the quaint eyebrow roofs and, of course, the original
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   We were going to take it back to its roots. At least, that's
what our architect, Mike, said. The pictures Mike drew were
gorgeous and easily changed. That new downstairs bathroom needed a
shower. We said, ``Draw us a shower, Mike,'' and he did.
``Shouldn't this section of the house be stone?'' we asked. And so
it was. Stone is heavy, difficult and expensive to move, but very
easy to draw.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was that we would have a big kitchen, and off that a
large room with a hearth. A sort of gathering room in miniature.
The basement would be dry as a whistle. The drawing part was fun
and imaginary; then actual workers began tearing down part of our
house. This was not imaginary, nor was it fun. Besides which, we
had to clean out the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Our basement was full of papers. The papers were full of water.
There were also the treasures we had bought with high hopes, and
then broken. DeWitt Wallace, the founder of Reader's Digest, once
said that the dead carry to the grave only that which they have
given away. Which sentiment I find admirable. I also think now that
if you die, and wake up and find you still have all your stuff,
then you've gone to hell.
</P>
<P>
   The work went slowly at first. Demolition was busy elsewhere.
Demolition was like a panzer unit: 20 men and a big machine.
Someone cut a notch in the roof of our house so that the demolition
workers would know where to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The excavator they brought in weighed 28,000 pounds and had a
claw 4 feet across. The machine squatted in our driveway and ate
the roof off the garage and the back room. My son John, 12, took
movies. My wife thought our son Andrew, 9, would be upset. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why no wrecking ball?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I was the one who was upset. When the last doomed section came
down, I could see two bottles of shampoo _ Flex, and Head and
Shoulders _ sitting on what had once been a shower floor. My shower
floor. I expected to be on the evening news: ``A demolition team
swept through northern Westchester yesterday destroying dozens of
homes, including one in Pleasantville.'' Then they would thrust a
microphone into my face, and I could weep.
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of the house is gone now, replaced by a crater. Mike
tells us that renovation will be completed next spring.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I should feel grand. They tore down O.J. Simpson's
house. They tore down Jimmy Stewart's house. Then again, Jimmy
Stewart didn't pay somebody to tear down his own house while he was
still in it. Not even O.J. Simpson did that.

 FAST NEW PCs COMING FOR THE HIGH-END CROWD  
 (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than half the personal computers sold these days cost less
than $1,000, according to industry researchers, and fewer than 10
percent sell for more than $2,000. With the notable exceptions of
Dell Computer Corp. and Apple Computer, the major computer
companies have been aggressively pushing prices well below $1,000
for entry-level machines.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean, however, that computer makers are ignoring
the high end of the consumer market. Timed to coincide with the
introduction of several new microprocessors from Intel Corp. this
week, most computer makers announced new systems based on the
450-megahertz Pentium II chip, which is about 15 percent faster
than the previous speed leader for Windows machines, the 400-MHz
Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   The 450-MHz systems cost at least $2,000, not including
monitors, but industry sources say there are plenty of consumers
willing to pay a premium for the fastest machines available.
</P>
<P>
   The microprocessor is but one component of performance in
desktop PCs. High-end customers are also buying more system memory,
better graphics cards for showing off games and business
presentations and bigger hard disks for storing applications and
files. On top of that, the new pacesetter machines have faster
modems, extra storage systems, including Zip and DVD drives, and
even flat-panel LCD monitors, though sometimes at extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing members of the fall class is IBM's
new Aptiva SE7, code-named Cobra, scheduled to go on sale in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it sought to define the high end of portable computing
with its ThinkPad line of laptops, IBM is hoping the all-black
Cobra will become the desktop home computer of choice for people
who want both power and panache.
</P>
<P>
   For a suggested list price of $2,399, the Cobra includes the
450-MHz Pentium II engine with 512 kilobytes of level-2 cache (a
performance enhancer), an unusually large, 16.8-gigabyte hard disk,
128 megabytes of high-speed system memory, 4 megabytes video memory
on an ATI Rage Pro Turbo AGP 2X graphics card, a DVD-ROM drive, a
56K modem, and a pair of Infinity speakers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM will offer, as an option, a matching digital ThinkPanel LCD
monitor. The exact price has not been set, IBM officials said, but
added that the total package of Cobra computer and ThinkPanel
display would cost slightly more than $3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Way down at the other end of the pricing scale, MEI-Micro Center
(www.mei-microcenter.com), a computer store chain based in
Columbus, Ohio, has just started selling a computer for $399,
believed to be a new low for personal computers running the
Microsoft Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The Micro Center Power Spec 1810 Integrated Multimedia Computer,
as the cheap PC is called, is built around a 180-MHz Cyrix
processor and comes with 22 megabytes of usable RAM, a 1.6-gigabyte
hard drive, a diskette drive, a 33.6K modem, Windows 98 and a
collection of other Microsoft products including Works, Money and
Entertainment Pack. It does not include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Judged on specifications alone, the Power Spec 1810 would have
been an impressive machine in early 1993, but today it just barely
clings above the abyss of obsolescence. But Micro Center also
offers systems with substantially more vitality for less than
$1,000, including a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers whose desires and budgets meet somewhere in
between the IBM Cobra and the Micro Center Power Spec, Intel also
released this week a pair of new Celeron processors that will find
homes quickly in computers costing $1,000 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The first-generation Celeron chips, introduced earlier this
year, were the runt siblings of the Pentium II litter. They lacked
the caching feature found on the Pentiums, which greatly improves
the microprocessor's performance. Some computer makers refused to
include the Celeron chips in their computers, choosing instead to
use superior chips made by Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has now seen the light, and the new Celerons introduced
this week have been praised by analysts, especially one that
operates at 333 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   The Celeron 333 comes very close to matching the performance of
the Pentium II chip at the same clock speed. The other new Celeron
chip, called the 300A, has the 128 kilobytes of cache that was
missing from the original Celeron 300.

`UPFRONT TONIGHT': HERE NOW THE (WINK, WINK) NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching Geraldo Rivera and NBC News learn to dance together
brings to mind the old line about the luckier pairing of Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers: She gave him sex, he gave her class.
This is not meant as a compliment to Rivera, whose relentless
self-promotion based on little substance makes him more the
journalistic equivalent of Ginger Spice than Ginger Rogers. But the
ratings success of ``Rivera Live,'' the talk show about court cases
that earns CNBC's highest ratings, has led NBC News to make a
devilish bargain.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Rivera from going to the Fox News Channel, NBC gave
him a six-year, $30 million contract that included a half-hour news
show, ``Upfront Tonight,'' which had its premiere on Monday and is
seen weeknights at 7:30 on CNBC. In this partnership, Rivera gives
NBC News ratings; NBC News gives him instant respectability. He is
being thoroughly bolstered by NBC correspondents who appear often
on both of his programs and by his use of taped reports from ``NBC
Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' is a slight program and so far seems the
least significant part of the Rivera contract, which also includes
four news specials a year and a role as legal commentator on
``Today.'' In return, he gave up his syndicated tabloid talk show.
But he has retained his tabloid, show-biz sensibility, in which his
own role appears more important than any report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' looks like a news program, with a sleek,
high-tech set. You can tell it's serious because there is a world
map behind Rivera and his co-anchor, Diane Dimond. It begins with a
few reports from the day's headlines, which on the first two
programs were read awkwardly by Ms. Dimond. A veteran of ``Hard
Copy'' and WCBS-TV in New York, she seemed uncharacteristically
wooden. Perhaps it was because she was saddled with lines to make a
viewer wince, including nightly variations on ``Hurricane Bonnie
still lies over the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' also includes investigative reports; the
first few were inflated attempts at muckraking. Tuesday's report,
about a mentally ill prisoner in Utah who died last year after he
was strapped naked in a restraining chair for 16 hours, began with
Rivera introducing clips from his own most famous reporting. ``More
than 25 years ago, I helped expose the dreadful conditions'' at
Willowbrook, an institution for the mentally retarded, he said,
taking credit for changes in their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers were near the end of the Utah segment (complete with
graphic videotape) before its reporter, Jane Wells, acknowledged
that the prison has since changed its policy about using the
restraining chair. (The report's second installment, scheduled for
Wednesday night, discussed those changes.) It was a sound report,
but characteristically overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's intrusive style would matter less if his reporting were
nearly as substantive or important as he makes it sound. On
``Rivera Live,'' legal analysis is an excuse for relentless pursuit
of the national soap opera of the moment (Simpson, Ramsey,
Lewinsky, whatever). On that program, Rivera is always touting some
secret source of his own, and usually turning up information
everyone else has.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, I've done some reporting,'' he said the other night to
NBC's John Palmer, who was covering President Clinton on Martha's
Vineyard. ``One source says Clinton will leave the Vineyard,''
which plenty of sources were predicting (and which turned out to be
the president's scheduled trip to Worcester, Mass., for a speech
Thursday). In this overheated atmosphere, it is still bizarre to
see serious NBC journalists, like the White House correspondent
David Bloom, toss a report back to the studio with, ``Geraldo?''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's new contract, he said last year, was about ``seeking
that Holy Grail of redeemed reputation.'' In another often quoted
remark, he said he wanted to sit among ``the wise men'' of
television news. There is nothing wrong with trying to change your
image. But if you want to be taken seriously as a journalist, it
helps not to invoke comic images of frankincense and myrrh. It also
helps not to make nasty personal comments about Peter Jennings or
to call Barbara Walters ``a very sexy babe,'' as he did in a recent
Playboy interview. And it helps to admit that you are not the
story.
</P>
<P>
   As a program, ``Upfront Tonight'' may evolve. It is too soon to
tell much about its ratings. (Its second broadcast reached 307,000
households, a slight improvement on the program it replaced,
``Equal Time,'' but nothing near ``Rivera Live,'' which last week,
in an all-time high, reached a million more homes.) Rivera's
approach shows no signs of changing. Whatever you think about their
judgment, Rivera and Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, are
smart men; wise is a different matter.

RENO ORDERS LIMITED REVIEW OF 1968 KING ASSASSINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: ``Raul'' and ``Raoul'' are cq) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department will begin a limited
investigation into the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., amid claims that confessed killer James Earl Ray did not
act alone, Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King, widow of the slain civil rights leader, had
pressed Reno to launch a wide-ranging investigation after an ex-FBI
agent and a former Memphis, Tenn., bar owner alleged that Ray, who
died April 23 at age 70, either did not kill or had help in
assassinating King. Reno decided to conduct a more limited inquiry
into the assassination, after she had an April 8 meeting with
Coretta King.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this review will provide answers to new questions that
have been raised about a tragedy that still haunts our nation,''
Reno said. The Justice Department, in announcing the investigation,
stated, ``The evidence gathered during the inquiry will be followed
wherever it may lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Coretta King hailed the pending Justice Department investigation
as ``a first step towards revealing the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it will examine a claim made by
Donald Wilson, an FBI agent based in Atlanta at the time of the
shooting, that he found an envelope in Ray's car shortly after the
April 4, 1968, assassination. The envelope contained two pieces of
paper with the name ``Raul'' written on them, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he was framed by a man named ``Raoul.'' However, the
existence of this shadowy figure has never been verified, and the
FBI has discounted Wilson's story.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will also examine the claim of Lloyd Jowers,
who told ABC-TV's ``PrimeTime Live'' in 1993 that he hired someone
to kill King but that person was not Ray. Jowers said a
now-deceased Memphis produce dealer arranged the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the slaying, Jowers operated Jim's Grill across
the street from the Lorraine Motel. King was shot and killed by a
sniper while standing on a balcony at the Memphis motel.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last spring, the Memphis district attorney's
office said it found no evidence tying Jowers to the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Ray pleaded guilty in March 1969 to killing King and was
sentenced to 99 years in prison. Ray, who later recanted his
confession, was serving his sentence and seeking a fresh trial when
he died of liver disease and kidney failure at Columbia Nashville
Memorial Hospital in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta King, who believes Ray did not kill her husband, called
Ray's death ``a tragedy ... for the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America will never have the benefit of Mr. Ray's trial, which
would have produced new revelations about the assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr., as well as establish the facts concerning
Mr. Ray's innocence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this inquiry will open a wider investigation of all
pertinent leads,'' she said. ``When this is accomplished, our
family and the American people will at least have the satisfaction
that all relevant evidence has been fully examined.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she will issue a report following the Justice
Department's investigation and decide whether further action is
warranted based on her agency's findings. The attorney general did
not say how long the investigation will take.
</P>
<P>
   If the investigation does uncover a conspiracy to kill King, the
conspirators might escape federal prosecution due to statutory time
limits, the department said. But Tennessee could use the federal
agency's findings to conduct its own state prosecution, because
King was killed in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which harassed and spied on King in the 1960s, will not
be involved in the investigation. The Justice Department said its
Civil Rights Division will oversee the investigation with
assistance from the Criminal Division.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Kowalski, who led the successful federal prosecution of
Los Angeles police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King in
1991, will lead the department's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in 1978
that Ray killed the civil rights leader. The special panel added
that, if Ray was part of a conspiracy, the conspirators were most
likely limited to his family members and militant racists in St.
Louis who had offered a reward for King's assassination.

RESTORING HUMAN FOIBLES TO AN INSPIRATIONAL ICON

   (Publication notes at end)

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every American schoolchild learns the story of Helen Keller,
deaf and blind from the age of 19 months, who grew up to read Greek
and to become a best-selling author and social reformer. Keller
could recognize people by the vibrations of their footsteps and
tell a person's mood by the touch of his hand. She could
distinguish between a Southern and a Northern accent, and sense
when a storm was brewing. She symbolized the American ability to
conquer all odds and seemed a figure of perfect, virginal, saintly
rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   Keller has been the subject of a Broadway play, ``The Miracle
Worker''; a movie adaptation of the play and numerous biographical
studies, including Joseph P. Lash's definitive 1980 work, ``Helen
and Teacher.'' Now, Dorothy Herrmann, an author of books on Anne
Morrow Lindbergh and S.J. Perelman, has given us perhaps the most
intimate biography. ``Helen Keller: A Life'' offers few startling
facts about Keller, but it does give her back her sexuality. And in
treating her with a degree of skepticism, it also imbues her with a
true humanity that is sometimes missing from the other portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The central mystery of Keller's life is how she learned to
conceptualize, to render touch and smell into mental pictures,
which she communicated by spelling out messages on her
interlocutor's hand. (Herrmann points out that relatively few
children become deaf and blind at such an early age.) Herrmann
provides a fascinating insight into how Keller developed a form of
language. According to the standard Gesell developmental tests, by
19 months Keller would have been able to recognize her mother,
follow simple commands like ``Come here,'' and identify body parts
like her mouth and nose. These months when her senses were intact
formed the seedbed from which sprang her breakthrough on April 5,
1887, when she was 6, and when her teacher, Annie Sullivan, spelled
``w-a-t-e-r'' on one of her hands while water coursed down over the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Keller always referred to the moment that Sullivan entered her
life as ``my soul's birthday,'' and their relationship was
passionate, ``a complicated interplay of power and dependence,''
Herrmann writes. People compared them to Romeo and Juliet and
Orpheus and Eurydice. Keller lived through her fingers, and there
were moments when her relationship with ``Teacher'' seemed to have
an almost sexual intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sullivan, Keller became famous. The deaf and the blind
were a curiosity among the Victorians. Before Keller, there was
Laura Bridgman, who was blind and deaf but learned to speak in
monosyllables _ and to thread a needle. Keller was a vehicle for
the study of the Platonic notion of innate ideas, that ideas, and
language, are part of the deep structures of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In the Victorian age, blindness was considered a living death.
There was a terror, before modern embalming, of being buried alive.
In an era when fatal childhood illnesses were common, Keller's
predicament coincided with a national preoccupation with death.
</P>
<P>
   Keller graduated with honors from Radcliffe College in 1904,
when few women went to college. She became a Socialist, a
suffragist and an advocate for the handicapped. Through her
appearances and product endorsements she grew prosperous. America
tolerated handicapped people as long as they were sexless, and
Keller, unmarried, angelic-looking, her face suffused with an inner
light, became an icon.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann interestingly observes that Keller had a ``special
appeal for beautiful, narcissistic women, many of whom were
fascinated that she had never seen her own reflection in a
mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Herrmann portrays her, Keller was also a strikingly
sensual full-bodied beauty with lustrous hair. ``In the odor of
young men there is something elemental, as of fire, storm, and salt
sea,'' Keller wrote. ``It pulsates with buoyancy and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann recounts the story of Keller's brief engagement to
Peter Fagan, and her mother's successful bid to thwart it. While
Lash speculates that Keller probably sublimated her sexuality for
the higher good, Herrmann suggests that she may have slept with
Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   Keller was not without flaws. She could be sentimental and
naive. Sometimes she seemed to care more for ideals like peace and
justice than she did for people. She denounced capitalism, but she
liked to live well; she was beautifully groomed and her homes had
fine furnishings. Right after the death of her companion, Polly
Thomson, Keller, angry that Thomson had left her out of her will,
began wearing Thomson's $8,000 mink coat.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the nagging questions about the authenticity
of Keller's achievements. Was her writing, with its ``disturbingly
elaborate visual descriptions,'' as Herrmann puts it, just an echo
of what she had been taught by Sullivan and of other writers' work?
Herrmann relates the events surrounding ``The Frost King,'' a
children's tale that Keller wrote when she was 11 and that was
published as her own work. Keller was accused of plagiarism, which
she denied, but the charge caused her pain for the rest of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helen Keller: A Life'' has some of the texture and the
dramatic arc of a good novel. In Keller's later years, she became a
``luxurious captive,'' Herrmann writes, her caretakers conspiring
around her, and guarded by the essentially mad Thomson. Despite her
efforts, Keller never learned to speak clearly. ``Her voice was to
me the loneliest sound I have ever heard,'' one person said of her,
``like waves breaking on the coast of some lonely desert island.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of her life, in the late 1960's, she seemed to
withdraw, her sensory awareness dulled. Her eyes were glass _ her
real eyes had been removed years before for esthetic reasons _ and
her teeth were false. Her face was vacant of the imprint of normal
human experience, and she was living each day looking forward only
to being reunited in death with ``Teacher.''

`VEIL': SO DIFFERENT, YET SO MUCH THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The idea is to bring together, via satellite dishes, individuals
from unlike or opposing cultures in civil conversation. If that
sounds like the latest of those people-to-people,
getting-to-know-you efforts that pop up fairly frequently under the
wishful auspices of peace advocates or religious groups or
enlightened foundations, that's no criticism.
</P>
<P>
   A technical accomplishment of ``Vis-a-Vis,'' a series that has
won audiences in Europe, is the use of high-speed digital video
links. In Thursday night's opening program, ``Beyond the Veil,''
they enable high school teachers in Iran and the United States to
chat and share home videos on television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   In this hourlong synthesis of four days of show and tell,
Deborah Whitley in suburban Washington and Sima Daad in Tehran
concentrate on what they have in common _ their teaching (both are
devoted to poetry), their children (both have three), their home
lives (both have supportive husbands) _ and, gingerly, a few issues
that separate them. When it comes to those, Ms. Daad is the more
assertive as she criticizes the United States for its past
intrusions into Iranian life and what she sees as the current
threat of a cultural invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed delicately by Ms. Whitley on the condition of women in
Iran, Ms. Daad says women need protection from the eyes of men.
(She is seen telling her husband that the American is
``unconsciously prejudiced'' on this subject.) Occasionally her
remarks seem borrowed from the slogans on Tehran signboards.
Declaring that she is prepared to send her young son into battle,
she says, ``Physical life is precious only when you can keep your
self-esteem.'' Her classroom explication of the message of Orwell's
``Nineteen Eighty-Four'' slips by fuzzily. She justifies the death
sentence passed on Salman Rushdie on the grounds that he has
committed ``intellectual crimes'' as well as violated her nation's
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing her words to be as nonconfrontational as possible, Ms.
Whitley comes out for free speech, but this encounter is not meant
as a debate, and both women are evidently more comfortable smiling
over domestic scenes. ``If you don't mind,'' Ms. Saad urges after
the free-speech remarks, ``can we go to family life?''
</P>
<P>
   The program as edited accentuates the positive, the quotidian
details of life, although viewers may wonder whether the apparently
upscale Saads are as typical of Tehran as the suburban style of the
Whitleys is of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Next week ``Vis-a-Vis'' introduces two black police sergeants,
David Van from Philadelphia and Hendriek Mohale from Soweto, South
Africa. Both have experienced racism, but as the program confirms,
nothing Van has suffered can compare to what blacks, including
black policemen, had to endure under apartheid. What brings them
together in the amiably inquiring exchanges of ``Blue and Black''
is a shared professionalism, a realistic view of crime and a
commitment to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by these two examples, ``Vis-a-Vis'' is at its most
illuminating when it does not strain for either confrontation or
reconciliation but explores the professional and private concerns
that make for surprising connections.

   With all the computers under the hood, how can you tell what's
going on with your car? One solution is the latest in-dash
computer, Clarion's Auto PC, which can tell the driver exactly what
is wrong with the car and recommend action. Instead of pondering
the generic ``check engine'' light on the dash, you can view a
display on the engine that indicates the specific problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto PC, a $1,300 combination computer, radio and CD player,
now available on the Infiniti I30 Executive Luxury Special Edition,
recognizes more than 200 voice commands _ it can check for e-mail,
dial a cellular phone, find a restaurant or hotel _ allowing the
driver to operate it while keeping hands on the wheel and eyes on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   A navigation system is standard, as is an address book, a
mileage log and a hands-free voice memo feature. The Auto PC's
infrared data port permits the exchange of data to and from a
hand-held PC.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of concept cars incorporate new applications for
on-board computers. Because new generations of computers are
introduced far more often than new generations of cars, a docking
port on the Dodge Intrepid ESX2 concept car's dash lets you use the
latest hand-held PC to link with the car's computers. You can also
adda cell phone, a modem for Internet access and a Global
Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Buckley, a Chrysler electronics specialist,
the module that makes this possible could be installed at
dealerships within two years for less than $100. The prototype uses
a Hewlett-Packard 620LX hand-held computer that connects to the
Internet with a 19.2-kbps wireless modem, giving drivers access to
weather forecasts and traffic reports. ``New York City has a pretty
good real-time traffic Web site,'' Buckley noted. ``It even tells
you where the radar traps are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Network Vehicle from Delphi Automotive Systems, a subsidiary
of General Motors, incorporates computer hardware and software
developed by IBM, Sun Microsystems and Netscape Corp. Using
existing technology, the concept vehicle receives broadcasts from
Hughes DirecTV and DirecPC satellites via a flat antenna imbedded
in its roof.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the car, which is not planned for production,
include wireless communications, GPS navigation, displays
positioned for eyes-on-the-road control of the system, voice
recognition and access to the Web, including the ability to send
and receive e-mail.

FILL IT UP, WITH RAM: CARS GET MORE CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By RICHARD STEPLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a long day spent in front of your computer screen, you
need a change of scenery. You get behind the wheel of your car,
start the ignition and step on the gas pedal. Once on the open
road, you feel the rush of freedom: you believe you have finally
left the world of binary code far behind.
</P>
<P>
   You are wrong. Chances are, if your car was built in the last 20
years, you have traded one computer for many. Take, for example,
the simple task of stepping on the accelerator. No connection of
modern human beings to machinery is more visceral and familiar. It
is the simplest and most satisfying of nondigital interfaces: the
heavier the foot, the faster the car goes.
</P>
<P>
   But in Volvo's new S80, the company's flagship sedan to be
released this fall, there is no physical link between the
accelerator pedal and the six-cylinder engine. When you depress the
accelerator, you are actually sending a digital signal to the
engine management computer to open the throttle on the engine. The
benefits include smoother operation and lower fuel consumption and
emissions. The pedal, however, might as well be a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerator is only the beginning. Computers provide the
smarts for many of the S80s other components, including its
electronic transmission, antilock braking, traction control,
climate control, navigation and communication systems. And in more
or less the same way that a PC can be upgraded from 16 megabytes to
32 megabytes of RAM, the S80's turbocharger can be upgraded, adding
50 more horsepower, simply by changing the software in the engine
management computer.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that the new S80 has ``more computers than a
jet fighter.'' While that may be a bit of hyperbole, the car very
likely represents the state of the art in the marriage of the
computer and the automobile. It may also represent the beginning of
a very different relationship between drivers and their beloved
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The first microprocessor appeared in an automobile three decades
ago, in the 1968 Volkswagen 1600. It controlled the air-fuel
mixture in an electronic fuel injection system, improving fuel
efficiency and engine performance and, more important, paving the
way for cleaner tailpipe emissions as more powerful and
sophisticated engine management computers were developed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, automotive computers have multiplied like rabbits,
and while cleaning up exhaust emissions may remain the computer's
single greatest contribution to automotive technology, that is far
from the only important function computers perform in today's cars.
</P>
<P>
   Engine management computers, networked with microprocessors,
control the transmission, braking, traction and stability control
systems, giving drivers unparalleled control, particularly on icy
or rain-slicked roads. Computers control front and side air bags
and tighten the seat belts in the event of a collision. They also
command the latest air bag innovation, a curtain that inflates in
25 milliseconds from above the side windows. Appearing on 1999
Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans this month and on the Volvo S80, the
curtain offers protection for both front- and rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessor-controlled antitheft systems _ combined with a
Global Positioning System (GPS) and a cellular phone _ can track a
stolen car and even let the police eavesdrop on conversations
inside the vehicle. Instrumentation, driver information displays _
miles to go until empty _ climate control and entertainment systems
get their brains from computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the handheld portable computer has found a new home inside
the car, via an infrared docking port in a prototype system. In
some cars, a computer can even tell you how to fix a flat tire.
Unfortunately, a computer will never be able to do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the progress of the computerized car hasn't been a
completely bump-free joy ride: consider the annoying and
short-lived fad for cars that ``talked'' in the early 1980s,
insistently reminding passengers to fasten seat belts or that a
door was ``ajar.'' It was as though the car had become its own
back-seat driver.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the failure of these frivolities, car makers are
taking a more pragmatic approach to the incorporation of computers
in their latest offerings. There are certainly more computers in
cars than ever, networked in ever more sophisticated ways, but
their functions are typically transparent to the car's driver and
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the spin-out. In the days before on-board
computers, drivers were taught to turn the steering wheel in the
direction the car was skidding to maintain control. That's no
longer necessary if the car is equipped with a stability control
system, like those found in models sold by BMW, Cadillac,
Mercedes-Benz and Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   Stability control systems receive data from several sensors,
which is typically updated every 40 milliseconds. For example, a
steering wheel position sensor, as the name implies, tells the
system where the driver intends the car to go. Data on what the car
is actually doing is provided by sensors for wheel speed, sideways
acceleration and the yaw rate _ the rotation of the vehicle around
a vertical axis. The computer compares the car's dynamic
performance as measured by this data with a model stored in memory.
Then it compares that with the driver's intentions. If the computer
detects an incipient out-of-control situation _ the car is
understeering or oversteering _ it orders the engine computer to
reduce power or to apply the brakes on one or two wheels to keep
the car going in the direction the driver intends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a dramatic feeling,'' said Frank Markus, technical
director at Car &AMP; Driver. ``As you turn the wheel, you'll feel some
momentary slipping, but there's not a lot of herky-jerky motion.
You sense the car slowing down and turning the direction you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing for the driver to do other than to
trust that the system will work. ``It's like an invisible hand of
God has come down to rescue you,'' said Don Sherman, a contributing
editor at Popular Science magazine. ``You feel the car correct
itself in ways that you cannot normally do _ such as applying the
brake on one wheel.'' Without the computerized stability control
system, he continued, ``you can lift off the gas, apply the brakes,
or turn the wheel, but these actions frequently cannot sufficiently
correct an understeer or oversteer condition.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the car with the most computer chips in the land today?
According to Fred Heiler, a spokesman for Mercedes-Benz, it's the
car maker's flagship S-Class sedan, which, depending on options,
contains between 35 and 40 computers. The 1998 Lincoln Continental
has 26 microprocessors, which control such features as antilock
brakes and traction control, engine and transmission management,
ride control, a GPS, as well as comfort and convenience features
like climate control, interior and exterior lighting, stereo and CD
changer, and remote keyless entry. An additional 14 microchips help
manage the data to make all this possible. The total brainpower in
these 40 chips allows the Continental to process more than 40
million instructions each second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auto industry has introduced so many new electrical
features that the electrical systems themselves are becoming a
problem,'' said Sven Eckerstein, deputy chief executive of Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wiring has become heavy, bulky and very complex. The
number of connections has increased dramatically.'' Today's Volvos
have 4,000 feet of wiring. By comparison, the 1955 model, the first
sold by Volvo in the United States, had 300 feet of wiring.
``Troubleshooting has become almost a nightmare,'' Eckerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One way to reduce all this complexity is with an on-board
computer network. In 1992, Mercedes-Benz introduced the first
computer area network in its S-Class models.
</P>
<P>
   ``In simple terms,'' explained Dave Acton, a director of
electrical engineering at General Motors, ``it means sending a
number of digitally coded messages down the same wire, something
like the old telephone party lines. One of the benefits is to
permit every electronic module in need of a piece of data _ road
speed, for example _ to obtain that information without having to
send it to each module on a separate wire.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the computer world, software development has become
increasingly important in automotive applications. The idea is
simple and compelling: Why redesign the hardware when a software
upgrade will do just as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``The top guns are now in software development,'' said Heiler at
Mercedes-Benz. At Volvo, the software now gets a part number like
any other component in the car, according to Asko Lyytikainen, an
engineer at the company. ``Conceivably you could recall just the
software, or upgrade it to give the customer more benefits,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as though car makers are building more and more
complexity and features into their products _ more and more things
to malfunction, wear out and need service _ don't worry. Too much.
Networked computers also provide powerful diagnostic capabilities.
So when the ``check engine'' message lights up on your car's
dashboard, it is more than likely that when a mechanic plugs a
diagnostic tester into the car's electronics system, he'll be able
to determine what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diagnostic tools are very powerful,'' Heiler said. ``There's
an amazing amount of information there, and some of it is even
predictive.'' The ability to predict that, say, a catalytic
converter will fail within a certain number of miles is important
to insure that vehicle emissions stay within legal limits.
</P>
<P>
   And in one troubleshooting area the computer is proving to be
invaluable: the intermittent malfunction that occurs only late at
night and far from home and never ever recurs when the car is in
the repair shop. Computers, after all, have memories, and a
mechanic can enter command codes that will retrieve information on
past failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trained technician can tell you the specific problem your
car had last Friday at 4:10 p.m.,'' Heiler said.

A QUARTET ALL OVER THE MAP? NOT HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., August 30)  
 (JT)  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most music lovers, the historical map of the string quartet
is drawn on well-traveled roads. We tend to trace and retrace the
great highways named Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Bartok and
ignore the byways. Many are the roads not taken, especially on the
landscape of our own time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kronos Quartet would have us draw the world differently,
in greater detail and from a more modern perspective. Through 25
years of concerts and recordings, the Kronos _ David Harrington and
John Sherba, violinists; Hank Dutt, violist, and Joan Jeanrenaud,
cellist _ has explored the string quartet down remote pathways of
world music and along more established (if not exactly
establishment) routes paved by the likes of John Adams, Henryk
Gorecki and Philip Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in classic Kronos fashion, comes a set of the string
quartets of Alfred Schnittke (Nonesuch 79500-2; two CD's), which
both widens a path once traveled and pencils in side roads where
perhaps none had been noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The penchant for mixing the conventional and obvious with the
odd and obscure has been a major ingredient in the charm, the
distinction and the significance of the Kronos Quartet. The Kronos
recording of Schnittke's Quartet No. 3, for example, first appeared
on a 1988 CD, ``Winter Was Hard,'' a characteristic potpourri of 10
works by 10 composers. Schnittke's sorrowful, acerbic music seemed
almost casually dropped into that laundry list, between Astor
Piazzolla's biting ``Four, for Tango'' and Samuel Barber's famously
ruminative Adagio, with other pieces ranging from the title cut by
Aulis Sallinen to the Six Bagatelles (Op. 9) of Anton Webern.
</P>
<P>
   That's Kronos, and such curiously patched-together programs
inevitably invite questions, criticism, even dismissal. Far from
drawing a map, one might conclude, these musicians are all over the
place. But that is the conservative view, and the Kronos has never
approached its art, its mission, on conventional terms. This is a
catholic ensemble, four musical sponges who simply cannot absorb
enough. That was the impression Harrington gave in conversation
some 15 years ago, when Kronos was just becoming the hot new band,
and the group's zeal has never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm is one thing, accomplishment another. The Kronos'
new-wave trappings have caused some critics to look askance at the
whole enterprise. Beyond the hodgepodge CD's with their pulp-novel
titles (``Short Stories,'' ``Night Prayers,'' ``White Man
Sleeps''), the quartet's use of amplified instruments, its flair
for dramatic lighting and its motorcycle-hip attire have created a
psychological smoke screen between the ensemble and some listeners.
Are these guys serious? Can they really play? Or are they just
market-savvy opportunists?
</P>
<P>
   Only the second question can be answered unequivocally. As the
new Schnittke survey attests, the Kronos can play like demons. But
that fact should have been evident from the touchstones of Bartok,
Gubaidulina, Webern and (again) Schnittke in those eclectic
releases of years past. The matters of seriousness and marketing
smarts are more elusive. What qualifies as ``serious,'' anyway?
Comedians can be serious about their work. Commitment is serious,
and the Kronos is manifestly devoted to proselytizing for
contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet and Nonesuch seem to share a knack for making new
music attractive. That said, the Schnittke package suffers from a
recurring flaw in the Kronos' releases on Nonesuch: absent or
inadequate program notes. Here, what figures to be insight, from
the pen of Solomon Volkov, proves instead to be casual to the point
of empty-headedness. Volkov's rambling lines _ ``essay'' would
suggest too much organization and content _ endeavor above all to
play out a little game announced in the title: ``The ABC's of
Schnittke.''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't wish to quibble, much less harangue, but when the
name of the author of ``Testimony,'' Volkov's stirring as-told-to
``memoirs'' of Shostakovich, is attached to a commentary on the
quartets of the composer who was widely regarded as the most
important in contemporary Russia until his death, this month, one
expects more than a grammar-school diversion. Each succeeding
paragraph begins, more or less, with the next letter of the
alphabet, set as an initial: ``Among his friends in Moscow ... ''
``Believe me when I say ... '' ``Certainly it is now difficult ...
''
</P>
<P>
   Not to spoil the suspense, but things get worse: ``To Xerox or
copy down ... '' ``And Yet, is there a contradiction ... '' ``The
Zany moments I have spent ... '' One reach exceeds all others:
``The Vertiginous Fourth Quartet.''
</P>
<P>
   Better, perhaps, ``These Vacuous liner notes.'' And that's the
problem. Volkov provides almost no insight, blowing off one quartet
after another with inane observations.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years passed between the composition of the First
Quartet, a rather self-consciously defiant foray into Serialism by
a 32-year-old Soviet composer in 1966, and the Second, a work of
riveting urgency by a mature artist now writing from strong
internal need. Volkov's commentary: ``A natural Tie between the two
quartets exists, even though the Second Quartet is stylistically
very different from the First.'' That's it, except that he
attributes to Harrington the improbable claim that the Second
Quartet is somehow an inevitable sequel to the First, which was
written stylistic light-years before.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Schnittke laid out his First Quartet in three movements,
the Second follows the Classical pattern of four. But in its
rhetoric, by turns fearsome and sad, the Second is stunningly
personal. The second movement, Agitato, blows with the same
winter's fury that buffeted and boggled the aged King Lear. The
Kronos delivers it with shuddering ferocity, only to drain away
that energy and, with it, seemingly all human hope in a funeral
march marked Mesto (Sadly).
</P>
<P>
   The Third Quartet, written just three years later, in 1983, and
again cast in three movements, places an Agitato chapter at the
center, but this time the mood is edged with bitter ambiguity, in a
folk dance that careens from joy into the shadows of despair.
Comparison with the many double-edged quartet movements in
Shostakovich's works is inescapable, and the Kronos' playing is
galvanic. Then comes the crushing footfall of the finale, marked
Pesante (Heavily). The composer of these chilling pages has long
since ceased thumbing his nose at officialdom; this is the halting
cry of a burdened heart. At the close, the fear and suffocation are
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Has Volkov actually heard the piece? ``The Third Quartet,'' he
writes, ``ultimately conveys a peaceful, almost contented mood, so
rarely present in Schnittke's music.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Vertiginous Fourth, who can tell what Volkov (or his
translator) means by that summation of this five-movement work,
which, at 35 minutes, is half again as long as any of Schnittke's
other quartets. ``Despite our expectations, it brings with it
neither peace nor harmony,'' Volkov writes. ``Instead, all of the
accumulated contradictions, sorrows and problems are once again
tied into an intellectual knot.'' There's a safe statement.

 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The fighter had just sent Sandman cowering through the fog when
he heard the sound of his shoulder exploding. Sweeping his phaser
around the pylons, he fired wildly into the darkness. Surely his
nemesis could not have come back already; the enemy was probably at
his recharger by now, loading up again on shots.
 &HT;    Sucker! The thought flashed through his mind as he was hit
again, and his shoulder sensor pulsed with blood-colored light.
Looking down _ way down _ behind a green neon-tipped pylon, he saw
Sandman's teammate, Caster Troy. Alas, this was his lethal
assailant _ four feet tall, 9 years old, barely able to wrap her
hands around her phaser.
 &HT;    So it goes in laser tag, perhaps the only sport besides jacks
that allows a fourth grader to whip a 29-year-old weighing in at
200 pounds. And one of the things that levels the playing field is
the technology, a sophisticated system of data exchange that works,
quite literally, at the speed of light.
 &HT;    Inspired by ``Star Wars,'' a Texas inventor named George Carter
is said to have created the first laser tag game in the early
1980s. Carter built a string of Photon Laser Centers in Dallas.
There are now more than 500 laser tag arenas, from Tampa, Fla., to
Sydney, Australia, up from only eight only five years ago.
 &HT;    Though the technology has improved, the essential concept
remains the same. Like a science fiction version of
capture-the-flag, laser tag is played in arenas ranging in size
from 2,000 square feet to 12,000 square feet. Players, either
individuals or teams, don vests stitched with sensors; their
weapons are so-called phasers that shoot infrared rays the sensors
pick up. The phasers also fire red lasers, which are just for show.
There's no danger _ the lasers used for recreation must be approved
by the Food and Drug Administration.
 &HT;    The atmosphere at Lazer Park in New York City at 163 W. 46th
St., just off Times Square, is right out of an ``X-Files'' pursuit.
The arena features a maze of towering black plastic pylons;
machines pump water-based fog; fluorescent black-velvet posters of
lunar landscapes glow on the walls. A high-decibel soundtrack with
bands like the Prodigy keeps the adrenaline flowing.
 &HT;    While the players are chasing and shooting their phasers at one
another, the action is indeed fast-paced _ although, for safety
reasons, running is not allowed. Referees roam the labyrinths to
catch runners and to make sure people are the proper distance away
from each other, and penalize violators by suspending them from
play. After repeated violations, some referees will hold a player's
vest in the air and encourage others to riddle it with shots.
 &HT;    To be an accomplished laser-tagger requires lightning-fast
reflexes, but not necessarily impeccable aim. The radius of the
infrared beam allows someone to score a hit by firing within
several inches of a sensor. For die-hards, there's even the
opportunity to collect statistics throughout a season. At the end
of each game, players leave with a fully detailed printout of their
performances.
 &HT;    Eric Guthrie, executive director of the International Laser Tag
Association in Indianapolis, said companies like Q-Zar, Ultrazone
and LaserTron, which operate arenas around the country, help the
industry generate about $15 million in sales a year. Many in the
business would like to make laser tag a legitimate sport. Leagues
compete weekly. Nearly half the players are teen-aged males (no
surprise there). But increasingly adults are joining the fray.
Guthrie said more and more players are coming from corporations
like Chase Manhattan and Salomon Smith Barney, which use the events
as team-building exercises.
 &HT;    At Lazer Park in Manhattan, the owner, Marc Epstein, credited
the increasingly lightweight and simple game gear with the boom in
business. ``We try to provide something high-tech that will keep
people coming back,'' he said. ``If you have the right mix, you
forget about your hard day at work and feel like you've been in
another world. We put you in an alternate reality.''
 &HT;    To get there, players at most arenas pay about $5 for a
five-minute game. Home versions are also popular, but jumping over
couches in one's living room just doesn't have the same oomph as
dodging shots in an arena.
 &HT;    At Lazer Park, a 31-year-old player who would give only his
nickname, Slippery Weasel, said he preferred the excitement of
laser tag over PC shoot 'em up games like Doom and Quake. After a
particularly rigorous match, Slippery Weasel stood outside the
arena dripping with sweat. ``Instead of watching a video game,'' he
said, ``you're in it.''

 &HT;    ARMED, BUT NOT DANGEROUS: LASER TAG GEAR
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vest: Made of polyethylene foam with a Leatherette finish, the
eight-pound vest contains four sensors (one on each shoulder, the
chest and the back) that register hits in all directions from the
phasers' infrared rays. When hit, the sensors vibrate and flash;
shoulder speakers emit the sounds of explosions and ``Great shot!''
Powered by a central processing unit, the vest has a digital
readout on the front displaying how many shots and lives the player
has remaining, plus the score and the vest's identification number
throughout the game. A radio transmits and receives game data to
and from the transceiver. A battery supplies energy for up to 12
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Phaser: This plastic, soft foam-insulated phaser is connected by
a cord to the vest. When fired, each phaser simultaneously produces
two beams: laser and infrared. The laser beam is harmless, similar
to the beams used in laser pointers. It's the invisible infrared
ray that transmits all the necessary data to sensors on the vests
and bases. A digital readout on the back of the phaser displays a
player's remaining shots and lives.
</P>
<P>
   Game computer: A Pentium-powered personal computer runs laser
tag with customized software. The PC exchanges information with the
transceiver.
</P>
<P>
   Transceiver: The eyes and ears of a laser-tag game, this
one-square-foot black box hangs in the middle of the arena and is
hard-wired to the game computer. The transceiver uses a
900-megahertz restricted band radio, similar to what a cordless
phone would use, that transmits and receives information. It
converts the computer's digital data into radio waves, then
transmits to the vest packs. Data coming from the vests is picked
up by the transceiver, converted back to digital information, then
sent back to the game computer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Base station: Each team has a base station at its end of the
arena, fitted with sensors similar to those on the vest; a player
can earn points by hitting the opposing team's base with a phaser
blast. At each station, a recharger that transmits radio waves
automatically updates players' vest packs with shots and lives each
time someone passes by it.
</P>
<P>
   When the game starts: After obtaining game-play data from the
game computer, the transceiver signals the vest packs to update to
the appropriate number of shots and lives. Once the vest packs are
charged up, the game begins, with players shooting at the opposing
team and its bases. Every second, the transceiver polls the vests
for new information by sending a radio signal to and from each vest
and each base. Along the way, the information is translated into
digital information for the game computer.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring: Each player's infrared ray carries an identifying piece
of data. Say Player 8 on the Red team shoots Player 7 on the Green
team. Player 8's infrared ray hits player 7's sensor, causing it to
flash, vibrate and produce sound effects. When the transceiver
polls the players' vests, it will be alerted that Red Player 8 has
hit Green Player 7. It will then increase and lower their scores
accordingly, and tell Red Player 8's shoulder speakers to say
``Great shot!''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting Your Opponent's Base: The scoring process is the same as
when a player shoots another player, except that the bases are
linked directly to the game computer; the main transceiver is not
used.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard: At the end of the game, the computer kicks out a
scorecard for each player with game statistics: who you tagged,
where you tagged them (shoulders, front or back), where you were
tagged and your overall ranking.

BOND PRICES RISE AMID CONCERNS OVER RUSSIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities edged up Wednesday,
amid fresh concerns about Russia's economic crisis and the raised
anxiety level of world equity markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market appeared a bit wobbly today, even as it partially
ignored the release of July durable goods orders due to the
problems in both Russia and Latin America,'' said Anthony Chan,
managing director and chief economist for Banc One Investment
Advisers in Columbus, Ohio. Durable goods unexpectedly rose 2.4
percent last month, their biggest monthly gain in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably safe to say that credit markets have already
priced in much of the bad news coming out of Asia, but in the
scheme of things,'' he said, ``Russia and Latin America are the new
kids on the block, which have not been fully discounted by credit
markets.'' Recalling the unfolding of the Asian crisis, he added,
``We may be entering another stage in which credit-market investors
will wake up every morning checking to see what is happening in
Russia and for the prospects in Latin America for that day before
even wondering about which U.S. economic statistics are scheduled
for release.''
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 4/32, to
a price of 101 7/32, pushing down its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, to 5.42 percent, from 5.43 percent on Tuesday.
Bond yields are at their lowest levels in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the greatest fear among bond investors was whether
they could justify paying more for bonds _ and pushing yields below
5.50 percent _ without an intelligible indication from the Federal
Reserve that the central bank was close to easing short-term
interest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Fed was in the bond market to satisfy its
seasonal needs. In the process, known as a coupon pass, the Fed
bought $1.521 billion in securities. The maneuver added to the
banking system and provided some support to the longer maturities.
</P>
<P>
   The report on July durable goods orders, which was released
early in the session, surprised investors because the aircraft and
electrical order components were so strong that they more than
offset the weakness in autos caused by the General Motors Corp.
strike. However, economists said that the seasonal adjustment
factor for July is especially aggressive to account for the
shortfalls that occur while automakers retool for the next season's
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The market also had to deal with supply Wednesday, as the
Treasury sold $15 billion of new two-year notes at an auction,
which went a little better than expected. The notes were sold at a
yield of 5.125 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it was a busy day in the municipal market, with $1.6
billion in one-year notes from Texas and nearly $1 billion in new
bonds, including a $542.7 million refunding deal from Utah's
Intermountain Power Agency, with a maximum preliminary yield of
5.25 percent for a bond due in 2019.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every swan has its song. The SoHo area is losing out
to Chelsea as the center of the downtown gallery scene and filling
ever more rapidly with hotels, cosmetic boutiques, home-furnishing
stores and designer-shopping opportunities. Its farewell melody to
the art world may be Rachel Whiteread's self-effacing site-specific
sculpture, ``Water Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   The work, a life-size cast in greenish translucent resin of the
interior of a New York wood-slatted water tower, occupies that
ubiquitous structure's natural habitat, a life-size New York roof.
This one is six stories above the intersection of Grand and West
Broadway, the epicenter of the area's thriving bistro scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful piece, silent, ghostly, responsive to changing
light, and so fused with its site that it becomes a fitting
memorial to the neighborhood itself. Elevated on its own platform,
it is flanked by several nearly identical versions of the real
thing, to which it relates as a translucent, freshly shed snakeskin
relates to a snake.
</P>
<P>
   The work, which is sponsored by the Public Art Fund, also
suggests a crown so weightless that it might drift skyward at any
moment. (In fact, it is to stay put until next June.) From certain
distances, it hovers near invisibility: You can see blue sky
through it. At night it fades to pale gray, matching the eternal
twilight of New York's glowing, nocturnal sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture is one of the latest, and best, efforts from an
English artist who frequently makes casts of the interior volumes
of things. Made from voids, like all cast sculptures, these pieces
flatfootedly memorialize a familiar but absent object. Previous
Whitereads have used mattresses, bathtubs, the spaces beneath
tables and chairs. An early work, a cast of an entire room, was
appropriately titled ``Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who have witnessed SoHo's transformation over the last
two or three decades, ``Water Tower'' may memorialize more than
just the increasingly antiquated object that served as its mold. It
symbolizes SoHo's role as an art neighborhood, or village, a place
that in its heyday introduced so much new art _ especially
installation and site-specific art _ and is now changing beyond
recognition and all expectation.
</P>
<P>
   The piece sharpens the eye to see all kinds of things about SoHo
past and present, most immediately the ancient, enormous Coca-Cola
sign painted on the side of the building it is installed on. As it
fades, the names of other painted-over signs are surfacing,
creating a touchingly decrepit collage of word fragments and
letters that begs to be photographed by Robert Rauschenberg, Aaron
Siskind or Walker Evans.
</P>
<P>
   SoHo was pioneered mostly by artists from the
counterculture-baby-boom generation that reached voting age in the
1960s. They were more numerous than preceding generations of
artists and the first to be almost entirely educated at art
schools. Maybe that's one reason the place came to feel like an art
campus, where many of the faces on the street were familiar and the
mood was a little removed, almost insular.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the beauty and unity of SoHo's cast-iron
architecture, which has helped make it the most stylish mall in
America, was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s and early '70s these artists started flocking
to the area, once dominated by light manufacturing, in search of
studios to live and work in. SoHo had a lot of empty warehouse
space that rented cheaply and seemed perfect for artists of all
varieties, especially those working in the relatively new media of
installation and site-specific art.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs of their arrival were 112 Greene Street, an
intermittently artist-run space that gave early exhibitions to
artists as disparate as Vito Acconci, Susan Rothenberg and Harriet
Korman, and Food, a collaborative health-food restaurant at the
corner of Prince and Wooster (now a trendy boutique), where artists
and dancers took turns cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Art galleries were not far behind, the first being Paula Cooper
and O.K. Harris, who ran shoestring operations compared with the
sleek professionalism that followed. The official opening of the
SoHo art scene and land rush occurred in September 1971, when four
prominent uptown dealers (Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend, John
Weber and Andre Emmerich) opened galleries in a big loft building
at 420 West Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings of the Future
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately there were objections, like the rhyming,
slightly profane signs that demanded, in part, ``Bring Back the
Trucks.'' But the artists and galleries had started something that
soon had a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a sense of awe and there-goes-the-neighborhood
foreboding in 1977, when Giorgio DeLuca's tiny Cheese Shop (now a
fancy takeout place called Olive) crossed Prince Street, became
Dean &AMP; DeLuca and began making retail history.
</P>
<P>
   The next year brought ``An Unmarried Woman,'' Paul Mazursky's
film about a divorced woman (Jill Clayburgh) pursuing a career in
painting that included a scene shot in the Spring Street Bar. These
were mere glimmers of the trendiness _ and rising real-estate
values _ to come.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of galleries in SoHo, but they have
ceased to define the neighborhood's character, which is a strange
cross between Milan's Via della Spiga _ a place where every
high-end fashion designer feels the need to have a presence _ and
Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the galleries are now marginalized, on the brink
of assuming an underground position, as they did in the East
Village, which may have its advantages. Walking through SoHo to
visit these galleries, I sometimes feel like an alumna at a college
reunion, surprised by the way the place has changed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I first lived in the area as a college student 30 years ago,
when it was still known as the Cast Iron District. At night it was
eerily quiet and empty, which seems unimaginable given its
vociferous night life these days. It was also quite dark; the few
lighted windows signaled where artists lived.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the nocturnal experience was the smell of freshly
baked bread and doughnuts emanating from the Bakery Building at 130
Prince St., a 1930s industrial building that shortly progressed
from being a prospective private museum to a cluster of swank
galleries to its current incarnation as design and advertising
offices, its remaining galleries having moved en masse to Chelsea
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Other addresses are similarly layered. I remember when the
Mercer Hotel was the Reese Palley Gallery, when Boom was WPA, and
even before that, when it was Kast's, a narrow coffee shop with
bare wood booths. There, an innocent from the middle of the Middle
West, I had one of the first toasted bagels of my life.
</P>
<P>
   But you know you're not in Kansas anymore when your first
inkling that the Mercer Hotel is finally open for business is a big
glossy spread in Vogue; when news of the opening of Sephora, a huge
makeup emporium on Broadway, is brought to you by W.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the installation pieces are likely to be encountered in
the windows of fancy stores _ displays whose creators have learned
a few tricks from installation art.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of Prince and Wooster streets is Pleats Please, a
new store selling intricately pleated garments designed by Issey
Miyake. Its windows are coated with a pale green film that changes
in density as you walk past, creating the illusion from some angles
that the store is filled entirely with glowing Kryptonite, as well
as an experience of hazy light not unlike an installation by Robert
Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Phantoms of the Old SoHo
</P>
<P>
   The paler green Whiteread is invisible to anyone who doesn't
know to look for it, just as SoHo's history is invisible, at least
until it is thoroughly recorded, to anyone who didn't experience
it. Anyone who did has a personal bank of memories, an assortment
of odd collisions between past art and present commerce that can be
activated by a walk along the area's glamorous streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Blum Helman Gallery on Greene Street, where I first saw
Charles LeDray's miniaturized garments on the floor, is now the
Helmut Lang store. Tony Shafrazi's old gallery, once the site of
Keith Haring's raucous shows, houses the designs of Marc Jacobs.
Annina Nosei's old gallery, where Jean-Michel Basquiat made his
debut, is now occupied by Miu Miu.
</P>
<P>
   And rumors of the demise of 420 West Broadway, which have
flitted through the art world for more than a year, are gaining
substance. In the September issue of Artforum, Sonnabend has taken
out an ad announcing that it will relocate to Chelsea in early
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to imagine the building as a series of emporiums
Armani, Klein or Karan. And as if to keep the circle unbroken,
Comme des Garcons, the designer that led the fashion incursion into
SoHo in 1983, will close its Wooster Street store next week, and
reopen on 22nd Street in Chelsea in December.
</P>
<P>
   But some things still haven't changed. Walking around at night,
you can still look up and see lofts that must belong to SoHo's
longtime artist-residents, safely ``grandfathered.'' They tend to
be the ones that look seriously unrenovated, complete with dirty
walls, old fluorescent light fixtures and plenty of exposed
electrical conduit.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these windows, I recently saw a large old sign
prominently and, I think, deliberately, displayed, a coded reminder
of the neighborhood's previous incarnations. It read ``E. &AMP; H. Kast
Restaurant, est. 1891.''

   Biochemists at Cambridge University are applying computer
programs used in genetic research to reconstruct the text of the
14th-century manuscript of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales.'' Because
the original was lost and later versions vary widely, scholars have
long argued about which are most accurate. The journal Nature
reported Wednesday that the 58 surviving 15th-century manuscripts
of the Wife of Bath's prologue had been fed into a computer, which
identified several versions previously ignored by scholars as being
close to the original. ``In time,'' the report says, ``this may
lead editors to produce a radically different text of `The
Canterbury Tales.'''

EXPERTS QUESTION MILITARY STRIKES IN TARGETING BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States needs to dramatically increase
the reward for bombing suspect Osama bin Laden.MDNM/ and seek
greater cooperation with countries that harbor him to weaken the
millionaire's ability to carry out attacks, an Israeli terrorism
.MDSU/.MDNM/.MDNM/expert said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Ehud Sprinzak, a Hebrew University political science
professor and a senior fellow at the United States Institute of
Peace, said increasing the reward for information on bin Laden
might be the key to finding him. The United States is offering $2
million for information leading to the capture of bin Laden, but
Sprinzak said it should be $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Institute
of Peace, a federal agency created by Congress to promote conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, a political science professor at the University of
Ulster and another Institute of Peace fellow, said the United
States needs to build a global coalition to avoid being isolated in
its retaliatory attacks against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi
outcast, of using his personal fortune to finance terrorist
activities _ including the recent bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Keyna and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   .MDUL/.MDBO/.MDUL/.MDRV/.MDBU/.MDBR/.MDBU/.MDRV/.MDUL/.MDBR/.MDNM/Wi
th a high price on bin Laden's head, he would ``very quickly feel
the heat'' from organizations in the Middle East that would be
attracted to a large reward, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long suspected bin Laden as being a
leading sponsor of terrorism. In 1994, he took refuge in Sudan
after losing citizenship in his native .MDBR/.MDNM/Saudi Arabia for
opposing the ruling family.MDBR/.MDNM/. He was ousted from there
two years later when the United States threatened Sudan with trade
sanctions, and he moved to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden gathers support from groups such as the Taliban, a
fundamentalist Islamic movement that controls much of Afghanistan.
But Sprinzak said some of his reported 3,000 supporters might tell
of bin Laden's whereabouts in exchange for a hefty reward.
</P>
<P>
   Through money and cooperation with countries that currently
harbor him, Sprinzak added, bin Laden might be exiled and then
forced to wander, looking for countries that will protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak argued that bin Laden's lack of citizenship will make
it easier to find him because he can be exiled from any nation that
decides it is no longer in its interests to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Greater cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is
one way to wound the millionaire, who has a house in Pakistan,
Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright should talk seriously with
the Pakistani government and discuss every possible option because
that nation's intelligence service knows exactly where bin Laden
lives and where his hideouts are, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   If Pakistan ``decides tomorrow that the fellow damages their
interests, (the government) can solve the problem'' in no time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Pakistan have had tenuous relations in
recent years because of the country's efforts to develop nuclear
weapons. President Clinton imposed sanctions this year after
Pakistan detonated nuclear devices in response to nuclear tests in
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Reat, a State Department spokesman, said he had no
immediate comment on Sprinzak's statements.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Arthur argued that bin Laden's
lack of citizenship makes it easier for him to escape U.S. efforts
to pursue .MDBR/.MDNM/him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has an amorphous group of supporters and he isn't
rooted, Arthur said. He described bin Laden's power structure as
``faceless'' and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to relying on military force to respond to
terrorism, Arthur suggests that the United States build an alliance
against terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is in U.S. foreign policy interests to start again
this business of coalition building,'' he said, adding that America
is ``dangerously isolated'' as the sole superpower.

 &HT;    35 YEARS LATER, KING'S 'DREAM' STILL NOT REALITY
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. With KING-DATA.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 35 years since the Rev. Martin Luther King
described a ``dark and desolate valley'' of racial segregation in
his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, America has yet to meet King's
challenge to make real its promise of brotherhood to African
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in economic terms, the dream of political, social
and economic brotherhood that King shared with the hundreds of
thousands who gathered at the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963 is
a dream deferred for many minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, we haven't made much progress,'' said Margaret
Simms, an economist and vice president of research at the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies, the premier think tank
on issues affecting African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, of course, all minorities have made tremendous
progress since the ``Jobs and Freedom'' march came to the capital
in 1963. The huge, peaceful gathering helped persuade lawmakers to
sweep away legal barriers to voting, jobs, housing and education,
and set up a system of affirmative action to begin making amends
for past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable evidence that even the private attitudes
of Americans _ and especially those of Southerners _ about racial
matters have changed dramatically since King offered his vision of
a time when Americans would be judged by their character rather
than their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   ``In small towns and rural communities all across the South,
people are in the process of laying down the burden of race,'' Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., said in an interview Wednesday. ``We've come a
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans can measure that distance as accurately as Lewis,
one of the defining figures of the modern civil rights movement.
And yet, for all the ``sense of hope and optimism'' that he
encounters today in his extensive travels as a member of Congress,
Lewis said that as a nation, ``we have not yet arrived at the
beloved community'' King envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``some people today, blacks and whites, probably don't
believe that we will ever be able to 'sit down together at the
table of brotherhood' or that the 'American dream' King spoke of so
fondly was ever real,'' said Stephanie Larson, a professor at
Dickinson College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are currently nowhere near the point of realizing much of
King's dream,'' she added. ``Certainly, Mississippi is not 'an
oasis of freedom and justice,' nor are we a nation with 'a
beautiful symphony of brotherhood'.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, in Jackson, Miss., where voter registration workers
were met in 1961 by Mayor Allen Thompson with a machine
gun-equipped tank, the mayor is a young black man, Harvey Johnson
Jr. Likewise, today in Birmingham, Ala., where Police Chief Bull
Connor turned fire hoses on black children in 1963, the mayor,
Richard Arrington, is black. And the park where children's marches
took place is now a memorial to the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the political gains of African Americans have far
outrun social and economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban League's latest report on ``The State of Black
America'' notes, for example, that African Americans own about 8
cents of wealth for every dollar owned by whites. African Americans
still lag whites in income, employment and educational attainment
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as a nation, have a difficult time confronting the legacy
of racism, the continuing existence of racism, and recognizing the
benefits that whites receive from American society simply by virtue
of being white,'' said Paula McClain, a professor at the University
of Virginia. ``The legacy of race and racism continues to haunt us,
but we treat them like the crazy aunt or uncle in the attic that we
try to ignore and not acknowledge even as their presence creates
tremendous difficulties for us.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is that the rhetoric of King's ``I Have a
Dream'' speech has been ``hijacked'' by those who oppose racial
bias remedies such as affirmative action, said Yvonne
Scruggs-Leftwich, executive director of the Black Leadership Forum,
an umbrella organization for the nation's most prominent civil
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Gerald Reynolds, president of the Center for New
Black Leadership, a political conservative group at the forefront
of the movement to abolish affirmative action. ``To say we have no
right to honor Dr. King in our way is ridiculous,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Reynolds acknowledged that the economic advancement of
African Americans has fallen short of the goals King set in his
speech to the multitudes at the Lincoln Memorial, though he
questioned whether ``any government program can help'' achieve
those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, much of the progress that has been made in
the 35 years since the March on Washington has been clouded by the
constant _ and sometimes simplistic _ celebration of King's ``I
Have A Dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we are trapped by this repeated broadcast of the
speech,'' said David Garrow, author of ``Bearing the Cross,'' a
widely acclaimed book about King and the organization he founded,
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. ``I have worried for
years that especially with younger folks, this portrayal of King as
this Horatio Alger-esque optimist makes him less interesting and
less challenging and less relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the attention to the speech ignores the transcendent
nature of the March on Washington, said Roger Wilkins, a historian
at George Mason University and the nephew of the late Roy Wilkins,
longtime leader of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who were there, the inspiration of that day
lives on,'' Wilkins said. ``It was a rare display that made the
nation, for that moment, believe that it could be better than it
ever was before. Whether it could happen again, who knows? But the
struggle continues on a less elevated plane, but it keeps on.''

EXPERTS QUESTION MILITARY STRIKES IN TARGETING BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: Refiling to eliminate garble)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States needs to dramatically increase
the reward for bombing suspect Osama bin Laden.MDNM/ and seek
greater cooperation with countries that harbor him to weaken the
millionaire's ability to carry out attacks, an Israeli terrorism
.MDSU/.MDNM/.MDNM/expert said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Ehud Sprinzak, a Hebrew University political science
professor and a senior fellow at the United States Institute of
Peace, said increasing the reward for information on bin Laden
might be the key to finding him. The United States is offering $2
million for information leading to the capture of bin Laden, but
Sprinzak said it should be $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Institute
of Peace, a federal agency created by Congress to promote conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, a political science professor at the University of
Ulster and another Institute of Peace fellow, said the United
States needs to build a global coalition to avoid being isolated in
its retaliatory attacks against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi
outcast, of using his personal fortune to finance terrorist
activities _ including the recent bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Keyna and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   .MDUL/.MDBO/.MDUL/.MDRV/.MDBU/.MDBR/.MDBU/.MDRV/.MDUL/.MDBR/.MDNM/Wi
th a high price on bin Laden's head, he would ``very quickly feel
the heat'' from organizations in the Middle East that would be
attracted to a large reward, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long suspected bin Laden as being a
leading sponsor of terrorism. In 1994, he took refuge in Sudan
after losing citizenship in his native .MDBR/.MDNM/Saudi Arabia for
opposing the ruling family.MDBR/.MDNM/. He was ousted from there
two years later when the United States threatened Sudan with trade
sanctions, and he moved to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden gathers support from groups such as the Taliban, a
fundamentalist Islamic movement that controls much of Afghanistan.
But Sprinzak said some of his reported 3,000 supporters might tell
of bin Laden's whereabouts in exchange for a hefty reward.
</P>
<P>
   Through money and cooperation with countries that currently
harbor him, Sprinzak added, bin Laden might be exiled and then
forced to wander, looking for countries that will protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak argued that bin Laden's lack of citizenship will make
it easier to find him because he can be exiled from any nation that
decides it is no longer in its interests to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Greater cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is
one way to wound the millionaire, who has a house in Pakistan,
Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright should talk seriously with
the Pakistani government and discuss every possible option because
that nation's intelligence service knows exactly where bin Laden
lives and where his hideouts are, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   If Pakistan ``decides tomorrow that the fellow damages their
interests, (the government) can solve the problem'' in no time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Pakistan have had tenuous relations in
recent years because of the country's efforts to develop nuclear
weapons. President Clinton imposed sanctions this year after
Pakistan detonated nuclear devices in response to nuclear tests in
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Reat, a State Department spokesman, said he had no
immediate comment on Sprinzak's statements.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Arthur argued that bin Laden's
lack of citizenship makes it easier for him to escape U.S. efforts
to pursue .MDBR/.MDNM/him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has an amorphous group of supporters and he isn't
rooted, Arthur said. He described bin Laden's power structure as
``faceless'' and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to relying on military force to respond to
terrorism, Arthur suggests that the United States build an alliance
against terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is in U.S. foreign policy interests to start again
this business of coalition building,'' he said, adding that America
is ``dangerously isolated'' as the sole superpower.

 &HT;    People living near the North Carolina coast did little more than
wait
 &HT;    By Stuart Savage
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ While the nation watched, people living near
the North Carolina coast did little more than wait.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie's sluggish pace hardly helped residents of New Bern,
Vanceboro, Washington and other near-coastal regions decide what to
do. Each weather update showed Bonnie's course had changed. So most
people played it safe, stirred to caution by memories of Fran and
Bertha two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over the Trent River in New Bern, Carmalita Wetherington
described how Fran twisted bridges like snakes, mangled boats and
drove water within inches of her doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to keep an eye open,'' said Ms. Wetherington, 61.
``We've seen some wild things here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once burned, twice shy was the only advice most hurricane
veterans needed. Bonnie, a category three storm, projected by late
afternoon Wednesday to land near New Bern, was expected to cause
serious flooding in the Albemarle and Pamlico regions. Surges 12
feet or more were expected to force water into the critical areas
where the Neuse, Trent, Pamlico and Chowan rivers flow into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   That was compounded by the threat of water swells spilling over
the banks of Wilmington's Cape Fear River, which Bonnie reached at
about 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Pamlico County, officials had evacuated low-lying
areas Tuesday, including Hobucken, Lowland and Goose Creek Island,
said Martin Beach, county manager and acting emergency management
coordinator. Fourteen Pamlico County residents stayed at Chicod
School in Pitt County Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beach said his county shelter, at Pamlico Community College,
could hold 300 people. ``Basically we're in a hunker down mode,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Craven County, Stanley Kite, the emergency services director,
said four shelters were open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 550 people at the shelters now,'' he said
shortly after noon. But, he said, ``We have a lot of people on the
highway and roads. We're pleading with people to seek shelter, move
further inland.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about when or where the storm would touch down left
many taking the high road.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Chambliss, dock master at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina on
Front Street in New Bern, said boat owners removed their vessels
before the high winds and rains began Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a busy day yesterday and last night. These docks can't
handle 125 mile-per-hour winds. Fran really played havoc with this
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing waist-high, yellow wading pants, Chambliss, 69 and a
dock master for more than 13 years, calmly admitted he could do
little else than evacuate the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get very concerned,'' he said. ``You just go to work and
get ready for it. We've done all we can do. The worst that could
happen would be a 12- or 14-foot water surge,'' he said, adding,
``The best would be for this storm to just break up.''
</P>
<P>
   Desk attendants at the hotel reported no rooms were available by
noon Wednesday. The hotel offered a lower rate to accommodate the
unexpected business.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Craven County residents could stay in several
shelters in Vanceboro, New Bern and Havelock.
</P>
<P>
   In Kinston, Roger Dail, emergency management director for Lenoir
County, said people were coming in to the shelter at the Lenoir
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put 500 or 600 there,'' he said. ``It's just a wait,
watch and wait game now.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities around New Bern faced the on-coming storm with
caution and awe. Residents flocked to grocery stores, where they
emptied shelves of bread, water, ice, milk and canned food.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of shoppers to Kite's IGA in Vanceboro caused a parking
shortage and sent drivers scrambling for parking spots on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to get some food in the house,'' said
cashier Shirley Gaskins.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the situation became serious for Billy
Whichard, who owns Whichard's Beach resort near Washington. Heavy
mists, whitecaps and the constant sound of the Pamlico River
lapping against the bulkheads made his dock a lonely outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind has gotten up quite a bit. I think the tide's on its
way in now, for good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The marina and campground cleared out earlier and only two empty
recreational vehicles sat, unattended. They may or may not make it,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was here during Fran,'' he said, adding, ``We had
some that only had the chassis left.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran, which caused flooding in Raleigh and devastated the coast,
followed Bertha, which swept through the state in the summer of
1996. Whichard said those storms destroyed his game room and tore
the walls, windows and doors out of the covered building near the
marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had water in here four feet deep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Beaufort County shelters were at Washington, Northside and
Chocowinity high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a mandatory evacuation of low-lying area,'' a spokesman
said. ``But I have no idea of the number of people that left. If
they got water during Fran, they can expect pretty much the same
this time,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Whichard vowed to remain at the marina, which his father began
in the mid-1940s, as long as possible, just as he has before every
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd normally stay here until just before it's unsafe to get
out,'' he said. ``I wouldn't like to see it, but it looks like it's
going to get worse before it gets better.''

 &HT;    NORTH CAROLINA COUNTY POUNDED BY BONNIE
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high winds and heavy rain of Hurricane Bonnie started
pounding Pitt County late Wednesday afternoon, hours after the
storm was expected to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind has picked up tremendously,'' Greenville Fire-Rescue
Chief Raymond Carney, the city's emergency coordinator, said about
4 p.m. after a relatively quiet morning. ``Things are going to pick
up really soon Q extremely soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind speeds had doubled by the afternoon, with gusts up to 50
mph, Carney said. Conditions were getting worse about 4 p.m. at The
Daily Reflector's early press time.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, two and a half inches of rain fell in
Greenville in an hour. Spot flooding from the heavy downpour was
reported at First Street and parts of Evans Street and Red Banks
Road, with crews dispatched to post 'high water' warning signs.
Parked cars reportedly started flooding.
</P>
<P>
   County and city emergency centers started receiving calls of
downed tree limbs and minor debris blowing into the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like this is probably what we are in for for the next
few hours,'' Greenville Public Information Officer Katie Veilleux
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville Utilities Commission reported the first of what
was anticipated to be many power outages about 3:30 p.m. About 60
residents on Skinner Street, Cadillac Drive and Jefferson Drive had
lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Crews were waiting for wind speeds to decrease so they could
respond, GUC Public Information Officer Sue Bizzaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County residents woke up Wednesday morning to partly cloudy
skies and barely a breeze Q not at all what forecasters had
predicted a day before with Hurricane Bonnie approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Effects of the storm were expected to hit Pitt County early
Wednesday, bringing winds of about 40 to 60 mph that would
strengthen during the day to about 80 mph, with the worst
conditions developing about midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie changed her mind, slowing its course and leaving
residents and emergency officials ready and in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pitt County Emergency Operations Center kept its 3
a.m. opening time, the city of Greenville delayed activating its
center at the Police-Fire Rescue Building for a couple of hours
until about 9 a.m. Officials were trying to prevent workers from
overloading and being exhausted by the time the hurricane Q and
most of the work Q hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricanes have their own personalities,'' Veilleux said while
standing in the relatively quiet headquarters Wednesday morning.
``You just have to be prepared to watch and adjust. This one is so
big.''
</P>
<P>
   The 400-mile wide, category 3 hurricane, packing 115-mph winds,
sped up its course toward the North Carolina coast Tuesday then
slowed that night.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County opened shelters at five local schools at 5 a.m., and
about 700 residents had flocked to those by 3:30 p.m. By then,
forecasters predicted the storm would hit that evening.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee pots at the city's emergency operations center were
still full at mid-morning, a sign of the unexpected slow activity
as Bonnie still had not arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same scene at the county's center at 6 a.m., with a
few workers answering the sparse calls from residents mainly asking
about closings.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of a storm, the center, with more than 20
phones, is busy with callers reporting damage or needing help.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both centers keep their eyes on television reports
and radar images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has gotten their stuff in place and is waiting for
the actual landfall,'' Pitt County Public Information Officer Arlen
Holt said Wednesday afternoon. ``The storm is slowing down so much
it looks like it will hit tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   With that delay, some officials, after the early morning start,
took an afternoon break to save up energy for the brunt of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The extra preparation time gave county officials the chance to
test new strategies, including a computer-faxing system used to
send information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying some things for the first time, although we have
practiced,'' Holt said. ``In some respects, this time is good
because we are able to iron out some of the kinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials used the time to review
after-hurricane responses. They have two main priorities following
hurricane destruction: injuries and looting.
</P>
<P>
   When trees topple onto houses or winds rip through homes,
electricity and telephones are the first to go, Pitt County
sheriff's Lt. Ron Smith said. That makes finding help that much
harder for the injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the storm, we'll go out in the areas and assess damage,
looking for injury. The second thing will be the security of any
destructed areas Q looting, vandalism,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The devastating tornadoes that killed nine people and injured
100 in March 1984 led to looting problems, he said. It is something
officials are wary of when businesses are damaged, opening them up
as easy targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised. People will do that,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard helped the county watch for looting problems
in 1984 and has been called out for Bonnie as well. Gov. Jim Hunt
declared a state of emergency Tuesday, dispatching 150-member units
to Greenville, Tarboro and Lumberton. The soldiers will respond to
requests from state and local emergency officials for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Greenville Police Department and the Pitt County
Sheriff's Department stationed officers throughout their coverage
areas in preparation for the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   City officers were using fire departments and city buildings for
shelter, Major J.M. Simonowich said. The department also went to
12-hour shifts, bringing in extra officers.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies were stationed in every area of the county Wednesday
morning, including a deputy in each of the shelters. The Sheriff's
Department called for extra personnel and was expected to need HAM
radio operators to help with communication.
</P>
<P>
   The department had its mobile command center prepared and gassed
up. With the command center, the Sheriff's Department can stay out
of the weather, lay out maps, organize searches and communicate
with other agencies during disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The break frustrated rural power providers at Edgecombe Martin
and Pitt &AMP; Greene electric membership corporations, which provide
electricity to nearly 19,000 people in Pitt and surrounding
counties. They serve about 5,000 people in Pitt County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a nervous fit,'' said Mark A. Suggs, Pitt &AMP; Greene's
vice president and general manager. ``We want it to go ahead and do
what it's going to do or go away ... staying in a perpetual state
of preparedness is aggravating.S
</P>
<P>
   The utilities have been preparing since Monday, coordinating
efforts with other cooperatives through a central emergency center
in Raleigh. Co-op crews from Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia and
western North Carolina will respond wherever they are needed, and
the utilities have contracted with private companies to assist with
tree removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people and a lot of equipment ready to move
quickly,'' said Suggs, whose company serves primarily the Farmville
and Fountain areas. ``We're just waiting to see what we need, where
we need it and how much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgecombe-Martin serves customers primarily in the River Road,
Pactolus and TranterUs Creek areas. That company on Wednesday sent
its crews home to rest in anticipation of a busy day today, said
Eddie Stocks, key account manager.
</P>
<P>
   RDuring the brunt of the storm, thereUs not much we can do but
sit tight and wait for it to get over. Then we'll get out, assess
the damage and get to work.''

 &HT;    East Carolina University students playing it safe
 &HT;    By Judy Royal
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't their ideal way to spend a day off from classes, but
Meredith Neely and Amy Floyd didn't want to take any chances.
</P>
<P>
   The East Carolina University students filled their backpacks
with toothbrushes, snacks and other essentials before heading to
one of Pitt County's five hurricane emergency shelters Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just would rather be safe than sorry,'' Ms. Neely said,
rocking back on her green canvas cushion, which straps together to
create a backrest like a chair.
</P>
<P>
   The women, sitting on the steps outside C.M. Eppes Middle School
in Greenville, are neighbors at an apartment complex near Pitt
County Memorial Hospital. Neither felt safe weathering the storm
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the building behind us go up, and it took about
three weeks. This building has to be built better than ours,'' Ms.
Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain about how their homes would endure Hurricane Bonnie,
hundreds of people like Ms. Neely and Ms. Floyd gathered up their
belongings and loved ones to seek refuge in the relative safety of
emergency shelters officials established at five county high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The shelters opened their doors at 5 a.m., six hours earlier
than the original schedule, because meteorologists originally
predicted the storm's effects would touch Pitt County a shortly
before noon.
</P>
<P>
   But people waking up Wednesday morning must have somehow known
Bonnie was planning a late arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m. a group of Department of Social Services workers at
Ayden-Grifton High School ate biscuits from Hardee's and watched a
small black and white television to get the latest weather updates.
</P>
<P>
   They had no one to keep them company until three people signed
in at the shelter almost an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   The couple and their 13-year-old grandson fled their mobile home
near the Pitt-Craven County line, Murl Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   She came prepared with food, blankets, pillows, quilts, a small
mattress and plenty to keep her busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought my radio and I brought my Bible and I got a book
that I want to read,'' Ms. Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, James Keyes, seemed content with just a chair to
occupy him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always keep it with me. My legs aren't that good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grandson Carlos Curry sat on the floor with his head against the
wall, hoping others would soon join his family.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to wait long.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 a.m. a few cars pulled in, and by 3:30 p.m. the
original three had 185 others joining them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ayden-Grifton, D.H. Conley High School began getting a
crowd shortly after opening. By 7:30 a.m. almost 50 people set up
camp in hallways. That number grew to 182 by 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Many were repeat customers, remembering past hurricanes, Shelter
Manager Al Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fran made a believer out of everybody around here. They're
better prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Ellison, who sat out Fran and Bertha at the same
shelter, brought 10 other family members with her this time. Some
live in mobile homes and a few in a house, but all were unsure of
Bonnie's effects on their residences.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellison made two trips to pick up loved ones from Grimesland
and Winterville, including her 7-month-old daughter, Jamia
Worthington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the head of this household,'' Ms. Ellison said, drawing
laughs from her family as she sat down in the middle of her group,
which included eight children.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters watched a small television they brought, lost
themselves in music from portable compact disc players, shuffled
through cards and ripped open bags of animal crackers as more
people staked out floor space.
</P>
<P>
   They played, chatted and made the best of the situation as if it
were recess, not an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellison's nephews, Timmy West, 13, and Xavier Guions, 10,
took turns cheerfully picking on each other to pass the time, while
the adults joked about what Bonnie had in store for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets rough, I'm getting out of this hallway and going
into the bathroom,'' Ms. Ellison's mother Maggie Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Brenda Richardson's children Q Hope, 11, and Ryan, 5 Q
were a little more timid than those in the Ellison bunch. Both
admitted they were a little scared of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The family's mobile home in the Wintergreen area withstood the
hurricanes of 1996, but Richardson decided to seek shelter early
Wednesday morning to outsmart Bonnie's uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to happen, how it's going to
change or what it's going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson couldn't have summed it up any better.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neely and Ms. Floyd kept an eye on weather conditions
throughout the late morning, wondering when Bonnie would make the
grand entrance everyone had been talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters kept postponing the storm's original predicted
arrival time of noon as hours slipped by without any signs of the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But by presstime the rain and wind marched in and warned of an
evening thrashing by Bonnie. Many people at the shelter brought
only enough food and clothing to get them into late Wednesday, but
a sleepover seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubted Bonnie's force, but everyone wanted the storm to
make a quick exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather it just start now,'' Ms. Floyd said.

 &HT;    ECU student have little fear of hurricane
 &HT;    By Clejetter Pickett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ While concerned parents kept phones ringing
at the East Carolina University Housing Office on Wednesday, the
threat of Hurricane Bonnie caused little fear in students like
freshman Ron Eshbach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through hurricanes before, and it ain't no big
deal,'' the Sanford native said. ``Some people are pretty scared,
but some of them are laid back like me Q whatever happens,
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshbach, who lives in ECU's Aycock Hall, had made no
preparations for the arrival of Hurricane Bonnie as of noon
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   With classes canceled, many of the 5,000 dorm residents took the
unexpected day off to play football, wash laundry and even study Q
despite instructions from the Housing Office to take precautions
such as moving themselves and their valuables away from windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fan is still in my window,'' said sophomore Angela Baker.
``I'm not worried, I'm doing laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who is from Fayetteville, said having a hurricane is
``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot of storms, and me and my older brother
usually go outside and run in the wind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Angela Farrior of Jacksonville said having grown up on
the coast has made her somewhat hurricane savvy also.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said she would take precautions if necessary,
including moving from her sixth-floor room to the hallway of a
lower floor if the winds got too high.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Office instructed residential advisors to have
students move to safer areas of the dorms when winds got above 60
mph. Students also were given tips on how to prepare for the storm,
including to have drinking water, flashlights and battery operated
radios, University Housing Director Manny Amaro said.
</P>
<P>
   No evacuations were planned at ECU because the dorms are
considered to be structurally safe, he said. In fact, Amaro said,
some of the 100 calls his office received Wednesday morning were
from parents of students who live off campus but wanted to move
inside the dorms until Hurricane Bonnie passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are worried about their kids. I would be, too,'' Amaro
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, ECU does not allow students who live off campus to
temporarily move in the dorms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Doyle, a junior who lives in Fletcher Hall, agreed with
Amaro that her dorm is a safe place to be, at least during this
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about my parents because my parents live up in
Kill Devil Hills and didn't leave. So I wouldn't want to be home
right now,'' she said.

 &HT;    Anything but a normal morning for coastal residents
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE _ Hurricane Bonnie's delayed arrival here caused some
regular Wednesday activities to continue on what was expected to be
anything but a normal morning.
</P>
<P>
   With only wind and sporadic showers early Wednesday, some
regular routines didn't change. The post office delivered first-
and second-class mail, city Public Works crews collected garbage
and some stores opened as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our job,'' letter carrier Leslie Fowden said as
he slid envelops in the mailboxes at Eastbrook apartments. ``We
carry it until we think it would be unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the storm, city, county, East Carolina University
and Pitt County schools announced Tuesday they would not open
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and residents, already prepared for the potential
power outages and flooding, waited much of the day for those things
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Main tenants at University Commons, including Target and Barnes
&AMP; Noble, opened on time while some of their neighbors posted signs
on the taped windows notifying would-be shoppers the stores were
closed because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   How long stores would stay open was a guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just depends on Bonnie,'' Target manager Mark Koukal
said. ``We are going to do our best to stay open for the people who
need supplies. We've had quite a few people coming in getting
last-minute things.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of shoppers filtered into the two stores, some
getting last-minute supplies while others were just killing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buying curtains,'' Greenville resident Martha Moore said
as she walked into Target about noon. ``We're just bored and tired
of waiting for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenville resident Jane Brown was prepared for Bonnie's
effects, with batteries, flashlights, bottled water and food ready.
She also removed items from her yard that could catch flight in
high winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, we've done it,'' she said, wearing a yellow rain
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Brown made one more stop Wednesday at Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are buying magazines to read by candlelight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With most residents ready Tuesday evening for the predicted
early morning hit, Bonnie's delay had caused some impatience by
mid-Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish it would hurry up and get here so we can get
back to normal,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza Mall had its doors open Wednesday morning but most
stores Q with the exception of a few food vendors and Radio Shack Q
were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Radio Shack, manager Joyce Griswell took repeated
requests for D-size batteries, telling anxious weather watchers
that a stash was expected that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One angry customer wandering into Radio Shack complained that
the mall's barber shop was not open. Ms. Griswell found the man's
complaint bizarre considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He
</P>
<P>
   f+i
</P>
<P>
   had
</P>
<P>
   f-i
</P>
<P>
   to get his haircut before the storm,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Streeter took advantage of her unexpected day off from
teaching to pay a bill at University Commons. She was optimistic
that the light rain and winds would be the only effects locals
would see.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions also were a pleasant surprise when she woke up
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 'thank you Lord,''' Streeter said. ``I'm thinking this
right here is what we are going to get. I'm tickled to death this
is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some evacuees from the coast who are staying in Greenville
hotels also took some time to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Pat Nelson, Pine Knoll Shores residents staying with
friends in Greenville during the storm, stopped by Target to pick
up some items for their planned trip to Ireland on Friday. Pat had
to convince her husband to leave their hometown and seek shelter
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat out the last hurricane Q Fran in September '96. It was
a little frightening for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville prepares for hurricanes as much as their coastal
town, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're impressed,'' Pat Nelson said before the couple stopped
by a local eatery for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie interrupted Bill and Chantel Mauney's honeymoon on the
Outer Banks, with the couple checking into the Ramada Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came here for a couple of days until they tell us we
can go back, Bill Chantel said as he smoked a cigarette outside
Barnes &AMP; Noble. ``Honestly I expected it to hit a little earlier
this morning. I'm shocked it has stayed out there as long as it
has.''

 &HT;    Trailer park residents uneasy
 &HT;    By Greg Rickabaugh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE _ The door to Tonia Moore's trailer hung open Tuesday
just after 1 p.m. as rain sprinkled outside at Quail Village
Trailer Park in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie was on its way, but Tonia and Co. weren't
budging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sit here until I have to move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonia's mother, Deborah, and 3-year-old son, Ronald, sat with
her and watched the television weather reports, which they
frequently switched between local meteorologist Phillip Williams
and The Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   While the family may be stubborn, it wasn't stupid. Bags in
nearby rooms sat packed with snacks and a change of clothes for
each of them in case they needed to head for one of five schools
where Pitt County officials established shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Wait-and-see seemed to be the overwhelming philosophy at the
trailer park
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Edna Godley will wait until Bonnie is knocking on her
back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind starts going and the trailer starts shaking,
that's when I'll get out,'' she said, standing outside in her
bathrobe watching the storm clouds loom.
</P>
<P>
   With no telephone or transportation, Ms. Godley didn't know how
she would leave, but expected someone would give her a ride to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she waited until the last minute and ended up
hanging out in the Emergency Room lobby at Pitt County Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better there than in the trailer. They said anyone who
stays in a trailer, if it starts getting bad, they're supposed to
leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Godley was crossing her fingers that Bonnie would leave her
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will go back the other way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to Bonnie was mixed at Pinecrest Mobile Home Park,
just down the street. Some evacuated early; others went for the
wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Nunez and family followed the lead of local businesses
and put duct tape across their small windows in typical ``X''
fashion. While his neighbors had moved to a hotel on Tuesday, he
preferred to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets worse, we'll go to my brother's house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez's 10-year-old daughter, Miriam, didn't appear scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in God and God will help us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Little took the same attitude back at Quail Village
Trailer Park, where she kept a close eye on the news alongside
boyfriend David Worthington. The couple was prepared to drive to
Raleigh for a friend's house just in case.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't expect they would have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be fine,'' she said. ``We're going to ride with
faith.''

IRELAND AND ENGLAND SAY CRACKDOWN WON'T THREATEN PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Prime Ministers Bertie Ahern of Ireland and
Tony Blair of Britain said Wednesday that the Northern Ireland
peace agreement would succeed despite a terrorist bombing 10 days
ago and that the new security measures they propose will help
curtail future attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, by a Catholic splinter group calling itself the
Real IRA, killed 28 people in the town of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers, after meeting in County Mayo, western
Ireland, emphasized that the new security measures would not cause
political problems in the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly, which reconvenes Sept. 14, will deal with a number
of volatile political and security issues as it carries out the
agreement, which gives minority Catholics more power and the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in the
affairs of the mostly Protestant northern British province.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders said the security measures, expected to be
approved by their Parliaments next week, were aimed at cracking
down on a handful of paramilitary dissidents who have not called
cease-fires, as have the Irish Republican Army and all the major
Protestant guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the governments' decision to enact laws making it easier to
convict suspected terrorists has been attacked by both Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA, and by hard-line Protestant leaders.
Sinn Fein says they are too harsh; the hard-liners say they are too
soft.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, the No. 2 Sinn Fein official and a member of
the new Assembly, said Wednesday that the proposals were tantamount
to internment, the preventive detention of suspects without trial.
The Blair government eliminated internment last year. It is still
possible under Irish law, but Ahern said he has no immediate plans
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The governments have clearly tried to show the public that, in
the wake of the latest terrorist atrocity, they are doing
something. At the same time they do not want to push either
Catholics or Protestants in the Assembly into hard-line positions
on questions like prisoner release and disarmament of
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   To keep control of unionist votes in the Assembly, David
Trimble, the body's first minister, must seem, like the
governments, to be tough on Catholic terrorists. But Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein president, who was interned by the British as an IRA
leader in the 1970s, must hold the traditional Republican hatred of
any hint of internment and shortcuts to conviction. If Trimble or
Adams lose control of their Assembly members, it could delay or
collapse the Assembly.

   WASHINGTON _ The United States needs to dramatically increase
the reward for bombing suspect Osama bin Laden and seek greater
cooperation with countries that harbor him to weaken the
millionaire's ability to carry out attacks, an Israeli terrorism
expert said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Sprinzak, a Hebrew University political science professor
and a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, said
increasing the reward for information on bin Laden might be the key
to finding him. The United States is offering $2 million for
information leading to the capture of bin Laden, but Sprinzak said
it should be $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Institute
of Peace, a federal agency created by Congress to promote conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, a political science professor at the University of
Ulster and another Institute of Peace fellow, said the United
States needs to build a global coalition to avoid being isolated in
its retaliatory attacks against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi
outcast, of using his personal fortune to finance terrorist
activities _ including the recent bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Keyna and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   With a high price on bin Laden's head, he would ``very quickly
feel the heat'' from organizations in the Middle East that would be
attracted to a large reward, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long suspected bin Laden as being a
leading sponsor of terrorism. In 1994, he took refuge in Sudan
after losing citizenship in his native Saudi Arabia for opposing
the ruling family. He was ousted from there two years later when
the United States threatened Sudan with trade sanctions, and he
moved to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden gathers support from groups such as the Taliban, a
fundamentalist Islamic movement that controls much of Afghanistan.
But Sprinzak said some of his reported 3,000 supporters might tell
of bin Laden's whereabouts in exchange for a hefty reward.
</P>
<P>
   Through money and cooperation with countries that currently
harbor him, Sprinzak added, bin Laden might be exiled and then
forced to wander, looking for countries that will protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak argued that bin Laden's lack of citizenship will make
it easier to find him because he can be exiled from any nation that
decides it is no longer in its interests to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Greater cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is
one way to wound the millionaire, who has a house in Pakistan,
Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright should talk seriously with
the Pakistani government and discuss every possible option because
that nation's intelligence service knows exactly where bin Laden
lives and where his hideouts are, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   If Pakistan ``decides tomorrow that the fellow damages their
interests, (the government) can solve the problem'' in no time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Pakistan have had tenuous relations in
recent years because of the country's efforts to develop nuclear
weapons. President Clinton imposed sanctions this year after
Pakistan detonated nuclear devices in response to nuclear tests in
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Reat, a State Department spokesman, said he had no
immediate comment on Sprinzak's statements.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Arthur argued that bin Laden's
lack of citizenship makes it easier for him to escape U.S. efforts
to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has an amorphous group of supporters and he isn't
rooted, Arthur said. He described bin Laden's power structure as
``faceless'' and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to relying on military force to respond to
terrorism, Arthur suggests that the United States build an alliance
against terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is in U.S. foreign policy interests to start again
this business of coalition building,'' he said, adding that America
is ``dangerously isolated'' as the sole superpower.

`54': NOT A SHRED OF INTELLIGENT LIFE HERE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ The people who made ``54'' surely didn't intend for
the movie to prove the old adage that disco sucks. But they prove
it nevertheless.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authentically vapid, this lightheaded gloss on life at the
notorious New York nightclub Studio 54 puts viewers into the
strobing, throbbing, mirror-balled action. You just don't get any
of the sex or drugs, and it soon becomes tediously obvious that the
most interesting things about the place were the sex and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Awkwardly poaching the plot line from ``Saturday Night Fever,''
writer-director Mark Christopher presents the whole decadent scene
through the eyes of 19-year-old Shane O'Shea (``I Know What You Did
Last Summer's'' Ryan Phillippe), a dumb, attractive Jersey City kid
who wants some glamorous fantasy in his working-class life.
</P>
<P>
   When Studio 54's lascivious manager Steve Rubell (Mike Myers)
spots sexy Shane among the throngs hoping to get past his velvet
rope, he lets him into the club. Once inside, Shane is dazzled:
People wear goofy costumes, people wear almost nothing at all, the
awful music is loud and insistent, Truman Capote _ whoever he is _
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Sure beats Jersey!
</P>
<P>
   Before Shane knows it, he's a bare-chested busboy on the fast
track to becoming the be-all and end-all: a shirtless bartender.
Women demand his services in the makeout balcony. Although Rubell
drools over him, too, the mush-mouthed boss is too busy filling
trash bags with skimmed cash and his nervous system with
pharmaceuticals to really act on his lechery (for some reason,
Studio 54 co-operator Ian Schrager is never so much as mentioned in
the film).
</P>
<P>
   Shane is befriended by a young married couple, fellow cleanup
crewman Greg (Breckin Meyer) and coat-check girl/aspiring diva
Anita (Salma Hayek). Besides providing the film with its only real
glamour in the form of Hayek, the duo play surrogates for Shane's
uncomprehending family across the Hudson who think he's gone, well,
54th Street on them (they're right).
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Shane also manages to get closer to his dream
girl Julie (Neve Campbell), a hometown girl and Studio regular
who's making it, sort of, as a soap actress. Why, even a
coke-snortin' granny (``The Wedding Singer's'' Ellen Dow) takes
Shane under her wing.
</P>
<P>
   Could life get any better? If you have no use for intelligent
conversation, perhaps not. But of course, no earthly paradise lasts
forever, and as the '80s loom, the price of excess, not to mention
the IRS, perform their standard duties and declare that the party's
over.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Stillman's ``The Last Days of Disco,'' which came out
earlier this year, wasn't a very good movie either. But at least it
understood that disco was a particularly empty pop culture movement
and constantly joshed its naive characters' certainty that they
were having the best possible time of their lives making the
superficial scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``54,'' on the other hand, only finds humor in some of Rubell's
arch behavior. Otherwise, it's an article of faith that everyone he
allows into his den of iniquity is there for a life-defining
experience _ like getting introduced to Andy Warhol (really, wasn't
everybody?) or dancing to the latest Village People single.
</P>
<P>
   For, um, depth, there's something resembling a class struggle
going on here. Rubell likes to make noise about construction
workers dancing the hustle with millionaires, celebrities and
royalty under his roof. But like everything else in this movie,
it's reduced to the most simple-minded expressions, such as snooty
Park Avenue twits making fun of Shane's cultural ignorance by
calling him a ``gorgeous troglodyte.'' No point, other than the
filmmakers' clueless condescension, is made by the follow-up
revelation that Shane doesn't know what a troglodyte is, either.
</P>
<P>
   But heck, what did any of that matter? The important thing about
Studio 54, at least to the makers of ``54,'' was that, for a
glorious couple of years between '60s idealism and '80s greed, a
select few of the beautiful and the damned had a great place where
they could ignore their cares and dance their brains out.
</P>
<P>
   Which, at least according to this film, should have been
illegal, since brains were apparently such a precious, limited
commodity at Studio 54. &UR;  &QL;

   ATTN EDITORS: Here are resources Cox has covering Hurricane
Bonnie:
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta has reporters Marlon Manuel and Chris Burritt in N.C.
for the duration of the storm. Their stories are scheduled to move
on the Cox wire by 8:30 every evening. Also, AJC photographer W.A.
Bridges Jr. will file photos.
</P>
<P>
   _ All three daily Cox papers in N.C. are in the path. Greenville
will file a late-night story on damage after the storm hits, and
will post photos of any destruction on the server.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elizabeth City, on the coast, and Rocky Mount, a couple hours
inland, are afternoon papers whose stories are moving in the
afternoon on the Cox wire. They also will post photos on the Cox
server.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also: West Palm Beach will file a story Danielle, which to
this point is tracking in Bonnie's same path.

   BONNIE-PITT _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The high winds and heavy rain
of Hurricane Bonnie started pounding Pitt County late Wednesday
afternoon, hours after the storm was expected to hit. ``The wind
has picked up tremendously,'' Greenville Fire-Rescue Chief Raymond
Carney, the city's emergency coordinator, said about 4 p.m. after a
relatively quiet morning. ``Things are going to pick up really soon
Q extremely soon.'' (Bryant, Daily Reflector) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BONNIE-STUDENTS _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ It wasn't their ideal way
to spend a day off from classes, but Meredith Neely and Amy Floyd
didn't want to take any chances.

with toothbrushes, snacks and other essentials before heading to

morning. (Royal, Daily Reflector) MOVED

<P>
   BONNIE-NORMAL _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Hurricane Bonnie's delayed
arrival here caused some regular Wednesday activities to continue
on what was expected to be anything but a normal morning. With only
wind and sporadic showers early Wednesday, some regular routines
didn't change. The post office delivered first- and second-class
mail, city Public Works crews collected garbage and some stores
opened as usual. ``It's part of our job,'' letter carrier Leslie
Fowden said as he slid envelops in the mailboxes at Eastbrook
apartments. ``We carry it until we think it would be unsafe.''

and Pitt County schools announced Tuesday they would not open
Wednesday. (Bryant, Daily Refelctor) MOVED

<P>
   BONNIE-COASTAL _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ While the nation watched,
people living near the North Carolina coast did little more than
wait. Bonnie's sluggish pace hardly helped residents of New Bern,
Vanceboro, Washington and other near-coastal regions decide what to
do. Each weather update showed Bonnie's course had changed. So most
people played it safe, stirred to caution by memories of Fran and
Bertha two years ago. (Savage, Daily Refelctor) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BONNIE-TRAILER _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The door to Tonia Moore's
trailer hung open Tuesday just after 1 p.m. as rain sprinkled
outside at Quail Village Trailer Park in Greenville. Hurricane
Bonnie was on its way, but Tonia and Co. weren't budging. ``I'm
going to sit here until I have to move,'' she said. Tonia's mother,
Deborah, and 3-year-old son, Ronald, sat with her and watched the
television weather reports, which they frequently switched between
local meteorologist Phillip Williams and The Weather Channel.
(Rickabaugh, Daily Refelctor) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BONNIE-ESU _ GREENVILLE, N.C. _ While concerned parents kept
phones ringing at the East Carolina University Housing Office on
Wednesday, the threat of Hurricane Bonnie caused little fear in
students like freshman Ron Eshbach. ``I've been through hurricanes
before, and it ain't no big deal,'' the Sanford native said. ``Some
people are pretty scared, but some of them are laid back like me Q
whatever happens, happens.'' Eshbach, who lives in ECU's Aycock
Hall, had made no preparations for the arrival of Hurricane Bonnie
as of noon Wednesday. He wasn't alone. (Pickett, Daily Refelctor)

Danielle. Surfing conditions are excellent with waves breaking at 6
feet at the shoreline, will have numbers on rescues, water
district's plans to lower canal levels, pet shelters booked, EOC
plans, etc. Hurricane Danielle strengthened with steady winds
reaching 100 mph as the storm made a line towards the Caribbean.

   RUSSIA-ECONOMY _ MOSCOW _ The Russian Central Bank announced
that it would no longer intervene in propping up the country's
sagging ruble against the U.S. dollar. Within 45 minutes of the
opening of trading on the currency markets, the ruble fell five
percent -- after a 10-percent slide on Tuesday. Officials halted
trading after the first hour, and later said they would invalidate
all transactions that had happened on Wednesday. In further
evidence of falling confidence in the deteriorating economy, the
run on the banks has begun with hundreds of Russians standing
outside banks demanding money. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ The search for U.S. dollars is
reaching a fever pitch during the current economic crisis in
Russia. A drastic change in the situation either Monday or Tuesday
for the better not withstanding, the dollar supply has dried up and
Russians and expatriates are unable to lay their hands on
greenbacks. American Express Corp., a major money-changer here, is
holding up wire transfers from the States. It has been almost
impossible since Monday, Aug. 17, for Visa and American Express
card-holders to get cash from ATMs here. One woman said she was
preparing to cash dollars for rubles and was accosted outside a
currency-exchange booth by Russians begging to buy her $20 bill.
And then there's me, the absolute wolf of Wall Street, who shrewdly
exchanged $1,000 for rubles at the 6.2 rate on Monday, literally
minutes before the government announced its devaluation. Go figure.

 &HT;    Group pickets CNN: Tailwind seen as cause
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 10 U.S. military veterans held an Operaton
Tailwind-related protest outside CNN Center in Atlanta Wednesday,
wearing T-shirts advocating a boycott of parent company Time Warner
Inc. and handing out leaflets to CNN staffers entering the
building. ``We're angry at the lies being told,'' said George
Forsyth, who paid his own way from New York City to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Marzullo of Englewood, Colo., one of the protest's
organizers, said CNN's Tailwind story, which alleged U.S. nerve gas
use in 1970 but was then retracted by the network, is still being
used in other countries to attack the United States, despite the
retraction. Marzullo and a few of the vets met with CNN spokesman
Steve Haworth Wednesday and suggested a forensic examination of the
site in Laos to prove or disprove the allegation; further action
against correspondent Peter Arnett, who was reprimanded but not
fired, and more positive stories on the U.S. military. Haworth said
he promised to relay the veterans' concerns to CNN senior
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did anything at all,'' Marzullo said, ``I think we
planted a few seeds of ways they could fix this situation.''

 &HT;    A setback for scientists digging into a virus' past
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway _A team of researchers that has traveled to
this remote Arctic town with the hope of unraveling the mystery of
the 20th century's worst epidemic has hit an unexpected snag.
</P>
<P>
   The team had planned to exhume the bodies of seven victims of
the 1918 flu, hoping the corpses would hold within them frozen and
preserved pieces of the virus that killed up to 40 million people.
Such a find might show what made the flu strain such a killer and
help scientists head off another worldwide pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   But the first week of digging handed the team an unanticipated
setback:
</P>
<P>
   The bodies they have found are not frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Years of planning and research had led the team to think that
the bodies of seven miners had been buried in a pit blasted 6 feet
into a steep hillside by their mining company employer. That would
have put the victims 3 feet into eternal permafrost.
</P>
<P>
   But on the group's first day of digging, the shovels they were
using to clear the first few feet of soggy tundra thunked
unexpectedly on a wooden object. By Tuesday afternoon, six more had
been uncovered: seven coffins, lying side by side as predicted, but
only 10 inches below ground, in a portion of the ground that thaws
every summer.
</P>
<P>
   No markings on the coffins identified them as the flu victims,
but Alan Heginbottom, the team's geophysicist, said Wednesday
morning, ``We found seven bodies in the (grave) where we expected
to find seven bodies. If these are not the burials from the 1918
Spanish flu deaths, it is a remarkable coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The team _15 scientists and technicians from Canada, England and
the United States _ had hoped this 1,200-person town on the
Svalbard archipelago, where current daytime temperatures range from
30 to 50 degrees, might be the one place on the planet where bodies
had been kept cold enough to preserve intact the 1918 virus. Their
leader, Kirsty Duncan of Toronto, had searched Siberia and Iceland
without success; partially frozen bodies unearthed in Alaska by
American scientists have yielded only fragments of the genetic
material of the 1918 flu.
</P>
<P>
   But the team insisted Wednesday that the decayed state of the
one body sampled so far is not a disappointment and declared
intentions to proceed as planned. Asked whether she's dismayed by
the finding, Duncan, 31, a geographer, said firmly at the grave
site, ``We are delighted. We are extremely excited by what we have
found, and we are certainly looking forward to the next few days of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert G. Webster, chief of virology and molecular biology
at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and holder of
the team's $150,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health,
quickly backed her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been planning this for five years; to begin to get
samples was really thrilling,'' he said. ``But the experiment for
me in a sense doesn't start until we get back into the lab. We have
the tools to get answers from these samples, but you are going to
have to be patient with us, because it will probably take months.''
</P>
<P>
   Team members acknowledged that the virologists they have
recruited to analyze the miners' tissues may be able to find only
broken segments of the 1918 flu's genetic blueprint rather than the
complete genetic code they had hoped for. Still, with the
approximately 100 grams of material they took late Tuesday, the
team can perform a sophisticated genetic copying technique known as
polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. ``We have enough to do PCR from
now till kingdom come,'' said Dr. Rod Daniels of the National
Institute for Medical Research outside London.
</P>
<P>
   The body whose coffin was opened late Tuesday _ and cannot be
identified by marks on the coffin or by features of the corpse _
was so obviously decayed that the group decided to forgo the
elaborate infection precautions they had planned on, at least for
now. Last week, they laboriously unloaded high-level protective
gear from the two 40-foot containers at the base of the cemetery
hill: complete ``spacesuits,'' self-contained air supplies and
sharp-edged biopsy tubes specially designed by Daniels' laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the autopsy team agreed to wear only eye protection,
masks, gloves and splatter-proof Tyvek suits ``rather than the full
Monty,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's agreement that opening the bodies poses no risk of
releasing live virus may change its plans for the samples once the
trip is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the researchers had recruited highly secured and
safe labs in England, the United States and Canada to do the work,
with some samples being shared with Norwegian health authorities in
Oslo. Now, they said, such caution might not be necessary.

 &HT;    With new discoveries come new hurdles for pathologists
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna

   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway _ The pathologists who came to the Arctic
to autopsy victims of the 1918 flu were expecting obstacles: A
possibly living disease organism, cumbersome protective gear, the
difficulty of cutting safely into 80-year-old frozen human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery that the bodies lie close to the surface, a
fresh set of hurdles has taken their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our hands and knees in a ditch that keeps filling up
with icy water,'' said Dr. Charles Smith, the Toronto forensic
pathologist who leads the autopsy team. ``There's three of us down
there; the opening is so narrow only one of us can get a hand in at
a time; we've got miners' lamps strapped to our heads; and the
water keeps filling our boots.''
</P>
<P>
   The body Smith found when he opened an unlabeled coffin late
Tuesday afternoon had been reduced by time and the flow of glacial
meltwater through the coffin to fragile, spongy bone with some
tissue _ ``soft, black, goopy material,'' according to Smith _
still attached.
</P>
<P>
   The team came to Longyearbyen with a long list of body sites
from which they would take samples: Lungs, heart, trachea, abdomin,
brain. But no individual organs can be identified in what remains
of the tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the bones are there, so we know that when we are taking
tissue around the ribs or along the vertebral column, we are where
the remnants of lung tissue would be,'' Smith said. ``We're dealing
with an acid environment, so the bones have started to decalcify.
If you applied a bit of pressure to a flat bone such as the pelvic
bone, you could bend it.''
</P>
<P>
   All seven of the dead miners are known to have been young,
strong men, still in their 20s and used to spending much of the
year outside as farmers or fishermen. One confirmation of their
health, Smith said, is that the teeth of the newly discovered
bodies were intact and have survived demineralization and decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have archived some of the teeth, so that if they were
needed for DNA studies, for instance, we will be able to use
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The team is using standard field autopsy tools: scalpel, trowel
and spatula. Its members have removed the lid from the upper half
of the coffin, but since the sides have collapsed from ground
movement and water pressure, that has given them only a narrow slot
in which to work.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising discovery, Smith said, was that the body
initially appeared shrink-wrapped: not with a fabric shroud, as
would have been customary, but with newspapers that have softened
and become incorporated into the flesh. Few whole sheets remain, he
said, but some of the fragments are legible.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, it may just be hunks of wet newspaper,'' he said, ``but
to archivists and people who can retrieve the information from such
material, it may be a gold mine.''

 &HT;    A setback for scientists digging into a virus' past
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway _A team of researchers that has traveled to
this remote Arctic town with the hope of unraveling the mystery of
the 20th century's worst epidemic has hit an unexpected snag.
</P>
<P>
   The team had planned to exhume the bodies of seven victims of
the 1918 flu, hoping the corpses would hold within them frozen and
preserved pieces of the virus that killed up to 40 million people.
Such a find might show what made the flu strain such a killer and
help scientists head off another worldwide pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   But the first week of digging handed the team an unanticipated
setback:
</P>
<P>
   The bodies they have found are not frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Years of planning and research had led the team to think that
the bodies of seven miners had been buried in a pit blasted 6 feet
into a steep hillside by their mining company employer. That would
have put the victims 3 feet into eternal permafrost.
</P>
<P>
   But on the group's first day of digging, the shovels they were
using to clear the first few feet of soggy tundra thunked
unexpectedly on a wooden object. By Tuesday afternoon, six more had
been uncovered: seven coffins, lying side by side as predicted, but
only 10 inches below ground, in a portion of the ground that thaws
every summer.
</P>
<P>
   No markings on the coffins identified them as the flu victims,
but Alan Heginbottom, the team's geophysicist, said Wednesday
morning, ``We found seven bodies in the (grave) where we expected
to find seven bodies. If these are not the burials from the 1918
Spanish flu deaths, it is a remarkable coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The team _15 scientists and technicians from Canada, England and
the United States _ had hoped this 1,200-person town on the
Svalbard archipelago, where current daytime temperatures range from
30 to 50 degrees, might be the one place on the planet where bodies
had been kept cold enough to preserve intact the 1918 virus. Their
leader, Kirsty Duncan of Toronto, had searched Siberia and Iceland
without success; partially frozen bodies unearthed in Alaska by
American scientists have yielded only fragments of the genetic
material of the 1918 flu.
</P>
<P>
   But the team insisted Wednesday that the decayed state of the
one body sampled so far is not a disappointment and declared
intentions to proceed as planned. Asked whether she's dismayed by
the finding, Duncan, 31, a geographer, said firmly at the grave
site, ``We are delighted. We are extremely excited by what we have
found, and we are certainly looking forward to the next few days of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert G. Webster, chief of virology and molecular biology
at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and holder of
the team's $150,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health,
quickly backed her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been planning this for five years; to begin to get
samples was really thrilling,'' he said. ``But the experiment for
me in a sense doesn't start until we get back into the lab. We have
the tools to get answers from these samples, but you are going to
have to be patient with us, because it will probably take months.''
</P>
<P>
   Team members acknowledged that the virologists they have
recruited to analyze the miners' tissues may be able to find only
broken segments of the 1918 flu's genetic blueprint rather than the
complete genetic code they had hoped for. Still, with the
approximately 100 grams of material they took late Tuesday, the
team can perform a sophisticated genetic copying technique known as
polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. ``We have enough to do PCR from
now till kingdom come,'' said Dr. Rod Daniels of the National
Institute for Medical Research outside London.
</P>
<P>
   The body whose coffin was opened late Tuesday _ and cannot be
identified by marks on the coffin or by features of the corpse _
was so obviously decayed that the group decided to forgo the
elaborate infection precautions they had planned on, at least for
now. Last week, they laboriously unloaded high-level protective
gear from the two 40-foot containers at the base of the cemetery
hill: complete ``spacesuits,'' self-contained air supplies and
sharp-edged biopsy tubes specially designed by Daniels' laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the autopsy team agreed to wear only eye protection,
masks, gloves and splatter-proof Tyvek suits ``rather than the full
Monty,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's agreement that opening the bodies poses no risk of
releasing live virus may change its plans for the samples once the
trip is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the researchers had recruited highly secured and
safe labs in England, the United States and Canada to do the work,
with some samples being shared with Norwegian health authorities in
Oslo. Now, they said, such caution might not be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait and see what we get,'' said Webster, who
had planned to take his samples to Memphis before taking them to
Fort Detrick outside Washington. ``We can't decide before we have
all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team has rearranged the next few days' plans to
accommodate the surprising discovery. Though the members have
partially unearthed all seven coffins (one of which they agreed not
to open in deference to surviving relatives), their next step will
be to switch gears: They will continue excavating until they
penetrate the permafrost, looking for where other evidence -
possibly even more coffins - may lie.
</P>
<P>
   Since they have promised not to remove the coffins, that will
require tunneling down at an angle through the sodden ground, in a
channel wide enough to admit the jackhammers necessary to tackle
the lower frozen sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique environment and we have been given unique
permissions,'' Duncan said. ``It would be scientifically
irresponsible not to go further.''

MOBSTER CHALLENGED ON CLAIM OF FBI IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Stephen Flemmi has said repeatedly from the witness
stand, he and his criminal partner James ``Whitey'' Bulger had a
simple deal with the FBI: they would be ``protected'' from
prosecution in exchange for information on the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, after Flemmi testified in federal court that his
longtime protector, agent John Connolly, had no role in payoffs to
his corrupt supervisor, John Morris, a federal prosecutor had an
obvious question _ was Flemmi now returning the favor?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're now trying to protect John Connolly like you think he
protected you all those years?'' asked Assistant US Attorney Fred
M. Wyshak Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not,'' replied Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Flemmi's version of events contradicts testimony by
Morris in April, and conveniently removes Connolly from Morris's
most damning claims: that Connolly delivered two $1,000 payoffs to
him.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Morris said Connolly handed one payoff to Morris's
girlfriend, an FBI secretary, after Morris asked Connolly to get
the money from Bulger and Flemmi. The cash paid for her to fly to a
Georgia training program Morris was attending.
</P>
<P>
   The second payoff was hidden in a case of wine that Morris said
Connolly loaded into the trunk of his car at FBI headquarters in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi said he knew nothing of either payment and reiterated
that the only money he and Bulger gave Morris was a $5,000 ``loan''
that he never repaid. Flemmi denied he had ever given any money to
Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever given Connolly a diamond ring for his wife,
Flemmi replied, ``I don't recall giving John Connolly any diamond
ring or recall anything of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Connolly said, ``That is a
question that only a rogue prosecutor would ask and it is
consistent with the smear campaign that Mr. Wyshak has perpetrated
against me from the outset of these hearings.'' Connolly called the
suggestion about the diamond ring ``absolutely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Morris, Flemmi recalled the men exchanged inexpensive
Christmas gifts: Bulger and Flemmi gave Connolly an Alcatraz belt
buckle and a decorative knife, as well as books.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was aware that Connolly had taken a vacation with
Bulger, Flemmi said, ``I'm not aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Morris testified that Connolly and his former wife
had once stayed at a Provincetown inn with Bulger and his
girlfriend, which Connolly dismissed at the time as ``utter
nonsense.'' Connolly also said he did not recall receiving the belt
buckle or the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was Connolly's supervisor in the FBI's organized
crime squad from late 1977 to early 1983, testified under a grant
of immunity. Connolly has refused to testify without a similar
arrangement with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview last spring after Morris's testimony,
Connolly called the allegations ``a malicious lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, who was cross-examined for a fifth day Wednesday, is
trying to convince US District Judge Mark L. Wolf to dismiss
extortion and murder charges pending against him because the FBI
had promised him immunity in exchange for information he provided
as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies Flemmi's claim and says that any such
promises, if made, were improper and legally unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, his fifth day on the witness stand, Flemmi would not
answer questions about his alleged involvement in eight murders,
his extortion of bookmakers, or his and Bulger's efforts to control
drug dealing in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to discuss their forced takeover of a South Boston
liquor store from a couple who had just purchased it, and invoked
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at least 80
times.
</P>
<P>
   He would not even acknowledge that the FBI questioned him about
the May 1981 murder of World Jai Alai owner Roger Wheeler in
Oklahoma, and he refused to answer when Wyshak asked if Connolly
had ever told him that Edward ``Brian'' Halloran had implicated him
and Bulger in Wheeler's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran, a fringe gangster, was murdered a few months after he
began cooperating with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak also accused Flemmi of regularly feeding Connolly
information that pointed away from them and toward others _ such as
when he linked the murder of World Jai Alai president John ``Jack''
Callahan to a Cuban group in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him what I wanted to tell him,'' Flemmi said.
</P>
<P>
   When Wyshak asked Flemmi if he believed Connolly had broken the
law in his dealings with him, Flemmi quickly answered yes, but
suddenly changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I was concerned,'' Flemmi said, ``everything he did
was legal.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, Hurricane Bonnie began to slow along the
southeast coast of North Carolina as it entered a zone of listless,
high-altitude steering winds. On Thursday, the lethargic storm will
drift northeast over eastern North Carolina with diminished winds,
setting the stage for recurrent heavy rains as far north as
southeast Virginia. Serious flooding is likely across eastern North
Carolina and southeast Virginia. Strong winds and heavy surf could
prevail as far north as southern Delaware and eastern Chesapeake
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The cool front that caused severe thunderstorms in parts of
Connecticut Wednesday will stall and weaken along the Northeast
seaboard. Some showers and thunderstorms will develop in eastern
New England along the remnants of the front. Farther inland,
sunshine and comfortable afternoon temperatures will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will be sunny and unusually hot with light
winds. Afternoon temperatures between 95 and 100 degrees will be
common in the interior Gulf Coast states. A few afternoon
thunderstorms will form over central and southern Florida as a weak
tropical disturbance passes the area.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will move from the
southern Missouri Valley to the western Great Lakes. In the wake of
the disturbance, most of the Plains will be sunny and hot.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, seasonable warmth will cover the Rockies. There
will be a few isolated afternoon thunderstorms in the central and
southern Rockies, but otherwise sunshine will be plentiful. Except
for patchy morning coastal clouds, the West Coast states will be
dry and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Obligatory Watch
</P>
<P>
   An obligatory tornado watch was posted for east North Carolina
Wednesday as Hurricane Bonnie approached land. Almost all
hurricanes making landfall south of New England spawn tornadoes as
they come ashore. Many twisters form in the right-front quadrant of
the hurricane (relative to the eye). Here, onshore winds ease
slightly, due to the greater friction of land, while winds at 5,000
feet blow fiercely. The difference in wind speed causes air to spin
around a horizontal axis. Tornadoes form when rising currents of
air tilt these horizontal rolls into spinning, vertical columns of
air.

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ The sound of explosives and gunfire
reverberated throughout the capital early Wednesday as government
and rebel forces fought on the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Laurent Kabila said its forces and
allies had used machine-guns, mortars and rockets against a column
of rebel soldiers; it is not clear how the rebels returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was concentrated in a eucalyptus field near
Kinshasa airport, less than 20 miles southeast of the city center,
government officials said. It marked the most intense fighting near
the capital since the rebellion began on Aug. 2 from the eastern
Congo and spread to the region southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
   When the government's new 12-hour curfew went into effect at 6
p.m., the streets were calm and the sound of fighting had ceased.
But it was unclear whether the government had succeeded in crushing
the rebels' last-ditch attempt to seize Kinshasa, or whether the
rebels were regrouping and planning another assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be either of those things,'' said a European
ambassador. ``It could be that we're witnessing the actions of a
lone rebel holdout, or it could be something much more significant
than that. I'm not planning to go out tonight to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city's diplomatic and business center, government
soldiers blocked roads, stopped people from circulating on the
streets and searched the trunks of the few vehicles allowed into
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Government trucks filled with soldiers and armored tanks could
be seen rumbling through deserted avenues, leaving wide white
tracks on the asphalt. Many appeared headed toward the presidential
palace, which lies beyond Kinshasa's former world trade center, an
abandoned skyscraper atop which a giant sign sports this
war-ravaged country's former name, Zaire _ minus the ``a'' and
``r.''
</P>
<P>
   In La Cite, where most of the city's 5 million people live,
residents said the streets were deserted in the morning, as
government soldiers ordered people to stay home. Later in the
afternoon, after the shelling had died down, residents said
soldiers had started allowing people to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's public transportation now and we can circulate,'' said
a UNICEF worker who lives in La Cite. ``But there are barricades
everywhere and the soldiers are not allowing us to carry our
cellular phones.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, since Angola and Zimbabwe began providing arms
and troops to Congo's beleaguered army, the rebels seeking to
overthrow Kabila have been in retreat in the region southwest of
here.
</P>
<P>
   Congo and its allies recaptured a critical military airport. And
although rebels still hold a crucial hydroelectrical dam that
supplies power to this region, the government and its allies appear
to have eliminated the threat to Kinshasa, which at one point
seemed likely to fall any minute.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the pro-government troops made progress in the
southwest, an undetermined number of rebels lingered in the areas
just south of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   The government has downplayed the presence of rebels nearby,
saying its soldiers were merely taking steps to completely
eradicate guerrillas from the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the end for them,'' said Dr.
Jean-Baptiste Sondji, the health minister. ``We're not completely
free yet of these infiltrators. They could still inflict some small
damage on us. But it's the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sondji said the pro-government forces had attacked a rebel
column of 500 soldiers, most of them former soldiers in the army of
the longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, whom Kabila overthrew less
than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are led by ethnic Tutsi from eastern Congo and are
believed to be backed by Rwanda and Uganda, the two countries that
propelled Kabila to power and then became disenchanted with him.
But the rebels in the southwest have also included former Mobutu
soldiers who are not Tutsi and can mix more freely with the local
population.
</P>
<P>
   Sondji said that 300 of the soldiers surrendered, 200 fled into
the eucalyptus field, and allied troops attacked the rebels in the
field, killing scores of them, Sondji said.
</P>
<P>
   This description could not be independently verified. But the
manager of a charter airline that has been flying residents across
the Congo River to Brazzaville, in the Republic of Congo, said all
flights had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   A man who lives one mile from the airport and left for work in a
downtown Kinshasa hotel at 6 a.m. said hundreds of government
soldiers had arrived in the area by that hour. But he said the
shelling had not started by then.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of gunfire and explosives began echoing in downtown
Kinshasa after 7:30 a.m. and continued with some intensity for
about an hour. The boom of explosives, and what appeared to be
return fire, went on until around 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the rebel-held city of Matadi, about 220 miles southwest of
Kinshasa, a rebel commander said his troops had killed 30
Zimbabwean soldiers during Wednesday's battle.
</P>
<P>
   The commander showed a Reuters correspondent there a collection
of Zimbabwean uniforms, passports and other documents supposedly
belonging to the dead Zimbabweans. ``Our forces killed up to 30
Zimbabwean troops in a fierce battle outside Kinshasa,'' the
commander, Dieudonne Kabengele, said, vowing to march ahead to
Kinshasa.

BUSH TOURS DEVASTATION IN FLOODED TEXAS TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ As Gov. George W. Bush toured this
flood-ravaged town Wednesday and listened to the anguished stories
of survivors who have virtually nothing left and no place to go,
President Clinton declared the area a major disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received word of the presidential declaration through a
cellular telephone call from the White House as he stood outside an
emergency shelter where more than 900 flood victims spent the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster declaration means flood victims can apply for
various grants, loans and other forms of relief such as temporary
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who made the disaster request just hours earlier, called
the quick word from the Clinton administration ``unprecedented''
and said the action is great news for a weary Val Verde County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartbreaking to see people whose whole lives have been
destroyed,'' Bush said after flying over a section of Del Rio where
raging floodwaters wreaked the worst devastation. ``It's hard to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to provide ``help as quickly as possible,'' but he
didn't know exactly when some of the federal aid would be made
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that this part of the world went from very dry to
very wet, from too little to too much, in a really quick period of
time. A lot of people are suffering,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio and much of South Texas had been enduring a long drought
when the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley dumped more than a foot
of rain on the area Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Six people drowned in Del Rio, and as many were killed across
the swollen Rio Grande in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. The flooding left
hundreds homeless. An estimated 35 people are still missing in Del
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, and state Rep. Pete
Gallego, a Democrat, Bush took a helicopter trip over parts of Del
Rio early Wednesday, including San Felipe Creek, where floodwaters
washed away blocks of homes, flattened trees, overturned cars and
boats and made mincemeat of people's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The area resembled a washed-out ghost town. The only signs of
life were some cattle and a couple of stray dogs. Abandoned cars
were stuck in the mud, large pools of water remained in many spots,
rooftops lay disembodied in the muck and appliances were strewn
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst disaster I have ever seen,'' Bonilla said as
he toured Del Rio, a town of about 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of debris scattered along the creek's banks told the story
of the madness of the night when the torrential downpour surprised
the sleeping community.
</P>
<P>
   But the mounds may also be hiding an even worse secret. Bush
said officials are concerned some of the missing may be dead and
buried in the debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievably devastating,'' Bush said after the trip.
``It's a really powerful scene.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad homecoming for Gallego, who represents the area. At
several points as he looked down on the destruction, he prayed and
made the sign of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, a lot of these people I've known for a long time.
These are friends, family and supporters,'' Gallego said later as
he gazed out across the shelter. ``I bet I've knocked on every door
in that neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I counted the places I've been to that are no longer there,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Del Rio Civic Center, which has been turned into an
emergency shelter for hundreds of flood victims, a tearful Ortencia
Cardenas told the governor and the two lawmakers in Spanish how she
heard cries of help in the dark from her longtime neighbors but
could do nothing because of the rising water. They died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not been able to forget their screams,'' Gallego said.

   A Different Type of Computer Monitor
</P>
<P>
   Better watch what you type. A new generation of software is
emerging to permit employers to record not just which Web sites
employees browse, but also which programs they use, memos they
write, e-mail they send _ in short, every keystroke.
</P>
<P>
   Win What Where, a software company in Kennewick, Wash.
(www.winwhatwhere.com), released its entrant into the field this
month, a program called Win What Where, which costs $285 for each
desktop computer in which it is installed. The company says its
software keeps a record of every keystroke, mouse click and
command.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tech Assist of Largo, Fla. (www.toolsthatwork.com),
began distributing Desktop Surveillance in North America, a
comprehensive computer-monitoring program by the British company
Omniquad. The software costs $55 per computer and has been on sale
in Europe for about eight months. Desktop Surveillance is being
marketed as the ``software equivalent of a video surveillance
camera on the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   It permits third-party observers to view, in real time or in
playback, exactly what tasks a user is performing and what
keystrokes he or she is entering.
</P>
<P>
   Each program lets employers hide the fact that the software is
running on an employee's computer. Desktop Surveillance even allows
a record of the employee's activities to be e-mailed to a
supervisor without an employee's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both Tech Assist and Win What Where said they saw
a demand from employers concerned about employees' wasting time on
their computers. They also said that employers wanted a record in
case the employees sued or were sued.
</P>
<P>
   Win What Where president Richard Eaton said his company had
struggled with whether to produce software that could be used to
invade employee privacy. ``There was a lot of turmoil internally
about monitoring keystrokes,'' Eaton said. ``It just seemed like
too much, but it was the No. 1 request from our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Allen, senior product manager for Tech Assist, said
Desktop Surveillance could be set only to record an employee's
actions when certain off-limits activities occurred, such as when
an employee visited a sex-related Web site. ``Companies have proper
use policies for computers and the Internet,'' she said. ``This is
just an enforcer of those policies.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Drudge Report to the Drudge Retort
</P>
<P>
   Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge may claim to have a handle
on the latest news, but he doesn't have a world exclusive on his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge, who publishes the Drudge Report at www.drudgereport.com,
is competing, in a sense, with a parody of his effort,
www.drudge.com.
</P>
<P>
   Two opportunistic satirists, Rogers Cadenhead, a journalist, and
Jonathan Bourne, a television sitcom writer, have registered the
site and publish the Drudge Retort on it.
</P>
<P>
   The site deftly copies the look and feel of the Drudge Report
but, tongue placed firmly in cheek, seeks to mock Drudge's style of
journalism. Drudge did not respond to e-mail messages seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The satire receives more than 10,000 hits a day, according to
the site's operators, who say some of the traffic has a curious
point of origin: Their logs indicate that a dozen or so of the hits
have come from a server for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   University Takes Magazine to Task on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University believes it has a thing or two to teach U.S.
News &AMP; World Report about accuracy. The magazine counters that
Stanford needs a lesson in objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute surrounds the magazine's college rankings issue,
which reached newsstands Monday and is typically its best-selling
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is using the Net to press its several-year-old stand
against the rankings, asserting that they mischaracterize the
experience at various institutions. On its Web site
(www.stanford.edu/home/statistics/index.html), the university has
posted data about Stanford that it says more accurately reflects
the Stanford experience; it also has posted a report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which audits the universities' data.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News' report (www.usnews.com) does not disagree that
Stanford's own internal findings are accurate, but the magazine
says its own rankings offer prospective students a more objective
look because U.S. News does not favor any particular institution.
Indeed, a magazine spokeswoman, Celeste James, said that the
publication was well accustomed to hearing criticism from colleges
that did not necessarily agree with how the rankings portrayed
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an independent source,'' Ms. James said. ``When someone
selects their own data, it is inherently subjective.''
</P>
<P>
   A Stanford spokesman, Terry Shepard, countered that the
university was not complaining about its rank, which consistently
has been in the top six. Instead, he said, Stanford believes that
U.S. News &AMP; World Report generalizes too much and reaches
unsupportable conclusions. For example, he said, the magazine
unfairly seeks to measure student satisfaction partly by
determining what percentage of alumni donate to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They count what's countable rather than what's accurate,''
Shepard said, adding that Stanford would like to see the rankings
abolished and might decide not to provide information for the
survey next year.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. News &AMP; World Report annual survey, its 12th,
ranks more than 1,300 institutions based on questionnaires sent to
college officials. On at least one point, the magazine agrees with
Stanford. It notes that students should not base their decisions
solely on the rankings.

   New Fax Machine Software Adds E-Mail to the Menu  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The multifunction fax machine, which already is able to scan,
print, copy and, of course, fax, is about to add yet another
function _ e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley company, Jetfax. (www.jetfax.com), is working
the bugs out of technology that will make it possible to send an
e-mail directly from a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The fax machine scans a document, which is then sent to a server
at Jetfax in Menlo Park, Calif. The server then routes the document
to an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other interesting facet. The server at Jetfax
encodes the document so that it can be viewed in an e-mail
application, without requiring the use of a graphics program.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive Rudy Prince said the technology
will be available in November for ``less than $500.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up: the fax machine that brews your morning coffee.

   Artificial Intelligence Program Tries Its Hand at Cards  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chess has Deep Blue. Now bridge has GIB.
</P>
<P>
   GIB, a computer program that plays bridge, gave the world's best
human players a run for their money last weekend in Lille, France,
at the 1998 World Bridge Championships. The program placed 12th out
of 35 in a Par contest, which challenges competitors to solve
tricky bridge puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first solid finish for the program. It placed
first this summer at the National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence in a competition against other computer bridge
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Ginsberg, a University of Oregon professor who does
research in artificial intelligence, is the creator of the GIB,
which stands for Ginsberg Intelligent Bridge Player
(www.gibware.com). Ginsberg plans to start shipping the software
commercially on Oct. 1 with a price tag of about $80.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its successes, GIB is not without its faults. While it
is quite adept at playing a hand, it is not as effective at
bidding, which may explain why it did not fare better in France. As
a result, the program may not make the best partner for a very
talented bridge-playing human, Ginsberg conceded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ginsberg said he would continue to improve GIB and
hoped, sooner or later, to put it to a high-stakes test.

   Literary agent  &UR; Lucianne Goldberg &LR; , one of the featured players
in the  &UR; Monica &LR;   &UR; Lewinsky &LR;  scandal, has lost her client
 &UR; Mark Fuhrman &LR; , one of the featured players in the  &UR; O.J. &LR;   &UR; Simpson &LR; 
case. The former police detective has been trying to promote his
new nonfiction book, ``Murder in Greenwich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every show that Mark was booked on,'' Goldberg told New York
magazine, ``the first thing they did was ask him, `Do you know
Monica Lewinsky?' It made him crazy, and I don't blame him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source told the magazine that the fault was the agent's
rather than the media's. Goldberg was ``so consumed with bringing
down the president,'' said the source, that Fuhrman's interests
were being underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Jeffrey Toobin &LR; , who wrote a best-selling book about the

she gave the quilt to me. That's the difference between French and
American aesthetics.''

   BECKET, Mass. _ It sounded like a perfect match. The American
Indian Dance Theater, which began in 1987 as a showcase for
traditional dances from different tribes, was looking for a
dramatic way to reconcile its heritage with the modern world. Laura
Dean, a white choreographer with a penchant for spinning movement
and an eye for ritualism, was hoping to deconstruct some powwow
dances, which share a striking affinity with many of her own
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, after raising $26,000 from the National Endowment
for the Arts and two private foundations, the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival commissioned the postmodern dervish and the folkloric
troupe to make a new dance together.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Dean created a 12-minute piece called ``New
Dance,'' which American Indian Dance Theater performed for the
first time earlier this month at the Pillow's leafy campus in
Becket, Mass. Jennifer Dunning, writing in The New York Times,
called it ``a shimmering little jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dance barely made it to the stage, and a close look at
how it evolved offers a cautionary tale about leaping into creative
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of collaborations look terrific on paper, but for myriad
reasons they don't work out once you get inside the studio,'' said
Pablo Martinez, vice president for programs at Meet the Composer,
which awarded $830,000 this year for 18 collaborations by composers
and choreographers and nine partnerships between artists of
different nationalities. ``I often say, only half jokingly, that
someone should write a book called `Commissioning for Dummies.'
It's crucial to sit down early on and lay out the parameters very
clearly. If you don't, it's a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Dean had few substantive talks with
American Indian Dance Theater's artistic director, Hanay Geiogamah,
or its producer, Barbara Schwei, before joining the troupe in early
July for a weeklong residency at the National Arts Center in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mild northern air, tensions mounted steadily as
Geiogamah and Ms. Dean realized how differently they viewed the
conception, creation, casting and cost of the commissioned dance.
Each day passed like the one before, with Geiogamah drilling his
dancers for nightly performances, Ms. Dean waiting anxiously in the
lobby for rehearsal time and Ms. Schwei hustling about doing damage
control. They have variously characterized the situation as a
``creative frisson,'' a ``soap opera'' and that ``brouhaha in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The troupe, whose 19 members represent a dozen North American
tribes, had never performed a dance by a non-Indian. Yet there was
no indication that the discord stemmed from ethnic differences.
Instead, some dancers pointed to the disparate worlds of dance and
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dean, 52, who made her mark in the 1970s by stripping dance
to a set of elemental gestures and patterns, regards movement as an
end in itself. Geiogamah, 53, a playwright and professor of
literature, film and Indian studies at UCLA, sees it as part of a
larger dramatic whole. (Ms. Schwei, a white producer who founded
the company with Geiogamah, cut her teeth in music and theater.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dean had arrived in Ottawa with plans for an ensemble piece
for eight dancers and two musicians. Over hotel coffee one morning,
she explained: ``My wish is to take some of that movement from the
powwow dancing and spend time with the dancers pushing it out,
experimenting with it. But that takes time. Generally I need six
hours in the studio to make one minute of a dance.''
</P>
<P>
   While that might sound slow, she knows what works. ``I'm now
making my eighth piece for the Joffrey Ballet,'' said the
choreographer, whose exultant opening sequence for ``Billboards,''
a blockbuster set to 14 songs by the artist then known as Prince,
helped the Joffrey out of a difficult financial situation in 1993.
``I've made seven for the Ohio Ballet. And I'm the only American
choreographer to be invited back by the Royal Danish Ballet. I know
how to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Later she spoke of her work with American Indian Dance Theater.
``This isn't a collaboration. It's a commission, and that's
supposed to give me some independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiogamah had other ideas. A member of the Kiowa and Delaware
tribes from Oklahoma, he was creating an ambitious new piece called
``Kotuwokan,'' which means ``come celebrate the dance'' in
Algonquin. Essentially it's a story ballet about a young Indian's
journey to find his place in the modern world. ``We can't keep
doing only the social dances,'' he said while sitting by the Rideau
Canal in Ottawa. ``What we're doing here is dramatizing the
mythological back story that's been assumed by our Indian
audiences, and missed by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiogamah envisioned folding Ms. Dean's work into his two-hour
production. As a dance within a dance, it would symbolize the young
Indian's arrival at a new form of dance expression. Ms. Dean, while
adamant that ``I don't do dance theater,'' nevertheless agreed. But
after five days in Ottawa, she had spent only seven hours in
rehearsal, some of it doctoring other scenes at the director's
request. She flew home to Bahama, N.C., a day early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply didn't have enough rehearsal time,'' Geiogamah said
later that day. ``I didn't understand Laura's requirements as
clearly as I do now. I've never worked with her before, never seen
her methodologies, her style of rehearsing, her way of working with
the dancers. I respect it, but unfortunately, time is a luxury we
don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura's a person of pure dance, and in her mind that has
exquisitely defined and refined requirements,'' he added. ``I'm a
compromiser, a pragmatic compromiser. I do what has to be done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Few productions are free from backstage drama. What makes this
one worth airing is the extent to which it intruded on the creative
process. Last year the choreographer Blondell Cummings came equally
close to abandoning a collaboration with Philadanco and the singer
Oumou Sangare of Mali. Yet she persisted, and Philadanco performed
her dance, ``100 Percent Cotton/Natural Fiber,'' at the Joyce
Theater in New York last June to favorable reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the working process was horrendous,'' recalled Joan Myers
Brown, Philadanco's artistic and executive director. ``We were
screaming. She was screaming. It turned out to be a good piece, but
it probably would have been a great piece if a spirit of trust had
been there from the start. You've really got to have a lot of talk
up front to make sure you don't have different assumptions about
what you're making, and how you're going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Dean, Ms. Cummings said getting enough creative time
with the dancers was a major sticking point. ``Most repertory
companies are used to people coming in with the steps set up and
just teaching the dance,'' she said. ``But I worked with Meredith
Monk and I come out of that process. I read things to the dancers
so they can share some of my passions and understand where the work
is coming from. It takes a lot of time, and I don't think Joan
always understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who provided the financing for that collaboration on
behalf of Meet the Composer, questioned whether such stormy
ventures are worthwhile in the end. ``How terrible to have to make
work in such an environment,'' he mused. ``And then you have to
wonder whether the people involved will learn anything from the
experience, or just walk away from it with a bad taste in their
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling out details early on might ward off a lot of bitterness
and frustration, but there are limits to how much scripting truly
creative partnerships can withstand. With that in mind, Ms.
Cummings suggested that artists should also have access to a
third-party mediator for times when tempers flare.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, that's essentially how Ms. Dean's stand-off with
Geiogamah and Ms. Schwei was ultimately resolved. Eddie Swimmer, a
champion hoop dancer who has performed with the company since 1987,
stepped forward in Ottawa with a new plan.
</P>
<P>
   Placing a few phone calls to Cherokee, N.C., in the foothills of
the Smoky Mountains where he directs the ceremonial grounds, he
lined up free rehearsal space and lodging. A few weeks later, the
company flew in some dancers, the choreographer drove there and
hired a local musician, and the dance was finally made.
</P>
<P>
   With only four dancers and four days, Ms. Dean scaled down her
original concept, creating a short string of solos and an ensemble
sequence that echoed traditional Indian dances. Wearing just a few
ribbons and feathers over plain black clothes, the dancers revealed
the mechanics of the tribal dances and presented them as a new
modern aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   A few problems linger. As the company prepares to tour
``Kotuwokan'' in California this fall, Ms. Dean and Ms. Schwei
disagree about the rights to ``New Dance.'' In addition, Michael
Greyeyes, a Cree choreographer and actor who left the ``Kotuwokan''
project last winter because of film commitments, is in a dispute
with the company over authorship and fees. And several dancers say
they plan to move on, partly because of frustration with
last-minute scheduling and bounced paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to the unexpected has long been a strength of American
Indian culture. Dawn Russell, a 21-year-old Cherokee from
Tennessee, gave an example that relates to fancy-shawl dancing, a
style Indian women have developed in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to clubs, sometimes I'll catch myself doing a
fancy-shawl step to modern urban music,'' she said. ``And sometimes
I'll take a step I learned at a club and work it into my
fancy-shawl routine. We do that with life every day. We take a
little bit from both worlds and combine it to survive.''

 Wells Pledges $15 Billion to Community   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wells Fargo has pledged to lend $15 billion to lower-income and
minority customers and communities in California over the next
three years as part of its bid to win approval of its pending
merger with Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a letter to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
Wells chief executive Paul Hazen committed $8 billion in
small-business loans, $3.5 billion in community development loans
and $2.5 billion in mortgage loans to low-income and minority
homebuyers. It also pledged $1 billion in auto, student and other
loans to low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment is far smaller than the $350 billion community
reinvestment promise BankAmerica and NationsBank made after
announcing their merger plans. But that pledge was for 10 years,
not three, and will be spread over the banks' combined 22-state
operating territory, not just California.
</P>
<P>
   Several consumer groups voiced greater support yesterday for
Wells Fargo's more targeted and more specific commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the last few years that someone has
recognized the importance of California and made a commitment
specifically to this state,'' said Alan Fisher, executive director
of the California Reinvestment Committee, a coalition of about 200
nonprofit groups. ``For that, Wells should receive an A-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's previous community reinvestment commitment in
January 1996 totaled $45 billion, but that was spread over 10 years
and 10 states. California's share was about $3 billion a year
instead of $5 billion under the new pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells Fargo is also very specific in all the ways
NationsBank/BofA didn't want to be,'' said Robert Gnaizda, policy
director for the Greenlining Institute, a San Francisco consumer
group. ``For the first time, Wells set a goal of making a minimum
of 35 percent of mortgage loans to minority homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnaizda also applauds Wells Fargo's new $100 million charitable
contribution and community investment pledge to California over
three years because ``it all will go to low-income economic
development _ the barrio, not the ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank also said it would try to open more branches and ATM
machines in grocery stores in low-income communities. It said it is
committed to having its officers and managers (now 29 percent
minorities and 60 percent women) reflect the diversity of the areas
it serves. And Wells reconfirmed that its 10-year goal is to buy 40
percent of its business supplies from minority-, women-and
disabled-owned companies. Today, the figure is 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual, the Seattle thrift that has acquired a string
of the largest California savings &AMP; loans, also has received high
marks from community groups for pledging to be the leading mortgage
lender to minorities in all its markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo and Norwest are expected to make additional
Community Reinvestment Act commitments to some of the other states
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   The United Steelworkers of America says Wells Fargo's community
reinvestment record is dismal in a study released last week titled
``Shortchanging Our Neighborhoods.'' But the union is hardly
impartial since it is engaged in a bitter strike against Wells'
corporate banking customer Oregon Steel and has demanded that the
bank stop financing the company.

 Dell Leading a Charmed Life   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Can anything or anybody stop Dell Computer?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not likely, at least for the immediate future, say industry
experts who are as agape as the rest of us over Dell's phenomenal
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Round Rock, Texas, company surged $4.88 yesterday
to close at a new high of $124. That's twice as high as it was in
late March and _ get this _ 12 times higher than it was less than
two years ago, toward the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dell has maintained its steady climb despite recent
travails of other technology stocks and the Dow Jones industrial
average, which has fallen 2.4 percent in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dell's stock is 300 times higher than it was when the company
went public in 1988, factoring in six stock splits over the past
six years. That means an original investment of $10,000 now would
be worth $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's runaway success testifies to the efficiency of its
direct-sales approach, which competitors like Compaq, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard are trying to replicate in a limited way. &UR;  &LR; While
those companies must deal with distributors and retailers, Dell
sells its PCs over the phone and the Internet to consumers and
corporations. (Internet sales are up to $6 million a day.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken the high ground by maintaining the most
efficient manufacturing and delivery method in the business, and
with top-quality in customer satisfaction,'' said analyst Rob
Enderle of Giga Information Group. ``They're going to have to
stumble for somebody to move against them. They're the fastest
runner on the track, and they're already ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Dell moved into a virtual tie with Compaq
for the lead in U.S. PC shipments. Were it not for Compaq's recent
merger with Digital Equipment, which brought it Digital's PC
business, Dell would have taken over first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq is still struggling through the merger and is dealing
with an older delivery model as well as with problems of quality
and customer satisfaction,'' Enderle said. He thinks that Compaq
could be considered in a turnaround phase because of the myriad
problems it faces.
</P>
<P>
   Although Compaq, IBM and HP have suffered earnings
disappointments in recent quarters, Dell has continued to rattle
off increases of more than 50 percent. Last week, it reported
second-quarter profits of $346 million, a 72-percent gain over the
previous year. Revenues, which have set records for 18 straight
quarters, were $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The runaway success has turned founder Michael Dell into one of
the richest people in the country. He holds about 16 percent of
Dell's stock, which is worth about $12.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 33-year-old college dropout who started the
business in his dorm room at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The direct-sales approach that Dell pioneered has proven to have
major advantages over traditional methods
</P>
<P>
   _Because Dell builds computers as they're ordered, there's no
need to keep a big inventory of parts or already assembled PCs.
</P>
<P>
   _Dell can incorporate the latest chips and other new technology
as soon as it comes out, without having to worry about selling PCs
that already are on the shelves (because there are no shelves).
</P>
<P>
   _The company doesn't have to contend with returns from dealers.
</P>
<P>
   _Because there are no middlemen, there's no extra markup. Dell
can afford to sell its products for less than competitors who deal
with the distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
   All of Dell's rivals have been experimenting with ways to build
PCs to order and to embrace direct sales. But at the same time,
they can't abandon distributors, who provide installation and
technical service that the PC-makers aren't equipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell will continue to roll until Compaq, HP and IBM take some
very bold steps to combine the direct and indirect channels,'' said
analyst Scott Miller of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has proven especially fortuitous for Dell, blending
seamlessly with its way of doing business. Not only has it opened
up a new channel for sales, it also has given the company a neat
way to foster and maintain relationships with major corporate
customers. In fact, Dell custom-designs Web sites for companies so
that they can get fast access to information about products and
services they regularly buy.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Dell, alone among major manufacturers, has been
able to resist dipping into the market for sub-$1,000 consumer PCs.
The reason is that the company has business coming out of its ears
in corporate PCs, workstations and servers, all of which fetch far
higher prices than entry-level home systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have more opportunities than we can accommodate,''
said spokesman T.R. Reid. So do you chase business in the
thousand-dollar space or in the server category?''
</P>
<P>
   If Dell has a weakness, Miller says, it's the international
market, where direct sales aren't as popular as in the United
States.

   ``The only thing I would ask of the company is greater
international presence, and I think that may be a tough nut to
crack,'' he said. ``It's not that the direct model doesn't work
outside the United States, it's just that it doesn't work quite as
well.''

 Oracle Has Big Plans Online   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison has seen the company's future
_ and it is on the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The database giant's chairman yesterday unveiled Oracle Online,
a plan to allow customers to lease Oracle programs and space on its
computers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the plan is key to its battle to challenge
Microsoft's dominance of the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's future is based on the idea of Windows
everywhere,'' Ellison said at a press conference &UR; .  &LR; ``We think that
will never happen. We think it will be the Web everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, the world's second-largest software company, is trying
to shift more computing from the desktop to the Web, which Ellison
says is cheaper, easier to manage and more efficient for customers.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Oracle is readying new versions of its
database software and its application server that are able to
handle the traffic and demands of Web computing.
</P>
<P>
   With Web-based computing such as the Oracle Online scheme,
applications would be debugged, upgraded and maintained on a
central server instead of on each personal computer, and users
would access them using a Web browser, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a massive paradigm shift,'' Ellison said.
``We're betting very heavily that's how the world will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft responded yesterday by chiding Ellison for
``apparently being consumed with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile we remain entirely focused on our customers, and
we'll see who builds the best technology,'' said Greg Shaw, a
spokesman for the Redmond, Wash., software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Oracle expects to introduce Oracle Online soon, but
he did not specify an exact date. Oracle Online is aimed at small-
and medium-size businesses that would otherwise have to buy
expensive hardware and set up complex computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not have to install software. All you would have to
do is log onto Oracle Online, and we'd do it all for you,'' Ellison
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his typically ebullient style, the 54-year-old executive
detailed ways other companies could customize Oracle Online. One
example would be a ``Yahoolike service'' for doctors, in which
physicians log onto a secure Web site containing such data as
patient records, billing information and pharmaceutical
information. Doctors could go to the same site to use a software
program that would do their accounting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors want to figure out how Windows NT works. They want to
figure out how your body works,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Oracle Online service would be an industry
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My jaw was on the ground. I haven't seen anything like it,''
said Juliana Nelson, an analyst at International Data Corp. in
Mountain View. She said the success of Oracle Online will depend on
its pricing, which wasn't divulged yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson called Ellison's focus on Web computing ``dead on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry was saying they're making a bet (on Web computing). I
don't think it's a bet. It's happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Web computing ``is the best possible positioning for them to
assume in their battle with Microsoft,'' said Merv Adrian, an
analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's event at Oracle headquarters was designed to show
off the newest version of its application server, a crucial piece
of the company's Internet strategy. The program acts as a
go-between that makes it easy for users to pull database
information and programs off of a central server. Oracle said its
Application Server 4.0 can handle 10 times more data and 10 times
more users than previous versions.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle 8i, the newest version of Oracle's database, is due out
by Christmas, said Mark Jarvis, senior vice president of worldwide
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The database, Oracle's first to adopt the popular Java
programming language, is designed to ``do everything to set up
electronic commerce,'' Jarvis said.

 The Credibility of Sell-Side Financial Experts Is Swiftly Fading   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The credibility of sell-side analysts is declining nearly as
rapidly as that of journalists.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And if you take a look at the story behind Vivus, the Menlo Park
maker of the impotence treatment Muse, it's not so difficult to
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Vivus management announced that it had hired
investment bank CS First Boston to help peddle all or various parts
of the devalued medical device firm. (Another option includes
finding able marketing partners.)
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a company hangs out a ``for sale'' sign, it is quite
often an act of acute desperation. In fact, investors think so
little of Vivus and Muse that the announcement didn't even move the
stock, despite the fact that prospects of a buyout usually give
shares a boost.
</P>
<P>
   But not with Vivus. It stayed flat at $4.75, which is still
$1.65 higher than the company's book value of $3.10.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't investors bite?
</P>
<P>
   Because they've heard Vivus' embellished story too many times
and they no longer believe it. It was a stock whose price soared as
high as $40.56 (adjusted for a split), thanks largely to the
boosterish antics of some overzealous sell-side analysts, who work
for brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bull in the ring was Cruttenden Roth financial
analyst Wole Fayemi, who a year ago pounded the table insisting
that the stock would hit $125. And that was before Pfizer's Viagra
drug hit the market, which of course has become a huge success.
(And a catalyst to more water cooler jokes than the O.J. Simpson
trial).
</P>
<P>
   Fayemi aggressively touted Vivus' alleged clinical strengths
versus those of Viagra. And he adamantly defended Vivus management,
which at times seemed to contradict itself, fund managers say. He
even apologized for the company's troubles in getting Food and Drug
Administration approval for a production plant.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Fayemi was among the first to call journalists with
documented disclosures about deaths associated with Viagra's
clinical trials. If nothing, Fayemi has been a loyal bull to the
end. As of yesterday, he maintained a ``strong buy''
recommendation, according to Bloomberg. Neither Fayemi nor Vivus
chief executive Leland Wilson returned calls.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the stock simply wasn't real. Buy-side
analysts (who work for companies that buy stocks such as mutual and
hedge funds) say they've talked to doctors who made it clear that
they were not inclined to prescribe Vivus.
</P>
<P>
   Vivus' demise ``has been a long time in coming,'' says one
buy-side analyst who specializes in medical stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Vivus was early to market with its impotency drug and device (a
pill that is injected into the urethra). But longtime bears of the
company say it never possessed the fundamentals to justify the
price it once fetched.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Muse is effective on about 25 to 40 percent of
patients, bears say.
</P>
<P>
   It is expensive, about $23 a dose. And it is invasive. Not a
good combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people listen to the Wall Street hype. But with
medical device stocks, the truth lies with the opinions of the
clinicians,'' a buy-side analyst says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much attention has been paid recently to sell-side
analysts' changing roles and how they are pressured to publish
optimistic research to aid the corporate finance side of their
investment houses. Yet there are still plenty of analysts who stick
to the numbers and who are beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as with any group dynamic, a few bad apples can
spoil the whole barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Off the Grill
</P>
<P>
   Looks like comedian Jeff Foxworthy has done his first buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the company in which he holds a 25 percent stake
has. As part of its growth-through-acquisition strategy, Asheville,
N.C.'s Redneck Foods has bought one of the South's larger barbecue
chains: Woody's B-B-Q of Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Redneck chief executive (gosh that title has an ominous ring to
it) David Womick says the deal includes 33 outlets and is the first
major step toward building a national chain of barbecue restaurants
bearing Foxworthy's name. The transaction is a cash and stock deal
valued at around $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As discussed in the Independence Day Barbecue edition of Street
Smarts, the concept may have promise. Foxworthy is popular
throughout the South and Midwest, and if the chain is rolled out
properly it could succeed. The prototype restaurant and its
award-winning sauces (the key to any respectable 'que) have
received positive reviews, but there are plenty of reasons to wave
the yellow flag (as they say on the race car circuit in Bubbaland).
</P>
<P>
   Redneck is a bulletin board stock, which means it's not listed
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. What's more, Womick plans to expand the
company through acquisition, which allows for faster expansion but
makes it more difficult to maintain consistent quality, service and
ambience.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Redneck is launching two concepts
simultaneously: fast-food restaurants and more upscale steak
houses. And most restaurant analysts agree that trying to launch a
nationwide chain is difficult enough without trying to do two
things at once.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the core concept has gained a lot of buzz, and
Foxworthy's name gives this company national brand potential.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Womick is doing just what he said he would do back
in July: He's gobbling up some regional barbecue chains. So give
him credit for sticking to his strategic menu.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, it's worth watching for signs of a secondary offering
by a known underwriter. The IPO was launched by a regional boutique
firm. A secondary could increase the float and give the stock more
credibility. After all, Redneck shares have been trading sideways
at around $3 a share.

   The Financial Women's Association of San Francisco, which has a
penchant for taking hammers to glass ceilings, has landed one of
the top securities exchange officials in the nation to address its
annual confab. New York Stock Exchange Executive Vice President
Catherine R. Kinney will regale attendees at the group's Financial
Woman of the Year luncheon slated for September 16th. And this
year's guest of honor? Stanford University Chief Financial Officer
Mariann Byerwalter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The order came about 8:15 a.m. for about 100
people sleeping in the gymnasium at South Brunswick High School. Up
and out.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that Hurricane Bonnie's heavy winds would damage the
gymnasium's roof, shelter workers ordered people into the school's
hot, cramped hallways, where the sweating began. Shortly after
that, with the wind speed more than 75 mph, the rest of the
shelter's 462 refugees were ordered to move. By 9:30, bodies
covered every inch of the school's floor, and the agitation level
was high.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they tell us to stay, then they tell us to leave,''
grumbled one older man. If only these people had known about
Brunswick County's best-kept hurricane secret.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Jones/Byrd Clubhouse at Sea Trail Plantation,
Executive Chef Mike Kolcum served pastries, coffee and juice to
about 250 evacuees from western Brunswick County.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse, part of a 2,000-acre subdivision and golf course
near the South Carolina state line, was welcoming anyone who needed
shelter, but it advertised only by word of mouth. Sandwiches, beef
stew, chicken and dumplings were prepared for lunchtime, when the
eye of the hurricane was forecast to arrive in Brunswick County.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay calm,'' said Kolcum, the chef who nourished
Trail Creek through two hurricanes in 1996. ``If I panic, everyone
panics.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bonnie veered west toward Brunswick at 1 a.m. Wednesday,
the Sunset Beach police and fire departments retreated to the
clubhouse, setting up a radio and television in the kitchen.
Perched on a mound excavated from golf-course ponds, the clubhouse
sits on the highest ground for miles around.
</P>
<P>
   On the porch, ceiling fans spun through hurricane-force winds.
Inside the clubhouse, the golf pro shop sold a sweatshirt and
windbreaker to people chilled by the air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete basement was reserved for pets and their owners.
Dijon, a bichon frise lap dog with curly white fur, and Gail
Roberson, a consignment boutique owner, watched the first curtains
of rain fall as the basement garage doors lowered against the
tropical-storm-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the public shelters on TV, and it looks like they
are confined to a small area,'' Roberson said. ``Here, we can walk
around.'' Roberson brought a television, radio, dog cage and lawn
chairs to the shelter. People without chairs lounged in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, sleeping bags stretched across the purple paisley
carpet, while retirees played scrabble on white table cloths and
watched television newscasts from Wilmington and Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Elouise McCoy, 11, watched the storm through a window with 17
family members who fled their mobile homes on the mainland near
Ocean Isle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Trail Resort general manager Barry Brooks promised to move
the crowd to the windowless basement if the storm reached Class-4
status. If necessary, the kitchen had 450 cases of Gatorade in
stock. And in case refrigeration quit, it had plenty of ice on hand
for its $40,000 worth of perishable food.

SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE DISMISS LONE CLAIM IN FATAL RESTAURANT
BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: ATTACK-U.S., ATTACK-SUDAN, ATTACK-CAMPS,

 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ The government Wednesday invited the
FBI to join its inquiry into Tuesday's explosion at a Planet
Hollywood restaurant here that killed one man and wounded 26
people.
</P>
<P>
   A special agent assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria arrived
Wednesday morning, and two bomb experts who had been investigating
the larger and more devastating explosions at the embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania are expected early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of Safety and Security, Sidney Mufamadi, said
detectives were following ``some firm leads'' and implied there
might be arrests soon. He declined to give any details.
</P>
<P>
   The only claim of responsibility for the bombing came from a
caller who said he represented an anti-American, anti-Israeli group
called Muslims Against Global Oppression. But a leader of the group
dismissed the claim, saying it was an attempt to discredit Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was invited not so much to assist local investigators,
the police said, but to see if there are any links between the
Planet Hollywood bombing and others against American institutions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a long history of bombings in this country, so we've
developed our bomb squads to quite a high ability,'' said police
Capt. Rod Beer. ``But we want to cooperate with the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was increased here not only at American consular
offices but also at other symbols of America, including the
country's 45 McDonald's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The police made it clear that they did not think there were any
obvious links to the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, where 12
Americans and about 250 Africans died. The United States has blamed
those powerful truck bombs on a worldwide terrorist network
supposedly run by a Saudi living in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb here, apparently left on the floor in front of the
restaurant's shimmery blue-tiled bar, was much smaller and left a
gunpowder smell in the air. It seemed similar to pipe bombs used in
warfare between drug gangs and anti-crime groups led by Muslim
clerics in the mixed-race Cape Flats neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   No Americans were hurt. ``They should realize Americans don't
come to South Africa to go to Planet Hollywood,'' a policeman on
the scene said. ``They could go in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the wounded are British, police said, one is Argentine
and the rest are South African. The dead man, a 50-year-old South
African, Fanie Schoeman, and some of the worst wounded were
employees of a local bank who were holding a going-away party for a
colleague moving to England.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seriously wounded are an 8-year-old British girl,
Laura Giddings, whose foot was blown off, and her 3-year-old
brother, Jacob, who had serious spinal injuries. A witness said,
``It looked like someone just took an ice cream scoop out of the
little boy's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Who claimed to have set off the bomb remained murky Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, a radio reporter said she got a call on her
personal cellular phone from a man identifying himself as Jihad
al-Haq and saying his organization, Muslims Against Global
Oppression, was responsible. Wednesday, representatives of the
small group repeatedly denied responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unreservedly condemn the attack,'' one spokesman for the
group said. ``We don't have anyone named Jihad al-Haq in our
organization as far as I know, and we sympathize with the
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   About half a million South Africans, slightly more than 1
percent of the population, are Muslims.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a 5 p.m. talk show on Muslim community radio, callers who
identified themselves as members of the group suggested a possible
scenario: Several days ago the group received permission to march
on the American Consulate here on Saturday to ``show the world how
disgusted Muslims are with the U.S.'' for the cruise missile
attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan. One caller said the bomb might
have been ``a means to divert people'' from the march.
</P>
<P>
   Another caller said the bomb could have been the work of ``drug
barons and gangsters to exploit anger against Muslims.''
Alternatively, he suggested, it could have been the work of
Zionists, or of ``the U.S. security apparatus, which would allow
the FBI to establish a foothold in southern Africa and control
intelligence gathering here.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were careful to blame no one. ``We don't want to
point our finger at Muslims and it turns out to be a right-winger
or an employee with a grudge,'' Beer said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for President Nelson Mandela, Parks Mankahlana, said
religion was not the issue, adding: ``It doesn't matter to this
government if they are Christians or Muslims or Satanists. They
deserve to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African Broadcasting Corporation said Wednesday night
that it had a tape of a suspect but would not broadcast it for fear
of jeopardizing the investigation. Local newspapers said videotapes
had been retrieved from security cameras inside the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The front of Planet Hollywood was blocked Wednesday in
six-foot-high rolls of barbed wire to keep the curious back. Many
wreathes had been left, and 10 bunches of roses and carnations were
left hanging on razor wire by the Interreligious Committee on Crime
and Violence in the Western Cape, a group of prominent imams,
sheikhs, priests, rabbis and Hindu, Bahai and African clerics who
jointly criticized the bombing and said they would ask their
congregations to cooperate with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The normally bustling waterfront tourist area was sudued
Wednesday afternoon. Restaurants that usually turn people away had
empty tables. The Pick &AMP; Pay supermarket, patronized by locals, was
busy, but tourist shops' clerks slumped glumly behind counters.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Fick, a waitress at Delectable Deluxe Donuts, was eating
a grilled cheese sandwich, which she said was the first food she
had been able to eat since the explosion 20 hours earlier. She had
been waiting for a bus home just across from Planet Hollywood when
the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lady screaming, `I can't see! I can't feel my
face!''' she said. ``They carried out a lady with her foot off. I
was shocked. I just started crying and walked away. They had to
give me sugar water at the medic station, I was so upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Police identified one local hero as Marcus Dudley, a chef at the
Victoria &AMP; Alfred Hotel restaurant, who was returning home from
work when the bomb went off and was one of the first to rush into
the smoking nightclub to drag the wounded out. He gave first aid,
helped reunite families and even ripped a limb off a plaza tree to
splint a man's leg.

DELAY URGES COLLEAGUES TO VOTE TO RELEASE STARR REPORT TO PUBLIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay began organizing
support Wednesday for public disclosure of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report on the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a Texas Republican who has called for President Clinton
to resign, broke ranks with some House GOP leaders and urged his
colleagues to vote to release Starr's report once it reaches the
House, probably in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner the facts are released, the sooner we can put this
whole thing behind us,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry Hyde had hoped to amend House rules so Starr's report could
be kept under wraps until a decision is made on whether to begin an
impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   House rules require committees to provide all House members and
the public access to material under consideration by the panels,
and DeLay wants the rules to remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full public disclosure will ensure that the media, the
Congress and the public will all have accurate information,'' DeLay
said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said Delay ``would be wise to listen to his speaker and chairman
Hyde. The American people would not respond well to yet another
effort to politicize a matter they want put behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law that governs the Office of Independent Counsel,
Starr is required to report to Congress if he finds ``any
substantial and credible information ... that may constitute
grounds for an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's staff is in the process of drafting a detailed report of
findings from a seven-month inquiry in the president's affair with
Lewinsky and alleged efforts to keep the relationship secret.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who denied the affair in a sworn deposition in January,
testified before the grand jury 10 days ago, then went on national
television to admit to misleading the public for the past seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   The president insisted his answers to questions in the
depositions were ``legally accurate'' and did not constitute
perjury. He also said he never asked anyone to lie or destroy
evidence, which would amount to obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been investigating whether the president or his
associates tried to silence Lewinsky by helping her find a job in
New York or tried to help her avoid a subpoena in the Jones case by
retrieving his gifts from her.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence expected to earn a mention in Starr's report are the
gifts as well as tapes of Lewinsky gossiping in lurid detail about
her affair with Clinton and a dress allegedly stained during a
White House tryst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people read his report, they'll want to throw up,''
according to an unnamed source quoted by Newsweek magazine. Some
people will be ``deeply offended by some of the kinkier details,''
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's team of prosecutors has been examining whether Clinton
lied under oath in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and
tried to hinder the lawsuit and subsequent criminal investigation
by concealing the nature of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich over the weekend said the threshold for impeaching a
president should be higher than lying about a relationship with a
woman half his age. Instead of ``a single human mistake,'' the
president would have to display ``a pattern of felonies'' for
impeachment to be warranted, Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican also urged Starr not to limit his report
to the Lewinsky affair, but to include his findings from the
four-year investigation of Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas,
the misuse of FBI files and the dismissal of the White House travel
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Congress could move forward only on
Lewinsky, unless (Starr) had such a clear case, such an
overpowering case,'' Gingrich said. ``But I think we would be
better-served to know the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hyde, R-Ill., has instructed his staff to draft a
resolution for handling Starr's report once the leadership receives
word that he is prepared to ship it to the House, where an
impeachment inquiry would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic staff members are drafting resolutions
for the House to consider that would limit the availability of
Starr's report, once it is delivered, to members of Hyde's
committee and several key staff members.
</P>
<P>
   The committee members and staff investigators (a 14-member team
appointed by Republicans and a four-member team appointed by the
Democrats) would conduct an initial review behind closed doors of
Starr's report to determine whether a formal inquiry should be
held. &QL;

AFTER YEARS OF TRANQUIL AFFLUENCE, BRUNEI NOW HAS TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei _ Beneath a canopy of crystal
chandeliers in a dazzling throne room here earlier this month, a
gentle-looking young prince in a golden tunic was handed a
jewel-encrusted dagger and proclaimed heir to the Islamic Sultanate
of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   Royal succession is a serious business in this secluded,
oil-rich country on the northern coast of Borneo, where Sultan Muda
Hassanal Bolkiah has ruled with absolute authority since Brunei
gained independence from Britain in 1984. And never more so than
now, when the sultan is battling both a bitter family feud and a
free fall in oil prices, which has thrown the fief into a financial
bind.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning of the sultan's eldest son, the 24-year-old Prince
Al-Muhtadee Billah, was a suitably solemn affair _ steeped in six
centuries of Malay tradition that gave it an almost otherworldly
aura.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been praying for this day,'' a young woman said after
the Aug. 10 ceremony as the prince was drawn through the capital in
a gold-and-white chariot. Like most of Brunei's 305,000 people, she
regards the royal family with a reverence verging on awe. Thanks to
the richest oil reserves in Southeast Asia, the sultan has
transformed his country into an enclave of docile affluence.
</P>
<P>
   But the investiture of Prince Billah comes at a time of rising
turmoil in this normally peaceful country, although it is still
relatively unscathed by the Asian economic crisis swirling around
it. The sultan recently stripped his younger brother, Prince Jefri
Bolkiah, of his posts as head of Brunei's state investment agency
and its largest conglomerate, reflecting allegations that the
Prince squandered billions on bad investments and a profligate life
style.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sultan has come under scrutiny for living like Croesus
while a decline in oil prices drains Brunei's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Building a 1,788-room palace with air-conditioned stables and
hiring Michael Jackson to perform at his 50th birthday party was
fine as long as oil sales were pumping nearly $2 billion a year
into Brunei's coffers. But with oil prices down one-third since
January, Brunei has already lost about $400 million, or 20 percent
of its revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant oil producer, Brunei Shell Petroleum, a unit of the
Royal/Dutch Shell Group, is sending home expatriate workers, while
local merchants are feeling the pinch as shoppers flock to
neighboring Malaysia to buy cheaper goods. Analysts say Brunei is
experiencing something new in its well-lubricated history: a
cash-flow squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   That squeeze may force the country to cut back on entitlement
programs that earned it the nickname ``Shellfare state.'' At
$25,200, Brunei's citizens already have the highest per capita
income in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the government still doles out free health care and
education _ not to mention subsidized rent and interest-free loans
for civil servants to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate in our history because we've never had to
prioritize,'' said Deputy Finance Minister Selamat Munap. ``We've
been able to take care of our children, our sick, our elderly.
Perhaps we will have to be more rigorous in our standards for
government spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Selamat delicately avoids mentioning the royal family, which has
taken care of itself best of all. But diplomats here say the sultan
now recognizes that his relatives must curb their lavish ways. The
sultan, they say, is particularly angry with Prince Jefri, who set
off on an epic spending spree in the early 1990s, buying luxury
hotels from Paris and London to New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a dawning appreciation that they were getting ahead
of their earnings,'' said one Western diplomat, who, like almost
everybody here, insisted on anonymity out of fear of offending the
sultan.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the rift in the royal family became clear when
Prince Jefri stayed away from Prince Billah's investiture, the most
important ceremony since the sultan's coronation in 1967. Prince
Jefri, who is in self-imposed exile in the United States, issued a
statement that he could not return to Brunei because ``there is
little I can do to oppose the destructive action of reactionary
forces, which are becoming increasingly entrenched at all levels of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Prince Jefri said Islamic fundamentalists from
Libya and Iran were playing an influential role in Brunei's
government _ a contention that the government dismisses as
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the government starting a global investigation of
the prince, and the prince hurling brickbats in response, Brunei is
being dragged out of its velvet-lined obscurity. Before
independence, it had been a British protectorate. Its origins date
to the 13th century, when a prince from western Borneo became the
first sultan of this lush, heavily wooded land.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Brunei's troubles are rooted in its most
fortunate event: the 1929 discovery of oil off the coast. By 1996,
Brunei was pumping 160,000 barrels a day, mostly for export to
Japan. Oil and natural gas now generate 90 percent of the
government's income.

WHITE HOUSE ITSELF IS A VICTIM IN THE CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A house may be an inanimate object, but in the case
of the elegant mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue here, it is a
living symbol of the greatness of the world's most enduring
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   When compared with the massive palaces built by the monarchs of
old, the White House is a modest dwelling. But within its walls
have resided men whose leadership converted a tiny republic of 13
states into the most powerful nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The President's House, designed and built by Irish-born
architect James Hoban, has for 198 years been a silent witness to
events great and small, noble and tawdry, harmonious and violent.
In the current scandal over Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, it is
one of the casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The legend and the promise that have led generations of
Americans to regard residence in the White House as the ultimate
goal have both been tarnished. We may not know the lurid specifics
of the illicit relations engaged in by Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
but we do know that their private conduct desecrated the most
public house in America.
</P>
<P>
   We know also that when people are accorded the singular
privilege of taking up residence in the White House they should be
bound by an obligation not just to enjoy its facilities but to
respect the fact that it is one of democracy's most sacred shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of behavior should exclude extra-marital sexual encounters
in the Oval Office or, as in the case of Warren G. Harding, in a
broom closet adjacent to the Oval Office. They also should exclude
parties at which a president, John F. Kennedy, cavorted in the
swimming pool with bimbos while the first lady was away.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential election of 2000, attention certainly will
be paid to the unsavory Clinton practice of permitting big
contributors to the Democratic Party to spend a night in the
Lincoln bedroom. It also will be paid to the past sexual encounters
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When John Adams moved into the partially finished mansion in
early November 1800 as its first occupant, he wrote a benediction
that should have established a code of conduct for all future
presidents: ``I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this
house and on all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but
honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Adams arrived at the President's House, voters
rejected his bid for a second term, choosing Thomas Jefferson
instead. But the Adams benediction, carved into the fireplace
mantle in the State Dining Room, is as relevant today as it was two
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that not all presidents have been honest and
wise. Long before Clinton's peccadillos caused such a stir, other
presidents lied, entertained illicit-sex partners, sought to
obstruct justice and wielded their executive authority improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Even Adams himself committed a minor, but memorable, breach of
presidential etiquette at the end of his four-month stay in the
White House. Rather than attend the inauguration of his successor,
he left the mansion before dawn on the day of Jefferson's
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other president has engaged in such disrespectful
behavior. In 1829, Adams' son, John Quincy Adams, refused to
witness the swearing in of the man who had defeated him _ Andrew
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The late historian Fawn Brodie claimed that Jefferson, a
widower, shared his White House bed with a slave, Sally Hemmings,
who allegedly gave him several illegitimate children. Other
historians contend that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   As for old Andy Jackson, he was one of the most flamboyant
characters ever elected president. The hero of the Battle of New
Orleans in 1815, he fought duels, killing at least one man, and
exploded in temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   On the his inauguration day, thousands of his supporters, many
of them from what was then the American frontier, crowded into the
White House for a boisterous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion became so filled with jubilant people eating free
food and drinking whiskey-spiked punch that Jackson had to escape
through a window to avoid suffocation. Although dignity was not the
order of the day, the Jackson inaugural provided the common people
an opportunity to savor the pleasures of one of the shrines of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men and women who have lived in the White House have
conducted themselves properly and have respected the historic
grandeur of both the presidency and the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   For years Richard Nixon seemed to be following that example. But
after Watergate and his own deviousness did him in, many Americans
were appalled to learn from his White House tapes that he had often
used gutter language while sitting in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Nixon were very different personalities, but they
shared two traits that Clinton also has: a powerful intellect and a
weak moral core.
</P>
<P>
   Few previous presidents have possessed Clinton's incisive
intelligence, charm and brilliance as a communicator. Few also have
demonstrated such moral and ethical laxity.
</P>
<P>
   Having lied to the grand jury, the American people and his wife
and delivered a miserable, self-serving explanation of his conduct
on television, Clinton is treading on very unstable ground. The
nation probably would well served by his resignation. Then the
presidency and the aura of the White House could receive a
much-needed restoration.

 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei: government's income.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even to people who could not find his country on a map, the
sultan of Brunei became famous as the richest man in the world. It
is a title he only recently ceded to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
Like that of other oil barons, the sultan's net worth declines as
fast as the price of crude.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated fortune that reached $35 billion in the early
1990s, the royal family has enjoyed life on a grand scale. Prince
Jefri, 44, savored it with particular gusto, buying playthings like
a sleek yacht, an Airbus jet, a Sikorsky helicopter and five-star
hotels such as the Plaza Athenee in Paris, the New York Palace and
the Bel Air in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri's ambitions extended beyond shopping. As finance
minister from 1984 to 1996, he built, among other projects, a giant
amusement park, free to visitors. Prince Jefri pursued his ventures
through a web of private companies and government agencies. Amedeo
Development Corp., a private company owned by the prince, built the
amusement park and other projects in Brunei. Amedeo Crown, a Prince
Jefri-owned company listed in the British island of Jersey,
acquired Asprey, the London jeweler, while Prince Jefri family
trusts own the American hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The Brunei Investment Agency, a government operation that the
prince led as chairman, manages investments and owns more hotels,
including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing what happened at these companies is difficult
because their operations are cloaked in secrecy. The reputed
advisers will not even confirm whether they work for Prince Jefri,
the royal family or the government.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with ties to Prince Jefri said that Amedeo and the
Brunei Investment Agency were both audited by the accounting firm
KPMG Peat Marwick. Citibank is said to be their main adviser. Given
the blurry line between the interests of the royal family and those
of the state, these executives said it would be hard for any
outsider to impose strict financial controls.
</P>
<P>
   In July, reports began to surface of huge, undisclosed losses at
both Amedeo and the Brunei Investment Agency. Financial analysts
said the investment agency's assets might have been pledged to buy
hotels. The losses came as an acute embarrassment to the sultan,
who had offered loans to help his ailing neighbors, Thailand and
Indonesia, only to discover that Brunei could not afford them.
</P>
<P>
   So the sultan abruptly stripped Prince Jefri of his jobs at both
organizations and ordered the government to seize Amedeo's assets
in Brunei. The sultan hired auditors from Arthur Andersen in London
to calculate the losses, which some analysts say could reach
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Selamat, the deputy finance minister, declined to comment on
Amedeo's collapse but acknowledged that ``any major corporate
failure is going to have some impact on the economy of Brunei.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri's financial troubles came after another
embarrassing episode, in which Shannon Marketic, a former Miss
U.S.A., accused him and the sultan of trying to turn her into a sex
slave. The lawsuit is pending, though the sultan has sovereign
immunity and Prince Jefri has immunity as a potential heir to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri would seem to have a bleak future in Brunei. But he
contends that because his overseas properties are owned by separate
companies and trusts, he still owns those assets and intends to
keep them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not seek a fight and prefer to be left alone,'' he said
in a statement. ``I shall, however, vigorously defend my position
and interests of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Prince Jefri, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the government was exaggerating the losses at
Amedeo to discredit the prince and destroy his power base within
the country. The government also recently seized three oil
concessions that gave Prince Jefri a steady stream of income.
</P>
<P>
   Now the prince and his advisers are plotting a strategy to hold
on to the remaining properties. Brunei's investigation has set off
alarm bells in Europe and the United States, and Prince Jefri's
lieutenants have had to reassure employees and suppliers that the
hotels and other properties are not about to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri may be finally tightening his belt, too. At Asprey
Group, the venerable but money-losing luxury-goods company he
bought for $388 million in 1995, the Prince is merging the flagship
Asprey with its sister company, Garrard, and selling off
unprofitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that because we have a principal who is a prince, we
can spend whatever our hearts desire, is not true,'' said Ian Dahl,
the chief executive of Asprey in London. ``We run a very
tightfisted company.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri's adviser said he was being hounded by Islamic
militants, including another of the sultan's brothers, Prince
Mohamed. ``This is a classic power struggle between those who favor
a more conservative, religious approach and those who favor a more
open, tolerant approach,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunei has become more straitlaced in recent years. Alcohol is
no longer served in bars or restaurants. But other facts of life
here may have less to do with religion than money. Several
observers said the sultan's largesse had created a politically
satisfied, even sedated, populace. Even people who live in houses
on stilts in Brunei's 500-year-old water village own satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people feel they've gotten a good deal from the sultan,''
said Rex DeSilva, the editor of the Borneo Bulletin, which calls
itself an independent newspaper even though it is controlled by
Prince Mohamed. ``If a ruler can't be popular with all that, who
can?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sultan's biggest challenge may be economic rather
than political. For years, he has promised to wean Brunei from its
reliance on oil by diversifying its economy. Yet the government's
efforts to become a trade and tourism center have come to naught.
Given that Brunei has about 23 years of oil reserves left, that
problem may fall to the sultan's son.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Prince Billah may help overcome some of Brunei's
current ills. Unlike his playboy uncle, Prince Jefri, or even his
father at a younger age, Prince Billah projects a less frivolous
image. Educated at Oxford, Prince Billah is said to be a sober
young man. His idea of indulgence, according to royal propaganda,
is a game of snooker and the tame saxophone music of Kenny G.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MONTERREY, Mexico _ Mexico might be one of the most dynamic
economies in Latin America these days, but it has also turned into
a bewildering place.
 &HT;    Several politicians have broken all the rules by launching
formal or informal presidential campaigns two years before the next
elections. Even though real wages rose for the first time since the
crisis of 1995, Mexicans are wary of putting too much confidence in
their economic future. And a giant crime wave has broken over the
country, spooking everyone from bricklayers to top executives.
 &HT;    Is this progress or chaos? Maybe a little bit of both.
 &HT;    Mexico is still in the middle of a far-reaching transformation
that goes way beyond free trade. The economic opening the country
embarked on a decade ago is changing the way companies do business,
but it is also spilling into the rest of society. The benefits of
increasing economic and political freedom are already apparent to
some, but the process is far from finished.
 &HT;    ``Mexico is going through a collection of simultaneous
transitions, and they contribute to a sense of chaos,'' says
Antonio Alonso Concheiro, director of Analitica Consultores in
Mexico City and one of Mexico's leading futurists. ``That might be
more perception than reality, but these are delicate processes and
we're going to have to work hard to find new arrangements.''
 &HT;    Mexico has always been a land of extremes, of rich and poor,
north and south, educated and uneducated. The picture today is not
entirely black and white, but the current transition has
accentuated the division between the companies that have fashioned
themselves into world class competitors and the ones that are still
stuck in a bygone era.
 &HT;    Underlying that division is a deeper one between people who have
the education, know-how and spark to take advantage of the real
opportunities opening up, and those who are unprepared. With the
political environment far less authoritarian than it once was,
staying on the promising path of free trade and economic
liberalization will depend on how much their benefits are felt by
all Mexicans.
 &HT;    No part of the country illustrates the bright side of the
economy as well as Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, the industrial center two
hours from the U.S. border. People in this proud, dusty city walk
with a Texas swagger and flaunt their business acumen. Even taxi
drivers leave their business cards with visitors.
 &HT;    Regiomontanos, as Monterrey's residents are called, see their
city as a focus of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
stressing their experience in doing business with Texans and the
rest of the United States. Canada just opened a chamber of commerce
there earlier this year. And many Mexican and foreign businessmen
in Nuevo Leon have turned their companies into NAFTA powerhouses,
exporting US$5.5 billion last year.
 &HT;    ``We've seen about a 25 percent increase in calls from U.S.
companies interested in setting up operations in Monterrey, or
exporting their products to the Mexican market,'' says Santiago
Trevino, director of the Monterrey office of the American Chamber
of Commerce. ``We're even starting to see a shortage of labor,
there are jobs that are getting tough to fill.''
 &HT;    Cemex, perhaps Monterrey's best-known company, is the world's
second-largest cement firm that chairman Lorenzo Zambrano has built
into a respected multinational that happens to have a Mexican
address.
 &HT;    Local neighbors such as glassmaker Grupo Vitro and steelmaker
IMSA have also transformed themselves into international players.
 &HT;    Grupo Alfa, an industrial conglomerate, had to be bailed out by
the government in the early 1980's after much of its domestic
business went bust in an earlier crisis. Last year, however, it
exported a quarter of its $3.9 billion in sales. Pulsar, another
conglomerate, has branched out of its traditional packaging and
agricultural businesses to become a world leader in biotechnology.
And more than anywhere else in the country, a culture of
modernization and reorganization is beginning to suffuse the
region's smaller companies, making Monterrey one of the hottest
places to do business.
 &HT;    ``There's a real stress on making improvements in all companies,
everyone is trying to follow the big companies in boosting quality
levels and productivity,'' says Trevino.
 &HT;    Companies elsewhere are doing something similar. Bread-maker
Grupo Industrial Bimbo exports to the United States and the rest of
Latin America, and recently acquired Texas-based Mrs Baird's
Bakeries. Steelmakers have become regional forces, and even some
nimble small and medium-sized companies have joined the parade,
exporting their goods themselves or supplying the giants.
 &HT;    Multinationals are the other ingredient in the success story.
Automobile companies exported nearly one million cars and trucks
last year, and foreign companies as a whole poured a record $12
billion in direct investment into Mexico last year. The lion's
share still comes from the United States, but Asian and European
firms have also rushed to make Mexico their export platform for the
U.S. and Canadian markets, and in some cases for all of Latin
America.
 &HT;    Indeed, the success of the modern industrial economy is such
that infrastructure in Mexico and along the border is straining
under the weight of trade. Freight arriving at the Port of Veracruz
was backed up for a week last spring and summer, despite huge
efficiency improvements. The railroad system is improving and
Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, the company that runs the
Northeast Railroad between Mexico City and the Texas border, has
invested $1 billion in upgrading its business. But its efforts were
stymied last spring by a series of delays on Union Pacific's rails
in Texas, which simply couldn't handle all the traffic from Mexico.
 &HT;    ``Future growth depends on Mexico increasing its exports, and
the key to becoming more competitive is improving our
inrastructure,'' says Cemex's Zambrano. ``This will lower the cost
of getting our goods to other markets, and in the long run will
make the difference between winning and losing market share. We
must either make the necessary improvements within five years or
watch our exports grow less.''
 &HT;    In other parts of the economy, the apparent success of the idea
behind trade liberalization _ that companies will inevitably become
lean competitors _ is only part of the story. Small and
medium-sized companies around much of the country have been left in
the dust.
 &HT;    ``There's a part of the economy that is extraordinarily
competitive, accounting for as much as 60 percent to 70 percent of
industrial output,'' says Luis Rubio, a noted economist who is the
director of Mexico City-based think tank Center of Development
Research. ``But it only accounts for about 20 percent of the jobs.
The other 80 percent is a sea of inefficiency and (unproductivity).
It's as if companies in that sector are living in another age.''
 &HT;    Incorporating more of the smaller companies into export
production chains will be the key test of whether the new Mexico
can benefit more than just a few big businessmen. That is also
important given another kind of dilemma.
 &HT;    To create enough jobs for the one million people joining the
labor force each year, the economy must grow by at least 5 percent
(it grew 7 percent last year, and is expected to grow a bit less
than 5 percent this year).
 &HT;    Once it grows that fast, however, the trade deficit tends to
rise quickly because of high demand for imports, potentially
destabilizing the economy.
 &HT;    That will remain an acute problem until more domestic companies
are efficient enough to meet consumer demand and the needs of
domestic companies.
 &HT;    Since the big exporters only employ a minority of the labor
force, most workers have jobs in stagnant, low-wage firms in the
old industrial economy or the service economy. In the long run,
that could spell trouble for the consumer market, although that is
hardly a concern today.
 &HT;    In fact, the consumer market is back to driving growth this
year. Retail sales posted yearly gains of more than 10 percent
during the first quarter of the year, and could rise as much as 6
percent on the year, according to analysts. Demand for imports,
which plummeted during 1995, has also increased _ consumer goods
imports rose nearly 50 percent during the first four months of the
year, spearheading a nearly 25 percent overall increase.
 &HT;    ``About 20 percent of our goods were imports in 1994, a
proportion that fell to about 6 percent in 1995,'' says Pedro
Mejia, general manager of Soriana, a Monterrey-based supermarket
chain. ``The figure is now about 11 percent, and could go up more.
The main consideration in 1995 and 1996 was price, and we saw many
consumers move away from the brand-name products they used to buy.
Now, they're beginning to move back.''
 &HT;    But the dual nature of the recovery is again apparent. Cars and
durable goods _ mainly purchased by the middle and upper classes _
have made huge advances, but basic goods that everyone buys such as
food and clothing have posted smaller gains. A 1997 study by
polling firm Mori de Mexico showed that 35 percent of Mexicans
expected their own economic situation to improve during the next
year. That was much better than the 20 percent who thought so in
1996, and it was the first time expectations had improved since the
beginning of the crisis. But it was also far below comparable
expectations in countries such as Brazil and Colombia.
 &HT;    One reason for caution is Mexico's recurrent crises, which have
accompanied the end of each president's six-year term since 1976
(the president may not be reelected to two successive terms). The
next election is in July 2000, and it will be the first in memory
that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has a real
chance of losing.
 &HT;    Vicente Fox, the popular governor of the central state of
Guanajuato, has already announced he will compete for the
nomination of the center-right National Action Party (PAN).
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the mayor of Mexico City and the best known
politician in Mexico after President Ernesto Zedillo, is thought to
be planning a run for the center-left Party of the Democratic
Revolution (PRD). And a jumble of PRI politicians are jockeying for
position much more conspicuously than ever before.
 &HT;    Businessmen and economists are already getting nervous.
 &HT;    ``One of Mexico's key challenges is to maintain macroeconomic
stability through the year 2000,'' says Rubio. ``That means
confronting the other challenge, which is to avoid too much
pollution in people's expectations from politics.''
 &HT;    But politics is changing, too. The creaky system of fraud,
patronage and corporatism built during the PRI's seven decades in
power is crumbling. Confidence in the voting process _ and in
Zedillo's apparent eagerness to respect it _ leaped after the
successful midterm election in July last year, which gave
opposition parties a combined majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
 &HT;    As in the economy, however, there is an underside to the
political opening. Just as the more open political environment is
showing a viable alternative to the PRI's traditional dominance,
new social problems are cropping up.
 &HT;    Ancestral shortcomings like low education levels and systemic
corruption have been joined by a new one: the crime wave that has
swept Mexico since 1995. Muggings have become commonplace in Mexico
City, and the U.S. Embassy has repeatedly warned that hailing taxis
on the street is an invitation to be robbed. Violence has become
commonplace in a country where even criminals used to follow
unwritten rules of moderation.
 &HT;    ``It's a monster, and it's a monster we didn't have before,''
says Pete Palmer, a security specialist in Mexico City with U.S.
corporate security firm Kroll-O'Gara Associates. ``Sooner or later,
it's going to have an impact on foreign investment as people will
become unwilling to come down here just because of what they see.''
 &HT;    Mexican companies have already experienced the bittersweet
flavor of radical change, with its high costs for some and rich
opportunities for others. Now, in the willy-nilly process of
finding a new political and balance, the country as a whole is
going through something similar.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHIAPAS: THE NEXT FRONTIER?
 &HT;    MONTERREY _ While companies in northern and central Mexico
strive to join the global economy, much of the poor southeast is
being left behind. A conspicuous example is Chiapas, where the 1994
Zapatista rebellion has polarized part of the state and scared away
much investment. But to hear a few plucky businessmen tell it, the
state is full of business potential.
 &HT;    ``Of all our businesses, I like the ones in Chiapas most,'' says
Alfonso Romo Garza, the chairman of Monterrey-based Pulsar
Internacional, which runs a state-of-the-art biotechnology research
center there. ``Hunger is not solved by laws, and it is necessary
to bring economic development projects to Chiapas.''
 &HT;    To be sure, private sector involvement is no panacea for the
state's ills.
 &HT;    The government and the Zapatistas have dawdled so much in peace
negotiations that some skeptics have questioned the commitment of
both to finding a workable solution for the nearly five-year-old
standoff. But both sides concur that a new political agreement
covering the rights of indigenous people needs to be found.
 &HT;    The ruggedly beautiful state might be Mexico's richest in terms
of natural resources. It supplies more than half of the country's
hydroelectric power, holds a substantial share of oil reserves and
is covered with lush tropical and subtropical forests. Moreover,
experts reckon there are plenty of opportunities to develop
smaller-scale businesses, from non-traditional agriculture to
artisanry to ecological tourism.
 &HT;    In the conflict zone near the stunning city of San Cristobal de
las Casas, some once-poor Indian farmers have already carved out a
profitable niche in organically-grown coffee that finds eager
buyers in the United States and Europe. A co-op of 1,300 farmers
called Indigenous People of the Sierra Madre of Motozintla (Ismam)
now has total assets of US$7 million and credit lines of several
million dollars more, according to Father Jorge Aguilar Reyna, a
local priest who helped establish the association.
 &HT;    Small businessmen in the rest of the state are planting rubber
trees and establishing a shrimp-farming industry. A wheat flour
plant in the Soconusco region, far removed from the conflict zone,
currently imports 80 percent of its wheat from the United States
and Canada _ but figures it could cut costs and promote local jobs
if farmers near San Cristobal would plant more wheat.
 &HT;    Then there is Pulsar's center, which exports everything from
broccoli to cauliflower to melons. Meanwhile, several dozen
scientists at the company's International Center for Agricultural
Research and Training in the town of Frontera Hidalgo are
developing disease-resistant crops and other biotech innovations.
In an interview with Expansion magazine, Romo Garza said private
sector involvement would not be enough to solve the conflict by
itself _ but would be essential in assuring lasting peace.
 &HT;    Officials in other poor southern states are also keen on
attracting companies. Indeed, with the area's low salaries and
eagerness for investment, the south is becoming the next frontier
for many labor-intensive businesses.
 &HT;    Far more than Guerrero or Oaxaca states, Yucatan is the leader.
Belying the traditional perception of the maquiladora
assembly-for-export industry as a border phenomenon, the Gulf Coast
has attracted 60 maquiladoras and their 13,000 jobs in the last
four years alone. It wants more.
 &HT;    ``Any company that wants to set up a factory here can have all
the permits it needs in a week,'' says Ricardo Dajer Nahum,
Yucatan's director of economic development. ``We find that the
delays usually come from each company's own planning process, not
the government.''
 &HT;    Dajer Nahum is likely to be a busy man, what with Yucatan's calm
social atmosphere, minute rate of worker turnover and established
sea links with the United States. The underdeveloped south is still
a challenging place to do business. But if other states can
replicate some of Yucatan's conditions, the region might begin to
close the gap with the more prosperous north.

 &HT;    ``It's a monster, and it's a monster we didn't have before,''
says Pete Palmer, a security specialist in Mexico City with U.S.
corporate security firm Kroll-O'Gara Associates. ``Sooner or later,
it's going to have an impact on foreign investment as people will
become unwilling to come down here just because of what they see.''
 &HT;    Mexican companies have already experienced the bittersweet
flavor of radical change, with its high costs for some and rich
opportunities for others. Now, in the willy-nilly process of
finding a new political and balance, the country as a whole is
going through something similar.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHIAPAS: THE NEXT FRONTIER?
 &HT;    MONTERREY _ While companies in northern and central Mexico
strive to join the global economy, much of the poor southeast is
being left behind. A conspicuous example is Chiapas, where the 1994
Zapatista rebellion has polarized part of the state and scared away
much investment. But to hear a few plucky businessmen tell it, the
state is full of business potential.
 &HT;    ``Of all our businesses, I like the ones in Chiapas most,'' says
Alfonso Romo Garza, the chairman of Monterrey-based Pulsar
Internacional, which runs a state-of-the-art biotechnology research
center there. ``Hunger is not solved by laws, and it is necessary
to bring economic development projects to Chiapas.''
 &HT;    To be sure, private sector involvement is no panacea for the
state's ills.
 &HT;    The government and the Zapatistas have dawdled so much in peace
negotiations that some skeptics have questioned the commitment of
both to finding a workable solution for the nearly five-year-old
standoff. But both sides concur that a new political agreement
covering the rights of indigenous people needs to be found.
 &HT;    The ruggedly beautiful state might be Mexico's richest in terms
of natural resources. It supplies more than half of the country's
hydroelectric power, holds a substantial share of oil reserves and
is covered with lush tropical and subtropical forests. Moreover,
experts reckon there are plenty of opportunities to develop
smaller-scale businesses, from non-traditional agriculture to
artisanry to ecological tourism.
 &HT;    In the conflict zone near the stunning city of San Cristobal de
las Casas, some once-poor Indian farmers have already carved out a
profitable niche in organically-grown coffee that finds eager
buyers in the United States and Europe. A co-op of 1,300 farmers
called Indigenous People of the Sierra Madre of Motozintla (Ismam)
now has total assets of US$7 million and credit lines of several
million dollars more, according to Father Jorge Aguilar Reyna, a
local priest who helped establish the association.
 &HT;    Small businessmen in the rest of the state are planting rubber
trees and establishing a shrimp-farming industry. A wheat flour
plant in the Soconusco region, far removed from the conflict zone,
currently imports 80 percent of its wheat from the United States
and Canada _ but figures it could cut costs and promote local jobs
if farmers near San Cristobal would plant more wheat.
 &HT;    Then there is Pulsar's center, which exports everything from
broccoli to cauliflower to melons. Meanwhile, several dozen
scientists at the company's International Center for Agricultural
Research and Training in the town of Frontera Hidalgo are
developing disease-resistant crops and other biotech innovations.
In an interview with Expansion magazine, Romo Garza said private
sector involvement would not be enough to solve the conflict by
itself _ but would be essential in assuring lasting peace.
 &HT;    Officials in other poor southern states are also keen on
attracting companies. Indeed, with the area's low salaries and
eagerness for investment, the south is becoming the next frontier
for many labor-intensive businesses.
 &HT;    Far more than Guerrero or Oaxaca states, Yucatan is the leader.
Belying the traditional perception of the maquiladora
assembly-for-export industry as a border phenomenon, the Gulf Coast
has attracted 60 maquiladoras and their 13,000 jobs in the last
four years alone. It wants more.
 &HT;    ``Any company that wants to set up a factory here can have all
the permits it needs in a week,'' says Ricardo Dajer Nahum,
Yucatan's director of economic development. ``We find that the
delays usually come from each company's own planning process, not
the government.''
 &HT;    Dajer Nahum is likely to be a busy man, what with Yucatan's calm
social atmosphere, minute rate of worker turnover and established
sea links with the United States. The underdeveloped south is still
a challenging place to do business. But if other states can
replicate some of Yucatan's conditions, the region might begin to
close the gap with the more prosperous north.

<P>
   Watching Geraldo Rivera and NBC News learn to dance together
brings to mind the old line about the luckier pairing of Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers: She gave him sex, he gave her class.
This is not meant as a compliment to Rivera, whose relentless
self-promotion based on little substance makes him more the
journalistic equivalent of Ginger Spice than Ginger Rogers. But the
ratings success of ``Rivera Live,'' the talk show about court cases
that earns CNBC's highest ratings, has led NBC News to make a
devilish bargain.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Rivera from going to the Fox News Channel, NBC gave
him a six-year, $30 million contract that included a half-hour news
show, ``Upfront Tonight,'' which had its premiere on Monday and is
seen weeknights at 7:30 on CNBC. In this partnership, Rivera gives
NBC News ratings; NBC News gives him instant respectability. He is
being thoroughly bolstered by NBC correspondents who appear often
on both of his programs and by his use of taped reports from ``NBC
Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' is a slight program and so far seems the
least significant part of the Rivera contract, which also includes
four news specials a year and a role as legal commentator on
``Today.'' In return, he gave up his syndicated tabloid talk show.
But he has retained his tabloid, show-biz sensibility, in which his
own role appears more important than any report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' looks like a news program, with a sleek,
high-tech set. You can tell it's serious because there is a world
map behind Rivera and his co-anchor, Diane Dimond. It begins with a
few reports from the day's headlines, which on the first two
programs were read awkwardly by Ms. Dimond. A veteran of ``Hard
Copy'' and WCBS-TV in New York, she seemed uncharacteristically
wooden. Perhaps it was because she was saddled with lines to make a
viewer wince, including nightly variations on ``Hurricane Bonnie
still lies over the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upfront Tonight'' also includes investigative reports; the
first few were inflated attempts at muckraking. Tuesday's report,
about a mentally ill prisoner in Utah who died last year after he
was strapped naked in a restraining chair for 16 hours, began with
Rivera introducing clips from his own most famous reporting. ``More
than 25 years ago, I helped expose the dreadful conditions'' at
Willowbrook, an institution for the mentally retarded, he said,
taking credit for changes in their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers were near the end of the Utah segment (complete with
graphic videotape) before its reporter, Jane Wells, acknowledged
that the prison has since changed its policy about using the
restraining chair. (The report's second installment, scheduled for
Wednesday night, discussed those changes.) It was a sound report,
but characteristically overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's intrusive style would matter less if his reporting were
nearly as substantive or important as he makes it sound. On
``Rivera Live,'' legal analysis is an excuse for relentless pursuit
of the national soap opera of the moment (Simpson, Ramsey,
Lewinsky, whatever). On that program, Rivera is always touting some
secret source of his own, and usually turning up information
everyone else has.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, I've done some reporting,'' he said the other night to
NBC's John Palmer, who was covering President Clinton on Martha's
Vineyard. ``One source says Clinton will leave the Vineyard,''
which plenty of sources were predicting (and which turned out to be
the president's scheduled trip to Worcester, Mass., for a speech
Thursday). In this overheated atmosphere, it is still bizarre to
see serious NBC journalists, like the White House correspondent
David Bloom, toss a report back to the studio with, ``Geraldo?''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's new contract, he said last year, was about ``seeking
that Holy Grail of redeemed reputation.'' In another often quoted
remark, he said he wanted to sit among ``the wise men'' of
television news. There is nothing wrong with trying to change your
image. But if you want to be taken seriously as a journalist, it
helps not to invoke comic images of frankincense and myrrh. It also
helps not to make nasty personal comments about Peter Jennings or
to call Barbara Walters ``a very sexy babe,'' as he did in a recent
Playboy interview. And it helps to admit that you are not the
story.
</P>
<P>
   As a program, ``Upfront Tonight'' may evolve. It is too soon to
tell much about its ratings. (Its second broadcast reached 307,000
households, a slight improvement on the program it replaced,
``Equal Time,'' but nothing near ``Rivera Live,'' which last week,
in an all-time high, reached a million more homes.) Rivera's
approach shows no signs of changing. Whatever you think about their
judgment, Rivera and Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, are
smart men; wise is a different matter.

<P>
   MANSAHRA, Pakistan _ Guerrillas who have trained at the camps in
Afghanistan that were hit by American missiles last week said
Wednesday that the attack would not interfere with the training of
Muslim revolutionaries there, nor would it harm their morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will further motivate people,'' said Bakht Zamin, a
commander of a unit that was trained in Afghanistan and is now
fighting not far from here, in Kashmir. ``They consider it a matter
of pride and a blessing of God to become a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the camps, mostly mud huts and tents, could be rebuilt
within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says the camps, in eastern
Afghanistan near the Pakistani border, were part of a terrorist
network run by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who Washington says was
responsible for the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Zamin, 42, a lawyer with an easy laugh, rejected the notion that
he and his men were terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we are freedom fighters,'' he said as he sat on the
floor in a single-story house in the cornfields here and shared a
breakfast of beans, yogurt and nan, a thick, circular bread. A
decade ago Washington would also have considered him a freedom
fighter: He was part of the CIA-backed force of mujahedeen fighting
the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between a freedom fighter and a terrorist
depends on one's political viewpoint. Two of the three camps hit by
the American cruise missiles have been supported in varying degrees
by Pakistan's intelligence service, say Western diplomats and
Pakistani government officials.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree Afghanistan has lured an amalgam of
revolutionaries, united by fundamentalist Islam, just as Cuba
attracted a cross section of Marxist revolutionaries in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the United States had trouble fighting Cuban-backed
guerrillas, the missile attack demonstrates that high-technology
wizardry developed to fight a war against another superpower may
not be appropriate against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Though the stated goal of the attack was to protect Americans
and American institutions from terrorists, the camps also trained
guerrillas to fight in Turkey, Algeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
India. Earlier graduates have also fought in Bosnia and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The American missiles struck four camps in Afghanistan. Two, in
the Jarawah area near Khost, trained Pakistanis and Kashmiris for
the war against India in Kashmir, say Pakistani officials and
journalists who have visited the site. The third, Al Farooq,
nearby, was used primarily by Arabs from several countries,
American and Pakistani officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth camp, Al Badr, 10 miles to the west, also an Arab
camp, was run by bin Laden, according to American intelligence.
Reports filtering out from Afghanistan say that Al Badr was badly
damaged and that the casualties might have been very high.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst hit camps was operated by a fundamentalist
Islamic organization in Pakistan called Harakat Mujahedeen, or
Movement of Holy Warriors; at least 21 people were killed. The
group had been called Harakat Ansar, but the name was changed after
the State Department put that organization on its terrorist list
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Harakat Mujahedeen leaders, as well as survivors of the attack,
have insisted that the camp was only for religious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jarawah camps are only a few miles from the Pakistani
border, and people and supplies, including weapons, moved freely
across Pakistan to and from the camps for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always told the Pakistanis there are dangers in allowing
these camps,'' said a senior Western diplomat who is not American.
``They always denied they had any connection. Last year the
Russians showed them pictures of weapons going from Pakistan to the
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government dismissed the photos as fakes, the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Pakistan's Foreign Ministry nor its Information Ministry
responded to telephone messages seeking comment about the camps and
how they were supplied.
</P>
<P>
   A senior diplomat from another major American ally said there
was ``no doubt'' that the groups that had trained in the camps had
received assistance from Pakistani intelligence services. He said
that when the situation had gotten too hot politically, the
intelligence service would back off for a while.
</P>
<P>
   One of the groups that trained in Afghanistan was the Hezbul
Mujahedeen, or Party of Holy Warriors. This is the group in which
Zamin, the lawyer, is a senior commander, and he said more than
20,000 men had been trained at the camps in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   The training day begins before dawn with prayers, followed by an
hour or two of running up and down the mountains, then breakfast.
The rest of the morning is for military training, including
instruction in the uses of weapons: automatic rifles, mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and explosives. After lunch and prayers,
the afternoon is for the study of the Koran and for sports, then
dinner and bed.
</P>
<P>
   It is standard basic training, with the exception of the heavy
religious component.
</P>
<P>
   During what Zamin called ideological training, the focus is on
the jihad _ the holy war _ against America and Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against the American people,'' he said, carefully
swabbing up beans in a piece of nan. ``We have no bad feelings
towards them. We are against the American policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to other battles that the guerrillas are involved in,
he asked, ``Why does it matter to the Americans if they came here
for training to fight against their regimes at home?''
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria, he said, fundamentalist Muslims are at war against a
government that canceled elections in January 1992 after it became
clear that parties calling for an Islamic republic had won.
Washington and the West did not object to the coup. In Turkey, the
army has refused to let Islamic political parties govern, even
after electoral gains by fundamentalists. In Egypt, the government
discriminates against fundamentalist Muslims, he said _ for
example, by discouraging women from veiling themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The religious underpinning of such battles was emphasized in an
anecdote told by Zamin. Before a fighter is sent into battle, he
must write a letter to be given to his family should he die. Such a
letter was found on the body of Hafiz Shabir Ahmad, who was killed
in Kashmir in June.
</P>
<P>
   The letter read, ``If with the blessing of God, I become a
martyr, please show extreme patience, because life is the trust of
God and if He gets his trust back, there is no reason to cry.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MONTERREY, Mexico _ Mexico quiza sea una de las economias
latinoamericanas mas dinamicas de la actualidad, pero tambien se ha
convertido en un nido de confusion.
 &HT;    Varios politicos han roto todas las reglas al lanzar campanas
presidenciales dos anos antes de las proximas elecciones. Aunque el
salario real aumento por primera vez desde la crisis de 1995, los
mexicanos contemplan con cautela su futuro economico, mientras una
ola de delitos recorre el pais.
 &HT;    Es esto progreso o caos? Quiza un poco de ambos.
 &HT;    Mexico esta en medio de una vasta transformacion que abarca mas
que el libre comercio. La apertura economica que inicio hace diez
anos cambia la forma en que operan las empresas, pero tambien se
extiende al resto de la sociedad. Para algunos son evidentes las
ventajas del aumento de las libertades economicas y politicas, pero
el proceso esta lejos de haber concluido.
 &HT;    ``Mexico pasa por varias transiciones simultaneas, lo que crea
una sensacion de caos,'' dice Antonio Alonso Concheiro, director de
Analitica Consultores en la capital mexicana y uno de los
principales futuristas del pais. ``Quiza sea mas percepcion que
realidad, pero se trata de procesos delicados y vamos a tener que
trabajar duro para encontrar nuevos arreglos.''
 &HT;    Mexico siempre ha sido una tierra de extremos: ricos y pobres,
norte y sur, ilustrados y analfabetos. El cuadro de hoy no es solo
en blanco y negro, y la transicion ha acentuado la division entre
las empresas que compiten a nivel mundial y las que han quedado
estancadas en el pasado.
 &HT;    Bajo esa division hay otra mas profunda entre los que tienen la
instruccion, el conocimiento y la habilidad de aprovechar las
oportunidades, y los que no estan preparados. Con un ambiente
politico mucho menos autoritario, mantener el prometedor rumbo del
libre comercio y la liberalizacion economica dependera de que sus
beneficios lleguen a todos los mexicanos.
 &HT;    No hay parte del pais que ilustre mejor el lado brillante de la
economia que Monterrey, en Nuevo Leon, el centro industrial a dos
horas de la frontera con Estados Unidos. Los habitantes de esta
orgullosa ciudad hacen gala de su agudeza para los negocios: hasta
los taxistas dan su tarjeta de presentacion.
 &HT;    Los regiomontanos consideran que su ciudad es el eje del Tratado
de Libre Comercio (TLC) y senalan su experiencia en hacer negocios
con Texas y el resto de Estados Unidos. Canada abrio una camara de
comercio en Monterrey a principios de este ano. Y muchos
empresarios mexicanos y extranjeros en Nuevo Leon han convertido
sus companias en dinamos del TLC, con un total de US$5.500 millones
en exportaciones el ano pasado.
 &HT;    ``Hemos visto un aumento del 25 por ciento en llamadas de
empresas estadounidenses interesadas en montar operaciones en
Monterrey, o en exportar sus productos al mercado mexicano,'' dice
Santiago Trevino, director de la oficina en Monterrey de la Camara
Americana de Comercio. ``Incluso vemos una escasez de mano de obra:
hay puestos vacantes dificiles de llenar.''
 &HT;    Cemex, posiblemente la empresa mas conocida de Monterrey, es la
segunda productora mundial de cemento, y su presidente, Lorenzo
Zambrano, la ha convertido en una respetada multinacional.
 &HT;    Vecinos como el Grupo Vitro, fabricante de vidrio, y la acerera
IMSA tambien se han transformado en empresas internacionales.
 &HT;    A principios de los anos '80, el gobierno tuvo que acudir al
rescate del conglomerado industrial Grupo Alfa, cuando gran parte
de sus negocios nacionales se desplomaron en una crisis anterior.
Pero el ano pasado, el Grupo Alfa exporto un 25 por ciento de su
total de ventas, que alcanzaron US$3.900 millones. Pulsar, otro
conglomerado, emprendio otras actividades ademas de sus negocios
tradicionales de empacado y agricultura, y se ha convertido en un
lider mundial de la biotecnologia. Y mas que en cualquier otro
punto del pais, una cultura de modernizacion y reorganizacion
permea a las empresas menores y convierte a Monterrey en uno de los
lugares favoritos para hacer negocios.
 &HT;    ``Hay un verdadero enfasis en el mejoramiento en todas las
empresas,'' dice Trevino. ``Todo el mundo trata de copiar a las
grandes companias en mejorar la calidad y la productividad.''
 &HT;    En todas partes las empresas han tomado un rumbo similar. El
Grupo Industrial Bimbo, fabricante de productos horneados, exporta
a Estados Unidos y al resto de America Latina, y recientemente
adquirio Mrs Baird's Bakeries, de Texas. Los fabricantes de acero
se han convertido en fuerzas regionales, y hasta algunas companias
agiles, medianas y pequenas, se han unido al desfile exportando sus
productos o abasteciendo a los gigantes.
 &HT;    Las multinacionales son otro ingrediente de esta historia de
exito. Las empresas de automoviles exportaron casi un millon de
autos y camiones el ano pasado, y las companias extranjeras en
conjunto inyectaron una cifra record de US$12.000 millones en
inversion directa en Mexico el ano pasado. La mayor parte de esa
inversion todavia proviene de Estados Unidos, pero las firmas
europeas y asiaticas tambien se han apresurado en convertir a
Mexico en su plataforma de exportacion para los mercados de Estados
Unidos y Canada y, en algunos casos, para toda Latinoamerica.
 &HT;    De hecho, el exito de la economia industrial moderna es de tal
magnitud que la infraestructura en Mexico y a lo largo de la
frontera con Estados Unidos siente el peso del comercio. Los
cargamentos que llegaban al puerto de Veracruz tuvieron un retraso
de una semana en la primavera y el verano de este ano, a pesar del
gran mejoramiento de la eficiencia. El sistema ferroviario ya
funciona mejor, y Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, la empresa
que opera el Ferrocarril del Nordeste, entre la capital mexicana y
la frontera con Texas, ha invertido US$1.000 millones en mejorar el
servicio. Pero la primavera pasada sus esfuerzos se vieron
obstaculizados por varios retrasos en las vias de Union Pacific en
Texas, que no daban abasto con todo el trafico que venia de Mexico.
 &HT;    ``El crecimiento futuro depende del aumento de las exportaciones
mexicanas, y la clave para ser mas competitivo es mejorar nuestra
infraestructura,'' dice Zambrano, de Cemex. ``Eso bajara el costo
de llevar nuestros productos a otros mercados, y a la larga sera el
factor que decida si ganamos o perdemos participacion de mercado.
Debemos hacer las mejoras necesarias en un plazo de cinco anos o
nuestras exportaciones se reduciran.''
 &HT;    En otras esferas de la economia, el aparente exito de la nocion
esencial de la liberalizacion comercial es solo parte de la
historia. En gran parte del pais, muchas companias pequenas y
medianas se han quedado a la zaga.
 &HT;    ``Hay una parte de la economia que es extraordinariamente
competitiva y que aporta entre el 60 por ciento y el 70 por ciento
de la produccion industrial,'' senala el destacado economista Luis
Rubio, director del Centro de Investigaciones del Desarrollo, en la
capital mexicana. ``Pero esa parte solo representa alrededor del 20
por ciento de los empleos. El otro 80 por ciento es un mar de
ineficiencia y falta de productividad. Es como si las empresas de
ese sector vivieran en otra era.''
 &HT;    La incorporacion de mas empresas menores a las cadenas de
produccion para la exportacion sera la prueba clave que determine
si mas personas, y no solo unos cuantos grandes empresarios, se
beneficiaran en el nuevo Mexico. Eso tambien es importante ante
otra clase de dilema.
 &HT;    Para crear empleos suficientes para el millon de mexicanos que
se incorpora cada ano a la fuerza laboral, la economia debe crecer
a un ritmo de al menos el 5 por ciento (el ano pasado crecio el 7
por ciento y se espera que crezca un poco menos del 5 por ciento
este ano). Pero cuando crece a ese ritmo, el deficit comercial
tiende a aumentar debido a la gran demanda de importaciones, lo que
puede desestabilizar la economia.
 &HT;    Esa situacion no dejara de ser un problema grave hasta que mas
empresas nacionales alcancen el grado de eficiencia suficiente para
responder a la demanda del consumidor y a las necesidades de las
companias locales.
 &HT;    Como los grandes exportadores solo emplean a una pequena parte
de la fuerza laboral, la mayoria de los trabajadores estan
empleados en empresas estancadas, que pagan salarios bajos, en la
vieja economia industrial o en el sector de los servicios. A la
larga, esa realidad podria perjudicar el mercado del consumidor,
aunque hoy apenas preocupa.
 &HT;    En realidad, el mercado del consumidor ha recuperado un fuerte
crecimiento este ano. Las ventas minoristas reflejaron ganancias
anuales de mas del 10 por ciento en el primer trimestre del ano, y
podrian aumentar hasta el 6 por ciento para el ano completo, segun
los analistas. La demanda de importaciones, que se desplomo en
1995, tambien ha aumentado: las importaciones de productos de
consumo crecieron casi el 50 por ciento en los primeros cuatro
meses del ano, dando lugar a un crecimiento general de casi el 25
por ciento.
 &HT;    ``Aproximadamente el 20 por ciento de nuestros productos fueron
importados en 1994, una proporcion que bajo al 6 por ciento en
1995,'' dice Pedro Mejia, gerente general de Soriana, una cadena de
supermercados de Monterrey. ``La cifra ahora ronda el 11 por ciento
y podria subir. La consideracion principal en 1995 y 1996 era el
precio, y asi vimos a muchos consumidores dejar de adquirir los
productos de marca que solian comprar. Ahora hay una
recuperacion.''
 &HT;    Pero la doble naturaleza de la recuperacion tambien es aparente.
Las ventas de automoviles y productos duraderos han avanzado
significativamente, pero los bienes basicos que compra todo el
mundo, como alimentos y ropa, han registrado ganancias menores. Un
estudio realizado en 1997 por la firma encuestadora Mori de Mexico
mostro que el 35 por ciento de los mexicanos esperaba que su
situacion economica mejorara el ano siguiente. La cifra fue muy
superior al 20 por ciento que pensaba asi en 1996, y fue la primera
vez que las expectativas mejoraron desde el principio de la crisis.
Pero tambien estuvo muy por debajo de expectativas comparables en
paises como Brasil y Colombia.
 &HT;    Una razon de la cautela es lo ciclico de las crisis en Mexico,
que han acompanado el final de cada termino presidencial de seis
anos desde 1976. La proxima eleccion es en julio del 2000 y sera la
primera vez que el gobernante Partido Revolucionario Institucional
(PRI) tiene probabilidades reales de perder.
 &HT;    Vicente Fox, el popular gobernador del estado de Guanajuato, ya
ha anunciado que competira por la candidatura del Partido de Accion
Nacional (PAN), de centroderecha. Se cree que Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
alcalde de Mexico D.F. y el politico mas celebre de Mexico despues
del presidente Ernesto Zedillo, planea postularse por el Partido de
la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), de centroizquierda.
 &HT;    Los empresarios y los economistas ya se sienten nerviosos. ``Uno
de los mayores retos de Mexico es mantener la estabilidad
macroeconomica mas alla del 2000,'' apunta Rubio. ``Eso implica
hacer frente al otro desafio: evitar que haya demasiada
contaminacion en lo que la gente espera de los politicos.''
 &HT;    Pero la politica tambien cambia. El decrepito sistema de fraude,
padrinazgo y clientelismo levantado durante las siete decadas que
lleva el PRI en el poder, se viene abajo. La confianza en el
proceso electoral (y en la aparente voluntad de Zedillo de
respetarlo) se disparo despues de las elecciones de medio termino
en julio del ano pasado, que dio a los partidos de oposicion una
mayoria combinada en la Camara de Diputados.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, al igual que en la economia, hay un lado oculto en
la apertura politica. Del mismo modo que el ambiente politico
abierto muestra una alternativa viable a la dominacion tradicional
del PRI, surgen nuevos problemas sociales.
 &HT;    A viejos problemas como el bajo nivel de educacion y la
corrupcion sistemica se ha unido uno nuevo: la ola de crimenes que
azota al pais desde 1995.
 &HT;    ``Es un monstruo que antes no teniamos,'' dice Pete Palmer,
especialista de seguridad de la firma estadounidense de seguridad
Kroll-O'Gara Associates, en la capital mexicana. ``Tarde o
temprano, va a afectar la inversion extranjera, a medida que mas
personas esten menos dispuestas a venir debido a lo que ven en el
pais.''
 &HT;    Las empresas mexicanas ya han experimentado el sabor agridulce
del cambio radical, con altos costos para algunos y esplendidas
oportunidades para otros. Ahora, en el delicado proceso de hallar
un nuevo equilibrio politico, el pais en su conjunto pasa por un
fenomeno similar.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHIAPAS: LA PROXIMA FRONTERA?
 &HT;    MONTERREY, Mexico _ Mientras las empresas del norte y el centro
de Mexico se esfuerzan por integrarse a la economia mundializada,
gran parte del sureste pobre se queda a la zaga. Un ejemplo es
Chiapas, donde la rebelion zapatista de 1994 polarizo parte del
estado y alejo muchas inversiones. Pero para algunos empresarios
resueltos el estado tiene un gran potencial para los negocios.
 &HT;    ``De todos nuestros negocios, los que mas me gustan son los de
Chiapas,'' dice Alfonso Romo Garza, presidente del directorio de
Pulsar Internacional, de Monterrey, que tiene un centro de
investigaciones avanzadas de biotecnologia en el estado. ``Las
leyes no solucionan el hambre, y es necesario traer obras de
desarrollo economico a Chiapas.''
 &HT;    Pero es indudable que la participacion del sector privado no es
la panacea para los males del estado. El gobierno y los zapatistas
se han extendido tanto en las negociaciones de paz que algunos
escepticos han cuestionado el compromiso de ambas partes de
alcanzar una solucion factible a un estancamiento que ya dura casi
cinco anos. Ambos bandos coinciden en que hace falta un nuevo
acuerdo politico que contemple las necesidades de los pueblos
indigenas.
 &HT;    El estado, bello y agreste, quiza sea el mas rico de Mexico en
recursos naturales. Produce mas de la mitad de la energia
hidroelectrica del pais, tiene grandes reservas de petroleo y esta
cubierto por un manto exuberante de bosques tropicales. Ademas, los
especialistas estiman que hay numerosas oportunidades para
desarrollar negocios a pequena escala, como agricultura no
tradicional, artesania y ecoturismo.
 &HT;    En la zona de conflicto cerca de la impresionante ciudad de San
Cristobal de las Casas, varios campesinos indigenas, antes pobres,
han establecido un negocio rentable: cafe cultivado organicamente,
que tiene compradores ansiosos en Estados Unidos y Europa. Una
cooperativa de 1.300 campesinos llamada Pueblo Indigena de la
Sierra Madre de Motozintla (Ismam) tiene un total de activos de
US$7 millones y lineas de credito por varios millones mas, segun el
padre Jorge Aguilar Reyna, sacerdote local que contribuyo a la
creacion de la asociacion.
 &HT;    Pequenos empresarios en el resto del estado plantan arboles de
caucho y establecen una industria de cria de camarones. En la
region de Sosonusco, lejos de la zona de conflicto, una planta de
harina de trigo importa el 80 por ciento de su trigo de Estados
Unidos y Canada, pero calcula que podria reducir los costos y
promover empleos locales si los campesinos cerca de San Cristobal
sembraran mas trigo.
 &HT;    Tambien esta el centro de Pulsar, que exporta una gran variedad
de productos agricolas, como broculi, coliflor y melones.
Entretanto, decenas de cientificos en el Centro Internacional de
Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Agricolas de la compania, en el
pueblo de Frontera Hidalgo, desarrollan cultivos resistentes a las
plagas y otras innovaciones. En una entrevista con la revista
Expansion, Romo Garza dijo que la participacion del sector privado
no seria suficiente para resolver el conflicto, pero que si seria
esencial para garantizar una paz duradera.
 &HT;    Los funcionarios de otros empobrecidos estados del sur tambien
estan ansiosos por atraer a empresas. En realidad, con los bajos
salarios y la sed de inversiones en la region, el sur se convierte
en la proxima frontera de muchos negocios que requieren mucha mano
de obra.
 &HT;    Muy por delante de los estados de Guerrero y Oaxaca, Yucatan es
el lider. Desmintiendo la percepcion tradicional de la industria
del ensamblado para exportacion, la maquiladora, como un fenomeno
de la frontera, la costa del Golfo ha atraido 60 maquiladoras y sus
13.000 empleos solo en los ultimos cuatro anos. Y quiere mas.
 &HT;    ``Cualquier empresa que quiera montar una fabrica aqui puede
conseguir todos los permisos necesarios en una semana,'' afirma
Ricardo Dajer Nahum, director de desarrollo economico de Yucatan.
``Advertimos que los retrasos se deben generalmente al proceso de
planificacion de cada empresa en particular, y no al gobierno.''
 &HT;    Dajer Nahum probablemente sea un hombre ocupado, con el calmado
ambiente social de Yucatan, su bajo indice de cambios de personal y
sus vinculos maritimos establecidos con Estados Unidos. El sur
subdesarrollado aun es un lugar de desafio para los negocios. Pero
si otros estados pueden imitar algunas de las condiciones de
Yucatan, la region podria comenzar a cerrar la brecha que la separa
del mas prospero norte.

 &HT;    MONTERREY, Mexico _ Mexico quiza sea una de las economias
latinoamericanas mas dinamicas de la actualidad, pero tambien se ha
convertido en un nido de confusion.
 &HT;    Varios politicos han roto todas las reglas al lanzar campanas
presidenciales dos anos antes de las proximas elecciones. Aunque el
salario real aumento por primera vez desde la crisis de 1995, los
mexicanos contemplan con cautela su futuro economico, mientras una
ola de delitos recorre el pais.
 &HT;    Es esto progreso o caos? Quiza un poco de ambos.

conjunto inyectaron una cifra record de US$12.000 millones en

 &HT;    Para crear empleos suficientes para el millon de mexicanos que
se incorpora cada ano a la fuerza laboral, la economia debe crecer
a un ritmo de al menos el 5 por ciento (el ano pasado crecio el 7
por ciento y se espera que crezca un poco menos del 5 por ciento
este ano). Pero cuando crece a ese ritmo, el deficit comercial
tiende a aumentar debido a la gran demanda de importaciones, lo que
puede desestabilizar la economia.
 &HT;    Esa situacion no dejara de ser un problema grave hasta que mas

empleados en empresas estancadas, que pagan salarios bajos, en la
vieja economia industrial o en el sector de los servicios. A la

aunque hoy apenas preocupa.
 &HT;    En realidad, el mercado del consumidor ha recuperado un fuerte
crecimiento este ano. Las ventas minoristas reflejaron ganancias
anuales de mas del 10 por ciento en el primer trimestre del ano, y
podrian aumentar hasta el 6 por ciento para el ano completo, segun
los analistas. La demanda de importaciones, que se desplomo en
1995, tambien ha aumentado: las importaciones de productos de
consumo crecieron casi el 50 por ciento en los primeros cuatro
meses del ano, dando lugar a un crecimiento general de casi el 25
por ciento.

 &HT;    CHIAPAS: LA PROXIMA FRONTERA?
 &HT;    MONTERREY, Mexico _ Mientras las empresas del norte y el centro
de Mexico se esfuerzan por integrarse a la economia mundializada,
gran parte del sureste pobre se queda a la zaga. Un ejemplo es
Chiapas, donde la rebelion zapatista de 1994 polarizo parte del
estado y alejo muchas inversiones. Pero para algunos empresarios
resueltos el estado tiene un gran potencial para los negocios.
 &HT;    ``De todos nuestros negocios, los que mas me gustan son los de
Chiapas,'' dice Alfonso Romo Garza, presidente del directorio de
Pulsar Internacional, de Monterrey, que tiene un centro de
investigaciones avanzadas de biotecnologia en el estado. ``Las
leyes no solucionan el hambre, y es necesario traer obras de
desarrollo economico a Chiapas.''
 &HT;    Pero es indudable que la participacion del sector privado no es
la panacea para los males del estado. El gobierno y los zapatistas
se han extendido tanto en las negociaciones de paz que algunos
escepticos han cuestionado el compromiso de ambas partes de
alcanzar una solucion factible a un estancamiento que ya dura casi
cinco anos. Ambos bandos coinciden en que hace falta un nuevo
acuerdo politico que contemple las necesidades de los pueblos
indigenas.
 &HT;    El estado, bello y agreste, quiza sea el mas rico de Mexico en
recursos naturales. Produce mas de la mitad de la energia
hidroelectrica del pais, tiene grandes reservas de petroleo y esta
cubierto por un manto exuberante de bosques tropicales. Ademas, los
especialistas estiman que hay numerosas oportunidades para
desarrollar negocios a pequena escala, como agricultura no
tradicional, artesania y ecoturismo.
 &HT;    En la zona de conflicto cerca de la impresionante ciudad de San
Cristobal de las Casas, varios campesinos indigenas, antes pobres,
han establecido un negocio rentable: cafe cultivado organicamente,
que tiene compradores ansiosos en Estados Unidos y Europa. Una
cooperativa de 1.300 campesinos llamada Pueblo Indigena de la
Sierra Madre de Motozintla (Ismam) tiene un total de activos de
US$7 millones y lineas de credito por varios millones mas, segun el
padre Jorge Aguilar Reyna, sacerdote local que contribuyo a la
creacion de la asociacion.
 &HT;    Pequenos empresarios en el resto del estado plantan arboles de
caucho y establecen una industria de cria de camarones. En la
region de Sosonusco, lejos de la zona de conflicto, una planta de
harina de trigo importa el 80 por ciento de su trigo de Estados
Unidos y Canada, pero calcula que podria reducir los costos y
promover empleos locales si los campesinos cerca de San Cristobal
sembraran mas trigo.
 &HT;    Tambien esta el centro de Pulsar, que exporta una gran variedad
de productos agricolas, como broculi, coliflor y melones.
Entretanto, decenas de cientificos en el Centro Internacional de
Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Agricolas de la compania, en el
pueblo de Frontera Hidalgo, desarrollan cultivos resistentes a las
plagas y otras innovaciones. En una entrevista con la revista
Expansion, Romo Garza dijo que la participacion del sector privado
no seria suficiente para resolver el conflicto, pero que si seria
esencial para garantizar una paz duradera.
 &HT;    Los funcionarios de otros empobrecidos estados del sur tambien
estan ansiosos por atraer a empresas. En realidad, con los bajos
salarios y la sed de inversiones en la region, el sur se convierte
en la proxima frontera de muchos negocios que requieren mucha mano
de obra.
 &HT;    Muy por delante de los estados de Guerrero y Oaxaca, Yucatan es
el lider. Desmintiendo la percepcion tradicional de la industria
del ensamblado para exportacion, la maquiladora, como un fenomeno
de la frontera, la costa del Golfo ha atraido 60 maquiladoras y sus
13.000 empleos solo en los ultimos cuatro anos. Y quiere mas.
 &HT;    ``Cualquier empresa que quiera montar una fabrica aqui puede
conseguir todos los permisos necesarios en una semana,'' afirma
Ricardo Dajer Nahum, director de desarrollo economico de Yucatan.
``Advertimos que los retrasos se deben generalmente al proceso de
planificacion de cada empresa en particular, y no al gobierno.''
 &HT;    Dajer Nahum probablemente sea un hombre ocupado, con el calmado
ambiente social de Yucatan, su bajo indice de cambios de personal y
sus vinculos maritimos establecidos con Estados Unidos. El sur
subdesarrollado aun es un lugar de desafio para los negocios. Pero
si otros estados pueden imitar algunas de las condiciones de
Yucatan, la region podria comenzar a cerrar la brecha que la separa
del mas prospero norte.

COMMENTARY: SHADOW OF A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `s' category) 
(JT) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Androstenedione is legal in the United States, and Mark McGwire,
a remarkably muscular man who hits home runs for a living, has a
right to use it. Whether it's a good idea to use it is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, has had a
glorious summer and is now closing in on the single-season home run
marks of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. Kids idolize him. Fans have
been filling ballparks from coast to coast to watch him swing his
mighty bat. When he comes to town, it's not enough to see the ball
game. You have to show up early enough to catch batting practice,
to watch his screaming line drives and long, towering flies.
</P>
<P>
   Even when McGwire is on the road he gets standing ovations.
After a McGwire home run on Sunday at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Stadium, the delirious Pittsburgh fans demanded a curtain call, an
extremely rare honor for a visiting player.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, somewhat embarrassed, obliged. He stepped from the
dugout and tipped his cap. The fans went wild. Later McGwire would
say, ``I wish every baseball player could feel what I'm feeling
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a controversial substance, currently
classified as a dietary supplement, that is taken in pill or
capsule form. It is converted by the body into testosterone.
Athletes take it because they believe this temporary testosterone
boost can help build muscle and increase their strength and
endurance. McGwire, who in past years has lost substantial playing
time to injuries, recently acknowledged that he uses
androstenedione. He said it increased the efficiency of his
weight-room workouts.
</P>
<P>
   This acknowledgment has cast a shadow over his dream season.
</P>
<P>
   While it can be purchased over the counter and its use has not
been prohibited by Major League Baseball, androstenedione has been
banned by the National Football League, the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and the International Olympic Committee. Randy
Barnes, the Olympic shotput champion, is facing a lifetime ban
because he tested positive for androstenedione in April.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives? Is Mark McGwire in better shape to hit home runs
because he's taking a pill that promotes the development of lean
muscle mass? A pill that can make a strong man even stronger?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows. The Cardinals and McGwire issued a joint statement
this week that said androstenedione ``has no proven anabolic
steroid effect nor significant side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Yesalis, a professor at Penn State University and
author of the book ``The Steroids Game,'' said, ``The whole idea is
to convince people that you're not really taking a drug, that this
is not cheating, and most certainly that you are not taking
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course, this is a steroid. What is debatable is
whether this is an anabolic steroid. Does it have anabolic
qualities _ tissue-building qualities?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, a professor of clinical medicine at the New
York University School of Medicine and the lead author of the
influential textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete,'' said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody particularly knows whether
androstenedione itself has anabolic qualities. But the substance
that androstenedione is converted into unequivocally has anabolic
properties. It's the father of all anabolic steroids. Testosterone.
So if, in fact, depending on the dose _ a critical issue _ if you
can raise the amount of testosterone in your blood by taking enough
of this stuff, then it's anabolic, provided you lift the weights
and do all the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is looking at
androstenedione, but Federal officials have not determined whether
it should be regulated and controlled as anabolic steroids are. Too
little is known about it, officials said, including its long-term
effects.
</P>
<P>
   So Mark McGwire is operating safely within the boundaries of the
law and the rules of his sport. But there are other considerations.
Each new home run gives the nation a thrill. As he draws closer to
Ruth's 60 and Maris' 61, each at-bat will likely be televised live
to the nation. A lot of young people will be looking on, admiring
their hero, trying to follow his example, trying their best to be
like Mark.

MEXICO SETS ANTICRIME INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Under growing pressure from businesses and
citizens to stem a crime wave that has swept through almost every
corner of the country, Mexico announced an initiative Wednesday to
reduce criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Francisco Labastida and nearly all of the
country's 31 governors said the eight-point plan, called ``National
Crusade Against Crime and Delinquency,'' would help strengthen law
enforcement efforts and deter criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``An outlook that shows such grave problems requires radical
solutions that attack the root of the problems,'' Labastida told an
audience that included President Ernesto Zedillo and members of the
Cabinet. ``It also requires a unified effort among political
parties and with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans expressed skepticism about the plan. An average of 1.5
million crimes occur each year in Mexico, And although the number
of assualts and rapes in the country is down this year from last,
according to government statistics which are widely considered to
underrepresent the actual figure, the number of homicides during
the same period has doubled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there have been a record number of bank robberies
in Mexico City and a rash of kidnappings and muggings since a
severe economic recession hit the country four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the $380 million crime-fighting plan that has
been endorsed by Zedillo will increase the number of federal and
state police officers. It will also seek to professionalize the
country's police forces by removing corrupt officers, coordinating
inter-agency efforts, restructuring police training curriculum and
creating five new regional police acadmies.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative will also attempt to modernize the country's
crime-fighting technology through the use of computer databases and
the introduction of a national telephone number for reporting
crimes. Another phase of the crusade will focus on making Mexico's
constitution and federal and state penal codes tougher on
criminals, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes less than a week after police arrested
Daniel Arizmendi Lopez, the country's most wanted criminal, who is
believed to be responsible for dozens of kidnappings. The arrest
and continuing crime plague have sparked new calls here for the
death penalty, currently unavailable in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The crime-fighting plan also demonstrates an unusual consensus
between federal and state officials and among the country's three
main political parties, which have been taking bitter shots at each
other recently over a controversial proposal to save a
government-sponsored bank. But for now, many residents, even those
who support the plan, are unsure it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Josefina Recano de Nava, the mother of a 28-year-old son who was
killed by kidnappers, made a public plea to Zedillo and government
officials to fulfill their promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we teach our children to be good,'' she asked, ``if
at any moment they could lose their lives because of crime?''

FDA, PFIZER DOWNPLAY VIAGRA DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least 69 Americans taking Viagra, the impotence medication,
died in the first four months it was on the market, according to
the US Food and Drug Administration's latest count. The
significance of that statistic is being hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA insists that Viagra is safe, even though the death toll
has risen by 30 since its last report a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several medical groups, meanwhile, say the rising toll
reinforces their calls for better labeling of the drug by its
manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., and greater caution by doctors
prescribing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer and FDA are saying in a cavalier and reckless way that
there's no problem,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the
consumer organization Health Research Group. ``The labeling on the
drug is completely unacceptable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association and American College of
Cardiology have also expressed concerns, saying Viagra could pose a
risk to more people than is indicated on its label.
</P>
<P>
   But other physicians, along with federal officials, say the
figure of 69 deaths is not that high, since more than 2 million men
have taken the drug, and that many were old enough perhaps to have
died from overexertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of data we've seen,'' added an FDA spokesman,
Brad Stone, ``it appears that Viagra is safe and effective when
used as indicated.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the concerns about Viagra's safety, it helps to
understand the avalanche of interest after the drug was released in
April. In just four months, 3.6 million prescriptions were written
and 30 million tablets dispensed, making it the most instantly
popular prescription medication ever.
</P>
<P>
   But is it safe?
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer insists that it is, although the label warns that
life-threatening low blood pressure can result if people taking
heart medicine containing nitrates also use Viagra. And it cautions
about cardiac risk for people taking the drug who have not been
sexually active.
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, the College of Cardiology and the Heart
Association warned that Viagra can be dangerous for a long list of
other patients, including ones with insufficient blood flow to the
heart, congestive heart failure combined with borderline low blood
pressure, or those taking several drugs for high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   It also urged special precautions for men with severe liver or
kidney problems, or those taking such drugs as erythromycin or
cimetidine.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups promise a more definitive statement by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FDA has been tracking Viagra-related
deaths, and released its latest figures this week. While reports
are sketchy, the agency said that through July of this year, it had
solid evidence of 69 patients who had died after taking the drug.
Two had strokes, 46 had heart attacks or cardiovascular troubles,
and the cause of death could not be determined for the remaining
21.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the deaths also varied: 25 died or had onset of
symptoms within five hours of using Viagra; 16 died or developed
symptoms within four days of use; and the time from ingestion to
death was unknown in the rest.
</P>
<P>
   To Wolfe, the consumer activist, the new data back up a petition
he filed last week asking the FDA to review Viagra's side effects
and strengthen its warning label.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy McCormick, a Pfizer spokesman, said that after four
months ``we haven't seen anything different in rare side effects
the way we sometimes do with new drugs.'' And the FDA's Stone said
that while the agency will review Wolfe's petition and the medical
groups' concerns, for now there is no reason to spell out
additional concerns on Viagra's label.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Graboys, who runs the Lown Cardiovascular Center at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, takes a middle ground on the safety
questions. On the one hand, he said, a certain number of deaths can
be expected, since millions of men are taking the drug, and many
are not used to sexual exertion. On the other, concerns about more
users being at risk than previously believed must be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is out and we're in a state of watchful waiting,''
Grayboys concluded. ``That requires doctors to spend a significant
time with patients discussing the implications of their problem, of
their impotence and the implication of using the medication.''

EXPERTS QUESTION MILITARY STRIKES IN TARGETING BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS grafs 11-14 to reflect Pakistani cooperation, sanctions
on India; pickup15thgraf: Joseph Reat)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States needs to dramatically increase
the reward for bombing suspect Osama bin Laden and seek greater
cooperation with countries that harbor him to weaken the
millionaire's ability to carry out attacks, an Israeli terrorism
expert said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Sprinzak, a Hebrew University political science professor
and a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, said
increasing the reward for information on bin Laden might be the key
to finding him. The United States is offering $2 million for
information leading to the capture of bin Laden, but Sprinzak said
it should be $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Institute
of Peace, a federal agency created by Congress to promote conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, a political science professor at the University of
Ulster and another Institute of Peace fellow, said the United
States needs to build a global coalition to avoid being isolated in
its retaliatory attacks against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration accuses bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi
outcast, of using his personal fortune to finance terrorist
activities _ including the recent bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Keyna and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   With a high price on bin Laden's head, he would ``very quickly
feel the heat'' from organizations in the Middle East that would be
attracted to a large reward, Sprinzak said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long suspected bin Laden as being a
leading sponsor of terrorism. In 1994, he took refuge in Sudan
after losing citizenship in his native Saudi Arabia for opposing
the ruling family. He was ousted from there two years later when
the United States threatened Sudan with trade sanctions, and he
moved to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden gathers support from groups such as the Taliban, a
fundamentalist Islamic movement that controls much of Afghanistan.
But Sprinzak said some of his reported 3,000 supporters might tell
of bin Laden's whereabouts in exchange for a hefty reward.
</P>
<P>
   Through money and cooperation with countries that currently
harbor him, Sprinzak added, bin Laden might be exiled and then
forced to wander, looking for countries that will protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak argued that bin Laden's lack of citizenship will make
it easier to find him because he can be exiled from any nation that
decides it is no longer in its interests to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pakistan has cooperated with the United States in
hunting down other terrorism suspects, Sprinzak contends that the
Pakistani government could help find bin Laden. If it ``decides
tomorrow that the fellow damages their interests, (Pakistan) can
solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Pakistan have had lukewarm relations in
recent years because of the country's efforts to develop nuclear
weapons. President Clinton imposed sanctions on both Pakistan and
neighboring India after the two South Asian nations traded
tit-for-tat nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Reat, a State Department spokesman, said he had no
immediate comment on Sprinzak's statements.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Arthur argued that bin Laden's
lack of citizenship makes it easier for him to escape U.S. efforts
to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has an amorphous group of supporters and he isn't
rooted, Arthur said. He described bin Laden's power structure as
``faceless'' and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to relying on military force to respond to
terrorism, Arthur suggests that the United States build an alliance
against terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is in U.S. foreign policy interests to start again
this business of coalition building,'' he said, adding that America
is ``dangerously isolated'' as the sole superpower.

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ Damase Kava-Zumbu first heard about what his
nephew had done when he walked into his courtyard a couple of weeks
ago, a few days after rebels launched an attack against the
government here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonton's gone and volunteered,'' one of his children told him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he sat down with his nephew. ``Are you aware of what
you've done?'' asked the uncle, a thoughtful, university-educated
agronomist. The nephew answered that he was eager to defend his
country against foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle asked nothing else, even though he knew the young man
would go to war with almost no training, in part because he agreed
with his simple reasoning, in part because he barely knew him. A
younger sister of Kava-Zumbu's had sent her son away from the
family's ancestral village to live with his uncle here in La Cite,
the sprawling collection of dilapidated neighborhoods south of
Kinshasa's business and diplomatic center.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his uncle's courtyard, leaning toward his
grandmother, who everyone knew spoiled him, the nephew, Tonton
Miaka, now waited for the government to hand him a uniform and an
AK-47.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, impassive man of 24, Miaka let slip a faint smile only
when he recalled that since he had volunteered, the youths in the
neighborhood had begun saluting him and calling him Mokonzi,
``chief'' in the local dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa is filled these days with young men who have
volunteered to join the army, compelled by vague notions of duty
and the unshakable belief that Congo has been attacked by the hated
Tutsi and their Rwandan backers. Each morning, except on Sundays,
they can be seen milling around La Cite's sports stadiums, waiting
to join the military or to begin their drills.
</P>
<P>
   The young men _ many are just teen-agers _ are the foot soldiers
in the Congolese government's notoriously unprofessional and
disorganized army. Many in the first wave of volunteers who left
for the rebel-held areas southwest of here were killed by mistake
two weeks ago when they ran into another group of government
soldiers from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the deaths reached Kinshasa and Miaka's training was
put on hold for more than a week. But he was called back to duty on
Saturday and on Monday, at 7 a.m., he resumed his training after
walking the two miles from his uncle's house to the nearest sports
center, Martyr Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first group got killed, some volunteers changed
their minds and tried to discourage me,'' he said, leaning forward
in his chair, rubbing his leg with his hand. ``But I'm determined
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonton Miaka has no military experience, having spent half his
life growing onions and cabbage back in the village. With few
prospects there, he came to Kinshasa and, with some seed money from
his grandmother, started a small business selling cigarettes at the
local market.
</P>
<P>
   The young man lived at his uncle's, in a squat house with
cinder-block walls and a thin tin roof. The family moved into the
house in 1948, said Kava-Zumbu, 55, in a neighborhood called
Ngiri-Ngiri that was one of the last areas built by the Belgian
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   The family's fortunes fell under the ruinous, 32-year
dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko. While Kava-Zumbu benefited from
what was once considered one of the best educational systems on the
continent, his nephew did not study beyond age 12. The uncle, who
worked as an agronomist for the government and spent 12 years in
the eastern Congo, also fell on hard times. His salary eroded under
soaring inflation and eventually, like many government workers, he
was not paid at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the uncle _ along with his wife, their six children,
his mother and the nephew _ makes ends meet by renting rooms in the
house to two families, taking in a total of $70 a month. His
mother, an indomitable woman in her 80s who can be found sitting or
lying in the sand-swept courtyard all day, supplements the family
income by peeling sunflower seeds. She mashes the seeds into oil
and sells them at a stand in front of the house, or sometimes at
the local market.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that market, where Tonton Miaka was selling an average
of six packs of Ambassade cigarettes a day, that he first heard
that the army was taking volunteers. ``I wanted to go right away,''
he said, but he decided to wait until he told his grandmother that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be the first soldier in our family,'' his
grandmother, Veronique M'landu, recalled telling him, explaining
that five of her grandsons had now joined the army. ``Go defend the
country. Don't loot. Behave yourself like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, wearing jeans and running shoes, he went to
Martyr Stadium and quickly enrolled. For the next ten days, Miaka
and hundreds like him went through drills inside the stadium and
sang songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Rwandans, God has not chosen you,'' Miaka said, recalling
a song. ``If you want dialogue, we'll have dialogue. If you want
war, we'll have war.''
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, who went to university instead of the army, shook his
head. ``He gave up everything,'' he said with a laugh. ``He shaved
his head, a la Kabila. He spent all the money he'd earned. He gave
some of it away and feasted on the rest of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many educated Congolese here, Kava-Zumbu has
complicated feelings about the war. He is weary of it. But he is
steadfastly behind efforts by President Laurent Kabila to push back
the rebels, who are led by ethnic Tutsi from eastern Congo and who
are widely supposed to have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda, two
countries that helped propel Kabila to power less than two years
ago but then grew disenchanted with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call Kabila a buffoon and say that he doesn't have the
profile of a president,'' the uncle said bitterly. ``This is a
sovereign country, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The family is united behind the young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud,'' the grandmother said. ``I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   But each morning, after her grandson had left the house for
Martyr Stadium, Kava-Zumbu said, he noticed something unusual.
``Every morning,'' he said, ``she cried.'' &QL;

MUSTER NOT DONE COMPOSING MASTERFUL TENNIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ ``Shut up, Thomas!''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Muster can still hear the kind burghers of Leibnitz
addressing him affectionately when he was a boy at play: ``Shut up,
Thomas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not affection,'' he concedes. ``They hated the way I
played.''
</P>
<P>
   But how could those ear-abused Leibnitzers divine the future?
How would they imagine that growing in the midst of their
celebrated vineyards was a kid whose belting of rubber lemons would
one day bring the town more fame than its succulent grapes? A
platinum-headed lefthander possibly destined for a niche in the
International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport?
</P>
<P>
   It happened because Thomas Muster _ the Moo Man _ burned with a
desire to compete on a tennis court as surely as an earlier
Austrian, Wolfgang Mozart, was hot to outdo every other composer on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart would understand the way Muster waves his racket as
though a mad conductor demanding fortissimo. And accompanying his
blustering swings with strings, Muster delivers the fortissimo
sound himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Musterian sounds roll forth from his diaphragm, echoing
across the landscape, so that you may say, ``I heard Muster play at
Longwood.'' Even though you might have been across the street and
down the block having your hair cut by Silvio, and not seen him at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Muster hearings are much more common than Muster sightings,
although the customers at the MFS Pro Championships tonight may
combine the two as he wallops and wails at the Ecuadorian Nicholas
Lapentti in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Muster is definitely back in town after a 10-year absence,
even though, if the wind was right, you may have heard him laboring
in Paris as he won the French Open in 1995, or in Miami winning The
Lipton last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longwood looks the same,'' he said, ``but where's the clay?''
That was the footing in 1988 when he beat Lawson Duncan to win the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind these hard courts now,'' he said. ``In fact, I
like them. It took me a while to get used to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Muster would fight his heart out on any surface
because that's his way _ sound effects with resoundingly smacked,
topspin-dripping groundies. He could be knee-deep in a
grape-stomping tub at home and still battle you to the death.
</P>
<P>
   This quality attracted Ron Leitgeb, his triple-threat
countryman: friend-coach-manager. It's a weird coupling that has
worked wonders since 1984, when Muster was a crude-stroking
16-year-old in the French Juniors and tennis nut Leitgeb was a
25-year-old medical student in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Paris on a holiday to do some radio reports on the
French Open for a friend who owned a station, and I saw _ I mean, I
heard _ Thomas for the first time. Wojtek Fibak (former Polish
Davis Cupper) told me Muster was crazy but he could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy was all right. After all, I'm from Dr. Freud's city. And
I thought Thomas could become a player, too. I wanted to help
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Out the window went medicine, although Leitgeb doesn't deny a
little amateur psychiatry is involved. Naturally. It's tennis. They
became partners in learning the game at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned each day together, and still do. I had a concept, a
bigger picture than other Austrian coaches and the tennis
federation. The good Austrian players got spoiled early, given too
much money. They were content to be local heroes. We went off on
our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas, as you know, is not spoiled, although he's rich. He
does the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Muster's piercing blue eyes crinkle. ``I didn't like to start
working at first,'' he said. ``But when I got on the court ...
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ron met me I had a fair forehand, no backhand, just a
drop shot. We watched (Guillermo) Vilas's and (Henri) Leconte's
topspin backhands. That helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Muster's work ethic was clear as he rehabbed feverishly after
his left knee was injured in a 1989 auto accident, his career left
in rubble. Physicians couldn't believe it: He not only walked
normally but returned to the tour in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the hospital I was insecure about what would
happen to me, but I was impatient to play again,'' Muster said. So
impatient that he practiced while in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer does Muster, 31 in October _ as high as world
No. 1, now No. 24 _ want to goad and push himself, to run down
balls like a poor kid chasing quarters?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is complex,'' he said. ``You have to have the mind and
body working together like I did in '95, '96, '97.'' He hasn't
added a title this season to a career total of 44, third among
current laborers, behind Pete Sampras's 55 and Boris Becker's 49.
``You have to set your goals, and I haven't worked mine out this
year yet. Is there more very good tennis left in me? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the sound system is still working in Dolby stereo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made these awful noises since I was a boy. People didn't
like it. I tried to stop, like Monica Seles did. But I'm like her.
I couldn't play as well quieted down.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mozart were around, he'd love the Muster sounds _ tenor,
baritone, and bass. Maybe Wolfgang would call him the Pavarotti of
the Pavement and incorporate those tones in an opera called ``The
Magic Forehand,'' with Muster as the dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart could sympathize. Probably when he played the piano late
at night, the neighbors yelled, ``Shut up, Wolfie!''

   RILEY-EDUCATION (Seattle) U.S. Education Secretary Richard
Riley, in town for back-to-school pep talks, outlined a new
strategy for preventing school violence. In an interview, he said a
new ``early warning'' plan, soon to be announced by President
Clinton, calls for every school to have ``an openness for young
people to feel free to talk'' and to have a plan for predicting and
dealing with violent outbursts such as those in Springfield, Ore.
Riley also said a key to warding off violence is Clinton's pending
proposal to reduce average class sizes to 18 kids _ which would
give our state $236 million for construction and $180 million for
teachers. Riley said smaller classes are the top priority of
security officers in large urban disticts.

FDA, PFIZER DOWNPLAY VIAGRA DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least 69 Americans taking Viagra, the impotence medication,
died in the first four months it was on the market, according to
the US Food and Drug Administration's latest count. The
significance of that statistic is being hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA insists that Viagra is safe, even though the death toll
has risen by 30 since its last report a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several medical groups, meanwhile, say the rising toll
reinforces their calls for better labeling of the drug by its
manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., and greater caution by doctors
prescribing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer and FDA are saying in a cavalier and reckless way that
there's no problem,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the
consumer organization Health Research Group. ``The labeling on the
drug is completely unacceptable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association and American College of
Cardiology have also expressed concerns, saying Viagra could pose a
risk to more people than is indicated on its label.
</P>
<P>
   But other physicians, along with federal officials, say the
figure of 69 deaths is not that high, since more than 2 million men
have taken the drug, and that many were old enough perhaps to have
died from overexertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of data we've seen,'' added an FDA spokesman,
Brad Stone, ``it appears that Viagra is safe and effective when
used as indicated.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the concerns about Viagra's safety, it helps to
understand the avalanche of interest after the drug was released in
April. In just four months, 3.6 million prescriptions were written
and 30 million tablets dispensed, making it the most instantly
popular prescription medication ever.
</P>
<P>
   But is it safe?
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer insists that it is, although the label warns that
life-threatening low blood pressure can result if people taking
heart medicine containing nitrates also use Viagra. And it cautions
about cardiac risk for people taking the drug who have not been
sexually active.
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, the College of Cardiology and the Heart
Association warned that Viagra can be dangerous for a long list of
other patients, including ones with insufficient blood flow to the
heart, congestive heart failure combined with borderline low blood
pressure, or those taking several drugs for high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   It also urged special precautions for men with severe liver or
kidney problems, or those taking such drugs as erythromycin or
cimetidine.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups promise a more definitive statement by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FDA has been tracking Viagra-related
deaths, and released its latest figures this week. While reports
are sketchy, the agency said that through July of this year, it had
solid evidence of 69 patients who had died after taking the drug.
Two had strokes, 46 had heart attacks or cardiovascular troubles,
and the cause of death could not be determined for the remaining
21.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the deaths also varied: 25 died or had onset of
symptoms within five hours of using Viagra; 16 died or developed
symptoms within four days of use; and the time from ingestion to
death was unknown in the rest.
</P>
<P>
   To Wolfe, the consumer activist, the new data back up a petition
he filed last week asking the FDA to review Viagra's side effects
and strengthen its warning label.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy McCormick, a Pfizer spokesman, said that after four
months ``we haven't seen anything different in rare side effects
the way we sometimes do with new drugs.'' And the FDA's Stone said
that while the agency will review Wolfe's petition and the medical
groups' concerns, for now there is no reason to spell out
additional concerns on Viagra's label.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Graboys, who runs the Lown Cardiovascular Center at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, takes a middle ground on the safety
questions. On the one hand, he said, a certain number of deaths can
be expected, since millions of men are taking the drug, and many
are not used to sexual exertion. On the other, concerns about more
users being at risk than previously believed must be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is out and we're in a state of watchful waiting,''
Grayboys concluded. ``That requires doctors to spend a significant
time with patients discussing the implications of their problem, of
their impotence and the implication of using the medication.''

CHAN GAILEY HAS PIECES FOR COWBOYS RECONSTRUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jones can remember Dale Hansen's radio call from the 1992
Super Bowl like it was yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a span of four years, the Cowboys have gone from the
absolute worst to the absolute best. ... Dallas, your Cowboys are
champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jones had built the Cowboys from laughingstock losers when
he bought the team in 1989 to Super Bowl champions in 1992. The
Cowboys also won Super Bowl titles in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But's last season's 6-10 disaster not only seemed to bring
Jones' Cowboys full circle but rendered Hansen's celebrated call
obsolete. The awful performance, which saw the Cowboys end the
season with a five-game losing streak and finish fourth in the NFC
East after five consecutive division titles, affected Jones not
much differently than the blind-side hits quarterback Troy Aikman
had to endure during the grim season.
</P>
<P>
   For Jones to witness the Cowboys fall off their perch among the
league's elite to become losers again was like dropping the Vince
Lombardi Trophy and seeing it shatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in denial, maybe withdrawal,'' Jones said. ``It just
fell there in the final weeks like a splash of cold water.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also brought a splash of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones stood on the cold floor of Texas Stadium after the
season-ending loss to the New York Giants and started trying to
figure out how to piece his championship team back together, he
realized this wasn't 1989 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   With Aikman and all-pro defenders such as cornerback Deion
Sanders, defensive tackle Leon Lett and safety Darren Woodson in
place, Jones believed his task for 1998 was more of a renovation
than a rebuilding job.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began in February with the hiring of former
Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Chan Gailey and his
phone-book-thick playbook as head coach to replace Barry Switzer.
Jones said he felt the Cowboys' offense had gotten too predictable
and wanted to bring in an offensive-minded coach with a new system.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork also included the addition of seven new assistant
coaches, modifying the defensive scheme and upgrades at running
back, the offensive line and wide receiver with the free-agent
signings of Chris Warren, Everett McIver and Ernie Mills,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not in a rebuilding situation,'' Jones said. ``If I
thought we were in a rebuilding situation, I would have made
different decisions. But to get a coach like Chan and combining the
changes with already having a Super Bowl quarterback ... and a
Super Bowl-caliber defense, I felt we could have a dramatic
turnaround and be a playoff team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said one of the considerations during his search for a
head coach was to find someone who could fit the team's players
because he didn't want to make wholesale personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to pay the price of years of evolving,'' Jones
said. ``We didn't want to pay the price to evolve into a team that
better fit any coach's idea of what personnel ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Through personnel evaluations and outside recommendations, Jones
surmised that the Cowboys' problems last season were not based on
inferior talent.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Cowboys weren't as talented as the past
Super Bowl teams but said he believed they had far better than 6-10
talent _ especially when he compared Aikman, receiver Michael
Irvin, running back Emmitt Smith and his defense that ranked No. 2
in the league to what other NFC East teams had.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey came to the same conclusion. He said one of the benefits
in coming to the Cowboys was that he was getting an opportunity
with a team that had established stars in place. He said the
Cowboys' 37-7 blasting of his Steelers in last season's opener was
proof enough to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it firsthand,'' Gailey said. ``I didn't have to go
evaluate it. They had a lot of bad breaks after that game, and
things went against. But if everybody stays healthy..., we are
better than a 6-10 team. We got a solid nucleus of players.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, according to Jones, was putting that core group of
players in a new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Jones felt the old offense had become predictable and that
changing the offense would give the Cowboys a better chance to win.
Former offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese told Jones as much when
he offered his resignation after Switzer's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as important as getting into to the end zone is how you
get there,'' Jones said. ``In addition to Troy and Emmitt Smith
running and Michael Irvin catching, we needed a tangible weapon of
unpredictability. Chan brings us that imagination and creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who rushed for 1,204 yards in 1996 and 1,074 in 1997
after gaining a club-record 1,773 yards in 1995, agreed that a
change in style was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about time the rest of the league caught on to what we
were doing,'' Smith said. ``They sure had a lot of tape to watch.
And we needed to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Gailey and his array of end arounds, shotgun formations
and five-wide sets.
</P>
<P>
   The change for the Cowboys was like going from the fundamentals
of math to trigonometry. Out went the Cowboys' simplified attack,
based on power I-formation running, man-to-man blocking on the
offensive line and a precision passing game that featured timing
patterns and no adjustable pass routes.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's offense is based on the run as well, but uses zone
blocking on running plays, multiple formations, the shotgun, four-
and five-receiver sets and an audible system.
</P>
<P>
   The package is complex, but receivers coach Dwain Painter said
the premise is basic. The multiple formations cause defensive
adjustments, and the shotgun gives the quarterback more time to
throw the ball by spreading out the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Versatility is the key,'' Painter said. ``We want to run and
pass. But we want to be a physical football team and run the
football first. We want to use the speed and deceptive elements to
stretch the ball vertically and sideline to sideline. We want the
defense to prepare for a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Gailey long to figure out that his offense fit
the Cowboys' personnel. He says his central figures here are not
much different than they were in Pittsburgh, comparing Aikman,
Smith and Irvin to the Steelers' trio of quarterback Kordell
Stewart, running back Jerome Bettis and receiver Yancey Thigpen.
Gailey said the key for him was inserting David LaFleur in the
starting lineup ahead of Eric Bjornson because a big, blocking
tight end is crucial to the offense's success.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who admits he's a fan of the old offense, likes what he
sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives me some freedom to make some throws in this
offense that I couldn't in the past,'' Aikman said. ``This offense
gives us the ability to make bigger plays down the field. And it
allows me to use the field a little bit more. I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, his biggest adjustment is running more instinctively.
With zone blocking, Smith could start one way and end up on the
other side of the field. In the past, he would run to the
designated spot and trust that a hole would open.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Smith is still one of the league's top running
backs, but Gailey's first big move was deciding that the Cowboys
needed to add another back. Warren, Seattle's all-time leading
rusher, is a definite upgrade from Sherman Williams, last season's
backup. Warren's addition gives the Cowboys the team's best pair of
runners since Tony Dorsett and Herschel Walker shared the tailback
spot in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the Cowboys' offensive triumvirate, Irvin,
is also in for some changes. Though Irvin caught 75 passes last
season for 1,180 yards and nine touchdowns, Aikman had trouble
locating him at crucial times because of constant double-teaming.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey plans to free Irvin in his offense by moving him into the
slot, having him line up in the backfield and even having him catch
screen passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in favor of anything that will help us win and get me the
ball more,'' Irvin said. ``Chan is trying to do some things that
will get me some mismatches. And that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver and running back were only two of the areas that
Gailey said the Cowboys must improve. The others were the offensive
and defensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys attempted to improve the offense line by signing
McIver, mandating that guard Nate Newton lose weight and drafting
Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did two things to address the defensive line,
drafting defensive end Greg Ellis in the first round and shifting
their basic defensive alignment from a traditional 4-3 to a
modified 3-4 that is designed to close gaps in the the team's run
defense, which ranked 24th in the league last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, beyond the schemes and player additions, the Cowboys
know one of the biggest changes they must make is in their approach
to the game. Many of the team's problems _ especially inside the
opponent's 20-yard line where they ranked among the league's worst
in scoring touchdowns _ were because of poor execution, assignment
mistakes and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who has been lauded for his organized style and
disciplined ways, said handling those ``little things will make the
ultimate difference.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things that make the difference from 6-10 to 10-6,''
Gailey said. ``In general, that's how it always works.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are not ready to guarantee that all the changes will
work smoothly. They admit that questions abound, especially
regarding a consistent pass rush, consistency on the offensive line
and at No. 2 receiver, where Mills is competing with Billy Davis
for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys say they are encouraged by the team's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time there is change, there is renewed
enthusiasm,'' Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``The
change has given everybody a fresh outlook. Now that doesn't equate
to wins and losses. But it has brought about a renewed vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   It all has Jones feeling good about his effort to piece that
Lombardi Trophy back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't say now that we made all the right moves,'' Jones
said. ``To be what I consider a legitimate playoff team, we still
have a lot of questions to answer. However, I'm optimistic we will
answer those questions.''

AS RUSSIA'S CRISIS DEEPENS, PREMIER HURRIES TO SEE IMF CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
(bl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia confronts its worst financial crisis since
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ruble poised for a free
fall, Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made a sudden trip
to Ukraine on Wednesday to convince the head of the International
Monetary Fund not to cut off its next installment of credits.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the ruble's 9 percent drop Tuesday, anxious Russians
rushed to their banks Wednesday morning only to be given mixed
signals on when and how they can retrieve their savings. An early
round of dollar trading on the Moscow currency exchange was voided
Wednesday for the first time in the exchange's history, while the
ruble's value fell 40 percent against the German mark in a single
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Central Bank, under bitter attack at home and abroad
for its handling of the crisis, said Wednesday it could no longer
afford to protect the ruble. It reporting that it had already spent
$8.8 billion doing so in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the bank said it would not put limits on
currency transactions. Such a move, it said, would be a step back
to ``another economic model.''
</P>
<P>
   As the banking crisis threatens to engulf Russia's entire
financial system, the Central Bank took its first tough action
Wednesday by withdrawing the license of Bank AB Imperial, Russia's
13th-largest bank, which had reportedly defaulted on payments on
foreign loans earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday three major Russian banks announced plans to merge,
while six Moscow banks Wednesday said they would pool their
resources to end the deadlock of non-payments that has crippled
Russian banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's quick trip to the Crimean resort of Simferapol,
where IMF managing director Michel Camdessus was to meet Wednesday
afternoon with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, was seen as a
sign of Russia's growing concern that the IMF will refuse to issue
its next installment of $4.8 billion in credits, due to be reviewed
by the IMF's board in September.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery of the funds is now Russia's only hope for a new
injection of foreign aid, as Western leaders warned Wednesday that
it would be up to the Russian government to pull the country out of
its looming financial nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no shortcuts in restoring market confidence, and the
next steps are up to the Russia,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv
told reporters in Edgartown, Mass., where President Clinton was on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   That nightmare was already on the horizon for thousands of
Russian companies, caught between the ruble's downward spiral and a
gridlock in the Russian banking system. Several companies Wednesday
reported that their banks have not forwarded payments made by
customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They take money out of your account, and it may or may not
leave your bank, you don't know,'' said an director at a Russian
food processing plant. ``As a client of the bank, I don't care what
they are waiting for,'' said another Russian businessman who also
asked not to be identified. ``After one week of this, they are
killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin has made no further comment on the
crisis since a televised appearance Monday, when he gave a brief
explanation of his reappointment of Chernomyrdin, the man he had
fired as prime minister five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial and economic policy is a question to which I am
giving my attention minute by minute,'' Chernomyrdin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I am extremely dissatisfied with the work
of the central bank over the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chernomyrdin flew to Ukraine on Wednesday, leaders in
Russia's Parliament continued their public bargaining over the
future of his government and its policies. At a press conference
Wednesday, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, said the
Parliament was still working on its own anti-crisis plan, which he
said Chernomyrdin must endorse before his appointment can be
confirmed at a session now scheduled for Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be ready by next Monday afternoon,'' said Seleznyov,
referring to the anti-crisis document, ``but we would not want to
rush things since we are speaking about a very serious document.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Wednesday night, Seleznyov again
appealed for Yeltsin's resignation, a possibility that a Kremlin
spokesman dismissed earlier in the day as ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin on Tuesday told parliamentary leaders he was open
to a coalition government that would include members of the
Communist opposition, but Seleznyov has insisted that negotiations
over ministerial appointments come after adoption of a joint
strategy to handle the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday at a press conference if the Communist Party,
which holds the largest bloc in the Parliament, will join the new
government, Seleznyov said that the question had not yet been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While the political haggling over the new government continues,
financial analysts said Russia's financial situation was worsening
by the hour, with no clear policy from the Central Bank or the
government in sight.

<P>
   ``Some banks are really bankrupt,'' said Nikolai Gusev, a trader
at Regent European Securities, an investment company, ``and the
population is going to start withdrawing their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Russian savings accounts are held in
commercial banks _ with the rest in the giant government-controlled
Sberbank _ but much of these are held in several of the largest
banks now reported to be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear scheme for an operation transferring
deposits to Sberbank,'' said Gusev. ``There have been only words,
and no concrete words.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian banks were putting their walk-in customers
Wednesday on waiting lists, others were returning money in dribs
and drabs. ``You can call and check your place on the list, and
they don't allow people to cut the line as far as I can see,'' said
Pavel Mirovc, a 29-year-old sales consultant who was waiting in
line at downtown branch office of Most Bank. ``But of course I am
worried. They are giving out very little money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming every day,'' said a middle-aged woman, as
she and her husband were leaving the same bank early this evening.
``They give us our money little by little. But at least they are
giving something. But we've become part-time guards of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts attributed Tuesday's heaving trading on Moscow
currency exchange to the Central Bank's continued supply of credits
to Russia's troubled banks, and by its decision last week to lower
the banks' minimum capital requirements, which freed up ruble
reserves that the bankers then exchanged for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-crisis program, announced Aug. 17 by Chernomyrdin's
predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, included a 90-day moratorium on
payments of debts owed by Russia's commercial banks to foreign
lenders. Some Russian banks this week have said they will ignore
the moratorium and pay their debts, but with the fall in the ruble,
many foreign creditors have been left wondering where the other
banks will find the money to meet their debt payments when the
moratorium ends in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan to swap $40 million held in Russian
short-term Treasury bills for new longer term securities has also
left foreign investors with a bitter taste. But its main impact is
on Russian holders of the Treasury bills _ major banks, but also
pension and other investment funds _ which are now stuck with
assets that are worth less than their original value, and are less
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin on Wednesday tried to distance himself from the
debt restructuring plan, which was originally announced by the
Kiriyenko government. ``I would like people to understand us
correctly: this decision was predetermined,'' he said. ``In actual
fact, our task was only to formulate it, and we could not do
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to most analysts, the Central Bank has to take
decisive action to restore credibility to the financial system.
``What they have to do is limit rubles reserves, and start to close
down banks,'' said Holger Mueller, banking analyst at Fleming UCB,
an investment firm. ``They have to do it right now, and do it as
fast possible, because there is still value in these banks, and
they have to make sure there is no asset stripping.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Wednesday, Dmitry Vasilyev, chairman of
Russia's Federal Securities Commission, joined others in putting
the blame on the Central Bank, in particular a televised statement
by a top bank official on Aug. 12 who shocked viewers with the
announcement of a restriction on access to foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This caused a panic and huge requests for currency from legal
entities and the population,'' said Vasilyev. ``This drastically
destabilized the situation and ended with the government and
Central Bank statement of August 17. As a result we have an
extremely grave situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, it is possible that all that has happened on the
currency market, the actions of the Central Bank may merit an
investigation by law enforcement agencies,'' he added.

HAPPY ENDING IS JUST A MATTER OF CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upcoming Cowboys season is beginning to look a lot like one
of those children's books in which the reader gets to pick from two
different endings.
</P>
<P>
   There's the good ending, in which the hero prevails against evil
and rides off into the sunset with the Lombardi Trophy snuggled
close by his side.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the bad ending, in which everybody has to line up
and let Michael Irvin give them a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Just a little off the sides, Mike, and be careful of the ol'
Adam's apple there, OK? Had that baby a long time now and would
just as soon keep it a while longer, if you don't mind.
</P>
<P>
   This is how iffy this season looks. It could go either way, and
it could get there as fast as a pair of scissors can turn a
harmless wrestling match into a national incident.
</P>
<P>
   So you pick first.
</P>
<P>
   Ending No. 1? Or ending No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it could play out: Storyline No. 1 Coach Chan
Gailey's offense slowly but surely gathers momentum as the season
gets underway and, after a stuttering start that includes losses to
Arizona and Denver in the first two games, the Cowboys catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   First, they stun the Giants at the Meadowlands in the third week
of the season, kicking off a stretch in which they win eight of
nine games. A loss at Philadelphia on Nov. 2 is the only black mark
in that run.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman settles comfortably into Gailey's
offense and runs it to perfection. The offensive line, particularly
the left side where Larry Allen and a slimmed-down Nate Newton hold
court, once again becomes one of the best units in the NFL. Young
Flozell ``The Hotel'' Adams quickly emerges as one of the league's
rising young players, pushing Everett McIver for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin flourishes in the multiple-set offense. Confused
defenses can't seem to figure out where he's coming from, and
veteran Ernie Mills heads a committee of wideouts, including Billy
Davis and Jimmy Oliver, who give Aikman a variety of targets.
</P>
<P>
   The team's two-headed tight end setup of David LaFleur and Eric
Bjornson is equally effective, and LaFleur develops into one of the
league's best run blockers at his position.
</P>
<P>
   And run the football is what the Cowboys do, with relish and
abandon. Spelled by Chris Warren, Emmitt Smith displays fresh legs
and a rededication to his craft that vault him back among the
league's elite runners.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lett and Chad Hennings anchor a defensive line that grows
better each week. Rookie defensive end Greg Ellis gets his first
sack in New York and takes off from there. The Cowboys' speedy
linebacking corps covers the field from sideline to sideline and
the secondary, led by Deion Sanders and Darren Woodson, sustains
its reputation as one of the best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   By Thanksgiving Day, with Minnesota coming to town, the Cowboys
are 8-3 and have re-established themselves as Super Bowl
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings bring them back to earth with a Turkey Day upset at
Texas Stadium, but the Cowboys bounce back to win at New Orleans
and Kansas City, beat Philadelphia at home and square off against
the hated Redskins at Texas Stadium two nights after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   With the NFC East championship and the home-field advantage on
the line, Aikman leads the Cowboys down the field late in the
fourth quarter and hits Smith coming out of the backfield for the
game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs and the Super Bowl beckon. Storyline No. 2
</P>
<P>
   On the second Sunday of the season, after the Cowboys' crushing,
38-3 loss at the hands of the Broncos in Denver, a grim-faced
Gailey emerges from the locker room to announce that Aikman, who
had been carried from the field on a stretcher after being sacked
for the eighth time in the third quarter, will be lost for the
season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
</P>
<P>
   He also announces that Jason Garrett, mauled by Broncos'
defenders in the fourth quarter, will be out indefinitely with a
broken jaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' season rests in the hands of third-string
quarterback Danny Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we go on?
</P>
<P>
   Hounded by double and triple coverage because none of the
Cowboys' No. 2 receivers can get free, a frustrated Irvin gets into
repeated fistfights with opposing players and is suspended by the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Smith fights a multitude of nagging injuries and rarely plays.
Warren can't find running room behind an offensive line that has
grown too old and too soft.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur loses his starting position because he can't hang onto
the football, then regains it when Bjornson is lost with a
succession of leg and ankle injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense is repeatedly burned by deep passes because
it is forced to adopt a gambling, blitzing style to get pressure on
the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Ellis gets to an opposing quarterback is when he
gathers autographs during pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders abruptly leaves the team because he is ``called'' to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Ten games into the season, with his team the laughingstock of
the league at 1-9, Jerry Jones fires Gailey and makes himself
coach. The Cowboys fail to win another game.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1989 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Take your choice. Ending No. 1 or ending No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   Me? I'm opting for something in between, but I'll let the
Cowboys write the script for that one.

COWBOYS WILL SETTLE FOR MIDDLE OF THE PACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere between the 6-10 debacle of a year ago and their fans'
eternally lofty expectations sit the real 1998 Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran nucleus, yet a rookie head coach. A battle-tested
defense, yet a fickle pass rush. A running back who could awake and
run for 1,500 yards, yet a back whose starting days could be
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among the preseason football magazines seemed to
be that the Cowboys are yesterday's news. Their star has dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with most of the magazines is that because of
deadlines, they, too, are often yesterday's news. The Cowboys'
obituaries were more than likely written by the dim light of the
1997 bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   That team quit on its coach. That team couldn't run. That team
couldn't get to the end zone. That team just wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Angered and disenchanted, Cowboys fans demanded scapegoats.
Owner Jones, in no hurry, offered up the heads of head coach Barry
Switzer and offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, among others. Old
legs on the roster were urged to move along.
</P>
<P>
   Jones then brought in seasoned plug-ins _ Chris Warren, Everett
McIver, Ernie Mills and George Teague _ for another run at glory.
</P>
<P>
   A respectable strategy . . . if this were, say, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happened to that sleek silver dynasty that the
Cowboys had put together, the team that was supposed to win Super
Bowls for the rest of the century:
</P>
<P>
   It got distracted. It turned dysfunctional. It hit a speed bump
the size of a Norman, Okla., sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency ate away the fringes of the Cowboys' cathedral. The
golden icons remain _ some of them _ but for the most part Owner
Jones has simply vacuumed the aisles and put up the ``Under New
Management'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a Super Bowl team. If it reaches the playoffs, the
guess here is that it would say more about the NFC's rampant
mediocrity than about the ``rejuvenated'' Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the cast is solid, though ever-older. Troy Aikman,
Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders, Darren Woodson, Larry Allen and Leon
Lett would make a substantial foundation for any Super
Bowl-ambitious team.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Cowboys' case, the supporting cast is held together
by duct tape and dreams. In rookie defensive end Greg Ellis, new
coach Chan Gailey hopes he has the next Charles Haley, or even the
next Jim Jeffcoat. In veteran Ernie Mills and holdover Billy Davis,
Gailey hopes he has his No. 2 receiver problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey himself is a bit of a dream. After Switzer departed,
Owner Jones failed to produce a head coach from interviews and/or
get-togethers with ex-UCLA coach Terry Donahue and ex-49ers coach
George Seifert. He turned instead to the less-flashier, long-time
assistant Gailey, whose expertise is offense.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, unlike his successor, should not be a distraction on
this team. He is a football coach and talks like one. His ideas on
offense _ multiple wide-outs, shotgun, men in motion _ are
eye-catching for a guy whose boldest fashion statement remains a
ball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Cowboys, running back Emmitt Smith could make the
team's transition to Gailey easiest. Smith needs to return to
pre-1996 form and start finding the end zone again. If he doesn't,
there is Warren, who was deemed expendable in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There also remain questions on the offensive line, where the
burden has been placed on the modest shoulders of guard McIver and
center Clay Shiver.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the NFL schedule has been sympathetic to the
Cowboys' comeback struggle. By the first week of November, the
Cowboys will have played the likes of Arizona, Oakland, Chicago and
Philadelphia. A winning record at that point could mean another
slick elevator ride back up to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But that looms as an ambitious itinerary, especially to a team
coming off a joke of a 6-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   Elevator up? ... Or down?
</P>
<P>
   From here, it looks stuck on 8-and-8.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ With their pride still measured in megatons,
and with a strut still in their step after showing they can explode
bombs with the best of them, most of India's elite did not want one
of their own telling them that ``the air is thick with ugliness and
there's an unmistakable stench of fascism in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, she told them that the world now knows ``what a
tired, broken-hearted people we are,'' a people so in need of a
booster shot of self-esteem that ``we set up this crave clamoring
to be admitted to the club of superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   These severe assessments came from Arundhati Roy, who ascended
into international literary stardom last year with her first novel,
``The God of Small Things'' (Random House). A best seller in India,
America, Britain and elsewhere, it won the coveted Booker prize.
Indians were proud of her global renown.
</P>
<P>
   But early in August, a haunting 8,000-word essay by Ms. Roy,
``The End of Imagination,'' appeared as the cover story in two
popular Indian news magazines. Deeply personal, poetical and
unsparingly harsh, it lambasted the nation's main political parties
and called the bomb a ``final act of betrayal by a ruling class
that has failed its people.''
</P>
<P>
   India has long had a small, if spirited, antinuclear movement.
While others may have shown a more steadfast devotion to the cause,
the cameras these days mostly seem to follow the better-known Ms.
Roy, 38. She has spoken at peace rallies in New Delhi, Bombay and
Madras, and on Aug. 20, she risked her first personal appearance at
a place she expected to be hostile _ her alma mater, the Delhi
School of Planning and Architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, she was a fledgling architect, emotionally at war with
a college she considered stodgy and stifling. Though she was
trained as an architect, she has made her livelihood in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Invited now by a student group, she walked tentatively into the
circular art studio. A crowd of 150, most of them students seated
cross-legged on the floor, were fighting an indoor heat that had
them wilting like parched house plants. They greeted her without
applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a public speaker, and I don't trust myself to
extemporize much,'' she began apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   But she had prepared no speech. Instead, she said, she would
show them a British documentary about radiation poisoning of people
who live near India's nuclear power plants. Then she would read
excerpts from her long essay. Finally, she would take questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear weapons pervade our thinking,'' she read. ``Control
our behavior. Administer our societies. Inform our dreams. They
bury themselves like meat hooks deep in the base of our brains.
They are purveyors of madness. They are the ultimate colonizer.
Whiter than any white man that ever lived. The very heart of
whiteness.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on: ``If protesting against having a nuclear bomb
implanted in my brain is anti-Hindu and antinational, then I
secede. I hereby declare myself an independent, mobile republic. I
am a citizen of the earth. I own no territory. I have no flag.''
</P>
<P>
   She criticized the United States for bringing nuclear terror
into the world, but then said that India's decision in May to test
nuclear weapons forfeited its claim to higher ground: ``We're the
ones who have abandoned what was arguably a moral position: We have
the technology, we can make the bombs if we want to, but we won't.
We don't believe in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience had been politely silent, some of them awaiting
their chance to respond. Sandeep Sudhakaran, 19, was the first to
stand up. ``If Pakistan has a bomb, then we should have a bomb,''
he declared heatedly. ``The only way New Delhi can assure itself of
not being destroyed is to have a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Applause for the student was at least equal to that given the
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roy frowned. ``Here I am in a den of hawks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of her essay has been harsh. People have called her
naive, sentimental, unpatriotic. They accuse her of using her
writing talent for political objectives and of airing India's dirty
laundry. The essay has already been reprinted in Pakistan, England
and Germany and translated into Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Malayalam
and other Indian languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it so convenient for her to bash India when the world
is a ready audience, all ready to break into applause at anti-India
rhetoric?'' wrote a newspaper columnist, Shobori Ganguly. ``It is
intriguing that Roy should articulate the arguments of hand-picked
Western peaceniks, who are enormously comfortable with India as the
land of snake-charmers and fakirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roy, who lives in New Delhi, says there is no way to answer
such complaints: To her, the arguments for nuclear morality do not
breathe the same air as nuclear realpolitik. There is no room for
discussion, just the recognition of right and wrong. Her opinions
are nonnegotiable.
</P>
<P>
   As other students at the architecture school questioned her
reasoning _ and her motives _ she grew exasperated. ``You keep
saying that nuclear technology is here to stay,'' she said. ``I
say, well, so are we who are here to oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the-two-and-a-half-hour session was over, Ms. Roy had
seemed to make few converts. Even her great admirers, those who
stayed late to ask for an autograph or simply to get closer,
expressed their reservations about what she had said. Why had she
shown them a British documentary, with a ``white woman'' doing the
narration? How could she question the right of popularly elected
officials to make nuclear policy?
</P>
<P>
   Mohet Kumar, 23, a student clearly enamored of the guest
celebrity, followed her to the door, saying that, of course, she
was right and, of course, he agreed with much that she said. But
there was something bothering him, a question that he, like so many
of his friends, could not get past.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel if Pakistan had the bomb and we did not?''
he asked. ``How would a person be expected to feel then?''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the writer frowned.

drinking, was one that has been proposed several times over the
years, only to be postponed by opposition from alumni and faculty
with their own memories of freshman year in MIT fraternity houses _
a tradition that dates back to the school's earliest years.
</P>
<P>
   President Charles M. Vest made the decision reluctantly, and
students and some faculty continued to voice their opposition
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people have had excellent experiences living
in frats their freshmen year,'' said Steve Lefkowitz, a 20-year-old
junior at Beta Theta Pi &UR; . &LR;  ``Living closely with other guys who are
there with the intention of helping you in the transition into
school.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of Scott Krueger's death last September and
the sanctioning of Beta Theta Pi and four other fraternities in the
year since, officials said they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision, but it was one that needed
to be made,'' said Neal Dorow, MIT's adviser to fraternities and
sororities. ``It was the necessary thing to do, given the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County District Attorney's office is still
investigating Krueger's death at an MIT fraternity located in
Boston, and the school had received pressure from parents concerned
about their children living in fraternities.
</P>
<P>
   Since almost its earliest days as a downtown Boston campus in
the 1860s, MIT's fraternities have played an unusual role in
housing freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   At other schools, freshmen rush fraternities or sororities in
their first year, but do not live in Greek houses until at least
their second year. But a tight housing market in Boston and
Cambridge and the dearth of residence halls on campus made the
Greeks the residences of necessity for first-year students.
</P>
<P>
   The school's first fraternity was built in 1873, but its first
residence hall was not built until 1916 _ when there were already
21 fraternities. Today, the school has 10 residence halls and 38
fraternities, sororities, and so-called independent living groups.
It offers guaranteed housing to students for all four years, but
cannot house everyone in dormitories, so relies on Greeks for extra
room. The school plans to build a new residence hall on campus to
hold the freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities remain a fiercely cherished tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly why, even though it's been obvious this needs
to be done _ making the freshmen live on campus _ we haven't done
it,'' said one administrator who did not wish to be identified.
``Each time we proposed it, the students and the alums got so upset
about the end of tradition, that everyone's backed down. Scott
Krueger's death was a terrible reinforcement of these kinds of
concerns, but there have been other concerns to a lesser degree for
a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   A special working group on dangerous drinking, convened by Vest
after Krueger's death, reported in May that it ``strongly belives
that requiring freshmen to live on campus would reduce that
population's risk of being involved in dangerous drinking. Clearly,
on-campus housing for freshmen would not preclude their
participation in drinking, but it might help to reduce the
perceived social pressure for such activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Licensing Board gave an eight-month liquor license
suspension to Krueger's fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, after his
death, and over the past year, the board has sanctioned five other
fraternities.

US TO SCREEN CHEMICALS FOR POTENTIAL TO DEFORM HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disturbed by reports linking genital deformities and cancers to
common manmade chemicals, the US Environmental Protection Agency is
preparing a massive project to screen everything from pesticides to
plastics to cosmetics for substances that may invade the body by
posing as hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Timm, senior technical adviser to the EPA's chemical
control division, said Wednesday his agency would screen 15,000
chemicals by the end of 1999 to develop a ``suspect list'' of
chemicals that behave like estrogen and other hormones that govern
development of female and male sexual traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very controversial issue at the cutting edge of
science,'' said Timm, speaking at the American Chemical Society's
national meeting Boston, but ``it is at least a compelling
hypothesis that deserves additional study.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA study, which ultimately could cost the chemical industry
tens of millions of dollars, follows reports of shrunken alligator
penises, declining male sperm counts and other sex organ problems
that biologist Theo Colborn attributed to the proliferation of
synthetic chemicals in her 1996 book, ``Our Stolen Future.''
</P>
<P>
   Colborn theorized that the rise of pesticides such as DDT, along
with the increased use of plastics and other chemicals since World
War II, has exposed almost everyone to substances that the body
mistakes for the female hormone estrogen, its male counterpart,
androgen, or other hormones. She called these pervasive chemicals
``endocrine disruptors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into your new car and you smell that synthetic
leather, maybe you are breathing'' an endocrine disruptor, said Dr.
Ana M. Soto of Tufts University Medical School, one of the original
scientific supporters of Colborn's view.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis holds that during fetal development and in
puberty, these endocrine disruptors may block the functioning of
key genes, disrupting animal and human sexual development and
causing other problems such as poor hearing or, later in life,
certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But proving the endocrine disruptor theory is extremely
difficult, in part because so little scientific attention has been
paid to the health effects of seemingly inert materials such as
plastic. In addition, some of the reported effects, such as the
notion that male sperm counts are declining, turned out to be
contentious and peppered with contradictory studies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if estrogen mimics are bad, skeptics asked, why don't
estrogen-like chemicals in vegetables cause problems?
</P>
<P>
   However, even skeptics agree that manmade chemicals have
disrupted development among some animals, producing small penises
in the male alligators of Lake Apopka in Florida, for example.
Recently, some studies have suggested that such chemicals may play
a role in human disease and deformity. The Centers for Disease
Control reported last December that the US incidence of
hypospadias, where the urethra is improperly located in the male
penis, almost doubled from 1968 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. John Brock of the CDC found a five-fold increase in
non-Hodgkins lymphoma among women who were exposed to the highest
levels of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, a now-banned
insulator fluid that mimics estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Timm of the EPA said his agency is developing a comprehensive
set of tests to see which chemicals, if any, actually disrupt human
hormonal function. The first test, he said, will determine which of
15,000 chemicals can bind to estrogen, androgen or thyroid
receptors, the molecular doorways that allow the hormones inside
cells. Once the EPA has a ``suspect list,'' the chemicals will
undergo more tests, costing about $200,000 each, to be paid for by
the manufacturers. A third round of tests on the chemicals' effects
on rodents, fish, and other lab animals will cost $2 million each.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the pace of endocrine disruptor research is
picking up. A major National Academy of Sciences review of
endocrine disruptors is due in September, and federal agencies are
underwriting 396 endocrine disruptor projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Tufts' Soto, who worked on the Academy of Sciences review,
said politicians shouldn't wait for all the research before
protecting people from exposure to endocrine disruptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a policy decision, and I hope it is going to
be made soon because the science won't come for many years,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific: Asian turmoil chips away at stock price
 &HT;    By Cynthia Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Asia's chilly economic winds are buffeting the
overall stock market, but they've hit paper and forest products
stocks with gale force.
</P>
<P>
   And because of its relatively high debt levels and operating
capacity _ what analysts call operating and financial leverage _
the stock of Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s paper, pulp and building
products business is taking a bigger hit than most of its
competitors. The business trades as Georgia-Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
   Since hitting a high of $81 May 12, Georgia-Pacific Group's
stock has skidded nearly 42 percent, falling to 52-week lows
several times over the past month. On Wednesday, it closed at
$47.12 1/2, down $1.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other major forest products companies also have hit
52-week lows in August, including the country's biggest,
Weyerhaeuser.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these stocks last traded at these prices in the winter _
again over concerns about Asia's economic crisis, which came to a
head last fall. But they started climbing this spring, spurred by
strong first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying, 'Gee, we heard Asia was a problem, but we
don't see it yet.' So everybody assumed Asia wasn't relevant,''
explained Sherman Chao, one of the sector's most bearish analysts.
``Some forecasters were thinking if it hasn't happened now, it's
not going to. But now it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Chao is advising clients to sell Georgia-Pacific, Champion
International and Weyerhaeuser.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's impact is most glaring in the markets for paper and wood
pulp, which accounts for about 60 percent of the cost of making
paper. The two areas made up 43 percent of Georgia-Pacific's sales
of $12.97 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have U.S. exports to Asia dropped at double-digit
rates, but the region's weak currencies mean cheaper imports are
flooding the United States as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The world's pulp and paper manufacturers are
chasing a smaller market, so prices have been pushed down. Pulp
prices have fallen 7 percent to 10 percent from year-ago levels,
depending on the grade, and uncoated white paper has dropped as
much as 17.5 percent for a standard 50-pound roll, according to
Pulp &AMP; Paper Week.
</P>
<P>
   The trends are expected to continue through at least the rest of
this year, with most analysts lowering their earnings estimates for
the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier cycles, however, industry watchers are comforted
by the factcompanies are getting smarter about taking production
downtime to dampen the decline, rather than continuing to flood an
unreceptive market, which just makes prices worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the pulp market, which is a money loser at current industry
prices, Georgia-Pacific has made the most dramatic move _ one much
welcomed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, the country's second-largest maker of market pulp
said it was indefinitely shutting down 24 percent of production, or
500,000 tons a year. Most of that is coming from mothballing the
market pulp operations at its Ashdown, Ark., and Port Hudson, La.,
mills, which will result in a $15 million charge to third-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Market pulp refers to pulp sold to other companies, as opposed
to what companies produce for their own paper-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economic downturn in Asia and its weaker currencies,
Southern hardwood market pulp is not a viable product,''
Georgia-Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Pete Correll explained
when announcing the closings.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney analyst Chip Dillon has estimated the
reduction amounts to 3 percent of the global hardwood market and
1.5 percent of the overall pulp market _ and a much bigger chunk of
the industry's unused capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Paper struggling
</P>
<P>
   While the prices for communications papers and containerboard
were better than they were in the year-ago second quarter, they're
also down compared with previous quarters and are expected to
continue heading lower.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Georgia-Pacific has taken downtime in the first and
second quarters for those areas as well, and says it's continuing
to do so this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that we will do whatever is necessary to address
adverse changes in particular markets,'' said Georgia-Pacific
spokesman Ken Haldin. ``That has continued to be our approach to
ensure we stay competitive in those segments and to make sure we
can stay economically viable.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the current low stock prices mean
it's a good time to buy or a good time to bail. Of the 16
Georgia-Pacific Group analysts surveyed by Multex Professional
Investment Review, half say neither, having issued ``hold''
recommendations. Two are advocating selling, and six think it's a
good time to scoop up more.
</P>
<P>
   Multex calls the stock ``a contrarian's dream,'' given the
sector as a whole is unattractive and Georgia-Pacific's stock is
doing worse relative to the rest.
</P>
<P>
   To the bullish analysts, it's the longer view that's more
important. They're encouraged by the companies' efforts to wring
out excess costs, improve efficiencies and rein in capacity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies increased capacity by just 1.9 percent last year,
according to the American Forest &AMP; Paper Association's annual
year-end survey, and planned to keep expansion at an average of
just 1.2 percent a year through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And the Asian crisis has forced Asian competitors to halt their
massive investments in new capacity.
</P>
<P>
   There's also industry consolidation through asset sales and
mergers:
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Abitibi-Price merged with Stone Consolidated in a $4
billion transaction in May 1997
</P>
<P>
   In August, James River Corp., maker of Brawny paper towels and
other consumer paper products, struck a $7 billion merger agreement
with Fort Howard, the largest commercial and industrial tissue
maker
</P>
<P>
   This past March, Bowater agreed to buy Avenor, another Canadian
newsprint maker, for $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're struggling with cyclical concerns about
demand, but that restrained capacity should remain in place
substantially longer and be a big long-term benefit,'' said
Prudential Securities analyst Mark Rogers, one of the bulls. ``I
think the worst of the bad news is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s timber business, which trades as Timber
Group, isn't affected by the global markets nearly as much _ a big
reason Georgia-Pacific Corp. separated it from its highly cyclical
paper and building products businesses last December.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months since it opened at $25, Timber Group has
traded mostly in the low to mid $20s, closing at $21.50 Wednesday.
Eight out of the 10 analysts that cover it have a ``buy'' rating on
the stock.

 &HT;    Facing possible pilot walkout, Northwest scrubs a few flights
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Northwest Airlines is canceling some flights Friday
and Saturday in preparation for a possible pilot strike that could
also affect the carrier's 1,800 mechanics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota-based airline said Wednesday it will scrub 170 of
1,700 flights Friday and an additional 230 Saturday, even if the
strike is averted.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are free to strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, when a
30-day deadline expires.
</P>
<P>
   Last-ditch negotiations between Northwest and its Air Line
Pilots Association unit continued Wednesday amid conflicting
indications of progress.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to President Clinton told Bloomberg News the president
probably wouldn't block a walkout at Northwest, as he did when
American Airlines pilots tried to strike in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, the nation's fourth-biggest airline and a dominant
carrier in the Midwest and on U.S.-Asia routes, said the advance
cancellations will ensure planes are positioned for an orderly
shutdown and quick resumption of service.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has only 16 daily flights from Hartsfield
International Airport, a tiny market share. Four of Friday's
canceled flights involve Atlanta departures. They are flights 494
and 498 to Detroit; 827 to Memphis; and 731 to Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, three Atlanta-bound flights are canceled: Flight
493 from Detroit; and flights 736 and 738 from Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will be rebooked on other flights or will get
refunds, Northwest said. (A full list of canceled flights is posted
on Northwest's Web site, http://www.nwa.com.)
</P>
<P>
   While a strike wouldn't disrupt travel for many Atlantans, it
could spill over to the 1,800 mechanics at Northwest's maintenance
hangar at Hartsfield. They are members of the International
Association of Machinists, which is also locked in long-running
contract talks and could be asked by the pilot union to honor
picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ALPA hasn't made such a request. If it does, mechanics
would have to decide individually whether to honor it, a Machinists
spokesman said, because the union cannot legally wage a sympathy
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has warned non-pilot workers they could be fired for
joining the strike. It also says layoffs will begin early next week
if the strike persists.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has lobbied for presidential intervention to prevent a
strike. But the carrier is less far-flung than American, which the
Clinton aide cited as the reason such action is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation consultant Mike Boyd thinks there's another reason:
American's pilots belong to an independent union, while ALPA is
part of the AFL-CIO, a major Democratic supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton won't step in this time,'' Boyd predicted. ``He can't
deny the right to strike to an AFL-CIO union. If he did, Democrats
would have an out-of-body experience.''

MALAYSIA JAILS OPPOSITION LEGISLATOR FOR CRITICIZING JUDICIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ An opposition member of Parliament has
been imprisoned on a charge of sedition for criticizing the
Malaysian judiciary, raising questions about the limits of free
speech here.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament member, Lim Guan Eng, began serving a three-year
term on Tuesday after losing his final appeal in a case involving a
pamphlet he published in 1995 called ``The True Story.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, he questioned the government's decision not to press
statutory rape charges against a politician while holding the
15-year-old girl involved in ``protective custody'' for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International
criticized the ``arbitrary and selective'' use of sedition and
publishing laws ``to intimidate those who express dissenting
opinions and to engender public reluctance to criticize those in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media are tightly restricted in Malaysia and politics
is dominated overwhelmingly by the governing party of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Political commentators and ordinary
citizens choose their words carefully when they talk about
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have indicated in the past their sensitivity to
criticism, and Judge Gopal Sri Ram reflected this attitude in
announcing an earlier decision in the case, when he said, ``It is
time that the court sends a clear message that it cannot tolerate
any attack on the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement in Geneva last month, the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, representing members of parliaments in countries around the
world, criticized the original court ruling and ``the limits it
sets to the scope of the right to freedom of speech, in particular
to the right and the duty of the elected representatives of the
people to exercise their essential oversight function of the
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim, 38, who is deputy secretary general of the opposition
Democratic Action Party and has been a member of Parliament for 12
years, is the first sitting member to be sent to prison. Under
Malaysian law, a jail term of more than 12 months will cost him his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My political career may have terminated, but my political
struggle will go on,'' Lim said before being handcuffed and led
from the courthouse. ``I have no regrets in what I did. A rape
victim must be protected by the police and authorities and not
detained by authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Lim Kit Siang, who heads the opposition party in
Parliament, said the case raised the question of ``whether members
of Parliament should be able to speak up against injustices or
whether they should just be robots with no mind of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim was convicted last year of sedition and printing ``false
news'' for criticizing the decision not to press charges against
Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a former chief minister from Lim's home
state of Malacca and a member of the governing party, the United
Malays National Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said that other men alleged to have had
sexual relations with the girl were prosecuted but that officials
insisted they did not have enough evidence to proceed against Chik.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who acknowledged the sexual encounters, was held in a
center for ``wayward girls'' despite continued efforts by her
grandmother to gain her release, the organization said. The girl
gave birth while in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Lim became involved in the case when the girl's grandmother
sought his help in trying to obtain her release.

AMWEST-FINE (Phoenix) - An internal FAA memo shows that the agency
documented serious problems in America West Airlines maintenance
operations beginning in 1995, and that the agency gave the airline
two ``fresh starts'' before finally hitting America West with a
record fine this summer. The memo contradicts statements by America
West that the FAA's fine resulted mainly from problems of
paperwork, and raises new questions about the airline's decision to
contract its maintenance to an outside company. The memo is part of

VACATIONING PRESIDENT KEEPS LOW PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Under gray skies, President Clinton secluded
himself in his borrowed vacation house again Wednesday, presumably
reading and talking and continuing ahead with what the White House
has described as the healing process within the first family.
</P>
<P>
   From morning until night, Clinton stayed at his compound, far
from cameramen and reporters. The best his spokesman offered in
terms of insight was a list of books Clinton brought to the
Vineyard with him when he arrived last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some aides had broadly hinted that Clinton planned to play golf
Wednesday, which, in sharp contrast to past years when he played
roughly every other day, would have made it the first round of this
trip. There was no known reason why his game never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton is scheduled to fly to Worcester for a 10:30
a.m. speech on school safety issues. At the event, he also plans to
highlight a federal scholarship program that provides tuition aid
to students who go on to become police officers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester speech is expected to draw several hundred
supporters, and will be Clinton's first lengthy public appearance
since his admission on Aug. 17 that he carried on an extramarital
affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and then
lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the Worcester speech,
presumably scheduled at the urging of some political strategists,
would not hinder Clinton's attempts to make peace with Hillary
Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that this is going to interfere with the healing
process that's going on,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated that it is not likely Clinton will
address the Lewinsky relationship in any way, and fended off
criticisms from some key Democrats that Clinton's actions were
``reprehensible'' and that he ought to offer the public an explicit
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the president has spoken to that,'' Toiv said, referring
to the Aug. 17 speech.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton huddles inside his house, he is also likely preparing
for his trip to Moscow and Ireland, which begins on Monday. The
White House announced Wednesday that Clinton will visit the town of
Omagh in Northern Ireland, the site of the gruesome bombing earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's reading list includes ``Good Work,'' a Los
Angeles-based mystery by Michael Connelly; a heavier tome called
``The Burning of Washington'' by Anthony S. Pitch, about the
British invasion of 1814; ``Eureka Street,'' by Robert McLiam
Wilson; and ``The Marriage of Sense and Soul'' by Ken Wilber, about
the compatability of science and religion.

BUSH TOURS DEVASTATION AS WHITE HOUSE DECLARES BORDER TOWN A
DISASTER AREA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ The White House on Wednesday declared this
flood-stricken border town a disaster area, an announcement that
came moments after Gov. George W. Bush toured the devastation and
visited a shelter housing hundreds of people left homeless by
raging waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that nature can overpower humans,'' said Bush.
``And it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster declaration means federal assistance for the people
of Del Rio, including unspecified amounts for housing grants and
low-cost loans for both businesses and individuals. It comes just
weeks after the government declared the entire state a disaster
area because of a severe summer-long drought.
</P>
<P>
   The governor praised the Clinton administration for acting
swiftly in dealing with the flood, saying, ``Everything that can be
done is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   While the disaster relief signified the beginning of what
promises to be a long rebuilding effort, rain Tuesday night
triggered more evacuations, and the number of people unaccounted
for in the flash floods surged to 54, renewing fears that the death
toll of 14 across Texas and the Mexican border might rise.
</P>
<P>
   Under partly cloudy skies Wednesday, authorities expressed
confidence that the number of people unaccounted for would dwindle
as locals reconnected with family and friends and realized those
reported missing were fine. However, they said they felt they had
exhausted efforts to locate at least 14 of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, search and rescue workers continued to comb San Felipe
Creek, which Sunday night and early Monday unleashed a torrent that
nearly submerged an entire neighborhood. State authorities said 300
homes in Del Rio were destroyed while another 700 suffered damage.
</P>
<P>
   The number of residents in three temporary shelters rose to
about 1,700 after the Tuesday night evacuation, which focused on
the drier sections of the San Felipe neighborhood. The heart of the
neighborhood, very nearly washed away in the floods, is today a
place of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the water has receded, the brush has become more visible,''
said Bush. What officials fear, he said, is finding bodies in the
tangle of trees and piles of rubble that line either side of the
creek.
</P>
<P>
   Triggered by heavy rains from Tropical Storm Charley that came
ashore on the Gulf Coast, the floods swept south from the Hill
Country to Del Rio and neighboring Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. Six
people, all but one who has been identified, died in this town
while three are known dead in Acuna.
</P>
<P>
   The water, much of which emptied into the Rio Grande, was
expected to crest well above flood stage in Laredo in the early
evening Wednesday but was not predicted to cause near the
devastation seen in Del Rio. Still, some 800 people living along
the river were reported to be in shelters by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And authorities closed the city's border crossings for the first
time since the 1960s because of torrential rains. With 5,000 to
6,000 trucks crossing its three international bridges daily, Laredo
is the busiest commercial land port in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Maverick County, which lies between Del Rio and Laredo, some
5,000 people were evacuated, but no injuries were reported in the
flood waters that surged through Eagle Pass and surrounding areas
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican radio Wednesday said an additional three men who had
been sleeping beneath the international bridge connecting Acuna to
Del Rio had drowned. Many of the city's poor ``colonias,'' where
people often live in tar-paper shacks, were swept away, leaving
thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed his concern for Acuna, saying, ``There are no
borders when it comes to human life.'' But the governor's sympathy
was most directly conveyed to Del Rio residents, most of them from
the historic San Felipe neighborhood, a place of tidy adobe homes
before the flood.
</P>
<P>
   The floods knocked out the city's water system, leaving the town
of 34,000 with no drinking water and causing health officials
considerable concern. City officials reinstalled the pumps and
purifying system Tuesday, only to pull it out again for fear of
more floods Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials do not expect to have potable water for several more
days. In the meantime, they are relying on several hundred thousand
gallons of water a day being trucked in through private and public
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After a helicopter tour of San Felipe and Cienegas Terrace, a
nearby community also hit hard, Bush made his way to the civic
center, where the Red Cross reported giving shelter to as many as
950 people Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There, the governor heard stories of women holding their
children in waist deep water at night, hearing nothing but the
rushing current and the screams of their neighbors. One woman,
Diana Ortiz, told Bush that she lost everything and did not know
what would become of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   To Ortiz and others the governor replied that he was seeking
federal help, which was later granted. Mostly he said, ``I'm
sorry,'' in one case hugging a teary-eyed elderly woman, Paula
Yanes, who was hard of hearing and without any known friends or
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was holding back my tears the whole time,'' Bush told Del
Rio Mayor Robert Chavira after circling the civic center floor for
about 30 minutes. Later the governor said, ``The human stories are
compelling and my heart breaks for the families who went from a
nice, secure home to no home at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said those who lost their homes would likely
be housed in mobile homes in the coming days. For now they're
sleeping on cots in the civic center, where shock in some cases is
turning to despair.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Cardenas, who spoke with the governor, said she ventured
back to San Felipe on Tuesday to get a glimpse of her modest home.
She found the refrigerator in a room other than the kitchen and a
foot of mud on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to start all over again,'' she said. ``There's no
way we can rebuild there. I don't think I would be comfortable.
What we need is higher ground.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: POLITICS ASIDE, CENSUS SAMPLING RAISES QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm)  
By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A panel of three federal judges delivered a blow to Democrats
this week when it ruled that sampling techniques planned for the
2000 census violated federal law. The issue is far from dead,
though, as the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats embrace sampling _ data derived from a small set of
households _ to supplement census information gathered door to door
and through the mail. They believe it would add millions of blacks,
Hispanics and poor to the census rolls. That would lead to billions
of dollars of additional federal spending in Democrat-controlled
districts and perhaps a dozen or more additional Democratic seats
after congressional districts are redrawn. The Republicans loathe
sampling for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is about something more difficult, and less
partisan, than politics. The handful of statisticians who have
mastered the ferocious mathematical and practical complexities are
split over the usefulness of sampling. William Kruskal, former
chairman of the statistics department at the University of Chicago,
speaks for many of his colleagues when he admits that ``no one
really knows.''
</P>
<P>
   A middle ground, using sampling techniques for parts of the
census and not for others, makes perhaps the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau proposes three uses of sampling. One sample
would focus on a small group of households that fail to mail in
their census forms or to respond to repeated visits by census
takers, and then use statistical techniques to reach a description
of all nonresponding households. Most experts appear to agree that
this use of sampling is a sensible way to cut the soaring costs of
conducting the census without sacrificing accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The second proposed use, to correct for the undercount of
minorities and poor people, draws more criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census underestimated the population by less than 2
percent. But it underestimated the number of blacks by more than 4
percent and the number of Hispanics by about 5 percent. Likewise,
it missed more renters than homeowners and more poor families than
rich.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau proposes to fix this problem by conducting a
follow-up survey of 750,000 households. The bureau would compare
the two surveys to determine, for example, how many urban blacks
appeared in the follow-up survey but not the first _ an indication
of how many were missed in the initial census. The bureau would
then use a complicated series of calculations to estimate what
portions of several dozen demographic groups were initially missed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, like professor David Freedman of the University of
California at Berkeley, say the sampling procedure is fraught with
problems. What if someone moves, shows up on the rolls of the
second survey but appears nowhere in the initial census? Was he one
of the millions of uncounted Americans? Perhaps not. He might have
been accounted for by the proposed statistical correction for
nonresponding households (the first use of sampling) even without
ever having filled out a form.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an even trickier problem. Sampling could improve the
census count for every state, yet damage the overall value of the
census. That's because the important census figures, in terms of
funding and congressional representation, are not the absolute
numbers for each state and county, but rather their respective
shares of the national population. After all, there will be 435
House seats no matter how many people are counted.If sampling does
a better job locating missing households in one state than in
another, the distribution of House seats and federal spending could
be made less fair.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that the initial census misses 1,000 black households in
Harlem and 100 black households in Phoenix because of evasive
households and less-than-diligent census takers. The follow-up
sample will be plagued by similar problems. What if it turns up,
say, only 50 of the missing black households in Harlem but 75 of
the missing households in Phoenix. Then each state's population
count will improve, but Arizona's share of the total population
will be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau says its elaborate models can handle these problems.
Besides, none of the critics has shown that sampling would do more
harm than good, the bureau says.
</P>
<P>
   Most statisticians agree that sampling can improve the counting
of minorities and poor in areas as large as congressional districts
and states. But many are unwilling to conclude the small follow-up
sample can yield accurate estimates for small areas, say the size
of census blocks (about 30 households). One intriguing option would
be to use sampling to correct estimates for states and
congressional districts, but not for smaller areas. After all, no
important policy depends on accurate counts of small areas.
</P>
<P>
   Politics may scuttle any such middle-ground resolution. The
bureau is worried about how Congress would respond to census data
that show state population totals higher than the sum of population
figures for each census block in the state. Call this the Lotus
1-2-3 dilemma: The bureau's rows and columns would not add up _ and
Republicans on Capitol Hill would no doubt scream that the bureau
was counting fictitious people.
</P>
<P>
   And if the bureau goes the other route, applying corrections to
small areas, it will be prey to a court challenge, most likely by
Republicans, that could throw out all statistical attempts to
account for missing minorities.  &QL;

LIBYA SIGNALS ACCEPTANCE OF PLAN TO TRY LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In guarded language, Libya has apparently
accepted an American and British proposal that two Libyan suspects
in the bombing of a Pan Am jet in 1988 be tried in the Netherlands
by Scottish judges. The acceptance came in a statement read
Wednesday night on Libyan television and circulated by the official
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the one-page statement was there any promise to turn
over the two suspects, and further Libyan delays are widely
expected, but an agreement in principle among the Libyans, British
and Americans on how to proceed with the trial would be the first
major breakthrough in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan statement said only that the government would ``deal
positively'' with the American and British offer ``and give it the
interest and care it deserves.'' Libya also demanded a complete end
of the sanctions imposed on the country in 1992; Washington has
proposed suspending the curbs as a first step.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and the Arab League, where the
proposal originated, reacted cautiously to the announcement,
sensing that there may be further demands by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Libyans indicated that they had not finished
studying the proposals. In one passage, as circulated in English by
the official news agency, Libya seeks proof that the proposals
``are free from any conditions laid down by the governments of the
United Kingdom and the United States to impede the holding of the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   British and American diplomats say that the plan is
straightforward: All Libya needs to do is turn over the suspects,
and then justice will take its course.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan announcement was a response to a proposal formally
offered on Monday. The proposal included a resolution presented to
the United Nations that would suspend sanctions when the two
suspects reach the Netherlands but would also threaten further
steps if the Libyans failed to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi asked the Council to
postpone voting on the British and American resolution; the vote
may come on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the Scottish judiciary would establish an
unusual offshore court in a still undecided location in the
Netherlands. The explosion of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 270
people died, took place over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council, Ramadan Barg, Libya's
charge d'affaires at its U.N. mission, said Libyan judicial
authorities needed ``sufficient time'' to study the plan and other
relevant documents, which are being translated into Arabic. But the
Libyans got no support for a delay from Arab nations or members of
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no decision to delay anything,'' said Danilo Turk,
Slovenia's representative and this month's Security Council
president, when asked about the Libyan letter after Wednesday's
session.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's request for more time was seen by some diplomats here as
a last-ditch attempt by Gadhafi to avoid exposing intelligence
agents to scrutiny in a foreign court.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans also want to draw Secretary-General Kofi Annan into
the deliberations, further holding up movement toward a trial. Some
Arab diplomats say Gadhafi wants assurances that questions at the
trial will involve only Lockerbie, and that his intelligence
network, which many accuse of supporting terrorism, will not be
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In Edgartown, Mass., a spokesman for the vacationing President
Clinton said Wednesday that the United States was losing patience
with Libya. ``Libya must comply promptly,'' said the spokesman,
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League, where the proposal for a Scottish trial in the
Netherlands originated, obliquely warned the Libyans against
obstructing the compromise, which Gadhafi endorsed in January
before the United States and Britain adopted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Libya has counted on the support of the Arab, African and
nonaligned countries to bring about a solution to this problem,''
Hussein Hassouna, the Arab League's representative at the United
Nations, said in an interview Wednesday before the Libyan
announcement. ``I don't expect them to take a position that will
lose them this support in coming phases of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gomersall, the deputy British representative, said he
was ``very encouraged'' by the support for their proposal that
Britain and the United States were getting around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Libyan government obviously has the right to study the
text,'' Gomersall said. ``But the Libyan government has also had
access to legal expertise on the Scottish system for a long time.''
The proposal to try the Libyan suspects in the Netherlands in front
of Scottish judges had been discussed for months before it was made
public in July.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Hauser, an international lawyer and former American
delegate to the United Nations who is now chairman of the
International Peace Academy, described the promotion of the
proposal by Britain and the United States as a ``highly creative''
move that had caught the Libyans off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other case where a country was willing to
move an entire court to another country in this way,'' she said.
``Libya probably thought that the U.K. and the U.S. would never
agree to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and London had earlier insisted that the two
suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifa Fhimah, be
tried in the United States, the home of most of the victims, or in
Scotland. The midair explosion killed 259 people on the plane _ 189
of them Americans _ and 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gomersall said Wednesday that there was no time limit
set on Libya's accepting or rejecting the proposal, the American
and British resolution now taking shape in the Security Council
puts pressure on the Libyans to accept, or face wider sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   There was also pressure on the United States and Britain to make
the offer before a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement in South
Africa. At the meeting, which begins this weekend, more than 100
nations are expected to follow the lead of the Organization of
African Unity and declare they will no longer abide by sanctions
against Libya, even if there is no movement in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain, which have seen enthusiasm for
sanctions eroding, could not afford to see the erosion of the
limited sanctions _ bans on air travel to Libya and on some imports
from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hassouna, of the Arab League, said Arab and African nations had
welcomed the British and American offer as ``the best practical way
to bring about an early solution to this crisis that has been going
on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has left, on one hand, the families of the victims not
having their legal redress,'' he said, ``and on the other hand, a
whole country suffering from the hardship of sanctions because just
two suspects were not brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya also has an outstanding case with France. In 1989, UTA
Flight 772 was blown up over Niger, killing 171 people. The French
accused Libya of plotting the explosion, and the case remains
unresolved.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
! 1/2 ``The Avengers''  Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman look cool as
John Steed and Emma Peel, those unflappable defenders of the
British Empire on '60s TV. But the film is clueless when it comes
to capturing the twinkling subterranean interplay between them as
they save the world and pretend not to notice. And Sean Connery
seems surprisingly uneasy as the heavy, a Scottish meteorologist
whose ranting contributes to the dead space. (PG)
<TEXT>
<P>
   (FR)!! &UR; 1/2 ``Blade''  &LR; This film of a gothic comic begins
interestingly as Wesley Snipes's fearless vampire hunter comes
closer than any previous American action star has to Hong Kong's
acrobatic supermen. But the film degenerates into empty special
effects that relegate it to big-screen video game status. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! &UR; 1/2 ``Dance with Me''  &LR; A clunky soap opera plot is carried by
sizzling dance moves, smartly photographed by Randa Haines. Imagine
``Flashdance'' and ``Strictly Ballroom'' with lots of salsa added
and you'll get the idea. Vanessa Williams projects intensity,
Puerto Rican pop star Chayanne steals the movie with his sunny,
boyish, sexy charm. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   !!! &UR; ``Gadjo Dilo''  &LR; A French musicologist searching for a
legendary gypsy singer is won over to the gypsy way of life,
although filmmaker Tony Gatlif never minimizes its harshness. The
cast of mostly real Romanian gypsies all but explodes from the
screen as they act out their apparent belief that infusing their
second-class citizen status with lusty vigor is the best revenge.
(Unrated) (Romany, Romanian, and French with subtitles)
</P>
<P>
   !!! &UR; ``Next Stop Wonderland''  &LR; A refreshing against-the-grain
quality subverts Hollywood romantic comedy formula as Hope Davis's
melancholy, sharp-tongued nurse and Alan Gelfant's plumber dreaming
of being a marine biologist edge closer together, unbeknownst to
each other, fatefully linked by the fact that each has a stubborn
integrity beneath an unruly surface. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! &UR; 1/2 ``Regeneration''  &LR; High-minded, brooding but dramaticlaly
inert study of the clash between idealism and expediency in an
upper-class WWI rehab facility, a converted castle in Scotland,
where James Wilby's poet, Siegfried Sassoon, has been stashed as a
shellshock victim to discredit his antiwar writings. Jonathan
Pryce's compassionate doctor and Stuart Bunce as Sassoon's protege,
poet Wilfred Owen, add to the film's sense of committed
craftsmanship. (Unrated)

</P>
<P>
   He plays at a school where a 5-6 season was cause for wild
celebration. This year, the going gets even tougher with a schedule
that calls for trips to Florida, LSU and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one laughs when you mention Tim Couch and the Heisman
Trophy in the same breath. Certainly, the fellow at the center of
the budding hype seems comfortable enough with the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I think we can win 'em all,'' the Kentucky
quarterback insists. ``There's no reason why we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may take issue with that, since the Wildcats gave up points
even more quickly than Couch could put them on the board a year
ago. In yielding 363 points overall, Kentucky surrendered 30 or
more on five occasions. In the Southeastern Conference, making a
one-season leap from a sub-.500 finish to the top of the heap
probably is too much to ask, particularly with every game shaping
up as a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the UK junior, however, if he has grown accustomed to
thinking big, in terms of both numbers and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' Couch says without hesitation, ``is to win the SEC
and go to a New Year's Day bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 'Cats don't make it, Couch still figures to make life
interesting. A year ago, as a true sophomore, he adapted to
first-year coach Hal Mumme's innovative offense quickly enough to
lead the nation in passing yardage (3,884), completion percentage
(66.4) and completions (363) and was second in touchdown passes
(37).
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's 348 points were the second-most in school history.
The Wildcats topped 40 points three times for the first time since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Folks around the SEC took notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after he got here, he opened everyone's eyes,'' South
Carolina safety Arturo Freeman said. ``Coming out of high school,
he had all the hype in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he let anybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   That Couch has justified the hype speaks volumes about what he
already has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Out of high school in Hyden, Ky. _ an Appalachian town with a
population of 375 _ he was the Parade magazine national player of
the year and the USA Today offensive player of the year. His senior
season, Hyden was drawing crowds of 5,000 for home games as Couch
etched his name in the high school record book by finishing his
career with more than 12,000 yards passing and 133 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to pick a college, he was leaning toward
Tennessee, where he would bide his time for a year or so behind
Peyton Manning. Instead, Kentucky coach Bill Curry convinced Couch
he could prosper in a modified option offense.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stay at home gave hope to a UK program
accustomed to serving as little more than an autumn diversion prior
to the start of basketball season, but a rocky freshman year held
few happy moments for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Curry inserted the freshman in a game against Florida and
instructed him to run the option. Over the second half of that 1996
season, Couch completed just 38 percent of his passes and pondered
transferring before Curry was replaced by Mumme, a fast gun from
Division II Valdosta State.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach and quarterback wasted little time making their
mark. In his first game in the new system, Couch completed 36 of 50
passes for 398 yards and four touchdowns. In the season finale,
against Tennessee, he passed for 476 yards. In between, he threw
for 355 yards and four touchdowns in a 40-34 win over Alabama, the
first UK win over the Tide in 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   This time out, Couch knows, ``we're not going to surprise
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Still
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this offense is good enough that we'll do OK whether
people are ready or not,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even with similar numbers, Couch (who finished ninth in the
Heisman Trophy balloting a year ago) knows that his chances for
college football's most coveted award hinge on the numbers he can
put on a scoreboard _ preferably more than appear on the other
side. Players from 5-6 teams generally drop from the view of
television cameras and voters before the final impressions are
made, no matter how eye-catching the individual stats might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for me to win, we have to win eight or nine games and
go to a major bowl,'' he says. ``That would be pretty miraculous,
but I think we're capable of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Mumme says he isn't worried about his man getting
caught up in the hoopla. He cites Couch's intense preseason work on
improving his deep throws as evidence that the quarterback has his
priorities in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would love to play football even if nobody showed up,''
Mumme said.
</P>
<P>
   People will show up. After watching Manning endure the Heisman
spotlight a year ago, though, Couch is aware that things don't
always turn out as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman is kind of weird,'' he says. ``I expected Peyton
Manning to win it last year _ I think everybody did _ so I don't
know where to place myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Couch is likely to place himself high on most
NFL draft boards by the time the season is done. He has taken out a
$3 million insurance policy as a hedge against injury but says a
defection to the pros after the season is not a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's going to be a decision at the end of the year,''
he said. ``But right now, I'm just enjoying being in college.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kentucky, the feeling is mutual.

COWBOYS SCOUTING REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
RUSHING OFFENSE 
Emmitt Smith, coming off a second consecutive subpar season, is the
starter. Former Pro Bowl back Chris Warren was signed from Seattle
in the off-season as the backup. The Smith-Warren twosome is a
definite upgrade from the Smith-Sherman Williams duo the past two
seasons and should improve the production of 102.3 yards rushing
per game the Cowboys averaged last season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smith, who rushed for 1,074 yards in 1997, appears to be healthy
after two injury-filled seasons. However, if Smith struggles, the
Cowboys can turn to Warren, the Seahawks' all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that the offensive line will do more
zone blocking than in the past. This will require Smith and Warren
to read blocks and to run more instinctively rather than run
straight for a hole.
</P>
<P>
   It will also require a better season from the Cowboys' massive
offensive line, which has dropped off considerably from its past
dominance. Guard Nate Newton has lost more than 70 pounds from last
season and should be better, as should center Clay Shiver, who will
have a second season under his belt. The Cowboys also signed
free-agent guard Everett McIver to round out what should be an
improved bunch with Pro Bowl tackles Erik Williams and Larry Allen.
 &QL; 
PASSING OFFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Cowboys' pass offense will be more complex
than last season, when it finished 20th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman will operate out of the shotgun
on passing downs, and the alignment will feature four- and
five-receiver sets, screen plays and shovel passes.
</P>
<P>
   Substance, not creativity, will count. The Cowboys are looking
for a solid second receiver behind five-time Pro Bowl selection
Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   However, a quality group of five receivers is necessary for the
Cowboys to succeed with this offense. In addition to second and
third receivers Billy Davis and Ernie Mills, Stepfret Williams has
proved to be a capable third-down receiver. Second-year receiver
Macey Brooks is unproven.
</P>
<P>
   This could also be a breakout season for David LaFleur. New
coach Chan Gailey plans to use the 6-foot-7 tight end in the
passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the offensive line must do a better job of pass
protection than it did last season, when it allowed 39 sacks, the
most in a season since 1990.  &QL; 
RUSHING DEFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rushing defense was the Cowboys' greatest weakness last season.
They ranked 24th in the league, giving up 124.6 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The run defense should be better with the return of Pro Bowl
tackle Leon Lett for a full season. Lett missed 13 games last
season because of a league-mandated, substance-abuse suspension.
With Lett playing the first 13 games of 1996, the Cowboys gave up
91.1 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping the team improve against the run is a change in
scheme. The Cowboys have modified the traditional 4-3 defense to
feature a 3-4 look. Chad Hennings will line up as the nose tackle.
Lett will flip sides from time to time but will usually line up on
the weak side of the defense. Strong-side end Greg Ellis and
strong-side linebacker Randall Godfrey will usually line up on the
side with the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys aim to plug the middle and force the running backs
outside, where speedy linebackers Dexter Coakley and Godfrey can
make the plays.  &QL; 
PASSING DEFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even without free safety Brock Marion, who signed a free-agent
contract with Miami, the secondary should be among the league's
best. Cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith and strong safety
Darren Woodson return from a unit that led the league in pass
defense (157.6 yards per game) last season. Omar Stoutmire, Kenny
Wheaton or George Teague will plug in at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the pass rush. Aside from Lett, no player has
proved he can get to the quarterback consistently. Ellis, the top
draft pick in 1998, and Kavika Pittman must find a way to get the
job done if the Cowboys are to succeed. Not even Sanders can cover
a receiver forever.  &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' special teams are as good as any in the league.
Kicker Richie Cunningham earned All-Pro and NFC kicker-of-the-year
honors last season after making 34 of 37 field-goal attempts. He
was second in the league in scoring and led the league in field
goals. Punter Toby Gowin had a solid performance as a rookie last
season, averaging 41.8 yards per punt. However, he waned late in
the season and is looking for consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders will handle punt returns again, and the Cowboys are
seeking a replacement for the reliable Herschel Walker on kickoff
returns. Davis and defensive back Kevin Mathis are leading
candidates.

ADVERTISING:   COMPANIES SEEK TO IDENTIFY PRODUCTS WITH MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Ind.)  (rm) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Television advertisers, today more than ever, are seeking to
make their commercials music to the ear _ building brand identity
with replays of classic rock tunes and with original scores they
have commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers seem especially fond of trying to grab attention with
``underscores,'' as they are called. Consider Toyota's ``Everyday
People'' ad, borrowing its hook from the Sly and the Family Stone
tune. Or General Motors' Chevrolet, scoring points about durability
with the Bob Seeger standard ``Like a Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   But carmakers are not alone in sounding like a classic rock
station. The Rolling Stones' hit ``Start Me Up'' provided the
perfect word play for Microsoft's Windows 95 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a handful of traditional retailers have discovered the
brand-building potential of music. The Limited's Victoria's Secret,
Spiegel's Eddie Bauer, the Gap's Banana Republic and Starbucks are
extending their merchandising reach with name-brand CDs, an
unexpected outcome of selecting soundtracks to shape their stores'
environment. The compilations of previously produced work have
proved so popular with customers that Starbucks, for instance, has
issued 20 CDs since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But some advertisers, sensing that the use of well-known rock
hits is growing tired, are hiring composers to create original
scores that are as important to brand building as imagery is.
Campaigns by Chrysler, BMW and Conseco Insurance are recent
examples.
</P>
<P>
   And Intel and Sears, Roebuck have adopted recognizable aural
icons to sign off each of their television commercials. ``It makes
them original and identifiable,'' said Anthony Marinelli, a Los
Angeles composer, who has rearranged music for Sears into a variety
of musical styles, including an urban rendition.
</P>
<P>
   Also in demand are John Trivers and Liz Myers, a husband-wife
composing team from Manhattan Beach, Calif., who got their start
writing tunes for Blue Oyster Cult. When unemployed, they turned to
commercial composing for Apple Computer. More recently, they
composed an Italian-style opera for Ford Motor Co., which began
using the spot in June but masked the aria with a voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers recognize that the sound of music can trigger
recognition of their product,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more memorable than a tag line,'' Trivers added.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning an agency creative director called the
couple's ocean-view recording studio, describing what was wanted
for a soap commercial. ``Not sugary, not sappy; celebratory,
spiritual, breezier, extremely fluid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, her eyes shifting between a television monitor and the
keys of a baby grand piano, improvised 15 bars or so. Within an
hour of the conference call, she picked three tracks from among
seven to get a full orchestral treatment, but left the decisive cut
to the soap maker's agency.
</P>
<P>
   Trivers, choosing from a dozen or more bass guitars, added a
filling riff. From a keyboard-synthesizer, his wife overlaid a
breezy tinkling of bells and symphonic strings. A sound engineer
minded the tracks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conseco got a similar Trivers-Myers treatment for its first
television spots, a $25 million campaign begun in February by
Fallon McElligott &UR;  &LR;  in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for us to be distinctive; there's a lot
of sameness in the advertising of competitors,'' said James W.
Rosensteele, a spokesman for the insurance company, which is based
in Carmel, Ind. ``We were trying to break away in both sound and
image. We wanted to engage people intellectually and not rely on
pure emotional appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the warm and fuzzy images typically associated with
insurers, Conseco's vignettes show life's unexpected turns. The
music also takes unexpected turns.
</P>
<P>
   Paul L. Saylor, a partner at Bozell Worldwide, a unit of True
North Communications, produced six spots for Chrysler, relying on
one musical theme with slight variations. He said buying music
rights was effective when a campaign idea lent itself to the tune,
citing ``Like a Rock'' for Chevy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about creating new stuff is that it remains fresh
because it's not overplayed,'' he said, adding that longevity is
crucial for an auto campaign that lasts a year.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an edgy style for BMW's campaign last year, Fallon
McElligott commissioned a pulsating technopop soundtrack, filmed
black and white footage from the driver's point of view and used
text titles instead of a voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the music to cut through,'' said Bruce Bildsten, the
agency's group creative director.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's new spots, which are to start Sept. 14, extend the same
visual and musical theme. The arrangement came from Johannes
Hammers and Rico Conning, commercial composers in Santa Monica,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we have a musical signature,'' Bildsten said.
``Extending that signature is important to the brand's success.''

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Widespread power failures occurred Wednesday
as Hurricane Bonnie unleashed her fury on southeastern North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers were ready to begin repairing the damage as soon as
the winds subsided. Utility and telephone companies and electric
membership cooperatives had backup crews waiting to descend on
storm-damaged areas as soon as it was safe, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About midday Wednesday, 79,800 Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co.
customers were in the dark, said John Elliott, community-relations
manager with the company. Most of those were in Brunswick and New
Hanover counties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,600 contract workers were ready to respond as soon as
the company could complete an assessment of storm damage, Elliott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 600 were at staging areas in Raleigh and Florence, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   To get a head start, about 1,000 linemen and tree crews spent
Tuesday night in Raleigh, said Gayle Van Velsor, CP&AMP;L's eastern
region vice president. In addition to company employees, she said,
400 two-person crews from other utility companies were ready to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms were reserved and agreements reached with local
restaurants and caterers to house and feed the workers, Van Velsor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The crews' first task is repairing transmission lines _
high-voltage lines that deliver electricity from power plants to
substations. Substations are next, followed by feeder lines and tap
lines, which deliver power to service lines into individual homes.
Service is restored first to hospitals, police departments,
emergency services and other public health and safety agencies.
Next on the list are lines that serve the largest number of people.
</P>
<P>
   Electric cooperatives in the region also prepared to get help
from other cooperatives in the state and outside North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Four County Electric Membership Corp. had 70 crews ready to make
repairs.

CAMPERS A STUDY IN VERSATILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Such is the life of a boat-camper.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and Cesar Diosdado of San Diego arrived at a Lake Mojave
campsite to find a herd of wild donkeys waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about eight or nine of them,'' Kim said, ``and they
wouldn't clear out and were heehawing at us aggressively. We
weren't sure if we should try to go ashore and shoo them away or
not. They seemed like they might be dangerous. We ended up staying
on the boat that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat-camping is about exploring the amphibious option, though
not exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Boat-campers cut a wide swath, from those water lovers who
always spend the night aboard their boats to those who only sleep
on terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one's preference, boat-camping cuts across all
established and sacred lines in the boating world. Skiff jockeys do
it. Rag sailors do it. Housebargers do it. Stinkpotters do it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following from the annals of boat-camping:
</P>
<P>
   __ Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, a pair of canoe bums with
good government jobs, boat-camped for three years along the
Missouri, Clearwater, Snake and Columbia rivers, opening vast new
territories, all without Day-Glo colors, Synchilla fabric or the
proper topographic maps.
</P>
<P>
   __ David Livingstone, a Scottish physician and hopeless
boat-camper, portaged across Africa's Kalahari Desert, discovering
the Zambezi River and Victoria Falls for the Western world. When
H.M. Stanley found him in 1871 (``Dr. Livingstone, I presume''),
the two were so happy they discovered Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
   __ Two fictional miscreants boat-camped on a large muddy river
and, thanks in part to a guy named Twain, spawned a national
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Local forms of boat-camping occur at California's offshore
islands, at the Colorado River, at area lakes and at harbors along
the coast. With boat-camping, the stress is on versatility.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to the east side of Santa Cruz Island, the
Marcel and Van Koppen families of Summerland spent a weekend at one
of 35 campsites operated by the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   They hauled kayaks, wet suits, spear guns, drinking water and
camping gear onto a concessionaire's boat in Ventura Harbor and a
couple of hours later hauled the same gear the half-mile from the
Scorpion Beach landing to the island's campground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hiked a lot and saw boars and horses,'' said 6-year-old
Annik Marcel. ``I liked seeing the wild horses the best, but we
only saw one ... and two sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Mckenna Van Koppen, 11, enjoyed snorkeling but
wasn't particularly fond of donning a wet suit. Like many camping
trips, there were other sore spots, but the families plan to make
the island outing a yearly event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran a little short of food,'' said Lori Marcel, Annik's
mom. ``We figured we would be spearing fish, which we did, but we
ended up getting only mudfish, which wasn't too good.''
</P>
<P>
   A boat-camping option involving kayaks and stamina is the Lower
Tomol Trail, a 36-mile paddle course from Point Mugu in Ventura
County to the Santa Monica Pier, with paddlers coming ashore at
eight authorized landing sites and two paddle campgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Casitas in Western Ventura County recently, Chris and
``Stoney'' Stone of Lemon Grove, which is near San Diego, were
breaking camp _ stowing a tent and securing the trailered bass boat
that shared their campsite. The boat's fold-down bimini top allows
them to sleep aboard, which they sometimes do at Lake Havasu.
</P>
<P>
   The one shortcoming of sleeping on a bass boat, says Chris
Stone, is not having the room or privacy for a Porta Potti. When
nature calls, the anchor is weighed and a landing made.
</P>
<P>
   The Diosdados, friends of the Stones through the San Diego Bass
Couples club, echo the sentiment: You're roughing it, whether on
land or sea. But sleeping aboard often has allowed them to be first
to the fishing holes.
</P>
<P>
   On another Lake Mojave trip, the wind kicked up on the Diosdados
in the middle of the night, beaching their boat and collapsing
their tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we had were Nutter-Butter (cookies) and wet lunch meat,''
said Kim Diosdado, ``and we were worried we would never get out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's best to count on the unpredictable.

   ``Boat-camping is different for every boater,'' said Janet
Groene, who co-authored ``The ABCs of Boat Camping'' with her
husband, Gordon. ``We prefer sleeping aboard whenever we can. It's
bug-free, the wavelets rock you to sleep and you have the privacy
of being anchored out.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Groene urges anyone interested in boat-camping not to wait
until they have the money for a large boat with all the amenities.
Start small, she advised, and make the most out of what you have. &QL;

JUDGE ORDERS CREDIT BUREAU TO STOP SELLING CONSUMER RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal administrative law judge Wednesday
ordered one of the nation's largest credit bureaus to stop selling
detailed credit information on millions of consumers to advertisers
and marketers without the consumers' permission.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the judge was wrong and it would continue its
practice until an appeal was decided.
</P>
<P>
   The credit bureau, Trans Union Corp., maintains exhaustive
financial records on as many as 200 million Americans. The company
defended its right to sell the information, including details on
credit card accounts, mortgages, auto and student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is, this is not private and personal
information,'' said Oscar Marquis, the company's general counsel.
He added that Trans Union would appeal the ruling and continue its
marketing practices in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Trans Union is one of three national credit bureaus that gather
extensive credit and financial data on virtually every adult in the
nation, for use by banks, mortgage companies and credit-card
issuers that need the information when deciding whether to make a
loan or issue a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The other two agencies, Equifax Credit Information Services
Inc., and Experian, a unit of Great Universal Stores PLC, agreed
several years ago not to sell the information.
</P>
<P>
   But Marquis said Trans Union stills sells much of the
information it gathers to catalog companies, newspaper and
magazine-subscription vendors among others _ including banks and
insurance companies, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Reidenberg, a privacy expert at Fordham University's law
school who served as a government witness in the case, said he
believed Trans Union continues to pursue the case ``because it's a
very profitable business for them, particularly when the other two
companies have gotten out of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling by Judge James Timony of the Federal Trade
Commission found that ``Trans Union offers data showing open
automobile loans, loan type,'' as well as ``expiration dates for
the lease or loan and the high credit amount of the most current
leases or loans.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also said the company sells similar information on
first and second mortgages, home improvement loans and student
loans. In addition, Trans Union offers information on whether
individuals are mail-order buyers and whether they hold credit
cards from ``upscale stores,'' the ruling said. The company also
sells what it calls ``an income estimator,'' an estimate of an
individual's income based on credit data.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis said the data the company sells was not as detailed as
the judge asserted in his ruling. ``We sell lists of people who
have recently moved,'' he said, ``lists of people who have
mortgages and auto loans,'' but not details of those loans.
</P>
<P>
   A trade commission official said Trans Union might have changed
its marketing practices in that regard while the government's
lawsuit was pending.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trade commission first brought charges against Trans Union
in 1992, saying the company's practices violated the Federal Fair
Credit Reporting Act. The law's preamble says its purpose is ``to
ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave
responsibility with fairness, impartiality and respect for the
consumers' right to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits the release of credit data in most
circumstances, unless a consumer authorizes it _ explicitly by
signing a release, or implicitly by applying for a loan or credit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, credit bureaus are also entitled to sell
information to banks or other companies that lend money or issue
credit, as long as the companies do in fact offer credit to the
people on whom they have acquired information.
</P>
<P>
   A credit-card company, for example, will give Trans Union a
description of the sorts of people it wants to solicit. Trans Union
will then sell the company a list of names of people who meet the
criteria. At that point, under the law, the credit-card company is
required to make an offer of credit to the individuals.
</P>
<P>
   When the trade commission first sued Trans Union in 1992,
another administrative law judge issued a summary judgment against
the company. Trans Union appealed to the full Federal Trade
Commission, which upheld the ruling. But a federal appeals court
overturned the ruling, saying a summary judgment was unwarranted. A
trial was required, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Timony held that trial early this year and issued his
ruling Wednesday. Marquis said Trans Union would now appeal the
ruling to the full commission again _ though, given the history of
the case, Marquis acknowledged that the commission was not likely
to rule in Trans Union's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis said Trans Union would appeal an unfavorable trade
commission decision to a U.S. Court of Appeals. Under federal law,
the company can take the appeal to any appeals court it chooses.

WORCESTER COUNCILMAN WON'T WELCOME CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GEETA ANAND  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ While most Worcester residents eagerly
anticipated President Clinton's arrival Thursday, one city
councilor was doing the very opposite _ refusing an invitation to
welcome him at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester City Councilor Konstantine Lukes, a lawyer by
profession, a Democrat by party affiliation, and a contrarian by
nature, said she wanted to signal her disapproval of Clinton's
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and his statements about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen, sometimes you have to stand up and say, `The
emperor has no clothes,''' she said. ``I think Bill Clinton has
shamed himself, he's shamed his family, he's shamed the country and
he's shamed the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukes is no stranger to controversy. As a city councilor of nine
years, and a school committee member for eight years before that,
she has routinely questioned authority. Not even the ethics of her
colleagues has escaped her purview. Rarely, if ever, has she voted
for a city budget. She even rejected funding for the very popular
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Raymond Mariano, who is helping organize Clinton's visit,
sounded irritated with Lukes's stand, but said he was not
surprised. ``That's just like Konstantine Lukes,'' he said.
``That's her style.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano and the majority of Worcester residents interviewed,
however, preferred to focus on the positive: the fact that a
sitting US president was about to swoop down on a city that too
often feels ignored.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative James McGovern's office reported giving out
all 1,700 tickets to Clinton's speech within three hours Wednesday.
Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry, as well as Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger, planned to be there, McGovern's
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lukes's stance was drawing lots of attention Wednesday as
the media focused in on Worcester, where Clinton is said to be
trying to repair his image by turning attention to the issue of
school safety. By late afternoon Wednesday, Lukes had already been
interviewed by five newspapers and wire services.
</P>
<P>
   Lukes says she took her stand in a phone conversation Wednesday
morning with a White House official who informed her Clinton would
be arriving at Worcester Regional Airport at 9:15 a.m. and asked if
she would be present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I choose not to be there,'' she said. ``I somewhat
resent being used as a barometer and to boost his popularity.''

 &HT;    Strangers under a common roof
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel and Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, N.C. -- Lovis Ettore and her 20-year-old son, Brian,
packed up and moved here from northern Louisiana 3 1/2 weeks ago.
They knew nothing about hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was like a thunderstorm; it would hit the Outer
Banks and move on,'' Brian Ettore said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they learned the hard truth about a wobbly,
erratic hurricane named Bonnie. More than 300 miles across, Bonnie
took her sweet time about clearing out, first battering Wilmington
_ on the coast 150 miles south _ before jolting this area late in
the evening and in the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   The two transplants were among 400 who spent Wednesday night at
Washington High School, one of three Red Cross shelters in Beaufort
County, tucked about 90 miles inland from either tip of the Outer
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can make it once I get past the first one,'' said
Lovis Ettore, who nervously chatted for 10 minutes in a stuffy
hallway with no windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they say,'' Brian Ettore said.
</P>
<P>
   Lovis Ettore came to Washington, on the banks of the flood-prone
Pamlico River, as a pre-kindergarten teacher. She's been learning
from her class of 18. ``They told me more about hurricanes than I
knew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser was Lovis Ettore's sister in New Orleans, who
has dealt with hurricanes for 30 years. One tip: Get to the shelter
early to get a good spot. The Ettores woke up at 4 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the two main corridors, connected in a V-shape,
people laid out sheets, pillows, blankets, coolers and puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We headed to Winn-Dixie,'' Ettore said. ``We started Sunday
after church, buying canned goods and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't bring food today will eat cheese toast and
cereal for breakfast. Lunch will be chicken soup and a peanut
butter sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't bring food can't complain,'' said 17-year-old
Gene Woolard. Other than his change for the vending machine,
Woolard's most cherished supply: His six packs of Newport
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Woolard abandoned a doublewide trailer in a wooded area. ``Too
many winds,'' he said. ``It just wasn't safe out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelter director Alice Espenshade said the anxiety level inside
the modern brick high school didn't rise till late because light
rain and docile winds blew most of the day in advance of the
storm's real gusto. Taped to plate glass were warnings that had
been trans- lated into Spanish _ Evitar Ventana! _ Stay Away From
Windows During Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're either fighting boredom or fighting terror,''
Espenshade said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 after Hurricanes Bertha and Fran, James and Tina Stokes
cleaned up a flooded kitchen. And, as James said, the storm
``ruint'' a 1990 Oldsmobile he had just bought. So there was no
doubt they'd spend Wednesday in a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd being in here, but it's better than anywhere else,''
said James, 73. He found comfort in a meal of Vienna sausages and a
nap on the school's terra-cotta floor. ``I love to sleep on a hard
floor sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, in Morehead City, Jean West, 50, spent Tuesday
night at West Carteret High School with her two daughters,
9-year-old Sarah and 11-year-old Carol. She returned home Wednesday
morning to check on her dog, cat, parrot and husband, but she
returned to the shelter, with misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know whether to stay or go,'' said West, who
evacuated because of warnings that the rising Newport River could
flood her home.
</P>
<P>
   Some others pondered leaving. ``It's like a normal rainy day,''
Pauline Smith complained Wednesday morning. The 42-year-old
substitute school teacher and professional singer slept Tuesday
night on a blanket on the concrete floor of West Carteret High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Smith enlivened the atmosphere at the shelter Wednesday morning
with an impromptu concert in the West Carteret Fighting Patriots'
gymnasium. Some of the 200 people danced and clapped as she belted
out such oldies as ``The Twist and ``White Lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, people returned to their temporary quarters in the
school's dim hallways. They passed the time lounging on cots and
air mattresses, tending to fussy babies, playing cards and board
games, or reading. Some tried to sleep amid strangers thrown
together by the Atlantic season's first hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like one big family,'' said Mark Whittaker, a Newport,
N.C., pipe layer and Red Cross volunteer in charge of the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   To ease boredom, some people waded through water in the parking
lot to listen to radioes in their cars, some with tags from as far
away as New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is serving three meals a day. Shortly before noon,
a crowd lined up for a lunch of bologna sandwiches, baked beans and
potato ships. Some people gathered in a breezeway outside, where
they smoked cigarettes and stared into the sheets of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shelter is a dry, safe place,'' Red Cross official Cal
Jeffries said. ``But you are among strangers. The food is not as
good as you'd get at home. The sleeping accommodations are not the
master bedroom.''

A PUZZLING SEASON, A RIVETING MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a beautiful, crisp early winter evening, with the sun long
having disappeared over the hole in the roof. As day turns to
darkness, a chill sets in, but it's a good chill, bracing and
invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   This town can suck the life out of you in the summer, especially
the one we had this year. I can't remember what made me sweat more,
the heat or the thought of the next electricity bill.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just a bad memory now. This is the kind of day that
makes you glad to be alive. You can see your breath in front of
you, but that's a lot better than watching your sweat drip to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, my big, shiny jacket with the star on the back will
keep me warm.
</P>
<P>
   The jacket? A gift from the man who became my boss a few months
back. A gift, like the sideline pass hanging from my belt loop.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's a great night for a football game, which is a good
thing because I'm about to watch one.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on the sideline at Texas Stadium for the Cowboys' biggest
game in a couple of years. What game is it? For now, let's just
call it an important game. I guess someone with a more soulful
disposition might even say this can be a day of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it is at that, and I'm lucky enough to have one of the
best seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say lucky? Let me take that back.
</P>
<P>
   You might envy my place on the sideline, my
up-close-and-personal view of Troy, Emmitt, Deion and the boys, but
you shouldn't. I earned my spot here. Oh boy, did I earn it.
</P>
<P>
   The name's Thomas O'Rourke, and I suppose I'm a walking cliche.
Irish cop turned detective. I was a good cop, a clean cop, an
honest cop. That was my downfall.
</P>
<P>
   A snitch passed on a rumor about a couple of rotten cops on the
take. I did some digging, but I guess I got a little too close.
Late one night, I was jumped and worked over pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time, you won't get off so easy,'' was the last thing I
heard before I blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   When I came to, I took stock of the damage _ broken nose,
swollen eye, cracked rib _ and figured I wasn't cut out for any
hero stuff, so I quit the force. Now I'm a private eye.
</P>
<P>
   So how did I come to be standing here, watching the Cowboys warm
up before kickoff?
</P>
<P>
   It all began with a phone call nine or 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The voice at the other end sounded kind of muffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss has a proposition for you,'' it said. ``Could be very
lucrative if you're the right man for the job, but it's very
hush-hush.''
</P>
<P>
   The hush-hush part's pretty standard for someone in my line of
work. The lucrative part, though, that was different.
</P>
<P>
   His boss wanted to meet me someplace quiet, where no one would
see us. He suggested Cowboys Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' I said. ``I know some establishments where poking your
nose in someone's business can get you a one-way ticket to the
emergency room, so no one bothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy kind of gulped, but agreed. I gave him the name of a
place, The Tarnished Image, and we fixed a time for me to meet
``Mr. Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day I got there early to check things out. It's not
that I didn't trust the guy, but in my line of business it pays to
take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Everything looked like it should, so I settled in to wait.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a couple of suits came through the door.
Big suits. Hired muscle, obviously. They proceeded to give me the
once over, eyeing me like some reject from the casting call for
``Homeless in Seattle''. So maybe I hadn't introduced my face to a
razor in a couple of days. Maybe my clothes hadn't seen an iron in
a couple days. Sue me.
</P>
<P>
   They looked around the rest of the room, at the biker types
shooting pool and the bleary-eyed lushes drinking whiskey for
breakfast. Compared to them, I look like something out of ``GQ''.
The suits figured I must be their man, so they sauntered over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You the man supposed to meet Mr. Jones?'' the more intelligent
of the Neanderthals finally grunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm the neighborhood welcome wagon,'' I retorted.
</P>
<P>
   I was tempted to drop more smart-aleck responses on him, but the
word ``lucrative'' came back to me so I clammed up.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle gestured toward the door, and a couple more suits
came in. Nice suits. Expensive suits. Italian, from the look of
them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mugs above the silk ties looked familiar. I tried to
place the face. Then it came to me. I'm not much of a sports fan,
but I watch TV now and then.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Mr. Jones'' was the one who owned the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me that big, crooked smile of his and a firm handshake.
You'd figure a rich guy like him would be nervous looking at the
boys with the long hair, the tattoos and the big biceps who had
stopped shooting pool and started staring at him, but it didn't
phase him. Pretty tough guy, I figured.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jones didn't say much. It's the other guy, the younger guy
who looked a little like him who did the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's got a job for you,'' he said in this slight twang I
figured comes from somewhere in Arkansas. ``We've got a lot of
money invested in our football team, see, and we want to protect
our investment. The last couple of years have, frankly, been a
major embarrassment. We've had a coach arrested for carrying a gun.
We've had players involved with drugs and `exotic' women. Our
public image has taken a beating. Instead of revered, we're
ridiculed. We can't afford another season like that. We hired a
God-fearing coach and drafted an upstanding young man, and that
helped. But it's not enough if we continue to have players hanging
out with the wrong people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me something I don't know,'' I replied. ``I read the
papers. I know the jokes. America's Team to America's Most Wanted.
But let me give you some advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, normally I don't go dispensing advice to rich and powerful
men, but that's because I'm not around them much. I figure
everybody needs a little counsel now and then, and I'm not
reluctant to give it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, your image is a problem,'' I said. ``But drop in a few
more of those 6-10 seasons, and the front-running fans around here
won't care if you've got nothing but choirboys on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about that, son.'' It was the big man himself,
finally chiming in. ``We've still got some talent. We just need to
keep them healthy. And we need to keep them focused on football.
That's where you come in. Here's the deal. We want you to keep our
football players out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I read the papers. I watch the TV now and then. I
knew that keeping 50-odd players on the straight and narrow
wouldn't be easy. What do I know about making large men with no
more sense than the good Lord gave a grasshopper toe the line? Not
my regular line of work.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, but I know my
limitations. I was about to tell Mr. Jones to take a hike and take
his crazy idea along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Then the younger guy mentioned a dollar figure that would pay
the bills for a couple of years. And then some. When I managed to
pick my jaw up off the table, I had a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why me?'' I said. ``There's gotta be guys with more experience
in this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked you out,'' he answered. ``You were a good cop
before you turned tail and ran. You're honest and you don't have a
big mouth, and that's important. This is strictly a low-profile
job. Very discreet. No one _ especially that nosy media _ must know
we're doing this. We can't afford the bad publicity if that
big-mouthed guy on Channel 8 finds out we've hired a professional
baby sitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not what you'd call high praise, but I figured I could live with
it. The job might make me a professional baby sitter. But at least
I'd be a well-paid baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jones,'' I said, looking directly at the brains of the
outfit, ``you've got your man. If, that is, I get expenses to go
along with that nice figure your boy mentioned a few minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that I was being greedy. I just figured that tagging
along at some of the places I've heard these players frequent could
put a little dent in the pocketbook. Not that I planned on folding
any dollar bills in half, or anything.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jones let out this big laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got yourself a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We shook on it _ this is a man whose handshake is better than a
contract _ and walked out together. The suits climbed into some
big, fancy sedan. I got into my beat-up, 10-year-old Honda and
drove back to the office.
</P>
<P>
   I began to do some background work, and called up some old
friends in the force to find out what they knew about the
lifestyles of the rich and sometimes stupid. I separated the
naughty from the nice, and figured out a game plan. Yeah, I said
game plan. If I was going to baby-sit a football team, I thought it
might help to start thinking in sports cliches.
</P>
<P>
   By the time training camp started, I knew enough to know I was
in way over my head, but I dutifully pointed the car in the
direction of Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple of weeks were quiet. Too quiet. It was like one
big lovefest. Call me a cynic, but I knew it was too good to last.
</P>
<P>
   I was right. I was outside the dorms one night, doing my usual
sweep to keep the local lovelies from sneaking inside and embarking
on an empty life as a football groupie, when I heard a commotion
inside.
</P>
<P>
   I dashed up the stairs, suspecting that the idyllic atmosphere
was about to be shattered. The sight of blood dripping out of an
open wound on the neck of a certain player confirmed my suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys,'' I said, ``didn't your mother tell you never to run
with scissors.''
</P>
<P>
   I was going for the light-hearted approach, hoping they would
start laughing and break it up. It wasn't quite that easy.
</P>
<P>
   How did I handle the situation? Let's just say scissors don't
stand a chance against a handgun the size of the one I pulled out.
Prima donna football players might not respect a two-bit private
eye, but these guys are familiar with handguns. They had to respect
the business end of my piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horseplay,'' it was called later. I had to laugh at that.
Yeah, kind of like the horses in ``Ben Hur'' pulling those chariots
with the spiked wheels.
</P>
<P>
   As for that reported payoff, well, let's just say it wasn't Mr.
Jones' money. At least it wasn't until I turned in the expense
account.
</P>
<P>
   Things calmed down for a while after that. There's something
about an offense that can't move the ball that tends to depress
high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won the first game, beating the Cardinals at home.
There was some celebrating afterward, but nothing that got out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration quickly died as the 'Boys lost five of the next
seven. And as the losses mounted, tempers got hot.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback got mad at one of those large linemen after one
particularly boneheaded penalty, and they got into a shouting match
on the sideline. No big deal, happens all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But when they carried it into the locker room, I had to step in
and get it calmed down before they let the minicams in. It wouldn't
be good for the team's image to see the superstar flat on his back
after a roundhouse right.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I took the roundhouse right. It hurt, but it broke the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, I figured that would be the worst of my problems.
This team was looking old. I didn't think they had the energy to go
out and get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That's when they started to win. They beat the hated Giants,
lost at Arizona the following week, then started a three-game
winning streak. It started with a victory against Seattle, another
against the Vikings in the Thanksgiving game, and the third in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as the victories returned so did the problems.
</P>
<P>
   There was a big party at a local establishment after the victory
against the Giants. It was supposed to be private, but a handful of
drunken Yankees tried to crash. They yelled a few choice words in
those annoying New Yawk accents, and a couple of linebacker types
wanted to take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   I had to step in, again for image control. Beat up a couple of
drunk New Yorkers in public, and it's all over talk radio the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in New Orleans presented another problem. It was
pretty rowdy on the flight back, and a lot of the boys were in no
shape to drive home. I couldn't have anyone driving into a concrete
divider on the freeway, so I had to call a late-night limo company
and have them scramble the fleet. Cabs would have been cheaper, but
after a couple of victories these guys were thinking first class.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there weren't enough limos to go around, and I
had to give a couple of guys a ride. I won't name names, but
suffice it to say one of them had caught a couple of touchdown
passes earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't ready to go home, and wanted to visit a so-called
gentlemen's club where nothing good could happen. I never could
figure out why they're called that, by the way. I followed a couple
of players into a few of them to make sure they didn't get into
trouble, and gentlemen were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be the most brilliant thing you can do,'' I
said. ``Go home while you're ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, they wanted to go party. It gave me a bad feeling to go
into one of those places. Maybe hanging around Deion and Emmitt had
rubbed off. But rather than create an unpleasant scene, I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing I did. While these two guys were doing their
best to circulate more dollars into the community, I saw one of my
old snitches.
</P>
<P>
   He tipped me off about a mob figure heavily involved in gambling
who was about to set up a star player in a scenario involving a
hotel room, exotic dancers and cocaine. The plan was to videotape
the sordid affair and use it as blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I got wind of the plan this time and was able to
stop it before it started. No one ever had to find out.
</P>
<P>
   With no exotic dancers luring players astray, no one injured
from drunk-driving accidents and no one serving drug-related
suspensions, the Cowboys headed into the final three games with a
chance to do it on the field.
</P>
<P>
   They were 7-6 heading into the game at Kansas City on Dec. 13,
and things were looking pretty good. But that's when the season
almost unraveled. Troy Aikman was leveled by a blind-side hit early
in the game and sustained a concussion. Without him, the team had
no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Even that turned out OK, though. Troy was so groggy he became
convinced that the Barry Switzer regime was just a bad dream. It
took a couple of days before he realized that no, it really
happened.
</P>
<P>
   That served to lighten the mood of the team, and it create a
renewed determination in the quarterback. The Eagles the next week
had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys now were 8-7. Not exactly the stuff of Super Bowls,
but it beat the heck out of 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   At least they had a chance to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they're doing today, on this early winter evening.
It's Dec. 27, and the Cowboys are hoping for a belated Christmas
present. Beat the Redskins, and a wild-card playoff berth awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Can they do it? I don't know enough about football to make a
prediction. But I do know this: At least they have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I earned this jacket and sideline pass.
</P>

OUSTER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Tycoon Boris Berezovsky had been waiting months for
this moment of triumph, quietly plotting to depose Russia's earnest
prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Berezovsky went to the huge Soviet-era government
headquarters that looms over the Moscow River. There, in a private
meeting with Anatoly Chubais, one of the government's most
passionate reformers, Berezovsky told Chubais that the Kiriyenko
team was finished. President Boris Yeltsin, the tycoon pronounced,
would soon sign a decree sacking the entire cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais did not resist. He sensed itwas a fait accompli and
later told Kremlin aides that Berezovsky's aim in telegraphing the
punch was to demonstrate clearly that the financial barons who
dominate Russia's industry and banks were making a move to reassert
their power.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko had concluded that his days might be numbered.
Russia's wealthy businessmen, who had made a fortune buying and
selling companies once controlled by the government, had bridled at
his tough talk about about collecting back taxes and allowing
money-losing enterprises to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the day after Berezovsky delivered the news, Yeltsin
summoned the prime minister to his dacha outside of Moscow and told
him that he was planning some unspecified personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   Confused, Kiriyenko left the meeting unsure when the axe might
fall. Within hours, though, the official notice came. Kiriyenko was
out. Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who was fired in the
last shake-up, was back in.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago Kiriyenko and his young team of reformers
set out to carry forward Russia's unfinished economic revolution.
The sudden demise of the Kiriyenko government was facilitated by
the nation's deepening financial crisis and Yeltsin's penchant to
turn loyal subordinates into scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was a demonstration of the lingering power of
Berezovsky and other tycoons, who exploited the nation's financial
woes and Yeltsin's weakening position to install a more pliant
government.
</P>
<P>
   Now Berezovsky and his allies are playing role of go-between in
the formation of that government, helping to win support for
Chernomyrdin from the Communists who dominate the lower house of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The drama is still far from over. The burning issue now is not
whether the Communist-dominated Parliament will approve the stolid
Chernomyrdin _ that seems assured _ but whether a physically ailing
and politically besieged Yeltsin will completely cede power to
Chernomyrdin by eventually resigning and calling for early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable Chernomyrdin to take the reins as the nation's
acting chief executive and would give him an enormous advantage as
a candidate in a presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big danger for the country,'' said Boris
Nemtsov, one the Kiriyenko supporters who resigned his top Kremlin
post this week, in an interview. ``A resignation would be bad not
just because of the problem with the currency but because of the
history of Russia. If any czar decides to resign it could lead to a
real time of troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky had never made a secret of his opposition to
Kiriyenko or his own doctrine that the government should be a
servant of politically-connected businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   A former mathematician, Berezovsky made a fortune as a car
dealer and media mogul after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He
was one of Yeltsin's major financial backers during the 1996
presidential elections and claimed his reward by being named deputy
secretary of the national security council.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, he locked horns with Kremlin reformers like
Chubais, who once presided over Russia's troubled privatization
program.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov, the former governor of Nizhny Novgorod region who
Yeltsin once touted as possible successor, prevailed on the
president last year to fire Berezovsky from his security post,
complaining that the businessman was mixing his business and
government interests.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, however, remained close to the corridors of power.
He maintained connections with Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's chief
of staff, and Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter and political
adviser. And he used his control over the ORT television channel
and his newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, to inveigh against his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when Yeltsin anointed Kiriyenko _ a former energy
minister, banker and Nemtsov ally _ as prime minister, Berezovsky
inveighed against the choice.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it appeared that Berezovsky would be the loser. Aided
by Chubais, the Kiriyenko team negotiated a $17 billion bailout
package with the International Monetary Fund. Western officials
praised the new prime minister's dedication and acumen.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so enthusiastic. Some of Russia's financial
community was alarmed by Kiriyenko's talk about putting the
nation's house in order by refusing to bail out politically-well
connected banks and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the IMF bailout, investors continued to flee the
world's emerging markets. The Parliament resisted Kiriyenko's
program, much of which was tied to the additional loans from the
fund. Worse, the ruble began to falter and Russian banks were
having trouble paying back their borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government, after insisting that it would never
devalue the currency, reversed itself and allowed the currency to
decline in value. It also took some steps to protect the nation's
oligarchy, including a 90-day moratorium on the repayment of the
banks' foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia financial crisis also gave the prime minister's
opponents the opening they had been waiting for. ``Kiriyenko
prepared a packet of measures to that would lead to the bankruptcy
of ineffective banks or financial industrial groups,'' Nemtsov
said. ``When the oligarchs sensed this they decided to change the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   As last week came to an end, there was talk that Kiriyenko might
be ousted, but it was far from clear who might take his place.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls of the Kremlin, several successors were mentioned:
Moscow's pugnacious major, Yuri Luzhkov; Yegor Stroyev, the head of
the upper house of Parliament; and Chernomyrdin, the prime minister
Yeltsin unceremoniously ousted in March.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had his liabilities. During his first term as prime
minister, the former head Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas
monopoly, he had gone along with Russia's stutter-step journey
toward a capitalist democracy. But he had also presided over the
insider deals and half measures that led to Russia's economic
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, however, he had good connections across the
spectrum. As a former Gazprom chief he was an unofficial member of
the financial oligarchy. He also enjoyed close ties with the
Communist leadership in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   During the months after he was cast out of the Kremlin, he also
met with Berezovsky, including a reported meeting this month in
southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky glories in self-promotion and his enemies also
sometimes exaggerate his role. But while Berezovsky was not the
only baron supporting Chernomyrdin, he was an active and important
adviser.

RENO ANNOUNCES LIMITED REVIEW OF KING ASSASSINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno announced Wednesday
that the Justice Department would conduct a limited examination of
recently uncovered information in the assassination of Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has labored for months to reach a decision, authorized
a much narrower inquiry than the full review sought by King's
widow, Coretta Scott King, and other members of the King family who
had urged the Clinton administration to create a national
fact-finding commission.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations to be reviewed by the Justice Department's civil
rights division include those by Lloyd Jowers, a former Memphis bar
owner, and Donald Wilson, a former agent of the FBI. Both suggested
that there might have been a conspiracy to kill King involving
people in addition to James Early Ray, the only person convicted of
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this review will provide answers to new questions that
have been raised about a tragedy that still haunts our nation,''
Reno said in a statement, in which she also promised a report on
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence gathered by the inquiry will be followed wherever
it may lead,'' she said. But Reno warned that some actions might
not be prosecuted because some federal statutes of limitations had
lapsed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said that although investigators
would impartially re-examine the allegations of a conspiracy, they
had no reason to believe that Ray was wrongly convicted of the
murder or that he was part of a wider plot.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has posed a political problem for Reno. Justice
Department officials have been reluctant to raise expectations
about a case that most regard as closed. At the same time, the
officials have worried about offending a powerful family with
strong ties to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most investigators and historians who have reviewed the case in
the 30 years after King's death have concluded that Ray fatally
shot King as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in
Memphis. Ray, who used a deer rifle, was said to have been
motivated by racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest he confessed and pleaded guilty, but soon
recanted his confession. Until his death he hinted at a conspiracy,
but never offered any evidence to support his claim. Ray was
serving a 99-year sentence for the shooting when he died in April.
</P>
<P>
   The killing has aroused such deep passions that the government
has never fully succeeded in bring the case to a convincing close.
Ray's repeated, though unavailing, attempts to win a new trial
helped keep the case alive. So did jailhouse interviews in which he
said he took orders from a shadowy figure named Raoul, or Raul, who
has never been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Wilson, the retired FBI agent, said that
after the killing he had found two slips of paper in Ray's car that
he said bore the name ``Raul.'' In response, FBI officials said
that Wilson was not part of the search team that examined Ray's car
and dismissed Wilson's evidence as a ``total fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions have also been raised about a recent account by
Jowers, the bar owner. In 1968, Jowers ran Jim's Grill, a cafe
across the street from the Lorraine Motel. The cafe was located a
few doors down from the rooming house, the authorities have said,
from which Ray fired the single shot that killed King.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers said in an interview on ABC's ``Primetime Live'' in 1993
that he hired King's killer and that the man was not Ray. Jowers
said he hired the man for a Memphis produce dealer connected to
organized crime, who is now dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since the interview, Jowers has been unwilling to comment
further. His lawyers have said that he has moved out of state.
Earlier this year, a seven-month investigation by Bill Gibbons, the
Memphis district attorney, concluded that Ray acted alone.
</P>
<P>
   The most searching review of the case was conducted by the House
Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978 and 1979. The panel
found that Ray had fired the fatal shot and that if conspirators
existed, they were probably members of Ray's family and a few
extremists in St. Louis who were said to have put a bounty on
King's life.
</P>
<P>
   A recent book on the King case, ``Killing the Dream'' by Gerald
Posner, regarded by reviewers as an authoritative examination of
the subject, found no evidence to support Ray's contention that he
was maneuvered into a conspiracy, or that the FBI or the CIA had
covered up evidence in the case.

FLOAT PLAN ESSENTIAL TO CAMPING JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most important safety tool of any boat-camping
trip is a simple sheet of paper with some pen marks on it: the
float plan.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a few bits of key information given to a friend or
loved one who will !ital!not!off! be aboard the vessel. Described
within is the craft, the duration and details of the trip,
destination and stopover ports, who is aboard and any medical
conditions crew members may have.
</P>
<P>
   The data can be crucial if a vessel doesn't report back at the
appointed time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Janet Groene's ``The ABCs of Boat Camping'' (Sheridan
House; $16.50), contains a float-plan form that can be photocopied.
</P>
<P>
   Second only to a float plan is the need for accurate charts. The
National Ocean Service/National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration makes available charts for the Pacific and Atlantic
coasts, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Great Lakes and Alaska. Call
the National Ocean Survey, Distribution Division at (301) 436-6990
or visit any chandlery or boating supply store.
</P>
<P>
   For charts of lakes and rivers in California, do !ital!not!off!
contact the district office of the Army Corps of Engineers. Send
for an index of topographical maps from the National Cartographic
Information Center, 507 National Center, Reston, Va. 22092. A good
local source for topos are the large sporting goods stores and
shops specializing in mountaineering equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For detailed ocean approach information, see Brian Fagan's
``Cruising Guide to Southern California's Offshore Islands''
(Caractacus Corp.; 805-963-4860), ``Charlie's Charts of the U.S.
Pacific Coast'' (P.O. Box 45064, Ocean Park RPO, Surrey, BC V4A
9L1, Canada) or ``Chart Guide California'' (1695 W. Crescent Ave.,
No. 606, Anaheim, Calif. 92801)
</P>
<P>
   After maps come communications. A debate is now raging over the
preferred means of communication if a boater were forced to carry
just one device _ a VHF radio or a cellular telephone. The VHF
offers the advantage of being able to hail other boats, the Coast
Guard, bridge tenders, harbor masters on a common frequency, as
well as to monitor marine weather forecasts. In a mayday situation,
many boats may respond simultaneously to a single call for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone, on the other hand, offers the advantage of
party-to-party calling. In other words, you're not at the mercy of
agencies and fellow boaters who may or may not be monitoring
Channel 16.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's logistics. The boat-camper must contend with

RENO MAY BE READY TO PROBE GORE FUND-RAISING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Creating a new layer of political problems for Vice
President Al Gore, Attorney General Janet Reno reportedly decided
Wednesday that there are enough questions about Gore's fund-raising
practices to warrant a 90-day review, after which she will decide
whether to seek an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes 10 days after President Clinton said he had
an inappropriate relationship with former White House intern Monica
S. Lewinsky, an admission that already has threatened to tar Gore
and harm his presidential campaign prospects in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials Wednesday declined to confirm
Reno's decision, which was first reported by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, Reno can seek a 90-day review period if she
determines an allegation is specific enough to warrant
investigation. But such reviews do not mean she will ask a
three-judge panel to appoint an independent counsel. Reno is
looking at the narrow issue of whether Gore solicited unregulated
``soft money'' in campaign telephone calls from the White House,
but independent counsels often seek to expand their probes.
</P>
<P>
   Reno last year decided after a 90-day review that there was not
enough evidence to warrant an independent counsel to look at the
fund-raising practices of both Clinton and Gore. That decision
prompted an onslaught of Republican criticism, especially when word
leaked that a top Justice Department official and FBI Director
Louis Freeh wanted a counsel to be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is currently locked in a dispute with some House
Republicans over her refusal to release a July 16 memo from Charles
G. LaBella, former chief of the Justice Department's campaign
finance investigation, &UR;  &LR; that reportedly said an independent counsel
should be named. LaBella reportedly said a special prosecutor would
be in a better position to investigate whether fund-raising abuses
occurred in the Clinton administration. Freeh also had written his
memo with a similar recommendation last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, chairman of the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who has demanded the
memo for months, said Wednesday in a statement that Reno's action
didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Attorney General's action _ or inaction _ today has done
nothing to allay our concerns that something is seriously wrong at
the Justice Department,'' Burton said. ``Earlier this month, the
Attorney General promised a decision in three weeks, now she says
it will take three more months.'' Burton said that reinforces the
need to obtain the memos by Freeh and LaBella he has subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee has voted to recommend that the full House
find Reno in contempt for not turning over the two memos. Earlier
this week, Burton rejected an offer from the Justice Department to
brief members of his committee.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said on Aug. 20 that she will be criticized no matter what
she does. ``If people want to call me chicken or wimpy, they can do
that,'' Reno said. ``I'll get fussed at if I go one way and cussed
if I go the other. I'm never going to be Miss Popularity in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides have said privately that they expected the 90-day
review because Reno has been under so much pressure from
Republicans to appoint an independent counsel. But the Gore aides
said they believe Reno will not wind up asking for a counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, after a similar 90-day review, Reno decided
against seeking an independent counsel to investigate Gore. Reno
said the vice president's telephone calls from the White House in
1995 and 1996 were not in violation in a law prohibiting
fund-raising on federal property. In explaining her decision, Reno
said that law applied only to federally regulated contributions,
known as ``hard money,'' while Gore was soliciting unregulated
contributions, or ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno reopened the question when the Justice Department recently
obtained a memo that appears to suggest Gore knew he was also
soliciting hard money from the White House. In the Nov. 21, 1995,
memo, first reported last week by The New York Times, David
Strauss, a Gore aide, wrote the fund-raising would be ``65 percent
soft, 35 percent hard.'' The memo also quoted Gore as saying
``count me in'' on fund-raising calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides have said the memo is vague and does not show that
the vice president violated any laws. Gore reportedly was
interviewed by Justice officials about the memo earlier this month.
Gore has said that if his phone calls resulted in raising hard
money, he was unaware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides could not be reached for comment last night.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also has been reviewing whether an independent counsel
should examine the fund-raising activities of former Clinton deputy
chief of staff Harold Ickes. No decision was announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The probe centers on 45 telephone calls made by Gore in 1995 and
1996. That is just a small element of the fund-raising practices
that have come under investigation in the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   As required by the independent counsel law, Reno transmitted her
decision Wednesday to a three-judge court that picks counsels, but
the court did not immediately authorize her to publicly disclose
it, officials told the Associated Press. The department said it
would have no announcement on the case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a Republican-led Senate committee investigated an
array of campaign finance allegations, including suggestions that
Democrats illegally raised money from foreign interests. The Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee concluded that Clinton orchestrated
an effort to evade campaign finance laws by raising soft money for
the Democratic National Committee, which then aired millions of
dollars worth of ads that were de facto reelection commercials for
the Clinton-Gore team.

AS RUSSIA'S CRISIS DEEPENS, PREMIER HURRIES TO SEE IMF CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (See also RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
(bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia confronts its worst financial crisis since
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ruble poised for a free
fall, Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made a sudden trip
to Ukraine on Wednesday to convince the head of the International
Monetary Fund not to cut off its next installment of credits.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the ruble's 9 percent drop Tuesday, anxious Russians
rushed to their banks Wednesday morning only to be given mixed
signals on when and how they can retrieve their savings. An early
round of dollar trading on the Moscow currency exchange was voided
Wednesday for the first time in the exchange's history, while the
ruble's value fell 40 percent against the German mark in a single
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Central Bank, under bitter attack at home and abroad
for its handling of the crisis, said Wednesday it could no longer
afford to protect the ruble. It reporting that it had already spent
$8.8 billion doing so in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the bank said it would not put limits on
currency transactions. Such a move, it said, would be a step back
to ``another economic model.''
</P>
<P>
   As the banking crisis threatens to engulf Russia's entire
financial system, the Central Bank took its first tough action
Wednesday by withdrawing the license of Bank AB Imperial, Russia's
13th-largest bank, which had reportedly defaulted on payments on
foreign loans earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday three major Russian banks announced plans to merge,
while six Moscow banks Wednesday said they would pool their
resources to end the deadlock of non-payments that has crippled
Russian banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's quick trip to the Crimean resort of Simferapol,
where IMF managing director Michel Camdessus was to meet Wednesday
afternoon with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, was seen as a
sign of Russia's growing concern that the IMF will refuse to issue
its next installment of $4.8 billion in credits, due to be reviewed
by the IMF's board in September.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery of the funds is now Russia's only hope for a new
injection of foreign aid, as Western leaders warned Wednesday that
it would be up to the Russian government to pull the country out of
its looming financial nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no shortcuts in restoring market confidence, and the
next steps are up to the Russia,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv
told reporters in Edgartown, Mass., where President Clinton was on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   That nightmare was already on the horizon for thousands of
Russian companies, caught between the ruble's downward spiral and a
gridlock in the Russian banking system. Several companies Wednesday
reported that their banks have not forwarded payments made by
customers.
</P>

<P>
   ``They take money out of your account, and it may or may not
leave your bank, you don't know,'' said an director at a Russian
food processing plant. ``As a client of the bank, I don't care what
they are waiting for,'' said another Russian businessman who also
asked not to be identified. ``After one week of this, they are
killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin has made no further comment on the
crisis since a televised appearance Monday, when he gave a brief
explanation of his reappointment of Chernomyrdin, the man he had
fired as prime minister five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial and economic policy is a question to which I am
giving my attention minute by minute,'' Chernomyrdin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I am extremely dissatisfied with the work
of the central bank over the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chernomyrdin flew to Ukraine on Wednesday, leaders in
Russia's Parliament continued their public bargaining over the
future of his government and its policies. At a press conference
Wednesday, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, said the
Parliament was still working on its own anti-crisis plan, which he
said Chernomyrdin must endorse before his appointment can be
confirmed at a session now scheduled for Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be ready by next Monday afternoon,'' said Seleznyov,
referring to the anti-crisis document, ``but we would not want to
rush things since we are speaking about a very serious document.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Wednesday night, Seleznyov again
appealed for Yeltsin's resignation, a possibility that a Kremlin
spokesman dismissed earlier in the day as ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin on Tuesday told parliamentary leaders he was open
to a coalition government that would include members of the
Communist opposition, but Seleznyov has insisted that negotiations
over ministerial appointments come after adoption of a joint
strategy to handle the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday at a press conference if the Communist Party,
which holds the largest bloc in the Parliament, will join the new
government, Seleznyov said that the question had not yet been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While the political haggling over the new government continues,
financial analysts said Russia's financial situation was worsening
by the hour, with no clear policy from the Central Bank or the
government in sight.

<P>
   ``Some banks are really bankrupt,'' said Nikolai Gusev, a trader
at Regent European Securities, an investment company, ``and the
population is going to start withdrawing their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Russian savings accounts are held in
commercial banks _ with the rest in the giant government-controlled
Sberbank _ but much of these are held in several of the largest
banks now reported to be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear scheme for an operation transferring
deposits to Sberbank,'' said Gusev. ``There have been only words,
and no concrete words.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian banks were putting their walk-in customers
Wednesday on waiting lists, others were returning money in dribs
and drabs. ``You can call and check your place on the list, and
they don't allow people to cut the line as far as I can see,'' said
Pavel Mirovc, a 29-year-old sales consultant who was waiting in
line at downtown branch office of Most Bank. ``But of course I am
worried. They are giving out very little money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming every day,'' said a middle-aged woman, as
she and her husband were leaving the same bank early this evening.
``They give us our money little by little. But at least they are
giving something. But we've become part-time guards of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts attributed Tuesday's heaving trading on Moscow
currency exchange to the Central Bank's continued supply of credits
to Russia's troubled banks, and by its decision last week to lower
the banks' minimum capital requirements, which freed up ruble
reserves that the bankers then exchanged for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-crisis program, announced Aug. 17 by Chernomyrdin's
predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, included a 90-day moratorium on
payments of debts owed by Russia's commercial banks to foreign
lenders. Some Russian banks this week have said they will ignore
the moratorium and pay their debts, but with the fall in the ruble,
many foreign creditors have been left wondering where the other
banks will find the money to meet their debt payments when the
moratorium ends in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan to swap $40 million held in Russian
short-term Treasury bills for new longer term securities has also
left foreign investors with a bitter taste. But its main impact is
on Russian holders of the Treasury bills _ major banks, but also
pension and other investment funds _ which are now stuck with
assets that are worth less than their original value, and are less
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin on Wednesday tried to distance himself from the
debt restructuring plan, which was originally announced by the
Kiriyenko government. ``I would like people to understand us
correctly: this decision was predetermined,'' he said. ``In actual
fact, our task was only to formulate it, and we could not do
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to most analysts, the Central Bank has to take
decisive action to restore credibility to the financial system.
``What they have to do is limit rubles reserves, and start to close
down banks,'' said Holger Mueller, banking analyst at Fleming UCB,
an investment firm. ``They have to do it right now, and do it as
fast possible, because there is still value in these banks, and
they have to make sure there is no asset stripping.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Wednesday, Dmitry Vasilyev, chairman of
Russia's Federal Securities Commission, joined others in putting
the blame on the Central Bank, in particular a televised statement
by a top bank official on Aug. 12 who shocked viewers with the
announcement of a restriction on access to foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This caused a panic and huge requests for currency from legal
entities and the population,'' said Vasilyev. ``This drastically
destabilized the situation and ended with the government and
Central Bank statement of August 17. As a result we have an
extremely grave situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, it is possible that all that has happened on the
currency market, the actions of the Central Bank may merit an
investigation by law enforcement agencies,'' he added.

LISTENING, FINALLY, TO NICHOLAUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Now, he's got their attention. Back in February, when
Nicholaus Contreraz told a nurse at Arizona Boys Ranch that he hurt
all over and wanted to die, nobody gave a damn.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the conference room at the Arizona Department of
Economic Security building was filled with grown-ups eager to hear
Nicholaus' story.
</P>
<P>
   Ten television cameras lined the back of the room Wednesday
morning, their spindly legs crossing over one another like a chorus
line of stick figures. Reporters filled the chairs and collected
like dust in every corner.
</P>
<P>
   In front of them, standing before an ugly bouquet of
microphones, were DES Director Linda Blessing and two underlings.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholaus is important to them, now.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, when he was unable to control his bowel
movements, vomitting and too weak to stand, he was no big deal.
Back then, according to a DES report, a member of the Boys Ranch
staff told him, ``Nick, aren't you embarrassed of yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   He was just a punk kid from California in those days. Nobody
listens to punk kids. Even when they're telling the truth. Even
when they're dying.
</P>
<P>
   Once they're dead, we listen.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, reporters gathered to witness the
performing ensemble of Linda and the Bureaucrats sing the praises
of their department's 3,000-page investigation into Boys Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details of Nicholaus's death alone display a pattern of
abuse and neglect by 17 people that cannot be excused as an
isolated incident by a few rogue employees,'' Blessing said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's correct.
</P>
<P>
   But then, where was DES when the abuse took place? Where were
they during years of complaints about Boys Ranch? Where were they
the day before Nicholaus died, when he was heard to say, ``Lord
help me. I need help. I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 15 years old, suffering from pneumonia, bronchitis and
other infections, alone, being called a liar and fake by his
keepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your breathing problems are in your head,'' a nurse at the
ranch supposedly told him.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made him sit on a toilet with his pants down while he
ate dinner. They forced him to do push-ups, to carry a bucket of
his own waste and vomit. When he collapsed, they told him he
deserved an Academy Award. When he stopped breathing, they
conducted an internal investigation and found ``no wrongdoing on
the part of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have worked, too, if Nicholaus had survived. Alive, he
was a nobody. Dead, he has power.
</P>
<P>
   It was on display Wednesday morning, when DES officials
announced they had denied the Ranch a new operating license. It's
possible a deal will be worked out to keep the facility running,
but it won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucrats spoke of new rules to better protect kids in
facilities like Boys Ranch. They talked of getting tough with
inspections. They forwarded their report to the Pinal County
Sheriff's Office, which could file criminal charges against the 17
former ranch employees accused of abusing Nicholaus.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's a start,'' said Connie Woodward, Nicholaus' grandmother.
``It won't mean much if there aren't big changes, or if nobody goes
to jail. But I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she got a call at home in Sacramento on Wednesday from
one of the bigwigs at DES.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me they were sorry about what happened to Nicky,''
Connie said. ``It was the first time anybody official said
something like that to us. Too bad none of them ever talked to
Nicky.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with reporters, Connie and Nicholaus's mother,
Julie Vega, decided to visit the cemetery. For a long time, now,
their boy has wondered if he'd ever be heard.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to tell him in person _ he has. &QL;

U.S. WEAPONS INSPECTOR IN IRAQ RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 1stLd-Writethru is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The senior U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq resigned Wednesday,
charging that the U.N. secretary-general, the Security Council and
the Clinton administration had stymied the inspectors on ``the
doorstep'' of uncovering Iraq's hidden weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector, William Ritter, said in his resignation letter
that the failure to push aggressively ahead with the inspections
was ``a surrender to Iraqi leadership'' that made a ``farce'' of
the commission's efforts to prove that Iraq was concealing
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter asserted that the lack of will stemmed from a policy
shift by the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general that
was backed ``at least implicitly by the United States.'' He made
his resignation letter public in an effort to force the United
States and the United Nations to return to a tougher stance on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The administration heatedly denied Ritter's conclusions, saying
it had faithfully backed the inspections in Iraq. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan of the United Nations declined to comment, as did
Richard Butler, chairman of the inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ritter asserted that the administration had
been secretly trying since late last year to find a diplomatic
solution for its confrontation with Saddam Hussein and in doing so
had abandoned a policy _ in effect since the end of the Persian
Gulf war in 1991 _ that was designed to compel the Iraqi leader's
cooperation with the United Nations through sanctions and the
threat of military force.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has publicly backed the inspectors, who have
insisted on full and unfettered access to sites in Iraqi suspected
of being used to conceal weapons or the expertise needed to make
them. Twice in the last year the United States has threatened
military action against Iraq for obstructing the inspections, and
U.S. warships were even moved within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, U.S. officials acknowledged that the United
States and Britain had privately urged Butler to stop trying to
hold surprise inspections of sites in Baghdad. The officials said
they wanted to avoid an open confrontation with Iraq after Hussein
said he would no longer cooperate with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms
control at all,'' Ritter wrote Wednesday. ``What is being
propagated by the Security Council today is such an illusion, one
which in all good faith I cannot, and will not, be a party to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, joined the
commission in September 1991, soon after its creation, and was
assigned to help the inspectors ferret out whether Iraq was hiding
information and material relating to its programs to build weapons
of mass destruction, and if so, how.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis moved to block many of the inspections led by him and
accused Ritter of being a U.S. intelligence officer, a charge
Washington emphatically denied.

<P>
   No Red Sox player will admit when he stopped worrying about
catching the Yankees, but let's put it this way: if he's a
school-age parent, his kid was still dreaming about summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have spent the last 2, 2 1/2 months in some sort of
parallel baseball universe, from which they have only recently
returned with four consecutive losses entering Wednesday night's
game with the Angels. In Ye Olden Days, being stuck behind such a
ridiculous juggernaut would have guaranteed a boring August and
September. There would be nothing to speak of but individual goals
(Nomar's total bases, Pedro's Ks, Mo's homers, Johnny Val's
doubles, etc.). The Yankees would win the division, and there
wouldn't be a damn thing anyone could do about it except to say,
``See you next spring.''

   Not now. Not when the Red Sox go into a game like Wednesday's
against the A's 10 up in the loss column.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the late nineties. Welcome to the world of the OPR,
the Other Pennant Race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of old-fashioned,'' says Mo Vaughn. ``When they put
the wild card in, I thought it was a reward for mediocrity. But now
I look at it that we've got the second-best record in the American
League and we should get something for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, if they keep on doing what they're doing, they will. They
will be the American League's wild card playoff entry.
</P>
<P>
   If Mo's old-fashioned, then I'm positively medieval. If I could
have one summer to live over, it would be 1967, and in this locale
I'm hardly alone. Now that, you young'uns, was a capital P,
Pennant, capital R, Race. It was a daily carnival of baseball
thrills, culminating in the extraordinary events of Oct. 1, when
Jim Lonborg willed his way past the Minnesota Twins in game 162.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't the best pennant race of all, it was, as Dizzy Dean
would say, among 'em. The old baseball pennant races were the best
races in all of American sport, but the winner-take-all days are
gone and no wailing by a baseball purist like me can bring them
back. It's a wild card world. I can either accept it or turn to
street luging.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, there is no pennant race in the American
League East. The Yankees will enter the post-season through Door
No. 1. This does not concern the Boston Red Sox because they will
feel no shame whatsoever by waltzing into the postseason through
Door No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what sport you're in,'' reminds Bret Saberhagen,
``all you're trying to do is get into the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the Yankees play for regular season history. The Red Sox
have another issue. They have the OPR. All they know is that if it
looks like a pennant race, feels like a pennant race and smells
like a pennant race, then it surely is a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   They watch the scoreboard each night to see what Baltimore,
Texas and Anaheim are doing. ``You definitely keep an eye on the
other teams,'' says John Valentin. ``The way Baltimore was playing,
how could you not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees? They're of no direct interest, except for one
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can root for them,'' points out Saberhagen. ``They can
help you out.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Yankees are a source of amusement. First of
all, it's hard to imagine what it's like to play for them. But the
big thing is speculating about what it will be like to be a Yankee
when the playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be great pressure on them,'' says Vaughn. ``How can
you have a team like that and then go out and lose in the playoffs?
There will be pressure on them from the owner, the fans, the media
_ everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can see it,'' echoes Valentin. ``You have a season like
that, and then it's `How can you not win the World Series?' I mean,
if we were winning every game, I'd expect us to win it all, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to be a favorite like that,'' agrees Dennis
Eckersley, who has some experience in these matters. ``The best
team doesn't always win, anyway, let alone in a five-game series.
All it takes is one hot starting pitcher. Both times we (Oakland)
lost in the Series one starter knocked our (body part) off. (Orel)
Hershiser did it in '88 and (Jose) Rijo did it in '90.''
</P>
<P>
   You will be hearing a great deal in the coming weeks about the
notion that ``anything can happen in a short season,'' and the fact
is it happens to be true. Few players are students of history, so
let this be a source of inspiration to all the wild card hopefuls:
the two ballclubs with the best season records in each league were
beaten in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Chicago Cubs went 116-36 and were defeated by the
Chicago White Sox. Forty-eight years later the Cleveland Indians
went 111-43 to establish the all-time American League record. They
were swept by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley arched his eyebrows when apprised of this information,
but he is all too well aware of just what kind of trouble can lurk
in a baseball series.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, no one needs as much to get by in the post-season as
it does over the Big 162. ``What you need,'' maintains Dan
Duquette, ``are the vital ingredients _ pitching and defense _ and
I think we have them.''
</P>
<P>
   On this subject, at least, Mo Vaughn finds himself in agreement
with the somber general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think pitching and defense are the big things when you get
into the post-season,'' contends Vaughn. ``Offensively, it's always
going to be someone you don't think about. But pitching and defense
are always going to get you through the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching and desire,'' adds Valentin. ``I got that from
(Roger) Clemens. ``He can go out there without his best stuff, but
still find a way to win with desire, knowledge and heart. I believe
that plays a factor. I know nothing's more important than talent,
but you need more than just talent to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It has escaped no one's attention that the reigning champion of
the known baseball world entered the 1997 postseason through Door
No. 2. As far as know, the winners' checks didn't bounce and the
rings were authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our pitching staff we've got as good a chance as anyone
in baseball,'' says Vaughn. ``Getting to the postseason is what you
play for. When we win this (i.e. the wild card), it will be just
like winning the division in '95.
</P>
<P>
   Door 1. Door 2, it doesn't matter. They lead to the same room.

LISTENING, FINALLY, TO NICHOLAUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Now, he's got their attention. Back in February, when
Nicholaus Contreraz told a nurse at Arizona Boys Ranch that he hurt
all over and wanted to die, nobody gave a damn.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the conference room at the Arizona Department of
Economic Security building was filled with grown-ups eager to hear
Nicholaus' story.
</P>
<P>
   Ten television cameras lined the back of the room Wednesday
morning, their spindly legs crossing over one another like a chorus
line of stick figures. Reporters filled the chairs and collected
like dust in every corner.
</P>
<P>
   In front of them, standing before an ugly bouquet of
microphones, were DES Director Linda Blessing and two underlings.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholaus is important to them, now.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, when he was unable to control his bowel
movements, vomitting and too weak to stand, he was no big deal.
Back then, according to a DES report, a member of the Boys Ranch
staff told him, ``Nick, aren't you embarrassed of yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   He was just a punk kid from California in those days. Nobody
listens to punk kids. Even when they're telling the truth. Even
when they're dying.
</P>
<P>
   Once they're dead, we listen.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, reporters gathered to witness the
performing ensemble of Linda and the Bureaucrats sing the praises
of their department's 3,000-page investigation into Boys Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details of Nicholaus's death alone display a pattern of
abuse and neglect by 17 people that cannot be excused as an
isolated incident by a few rogue employees,'' Blessing said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's correct.
</P>
<P>
   But then, where was DES when the abuse took place? Where were
they during years of complaints about Boys Ranch? Where were they
the day before Nicholaus died, when he was heard to say, ``Lord
help me. I need help. I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 15 years old, suffering from pneumonia, bronchitis and
other infections, alone, being called a liar and fake by his
keepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your breathing problems are in your head,'' a nurse at the
ranch supposedly told him.
</P>
<P>
   The staff made him sit on a toilet with his pants down while he
ate dinner. They forced him to do push-ups, to carry a bucket of
his own waste and vomit. When he collapsed, they told him he
deserved an Academy Award. When he stopped breathing, they
conducted an internal investigation and found ``no wrongdoing on
the part of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have worked, too, if Nicholaus had survived. Alive, he
was a nobody. Dead, he has power.
</P>
<P>
   It was on display Wednesday morning, when DES officials
announced they had denied the Ranch a new operating license. It's
possible a deal will be worked out to keep the facility running,
but it won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucrats spoke of new rules to better protect kids in
facilities like Boys Ranch. They talked of getting tough with
inspections. They forwarded their report to the Pinal County
Sheriff's Office, which could file criminal charges against the 17
former ranch employees accused of abusing Nicholaus.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's a start,'' said Connie Woodward, Nicholaus' grandmother.
``It won't mean much if there aren't big changes, or if nobody goes
to jail. But I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she got a call at home in Sacramento on Wednesday from
one of the bigwigs at DES.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me they were sorry about what happened to Nicky,''
Connie said. ``It was the first time anybody official said
something like that to us. Too bad none of them ever talked to
Nicky.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with reporters, Connie and Nicholaus's mother,
Julie Vega, decided to visit the cemetery. For a long time, now,
their boy has wondered if he'd ever be heard.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to tell him in person _ he has. &QL;

NFC EAST CAPSULES

NFC EAST CAPSULES 
 
DALLAS COWBOYS 
1997: 6-10, 3-5 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Chan Gailey (0-0) 
Stadium: Texas Stadium (65,675) 
Ticket information: (972) 579-5000 
Pieces in place 
QB Troy Aikman (19 passing TDs), RB Emmitt Smith (1,074 rushing
yards), WR Michael Irvin (1,180 receiving yards), T Larry Allen, DT
Leon Lett, CB Deion Sanders (NFL-record 14 career TDs on returns),
CB Kevin Smith, SS Darren Woodson. 
Key newcomers 
Coach Chan Gailey, DE Greg Ellis, OT Flozell Adams, G Everett
McIver, RB Chris Warren, WR Ernie Mills. 
Key losses 
FS Brock Marion, T George Hegamin. 
Missing piece 
The Cowboys have not had a consistent wide receiver to play
alongside Irvin since Alvin Harper. Kevin Williams, in Buffalo
after a year in Arizona, was never more than a utility receiver.
And former Pro Bowl player Anthony Miller was never more than fast
last season. The candidates for the No. 2 spot this year are Billy
Davis, second-year man Macey Brooks and free-agent veteran Mills.
Because Gailey plans to use a five-receiver formation on some
plays, all will be counted on for production in certain situations.
Still, the coaching staff is hoping one emerges as another target
for Aikman. 
Biggest test 
The NFL community will know very early in the season whether last
season's dismal record was a mirage or a sign of things to come.
The Cowboys open the season at home against the up-and-coming
Arizona Cardinals, then go on the road to play the defending Super
Bowl champion Denver Broncos on Sept. 13 and the defending NFC East
champion New York Giants on Sept. 21 on Monday Night Football. 
Watch out for 
How this club responds to Gailey. Right now, the former offensive
coordinator is being called a breath of fresh air by veteran
Cowboys who had grown weary of Barry Switzer's act. But how long
will that last? Will the team have confidence in him after the
first blowout loss or lengthy losing streak? How will Gailey react
under the pressure of being the coach of the most visible team in
pro sports? 
Milestones 
Emmitt Smith needs 12 rushing touchdowns to surpass retired running
back Marcus Allen (123) as the all-time career leader. 
Overview 
The Cowboys have the best quarterback and best defense in the
division. They also have more future Hall of Famers on the roster
than anyone else. Yes, they are getting old. But with an influx of
young talent via the draft, and a new coach, Jerry Jones' money men
have one more run of greatness left. 
Prediction: 10-6

NEW YORK GIANTS 
 
1997: 10-5-1, 7-0-1 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Jim Fassel (10-5-1) 
Stadium: Giants Stadium (78,148) 
Ticket information: (201) 935-8222 
Pieces in place 
DE Michael Strahan (14 sacks), LB Jessie Armstead (134 tackles), CB
Phillippi Sparks (5 interceptions), DT Robert Harris (10 sacks), DT
Keith Hamilton (8 sacks), QB Danny Kanell (11 passing touchdowns). 
Key newcomers 
S Shaun Williams, WR Joe Jurevicius, WR Brian Alford. 
Key loss 
RB Rodney Hampton. 
Missing piece 
Offense. Offense. Offense. The Giants need plenty of it. Their
defense will keep them in most games, but the Giants desperately
need offensive playmakers to successfully defend their NFC East
title. Oddly, the Giants' first pick in the draft went to defense.
So, Fassel and company will hope that a running-back-by-committee
run game and Kanell, in his third year, will improve by leaps and
bounds to help a unit that ranked 27th in total yards last season.
Kanell will need help from last year's top draftee, speedy wide
receiver Ike Hilliard, who was limited to two receptions in 1997
because of a neck injury. The club's leading receiver in 1997 was
Chris Calloway (58 receptions). Calloway is more of a possession
receiver. 
Biggest test 
Four of the Giants' six games from Nov. 15 to Dec. 20 are against
Green Bay, San Francisco, Denver and Kansas City. If you are
wondering whether the Giants' 1997 worst-to-first season was a
fluke, you'll know by the morning of Dec. 21. 
Watch out for 
Who is behind Kanell. The Giants will probably go into the season
with halfback Tiki Barber and fullback Charles Way as the starters.
Way is a solid blocker and was the club's leading ground gainer and
second-leading receiver. If Barber struggles to give the Giants
consistent yards, don't be surprised to see journeyman Gary Brown
getting plenty of action. He gained 945 yards rushing as a
part-time player with San Diego last year. Tyrone Wheatley also
adds to the logjam at running back. 
Milestones 
The Giants, who became the first NFC East team to go through the
division schedule undefeated in 1997, have not lost to a division
team since a 24-0 loss at Philadelphia on Dec. 1, 1996. 
Overview 
The Giants can't possibly go through the division undefeated again.
And with the nondivision schedule much stronger than last season,
New York's hold on the division title could be short-lived. The
saving grace: Eight of the Giants' first nine opponents missed the
playoffs in 1997. So perhaps a fast start could give the club the
momentum it needs to pull out an upset against a San Francisco or a
Green Bay. But that's highly unlikely.

WASHINGTON REDSKINS 
1997: 8-7-1, 4-3-1 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Norv Turner (26-37-1) 
Stadium: Jack Kent Cooke Stadium (78,600) 
Ticket information: (301) 276-6050 
Pieces in place 
RB Terry Allen (724 yards), RB Stephen Davis (567 yards), CB
Darrell Green (second among active players in career interceptions
with 44), CB Cris Dishman (4 interceptions in '97), WR Michael
Westbrook (16.4 yards per catch), QB Gus Frerotte (17 passing
touchdowns), LB Ken Harvey (9.5 sacks), KR Brian Mitchell (2,081
total yards). 
Key newcomers 
DT Dana Stubblefield, DT Dan Wilkinson, TE Stephen Alexander, RB
Skip Hicks. 
Key losses 
OT Darryl Ashmore, DE Chris Mims. 
Missing piece 
The Redskins have lots of talent at the skill positions but will
need an overachieving effort from the offensive line to be a major
force in the division. The talent on the offensive line is average
at best and incompetent most of the time. The club desperately
needs a talented left tackle, but failed to obtain one through free
agency or the draft. That means Joe Patton, who is a better left
guard, will fill in to protect Frerotte's blind spot. Left guard
Tre Johnson is coming off two shoulder surgeries. The right side of
the line is manned by guys named Shar Pourdanesh and Brad Badger.
Yikes. 
Biggest test 
We should know how the season will turn out for the Redskins before
the end of September. They open at the New York Giants, play host
to San Francisco, travel to up-and-coming Seattle and close the
month at home against Denver. 
Watch out for 
Westbrook and Frerotte. These guys are the keys to getting Turner
into the playoffs for the first time as a head coach. Both are
immensely talented. But both made boneheaded mistakes last season
that eventually kept this team out of the playoffs. If Westbrook
can control his anger and Frerotte his urge to throw dumb passes at
the worst possible times, the Redskins have a good chance of
winning the NFC East. 
Milestones 
Green, a 16-year veteran, has 44 career interceptions, second among
active players behind Atlanta's Eugene Robinson (49). 
Overview 
The Redskins should have one of the best defenses in the league and
an offense that will excite from time to time. But six of their
first eight opponents reached the playoffs in 1997. After a slow
start, look for the Redskins to rally in the latter half of 1998,
only to fall short of postseason play for the sixth consecutive
season. But watch out in 1999.

ARIZONA CARDINALS 
1997: 4-12, 2-6 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Vince Tobin (11-21) 
Stadium: Sun Devil Stadium (73,273) 
Ticket information: (800) 999-1402 
Pieces in place 
WR Rob Moore (1,584 receiving yards), WR Frank Sanders (13.6 yards
per catch), FB Larry Centers (54 receptions), DT Eric Swann (7.5

Aeneas Williams (6 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
WR/KR Eric Metcalf, DE Andre Wadsworth, S Corey Chavous, RB Mario
Bates, RB Adrian Murrell. 
Key loss 
LB Eric Hill. 
Missing piece 
The offensive line. The Cardinals' best anchor, left tackle Lomas
Brown, is 35. The Cardinals added massive tackle Anthony Clement
(6-8, 348) in the draft, and he could be starting soon on the right
side. But not much else was done to improve a unit that allowed a
league-high 78 sacks in 1997. That's bad news for a club that is
resting its hopes for its first nonstrike playoff berth since 1975
on second-year quarterback Jake Plummer. 
Biggest test 
At the Cowboys for the season opener Sept. 6. The Cardinals ended a
13-game losing streak to the Cowboys with a victory in Tempe,
Ariz., last season. But they have not won at Texas Stadium since
1989. One reason for the Cardinals' sorry records this decade has
been slow starts. A victory against the Cowboys _ even if they are
a few All-Pros short of their glory days _ would give the young
Cardinals the emotional firepower to make a playoff run. A loss and
the same old doubts probably start to creep in. 
Watch out for 
Plummer's production. General manager Bob Ferguson has done a
wonderful job of stocking talent in the desert the past few years.
The addition of Metcalf helps special teams. The addition of
Murrell and Bates helps the running game, and the addition of
Wadsworth helps an already solid defense line. Now it is up to
Plummer, the second-year quarterback from Arizona State, to
produce. Yes, he has a shaky offensive line. But if he can stay
away from making the stupid plays (15 interceptions in 1997) and
let his playmakers win games for him, the Cardinals have as good a
shot as anyone to win what has become one of the weaker divisions
in the NFL. 
Milestones 
The Cardinals have not reached the playoffs in a nonstrike season
since they won the division in 1975. No club has gone longer
without a nonstrike-season playoff berth, and only the New York
Jets (1969) have gone longer without a division title. 
Overview 
The Cardinals lost six games in 1997 by a total of 20 points,
including three in overtime. This came despite having a rookie
quarterback, a defense that finished 27th in total yards allowed,
and a running game that ranked 30th. They added loads of talent via
trade and the draft. And in a division that saw one club make the
playoffs last season, the additions may be enough for a playoff
berth in the Valley of the Sun.

PHILADELPHIA EAGLES 
1997: 6-9-1, 3-5 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Ray Rhodes (27-23-1) 
Stadium: Veterans Stadium (65,352) 
Ticket information: (215) 463-5500 
Pieces in place 
QB Bobby Hoying (1,567 passing yards), RB Charlie Garner (547
rushing yards), WR Irving Fryar (1,316 receiving yards), DT Rhett
Hall (8 sacks). 
Key newcomers 
DE Hugh Douglas, OT Tra Thomas, LB Jeremiah Trotter, OG George
Hegamin, DT Bill Johnson, WR Jeff Graham. 
Key losses 
RB Ricky Watters, LB Darrin Smith, G Joe Panos. 
Missing piece 
The running game. Watters spent three stormy seasons in
Philadelphia before Seattle signed him to a free-agent contract in
the spring, but they were three productive seasons. Garner, who has
been handed Watters' job, burst on the scene as a rookie in 1994,
but hasn't parlayed that into a career that makes you think he will
be as good as Watters. Perhaps because he is the everyday starter
things will change. Whatever the case, the Eagles need a consistent
ground game to take pressure off Hoying, in his third year. 
Biggest test 
Any road game. The Eagles lost all of their eight road games last
season for the first time since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. They
play at Denver on Oct. 4, at the New York Giants on Nov. 22, at
Green Bay on Nov. 29, and at the Cowboys on Dec. 20. 
Watch out for 
Hoying is clearly the key to the Eagles' success, but this club
will only go as far as Rhodes can will it. And lately, Rhodes'
highly emotional act has worn thin. This club underachieved in
1997, missing the playoffs despite ranking fifth in total offense
and a respectable 13th in total defense. The Eagles need Rhodes to
push the right buttons to be considered a serious playoff
contender. He didn't do that last year. 
Milestones 
The Eagles have not won on the road since a 21-20 victory against
the New York Jets on Dec. 14, 1996. 
Overview 
The club's best offensive player, Fryar, is 36. Its best defensive
player, CB Bobby Taylor, missed most of last season with a severe
knee injury. This is basically the team that won two of its final
eight games last season, minus a few talented players the club did
not re-sign in the off-season. Add all the elements, and this could
be the end of the road for Rhodes, who has had many public
disagreements with upper management.

BONNIE LASHES CAROLINAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Bonnie howled into the Carolinas
Wednesday, slashing coastal communities and summer playlands, and
sending more than a half-million residents and vacationers
scurrying for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Roofs vanished, roads flooded, and trees snapped after the storm
struck land near Cape Fear, just south of Wilmington. Bonnie
battered the waterfront city and surrounding region throughout the
day and was expected to thunder northeast toward the state's
fragile Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   With top winds of 115 m.p.h., Bonnie threatened to wreak as much
as havoc as Hurricane Fran, which killed 24 people and caused more
than $5 billion damage when it raged across Cape Fear into the
Carolinas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Service said Bonnie, which was virtually
stalled over the Wilmington area Wednsday night, will continue to
produce powerful rain and hurricane-force winds for up to 36 hours.
The hurricane, stretching 450 miles wide, could continue pounding
North Carolina through Friday, metereologists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had terrific damage,'' said North Carolina emergency
management spokesman Ben Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Public safety officials said they hoped to limit Bonnie's
devastation with preventative measures they learned from Fran. But
as the storm inched up the coast, conditions remained too perilous
in many areas for authorities to fully assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service has forecast that Bonnie could pass
just southeast of New England Friday night or Saturday. Heavy-surf
advisories remained in effect through Friday, with the threat of
downpours across Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Amid pelting rain, seas surging higher than houses, and severed
power lines sizzling in the streets, many seaside communities in
North Carolina resembled battered ghost towns Wednesday. They had
emptied in a mass exodus, as more than 330,000 people heeded recent
orders to evacuate the North Carolina coast, from Sunset Beach,
near the border with South Carolina, north to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 200,000 people were evacuated from coastal
counties in South Carolina, although they escaped the brunt of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in North Carolina, where fears of looting, including an
attempted break-in at a grocery store in Wilmington, prompted
authorities to impose curfews as early as 8 p.m. in several
southern coastal counties. The National Guard was called in to
Wilmington, where the swollen Cape Fear River flooded much of the
city's historic district.
</P>
<P>
   The closest brush with tragedy occurred at Brunswick Community
Hospital, 25 miles south of Wilmington, where a large section of
the roof ripped off, forcing officials to move 31 patients to other
facilities during the storm's full force. No injuries were
reported, although five of the patients were in critical condition
before the roof disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other signs of a dangerous storm abounded: toppled trees,
bent billboards, shredded flags, broken traffic lights dangling
feebly above branch-littered intersections.
</P>
<P>
   All commerce and public transportation stopped. A cable tower
buckled and fell in Sea Breeze, just north of Cape Fear. Scores of
windows shatttered, including dozens at a high school in New
Hanover County, near Wilmington. And a steeple broke off a church
in the Wilmington suburb of Leland.
</P>
<P>
   For many mainland residents who brushed off official requests to
voluntarily evacuate, few amenities remained. Widespread phone
outages were reported. And nearly 200,000 electric customers lost
power, although the number was less than the 380,000 who lost
electricity in North Carolina during Hurricane Fran.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of damage to the region's most vulnerable spots
remained a mystery, as police continued to enforce mandatory
evacuation orders, particularly on barrier islands that were rocked
by Fran in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some residents said they expected the wreckage to rival
the destruction caused by Fran and Hurricane Hugo, which killed 26
people and caused $7 billion of damage in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damages are very similar to what we had with Hugo and
Fran,'' said Al Leonard, the town manager in Tabor City, west of
Wilmington. ``It's pretty much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed. ``At this point, it's certainly no Fran,''
said Allen O'Neal, manager of New Hanover County.
</P>
<P>
   As frustrating as the storm was for tens of thousands of
tourists, many of whom abandoned pricey vacation rentals in such
pleasure spots as Nags Head and Surf City, Bonnie was a potentially
costlier menace for many year-round residents, particularly
tourist-related businesses and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Cape Fear, Southport postmaster Marvin Watson
regretted not getting off Oak Island before the only bridge closed
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing _ it's scary out there,'' he said as
the wind pushed sheets of water across the island. ``If I had my
choice right now, I'd be sitting over in Wilmington somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hatteras Island, most homes and businesses were closed and
only a few people were on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Austin, who is accustomed to storms after living on
Hatteras for seven years, defied the evacuation order. She said she
planned to ``lay some candles out, get a good board game and sit
around with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   West Carteret High School in Morehead City was converted into a
shelter, with 200 people lodged there. Many brought sleeping bags,
cots, blankets, radios, books and lanterns. Some of the refugees
had gathered before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met each other during a storm years ago,'' said Iris
Salter, who was chatting with Edwin and Gertha Lewis of Harker's
Island.
</P>
<P>
   One hurricane tradition on the North Carolina coast survived
intact, officials said. Residents reported that someone broke into
the three-story Old Baldy Lighthouse near Cape Fear and rode out
the storm there. Smith Island is six miles off the coast near
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every storm we have somebody breaks into that lighthouse and
then gets a T-shirt that says `I survived (Bonnie) in the
lighthouse,' '' said Brunswick County spokesman Huey Marshall.
``That's probably the safest place on the island to ride out the
storm, and the view is fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bonnie approached the coast, Hurricane Danielle was
strengthening over the Atlantic _ 645 miles east of the Leeward
Islands _ and moving toward the northwest at 21 mph with winds of
105 mph that were expected to strengthen. Forecasters said it was
too early to tell whether Danielle would threaten the US mainland.

1998.

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (`e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-APES-NYT (Undated) _ Adapted from the novel by Pierre
Boulle and written by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson, who had been
blacklisted in 1951 for supposed communist connections, ``Planet of
the Apes'' was relentlessly promoted from the time it was just a
concept by the producer Arthur Jacobs. Hollywood, however, found
the idea of costumed apes uncomfortably close to Saturday-morning
cartoons. Only Richard Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, was
willing to make the film. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-LYMAN-NYT (Los Angeles) _ In the movie ``Why Do Fools Fall
in Love,'' which opened on August 28, starring Halle Berry, Vivica
Fox, Lela Rochon and Laranz Tate, courtroom testimony takes up only
a few minutes. But the fact that a legal battle really happened is
the reason the story of Frankie Lymon finally made it to the screen
at all. By Jamie Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-MERRY-WAR-NYT (Undated) _ ``Gordon halted outside a great,
garish picture-house. He hated the pictures, of course, seldom went
there even when he could afford it. Why encourage the art that is
destined to replace literature?'' So wrote George Orwell in his
1936 novel, ``Keep the Aspidistra Flying,'' but it is not a
vignette that makes it into Robert Bierman's ``The Merry War,'' the
new film adapted from the book. That comically high-minded rebuke
hangs over the movie, though, and over every attempt to bring the
work of this gifted, peculiar writer to the screen. By Ty Burr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN-DANCE-NYT (Becket, Mass.) _ It sounded like a perfect
match. The American Indian Dance Theater was looking for a dramatic
way to reconcile its heritage with the modern world. Laura Dean, a
white choreographer with a penchant for spinning movement and an
eye for ritualism, was hoping to deconstruct some powwow dances,
which share a striking affinity with many of her own compositions.
Last spring, after raising $26,000 from the National Endowment for
the Arts and two private foundations, the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival commissioned the postmodern dervish and the folkloric
troupe to make a new dance together. But the dance barely made it
to the stage, and a close look at how it evolved offers a
cautionary tale about leaping into creative partnerships. By
Christopher Reardon. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART-ANTIQUES-ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-MAINE (Bar Harbor) _ In 1922, Dr. Robert Abbe, a New
York surgeon who summered in this coastal town, was struck by
inspiration. He had just bought a small collection of ancient stone
implements that had been found in the region, filling him with
wonder about the hands that had held them in prehistoric times. And
rather than leave the artifacts on a shelf in his house, he wanted
to create a place where others could see them. So he set about
enlisting the support of other local collectors, and on Aug. 14,
1928, the Robert Abbe Museum of Stone Age Antiquities opened in a
quiet glen near here at the edge of Acadia National Park. By Paula
Deitz.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE-COLUMBUS-NYT (New York) _ With the selection of
a design for the old Coliseum site on New York's Columbus Circle
and plans afoot to spiff up the circle's core, this may be the time
to appreciate the power this place has had to stir the imagination
over the years. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHAMBER-MUSIC-NYT (Undated) _ It's odd how quickly the world
forgets about chamber players. For a time they may occupy something
close to center stage in the public imagination; then, almost
without warning, they disappear from the scene. The process may
seem natural where retirement or death is concerned. Still, it is
hard to see why the performers should vanish from the communal
memory. By David Mermelstein.
</P>
<P>
   STRING-QUARTETS-NYT (Undated) _ For most music lovers, the
historical map of the string quartet is drawn on well-traveled
roads. We tend to trace and retrace the great highways named
Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Bartok and ignore the byways. Many
are the roads not taken, especially on the landscape of our own
time. But the Kronos Quartet would have us draw the world
differently, in greater detail and from a more modern perspective.
By Lawrence B. Johnson.

BIKING INDOORS ISN'T CYCLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not surprising that indoor cycling _ or
``spinning'' _ has caught on with aerobiholics around the country.
It's low impact, high cardiovascular and fun.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an effort to establish themselves as tough trainers,
some indoor cycling instructors are pushing their students
unnecessarily. They're into unnecessarily high cadences and
improper movements on the stationary bikes to emulate the motions
of a bicyclist. Much of this is because while they are fit, many
instructors are not cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is when instructors mimic the side-to-side
action that naturally occurs when bicyclists pedal while not
seated, such as when riding uphill or in a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ask instructors why they are leaning their bodies left
and right to try to simulate what a bicyclist does, they tell me,
`That's how you do it outside,' '' said Peter Fair, studio cycling
director at Mid Valley Athletic Club in Reseda. ``That's just not
true. The bicycle sways underneath you and your body stays
(vertical).''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a stationary bike,'' Fair said, ``you can't
move your torso from side to side without affecting your knee
joints. You're going to blow the lateral meniscus (cartilage) out
if you continue to put pressure on it in that fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing trend among indoor cycling instructors is to use a
lower cadence, or revolutions per minute. However, instructors such
as Fair, an expert mountain bike racer and road racer, are making
sure their clients are getting the correct physiological guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people with various degrees of cardiac fitness and who
have orthopedic concerns that I have to be responsible for,'' Fair
said. ``That means setting up the bikes so that they are fitted
properly for their bodies and realizing that these people are
entrusting me with their health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair attempts to utilize stationary bike routines that have for
years been used by top cycling athletes. This includes
incorporating ``interval training'' techniques (high output
followed by rest periods) and a variety of resistances that more
closely simulate a bicycling workout.
</P>
<P>
   One of Fair's pet peeves is instructors who make their students
``stand and run'' on the stationary bicycle. ``Because some
instructors don't understand exercise physiology, the only way that
they feel that they're going to make the workout hard is to stand
and run,'' he explained. ``They push their classes for the sake of
a hard workout, not realizing that when you get fatigued, loss of
form follows, which leads to overcompensation, which can lead to
overuse injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any physical activity, proper technique becomes
critical. Whether one is riding a stationary bike or a bicycle, it
is essential to maximize bio-mechanical efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, an exercise physiologist and personal trainer, recommends
that when riding a stationary bike and pedaling out of the saddle
to keep the torso in line with the frame of the ``exercycle,'' with
the hips just above the nose of the saddle. When pressing down on
the pedals, the hips should not rock from side to side; the knees
should be slightly bent at the bottom of the pedal strokes, not
locked.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, indoor stationary cycling is one of the best
forms of exercise available. But it should not be a substitute for
actual bicycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get people out riding, they're going to go back into
the stationary class with a better understanding of what they want
from their workout,'' said indoor cycling instructor Robert
vonSchneidau of Club Millennium in Westlake Village. ``Riding a
bicycle is like lifting free weights: It incorporates more muscle
groups and gives you a more balanced overall workout.''
</P>
<P>
   When bicycling, make a conscious effort to feel the way your
body moves and responds; try to relate the motions to your
exercycle. Then, even if your instructor is pushing extremely high
revs, keep your revolutions lower and resistance a bit higher.
(Fair recommends 120 to 140 rpm with light resistance for
cardiovascular training and 60 to 80 rpm with increased resistance
for strength exercise.)
</P>
<P>
   You're heart rate will still be elevated, yet your legs won't be
spinning wildly and you'll be getting a better overall workout. &QL; 
SMOOTH RIDING
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're on a stationary bicycle or a bike made for
transportation, there are three key factors on which to
concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   __ Position in the saddle: While pedaling, the legs should have
a slight bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Too much bend and
the seat should be raised; an almost straight leg at the bottom of
the pedal stroke means the saddle should be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   The waist and arms should also be slightly bent; do not ride
with locked elbows and hunched shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Be seated with your ``sit points'' on the wider rear section of
the saddle. If you are unfamiliar with your sit points, sit on the
edge of a hard chair or bench. The two points you feel at the base
of your buttocks are protuberances of the hip bones and provide the
skeleton with optimal support. If you are new to cycling, the sit
points might be sore for up to four weeks until they become adapted
to this position.
</P>
<P>
   __ Efficient pedal revolution: While seated and pedaling,
picture your feet rotating in smooth, full circles. Select a
cadence that allows you to have constant pressure on the pedals,
instead of the pedals coming around so quickly that you are
bouncing up and down on the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring the upper body into the exercise: Select a gear that
allows you to pedal off the saddle with a fair amount of
resistance, which is easiest to obtain while riding uphill. Raise
your body off the saddle while bending your waist and arms so that
you are positioned in the middle of the bicycle, just ahead of the
nose of the saddle. Your weight will be forward and on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Next, as the pedal comes around and you begin pushing downward
with your foot, pull upward at the same time with the corresponding
arm (i.e. right foot pushing right arm pulling). Let the bicycle
rock from side to side rhythmically. This brings your arms,
shoulders and back into the cycling motion for a better total-body
workout, but use this technique only for short periods.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If you are unclear about any of the above descriptions,
inquire with a bicycle dealer for proper fit and guidance. Always
consult a physician before starting any exercise program.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ A vast and plodding Hurricane Bonnie rumbled
ashore near the mouth of the Cape Fear River on Wednesday
afternoon, bringing whipping winds and horizontal squalls through a
region that is still recovering, both physically and emotionally,
from the trauma of back-to-back hurricanes in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Wednesday evening, there were no reports of deaths
or serious injuries in the region from the category 3 hurricane,
which carried maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour. But
state officials and weather forecasters worried that the worst
could still be ahead as the slow-moving storm continues its
northerly movement up the North Carolina coast Wednesday night and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern for residents of the Outer Banks, a narrow
and ecologically fragile chain of barrier islands, was that Bonnie
would move straight up Pamlico Sound nd create surging floodwaters
that could cut new inlets and submerge the islands' single highway.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that damage assessments of the Outer
Banks, and of much of the rest of the North Carolina coast, would
not be possible until well into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie finally made land after two days of anxious
anticipation, residents here seemed fatalistic about the weather
currents and rotten luck that have brought three hurricanes to
their quaint, well-mannered town in only two years. In 1996, a mild
hurricane named Bertha struck in July, only to be followed two
months later by a devastating category 3 storm named Fran. That
hurricane resulted in 24 deaths in North Carolina, and 34 total,
and caused an estimated $6 billion in property damage, including
hundreds of downed trees in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Fran's impact was symbolized by the destruction of the
197-foot-tall steeple at the First Baptist Church, a local landmark
that is still being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when we heard about this one was that it
couldn't happen again, that you just can't have three in a row,''
said C. Bruce Williams III, a spokesman for New Hanover County's
emergency management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just one of those things.'' Gary Green, a
37-year-old cook who was waiting out the storm at a shelter at MCS
Noble Middle School here, said he liked the area enough to put up
with the enduring threat of wicked weather. ``Where are you going
to run on this planet?'' he asked. ``If you go to the Midwest you
put up with tornadoes. You go to the west coast and you put up with
earthquakes. You choose your poison as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Miami said that Bonnie's speed
had decreased gradually throughout the day to 8 miles per hour from
nearly double that speed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie will be persisting over eastern North Carolina for at
least another day, creating a serious flood threat from rain,'' the
forecasters said in their 5 p.m. advisory. ``Rainfall totals of 6
to 12 inches are possible. Totals could be much larger, possibly in
excess of 15 or 20 inches if the forward speed of Bonnie decreases
further.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million residents and tourists evacuated
coastal areas of North Carolina and South Carolina on Tuesday and
Wednesday morning, filling makeshift emergency shelters in schools
and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews were declared across the region and most bridges from
the mainland to barrier islands were blocked by police cars. An
estimated 97,500 households were without electricity along North
Carolina's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Supply, about 30 miles south of Wilmington, Bonnie's winds
destroyed a portion of the roof at Brunswick Hospital, forcing
officials to move 34 patients to another unit. Here in Wilmington,
a gust blew out a 40-foot section of windows at New Hanover High
School.
</P>
<P>
   On Bald Head Island, near the point of the hurricane's landfall,
47 people were stranded after missing the last ferry Tuesday night
and some took shelter in the island's lighthouse after breaking its
lock. ``It certainly would be better than even the more modern
houses,'' said Andy James, a spokesman for the state's emergency
management team. ``It's been there a long time and weathered a lot
of storms.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse squatters were not the only ones trapped by the
storm. On North Topsail Beach on Wednesday afternoon, two young men
stranded on the island ran through the blinding rain when they saw
a sheriff's car stopped on a road. Mitch Fowler, of Burlington, and
Dennis Poythress of Sneads Ferry, had spent the day trying to
repair Fowler's car.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting the car going, it became buried in the sand
and was eventually flooded by rising sea water, Poythress said. ''I
didn't care if it was the pope,'' said a soaking Poythress as he
crawled into the sheriff's car. ``I was ready to get off the
island. I'm about to starve. I want some dry clothes and a dry
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wilmington, the storm splintered a number of the oak
trees that give this city of 60,000 its elegant grace. Power lines
all across town drooped limply from poles and debris-littered
streets became obstacle courses for the few drivers braving the
roads. The almost universal outages forced the daily newspaper
here, the Morning Star, to send its eight-page Thursday edition to
Fayetteville to be printed.
</P>
<P>
   Although local officials warned that it was early to make broad
assessments, the damage to trees and property here seemed far
milder than that caused two years ago by Hurricane Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some air views of damage and some scouting around by
people,'' David Paynter, a spokesman here for the New Hanover
County Emergency Management Agency, said late Wednesday afternoon.
``It seems the hurricane has not created that much damage, but
we've got at least seven more hours before the main part of the
storm leaves this area.''
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of people along the coast fled the hurricane, at
least one family drove here deliberately to witness it. Doug Shales
and his 21-year-old daughter, Sarah, detoured to Wilmington while
returning from Tampa, Fla., to their home in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to experience a hurricane for a long time,''
Shales said. ``We just came on the spur of the moment. It's very
special for us to happen to land somewhere where you're going to be
in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shaleses spent the day watching the hurricane through the
picture windows in their room at a Holiday Inn. Shales noted that
his family spent time in 1993 in an historic blizzard atop Beech
Mountain. ``We just kind of really enjoy weather extremes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here remained exasperated that they had been
struck by another hurricane before finishing repairs from the last
one. Kathy Rackley, a 39-year-old housewife from Wilmington, said
she still has trees in her yard that were felled by Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of depressing,'' she said. ``You want to see
everything done before something else comes along and blows it all
down.'' Jack Goodhue, who fled a barrier island to take shelter in
a Wilmington motel, summed up the mood of many. ``What's happened
here?'' he asked. ``Have they pinned a target on Wilmington?''

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Bonnie's turn to the north didn't
come in time for southeastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's worst winds battered Brunswick and New Hanover
counties Wednesday afternoon, flooding beach areas, cutting off
power to nearly 80,000 people and causing other scattered reports
of damage.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, Brunswick County's emergency management center
in Bolivia dispatched vans to the Brunswick Hospital at Supply,
where at least part of the roof had been blown off.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five patients were in the hospital when the sheet metal
roof over one ward was blown off, said Brunswick County spokesman
Huey Marshall. The five most-critical patients, including a mother
and her premature child, were taken to Grand Strand Medical Center
in Myrtle Beach. Officials were moving the other patients to other
hospitals in the area Wednesday night and were preparing to close
the hospital until after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   At South Brunswick Middle School in Boiling Spring Lakes, about
60 people had to be moved to the nearby high school about 3 p.m.
after a roof leak flooded the middle school.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2:30 and 3 p.m., the eye of the storm crossed Bald Head
Island, much farther south than forecasters had predicted Tuesday.
Meteorologists said a trough of air north-northwest of the storm
kept it from turning north and put it on a direct course for
Brunswick and New Hanover counties.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., Hurricane Bonnie was centered about 40 miles south of
Wilmington. The storm was moving north about 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds extended up to 115 miles from the center,
battering much of the region. Gusts of 90 to 100 mph were recorded
across parts of New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender counties by
around 11:30 a.m., the National Weather Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   The storm center was expected to curve to the north-northeast
Wednesday night, raking across much of the North Carolina coast.
Bonnie's slow speed and immensity _ nearly 400 miles across _
threatened to keep winds battering the region for 12 to 18 hours
and potentially keep the storm in the region through two high-tide
cycles, increasing the possibility of devastating storm surges.
Surges were running about 9 to 11 feet above normal tide levels
Wednesday, the National Weather Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was expected to maintain its strength over land,
eventually reaching Currituck Sound about 8 a.m. Thursday before
heading north-northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's wide eye _ about 15 miles _ had Scott Garner
worried. The Brunswick County emergency management assistant was
afraid people would be lured outside during the lull.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to evacuate or they need help, we'll try to get
help to them,'' he said. ``But this is only a lull.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 National Guard troops, the 30th Brigade from Raleigh,
were sent to Wilmington to protect lives and property.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials were still hunkered down in safe
buildings Wednesday afternoon and had only scattered reports of
damage. A resident leaving Southport called the town's emergency
center to say a church steeple was down, but no one ventured out to
confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   A fire broke out at the General Wood plant in Leland, which
makes utility poles. But the Leland Fire Department had to abandon
the scene because of high winds. No damage estimates were
available.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmington firefighters were responding to calls of downed
electric lines, fallen limbs, sparking transformers or alarm
systems set off by power surges within city limits. But New Hanover
County Emergency Medical Service crews stopped sending ambulances
to the south end of the county as early as 4 a.m. Wednesday because
heavy winds were rocking trucks on the road. At Fifth Avenue and
Market Street, the steeple at First Baptist Church, which is being
rebuilt after Hurricane Fran toppled it in 1996, was holding late
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tide peaked at Wrightsville Beach well before the
center of the storm hit, portions of the town were under water, in
some places, as much as 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The water was washing over the sandbags at Shell Island Resort,
but it did not appear to be moving the bags, John Nesbitt, public
works director for Wrightsville Beach, said.
</P>
<P>
   The water was washing over the dunes at some locations, he said,
but it didn't appear to be washing sand away as badly as Fran did
at a similar point in the storm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had the wind with this storm that we had in
Fran,'' he said. ``The waves are not anywhere near the size they
were in Fran.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brunswick County, winds estimated at 110 mph at 2 p.m.
Wednesday snapped pine trees, downed power lines, stripped shingles
from roofs and separated a Calabash house, possibly a mobile home,
from its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   All Brunswick County's islands had been evacuated the night
before the storm. Sunset Beach officials resorted Wednesday
afternoon to binoculars to survey the island for damage. No major
damage was reported as of 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people remained on Bald Head Island, said Fire Chief
Kent Brown. Some ventured out Wednesday afternoon when the eye of
the storm passed over the island, and they reported light damage,
Chief Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pender County, Emergency Management Director Carson Smith
said the Topsail Beach police chief told him there were loose
shingles and small objects blowing around on Topsail Island, but no
major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Power was out in the western end of the county, but eastern
Pender still had power in the early afternoon. The only damage
emergency officials had heard about was flooding and downed trees.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers went to Topsail Island during a low in the
storm. They saw flooding and breaches in protective dunes, but no
homes destroyed.

SPORTS COLUMN: OVER FENCE CAME BEFORE OVER COUNTER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In Mark McGwire's first time at bat in Little League
in Claremont, Calif., in 1974, he hit a home run over the fence. He
was 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in high school, he hit a ball so far that it cleared
a 320-foot fence, flew over a vacant lot and slammed into the wall
of a gymnasium an estimated 500 feet from home plate. When Mark
McGwire was at the University of Southern California, he whacked 32
home runs in one season (a Pacific-10 record).
</P>
<P>
   In his first full year in the big leagues, in 1987, he belted 49
homers to share the major league lead with Andre Dawson. He has
continued orbiting homers, including 58 last season.
</P>
<P>
   In each locale, McGwire, like every other athlete, sought to
make himself stronger, fresher, bigger, better. So the consumption
of choice began with lemonade, escalated to oranges and candy bars
(Snickers, he said) and on to broccoli and _ it's true _ spinach.
</P>
<P>
   As he draws closer to Roger Maris' single-season home run record
of 61 _ he has hit 53 homers with 34 games left in the season going
into Wednesday night's contest against the Marlins _ the Cardinals'
McGwire has found something even dearer to his heart, and sinews,
than fruits, vegetables and sucrose. This year he began taking
androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement that is supposed to
enhance the benefits of daily workouts by strengthening body
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is legal in Major League Baseball and in the National
Basketball Association _ though banned in the National Football
League, and by the NCAA and the International Olympic Committee _
McGwire is breaking no rules. While the recent revelation that he
is using it has sparked a national debate, doctors still are not
sure of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   But, an inquiring public asks, is it McGwire or his pharmacist
who is responsible for splintering seats in the bleachers and the
upper decks?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has an obvious, and remarkable, natural athletic talent,
especially for hitting a baseball long distances, consistently. And
he has continued to work on it, and his body, with, apparently, an
uncommon devotion. He maintains a rigorous weight-lifting program,
and is said to study films of pitchers with the intensity of a
used-car dealer reading the fine print in a contract.
</P>
<P>
   He has got bigger _ and better _ as the years have progressed.
His stands 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 245 pounds, some 25 more than
when he broke into the major leagues in 1987. His arms are huge,
particularly his forearms, which, Bobby Valentine, the Mets'
manager, said, ``look like calves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's only part of the story,'' Valentine said. ``He's
learned the strike zone better, his swing is more compact, and he's
much more disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   His manager, Tony La Russa, derides speculation that it is
something other than ability that is responsible for McGwire's
blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach timing in hitting a baseball, especially when
you're talking about hitting a 93-mile-an-hour slider,'' he said.
``And if it was just muscle and strength generating those home
runs, then you'd have every weight-lifter and offensive lineman
come off the street and start hitting balls over the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   The art and science of hitting a baseball go beyond that. It is
a particular skill that may elude even the greatest of athletes _
just as the finest chef may meet his bete noire with a pineapple
upside-down cake. Michael Jordan, for one, discovered in his
adventures in the minor leagues a few years ago that a curveball
dipping on the outside corner got the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't generate good bat speed,'' Valentine said. ``He
was all upper body.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players in the league acknowledge taking Andro, as the
supplement is called, including Jason Giambi of Oakland. Giambi has
20 homers, and Maris may rest easily about his challenge. The
knowledge, meanwhile, that one substance can enhance performance
while another cannot _ or to what degree _ still meets with
conflict within the sports and medical communities.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Major League Baseball and the players union jointly
asked doctors to gather information about players' use of
muscle-enhancing pills. Reckless or harmless, athletes have always
sought an edge. Steak, for example, was once considered the best
pre-game meal. Now it is disparaged, in favor of pasta. Ty Cobb
eschewed both in favor of sharpening his spikes.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on Mark David McGwire, however, is that he is
legitimately the most astonishing home run hitter the world has
known since George Herman Ruth ambled to the plate.

CLINTON URGED TO PRODUCE WRITTEN REPORT TO COUNTER STARR'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some of President Clinton's political advisers have
recommended that his lawyers write an account of his legal troubles
to counter an expected report to Congress from Independent
Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is preparing a summary of his seven-month investigation of
Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. The report, which would serve as the basis for a likely
congressional inquiry, may also deal with other aspects of Starr's
four-year investigation, which originally focused on the Clintons'
Whitewater real estate investment.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the president's behalf would probably cover the
range of matters that Starr has investigated, administration
officials said. White House aides maintain that the prosecutors are
biased against Clinton and will not produce a balanced account of
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing sense that the report will not be either
complete or objective,'' an administration official said. ``There
is some desire to offer a counter to the report.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that a recommendation for such an alternative
report was made Tuesday to the White House counsel's office. But
David Kendall, the president's private lawyer and chief legal
strategist, is away on vacation, and no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has acknowledged that he had an intimate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky and misled the public about it, but he has denied
breaking any laws.
</P>
<P>
   The White House may also choose to disclose some sensitive
information in advance of the report, officials said. The
president's aides have frequently used that approach in the past to
dull the impact of any disclosures by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official called the proposal for an
alternative report one of ``many ideas that span a large range that
are being talked about internally here.'' Some of the ideas have
been passed on to Clinton, he said, but ``I don't think the
president has signaled back how he wants to proceed.'' Clinton is
on vacation with his family on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the president's advisers have been urging him to make a
fuller apology to the public than he offered in his public remarks
about Ms. Lewinsky in a four-minute speech Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, when Clinton interrupts his vacation to speak about
crime and school violence in Worcester, Mass., he probably will
make a brief reference to his efforts to repair relations within
his family. But he is not expected to make detailed remarks about
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   They are expecting him to be asked about the former intern at a
joint news conference to be held in Moscow next week with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. One administration official said Clinton
wanted to say ``something short and simple'' about his troubles
Thursday ``to avoid having to deal with it for the first time
publicly when you're standing in the Kremlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats reacted with consternation Wednesday to comments
by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and others that were
critical of Clinton and receptive to the possibility of impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are fueling the problem and making it worse by
this ridiculous hand-wringing,'' said Bill Knapp, a Democratic
consultant who has advised Clinton in the past. ``They're pouring
kerosene on it, and lighting a match, and the Republicans are just
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gephardt called Clinton's actions ``reprehensible'' and
said he would reserve judgment on whether the president should be
impeached. He said that he would review Starr's report before
deciding.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in an interview with Reuters, Gephardt seemed to
retreat a bit. ``I'm as disappointed as anyone about what's
happened, but that's history,'' the news agency quoted him as
saying. ``It's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House responded mildly to Gephardt's
comments on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, what Congressman Gephardt said was that
the Congress has very serious constitutional responsibilities with
respect to this issue, that it should be approached completely
without partisanship, and that members should not prejudge the
facts,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv on Martha's
Vineyard. ``And there's nothing there that I can see to disagree
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gephardt's use of the word ``reprehensible,'' Toiv
said, ``Well, I think that's a judgment that he has made.''

BLUEPRINT FOR THE QB OF THE FUTURE CAN BORROW FROM THE PAST,
PRESENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty years ago, Johnny Unitas was the standard by which all
quarterbacks were judged.
</P>
<P>
   Young, smart and able to gun the ball through coverage with
sheer arm strength, Unitas was the prototype for an NFL passer. And
in 1958, he used those skills to lead the Baltimore Colts to the
league championship by beating the New York Giants, 23-17, in
overtime in what became known as The Greatest Game Ever Played.
</P>
<P>
   But take the 25-year-old Unitas out of 1958 and drop him into an
NFL offense in 1998 and he becomes a relic. At 6-foot-1, 190
pounds, he is dwarfed by the likes of Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe,
Kerry Collins and Ryan Leaf. He lacks mobility, making him a
sitting duck for swift, powerful pass rushers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 model quarterback is gifted in ways Unitas couldn't
have imagined, beginning with the size and strength of Leaf and
Bledsoe, the quick feet of Mark Brunell and the spectacular running
ability of Kordell Stewart. He combines the powerful arm of Brett
Favre with the deft touch of Aikman, not to mention Steve Young's
uncanny ability to digest a War and Peace-size playbook and
Manning's born-to-be-a-quarterback football acumen.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no set formula for NFL success. With his
knowledge of the game, his arm and his toughness, Unitas would
likely be a terrific quarterback today despite his physical
limitations. Indeed, the list of current great or potentially great
passers who are conspicuously missing one or more of the key
elements includes Miami's Dan Marino (painfully slow), Young (too
small), Arizona up-and-comer Jake Plummer (small and lacks a
top-of-the-line arm) and Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer, a 1998 Pro Bowl
selection who has struggled with the mental aspects of the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think what you're looking for has changed a
lot,'' Washington Redskins general manager Charley Casserly said.
``I mean, everyone wants a mobile quarterback, but there really
aren't that many of them out there. You want an athletic guy with a
strong arm who can make all the throws. You need a certain level of
intelligence and instincts and the ability to make good, quick
decisions. It's no different now.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the position has evolved noticeably in the past 40
years. Quarterbacks can make more plays in more ways while facing
increasingly more athletic and complex defenses and sorting through
more sophisticated audibles and reads.
</P>
<P>
   In piecing together the quarterback of the future, the first
clues could come this season with the debuts of Indianapolis'
Manning and San Diego's Leaf, the first and second picks in the '98
draft, both of whom are being touted as perhaps the next great one.
In Denver, the Broncos say third-round choice Brian Griese can be a
star and are preparing him to replace John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   If they reach their potential, these three rookies could make an
impact similar to the one made by the famed draft class of 1983,
led by Elway, Marino and Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has retired, Elway has said this is his last season, and
Marino will follow soon. They are now the past. In their place is a
generation of quarterbacks whose parts add up to the prototype.
</P>
<P>
   These days, NFL quarterbacks are not required to call plays as
Unitas did, but they have far more to sort through, at the line of
scrimmage and after the snap. Multiple-receiver sets, many of which
call for the receiver to make reads along with the quarterback,
give passers more choices. Defenses counter with complex and
well-disguised coverages and rush schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas never had to contend with the trendy zone blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not call the plays, but he has to make the adjustments
at a second's notice,'' Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw
said of today's quarterback. ``He still has to be in charge and
make the plays. He has to be someone who can take the heat and can
perform in adverse situations, a guy who won't lose his poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Poise is a key ingredient, but one that's hard to categorize. It
goes beyond intelligence, or the ability to read defenses.
</P>
<P>
   All quarterbacks know their offenses, and most are as familiar
with their opponents' defenses. And Young not only knows where all
the San Francisco receivers and opposing defenders are supposed to
be on a given play, but he knows what to do when they're ``not''
where they're supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Young knows when to stand in and deliver the ball just before
taking a shot, and he knows when to run. He puts the ball in the
right place, which doesn't always mean right on the numbers; a good
quarterback throws the ball where the receiver can get it but the
defender can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such a grasp of the position,'' Casserly said. ``He
knows all the tricks and uses them to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the arm is stronger than the mind at times. Favre can
make a questionable decision but make the play work because he can
fire the ball between defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The truly gifted _ such as Favre, Elway and Jeff George _ make
not only the standard throws but also passes that defy convention,
throwing accurately across their bodies on the run or off the wrong
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Strength is only part of the equation. Accuracy is necessary
because an ``open'' receiver in the NFL is usually a step or less
ahead of a defender. And a quick release is essential to get the
pass off ahead of rushers.
</P>
<P>
   That ability is what the Colts saw in Manning, the former
Tennessee star. When San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard saw
Manning on film, he called Manning's father, former NFL quarterback
Archie, and said: ``I was just watching the Tennessee-Alabama tape.
Tell me, how does your boy get rid of the ball so fast?''
</P>
<P>
   If the protection collapsed around Unitas or Joe Namath, they
might sidestep the rush or step up in the pocket, or they could
throw the ball away, but most often they would ``eat the
football,'' tucking it away in preparation for the inevitable hit.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fran Tarkenton came along and changed everything,
scrambling away from trouble. Playing behind the expansion
Minnesota Vikings' porous offensive line, it was run or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Once it became apparent that a scrambler could succeed, they
became more common. Scramblers gaining credibility after Roger
``The Dodger'' Staubach carried the Cowboys to their first Super
Bowl victory in 1972. Eventually, mobility went from luxury to
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Even drop-back passers such as Aikman and Bledsoe can move and
buy time when pressed, a trait known as ``escapability.'' The best
runners, Pittsburgh's Stewart and Jacksonville's Brunell, are
running backs in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kordell runs faster than most wide receivers,'' Bradshaw said.
``That's a little different than what we're used to seeing. He's
someone coaches have to be aware of, because if he gets outside,
you're not going to catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is so effective as a runner that Steelers coach Bill
Cowher changed the rules by which most passers operate. Most young
quarterbacks have a problem staying in the pocket long enough to go
through their reads and let receivers come open. Stewart was
staying in long enough, but Cowher felt that was wasting his
talent. So he had Stewart take less time looking at the defense
before making his decision to pass or run. It's a strategy that
might become common as more running quarterbacks enter the league.
</P>
<P>
   Although mobility can help avoid a pass rush, it won't keep a
quarterback from taking a pounding. No matter how swift or agile,
he's going to get hit, and the blows can take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason 230-pound quarterbacks are no longer a rarity.
Carolina's Kerry Collins is 6-5, 240. Troy Aikman goes 6-4, 219.
And Leaf, the Chargers' rookie starter, is 6-5 and weighs 250 or
more, depending on when you catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to stay healthy is a high priority, and obviously
a guy with a lot of size is better able to stand up to the hits,''
New Orleans scout Tom Marino said. ``You want at least 215-220
pounds, and you also want the height to be able to see the whole
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas a 220-pound quarterback used to inspire awe in coaches,
now he is greeted by shrugs. Manning is a solid 6-5, 225, but, to
draft analysts, he was the small quarterback, small compared to
Leaf. Griese, the midget of the rookie class at 6-3, 215, is two
inches taller and 25 pounds heavier than his Hall of Fame father,
Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Said St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome: ``Today's
game makes it very difficult to be small.''
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a Unitas of the '80s and '90s, it was Elway.
At 6-3, 215, he has the size scouts wanted and, of course, the arm,
which has been the strongest in football history.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of mobility, well, Elway ranks fourth in career rushing
yardage among quarterbacks. His knowledge of the game is
unquestioned, and as for leadership and heart, he has an
unparalleled 45 come-from-behind victories, including The Drive of
98 yards to win the 1986 AFC title.
</P>
<P>
   But the prototype has begun to pass Elway. The latest examples
are Manning and Leaf, who represent opposite ends of the
quarterback spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf is the embodiment of physical prowess, huge and gifted. He
has a vertical leap of 36 inches and runs 40 yards in 4.7 seconds.
At Washington State, where he was taller than four of his five
offensive linemen, Leaf set weightlifting records to go with his
passing marks.
</P>
<P>
   No shrimp himself at 6-5, 225, Manning is the thinking man's
prospect. He has the arm and the release, but his football
knowledge makes him special. He has been tutored by his father
since his youth. By the time he was in high school, Manning was
breaking down film and organizing off-season drills.
</P>
<P>
   And the next step up the evolutionary ladder might already be on
the horizon. When the expansion Cleveland Browns open the 1999
draft, they are expected to select a quarterback to carry the
franchise. At the top of the board will likely be Daunte Culpepper
and Tim Couch, who have all the expected tools and add dimensions
to the position.
</P>
<P>
   If Couch elects to leave Kentucky after his junior season, he
could give the Browns the latest incarnation of the classic
drop-back passer. He is a 6-5, 233-pounder who, like Manning, has
been raised practically from birth to be a quarterback. As a
sophomore in 1997, Couch led the nation in passes (547),
completions (363), percentage (.664) and yardage (3,884). And he's
still improving; the deep ball was his project during the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leaf, Central Florida's Culpepper is gigantic, fast and
powerful, with the arm to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as big as a house, 6-5 and 250, and a tough kid,'' Tom
Marino said. ``But his first game as a freshman, he went 18-for-21.
Last year, he had his best game against Nebraska. That tells you a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The halftime score of that game _ Central Florida 17, Nebraska
14 _ said enough. Even in losing, 38-24, Culpepper emerged as a
national star, going 24-of-35 passing for 318 yards and a touchdown
against the Cornhuskers. Perhaps his most eye-opening play was a
bruising 10-yard touchdown run in which he showed speed and power
in bulling through two defenders at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the kind of thing you would picture Unitas
doing. Then again, Culpepper has a lot to learn about other phases
of the game. When the two come together, will that, then, be the
quarterback of the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is pretty easy to spot,'' Bradshaw said. ``Bigger,
stronger, faster, better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Moments after lecturing on his favorite
subject, the crime reduction in New York City, to his preferred
audience, a group of law enforcement officials, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani received a compliment Wednesday that could only be
described as peculiarly Iowan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor should look very closely at our Iowa caucus,'' said
Steve Grubbs, the Republican state chairman, before introducing
Giuliani to a gaggle of Iowa and New York reporters. ``If he ran
for president, he would finish in the top three.''
</P>
<P>
   There are problems associated with such an invitation, however
flattering. To start with, the caucus is 18 months away. What's
more, the mayor would be a moderate in a field that favors
conservatives. Oh, and Giuliani has acknowledged no interest
publicly in seeking the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, he responded to Grubbs by saying again that he has
given no thought to such a lofty goal, and was in Iowa only to
raise money for fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the very public invitation brought smiles of satisfaction
to the faces of Giuliani's aides. Their boss had come to the
Midwest in the seemingly innocuous role of Republican
soldier-cum-star, with no professed motive other than to support
colleagues and share his musings on the party's future. And yet the
mayor, in a slightly softer manifestation than the one routinely
seen in New York City, had charmed many Iowa Republicans with his
big-city tales of a plummeting murder rate and a crackdown on
welfare. He had succeeded in the often subtle game of Keep Me in
Mind.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the standing ovations Giuliani received Wednesday in
Iowa City, Cedar Rapids, and Waterloo really constituted anything
more than Midwestern hospitality remains to be seen. After all, he
is a social moderate who favors gay rights, gun control and
abortion rights, in a state in which 75 percent of those who vote
in the Republican caucus are against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is nationally recognized as a crime fighter
_ ``the leading warrior,'' he was called at a crime conference in
Cedar Rapids _ at the same time that Iowa has become obsessed with
crime, particularly a proliferation of the drug methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor so impressed Bill Kidwell, chairman of the Johnson
County Republican Committee and a retired police detective, that he
immediately began envisioning a country in which Giuliani was
addressed as Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke of law and order, he spoke of welfare, he spoke of
drug dependency,'' Kidwell said. ``I think that he's just the man
who can turn this country around to when I was a kid and you all
were dinky shavers.''
</P>

NFC CENTRAL 
TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 
1997: 10-6, 3-5 in NFC Central 
Coach (record): Tony Dungy (16-16) 
Stadium: Raymond James Stadium (65,394) 
Ticket information: (813) 879-2827 
Pieces in place 
QB Trent Dilfer (21 passing TDs), RB Warrick Dunn (1997 rookie of
the year), FB Mike Alstott (10 TDs), DT Warren Sapp (10.5 sacks), C
Tony Mayberry (1997 Pro Bowl), LB Derrick Brooks (1997 Pro Bowl),
LB Hardy Nickerson (1997 Pro Bowl). 
Key newcomers 
WR Bert Emanuel, RB Lorenzo Neal, WR Jacquez Green, CB Brian
Kelly. 
Key losses 
TE Jackie Harris 
Missing piece 
The Buccaneers reached the playoffs in 1997 for the first time in
14 seasons despite an offense that ranked 29th in yards per game
(273.5) and last in points scored (18.7). The main problem with the
Buccaneers' offense was its anemic passing game, which mustered a
measly 152.6 yards per game, last in the league. The club's leading
receiver last season was Dunn, who caught 29 passes. Dungy hopes he
correctly addressed his wide receiver problem through free agency
with Emanuel, who led Atlanta last season in receptions (65), yards
(991) and touchdowns (9). Dungy drafted Green, the speedy Florida
receiver, with his first pick in the draft. Reidel Anthony, who
will probably begin the season as the starter opposite Emanuel,
Horace Copeland and Karl Williams give the Buccaneers depth at the
position. All in all, Dilfer, a Pro Bowler in 1997, should have
plenty of weapons to take Tampa Bay deep into the playoffs. 
Biggest test 
The Buccaneers have two killer stretches in their schedule. They
open with three of their first four games on the road against
division foes Minnesota, Green Bay and Detroit. They were 2-1 in
those cities last season. Then, from Nov. 15 to Dec. 13, they play
at Jacksonville, vs. Detroit, at Chicago, vs. Green Bay and vs.
Pittsburgh. 
Watch out for 
Sapp. He anchors a defensive line that helped limit 2,000-yard man
Barry Sanders to fewer than 100 yards rushing in two of their three
games last season _ 20 in a regular-season contest and 65 in the
playoffs. Sapp single-handedly dominated some teams last year (ask
San Francisco and Green Bay), and he looks like he will become the
next great defensive superstar. Sapp has plenty of talent around
him. The unit limited 11 teams to less than 20 points last year. 
Milestones 
The Buccaneers have not won a road game in December since a 17-14
victory at Washington on Dec. 18, 1994. 
Overview 
The Buccaneers have a Super Bowl-contending defense. They have a
solid running game. If Dilfer can continue to play mistake-free
football, and if one of the young wide receivers can turn into a
big-play threat _ two ifs that are not unlikely _ the Buccaneers
could be Super Bowl-bound. 
Prediction: 11-5

GREEN BAY PACKERS 
1997: 13-3, 7-1 in NFC Central 
Coach (record): Mike Holmgren (71-35) 
Stadium: Lambeau Field (60,790) 
Ticket information: (920) 496-5719 
Pieces in place 
QB Brett Favre (35 passing TDs), RB Dorsey Levens (1,435 rushing
yards), WR Antonio Freeman (1,243 receiving yards), WR Robert

Butler (5 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
DE Eric Curry, RB/KR Glyn Milburn, DT Vonnie Holliday. 
Key losses 
CB Doug Evans, S Eugene Robinson, DE Gabe Wilkins, G Aaron Taylor. 
Missing piece 
The Packers, who have won more regular-season games (37) than any
team the past three seasons, were exposed in their Super Bowl loss
to Denver. Broncos running back Terrell Davis pounded the soft
underbelly of the Packers' defense, and that of massive tackle
Gilbert Brown, for 157 yards and three touchdowns. The Packers'
defense, which was 20th against the rush in 1997, continued to take
its lumps during the off-season as Robinson, Wilkins and Evans
departed for big free-agent contracts. The departure of Wilkins and
the on-again, off-again retirement antics of Reggie White in the
spring have left the defensive line in a mess. White will play in
1998, but no one knows how effective he'll be. No. 1 draft choice
Holliday will make the switch from tackle to replace Wilkins at the
other end. And Holmgren will depend on a rotation of Dotson, Brown
and Vaughn Booker at defensive tackle. Coaches worry most about the
350-pound Brown, whose lackluster conditioning has made him a
liability late in some games. 
Biggest test 
Prime Time. No, Favre won't have to worry about having an
interception return for a touchdown by the Cowboys' Deion Sanders.
We're talking about television here. The Packers play four night
games on national television; vs. Minnesota on Oct. 5, at Detroit
on Oct. 15, at Pittsburgh on Nov. 9 and at Tampa Bay on Dec. 7. The
world will get to see whether the Pack has slipped back into the
pack. 
Watch out for 
Who else but Favre. The three-time most valuable player is one of
the few players who can win it by himself. If the defense is having
a bad day, he can win the game with five touchdowns. He can also
lose it by himself, as he did with two crucial turnovers in the
Super Bowl. There are a lot of things happening in Green Bay, with
all of the free-agent defections and the holdout of Levens. But the
overachieving Packers live and die on the right arm of its resident
super hero, Favre. 
Milestones 
The Packers have won 23 consecutive regular-season home games. If
they win the first five home games of the 1998 season, they will
break the 1971-74 Dolphins' record for most consecutive home
victories (27). The Fab Five on Green Bay's home schedule are
Detroit, Tampa Bay, Minnesota, Baltimore and San Francisco. Hmmm.
Maybe the Dolphins' record will live on. 
Overview 
No NFC team has been to three consecutive Super Bowls. But any team
with Favre is a worthy Super Bowl contender. Thus, despite the fact
that they lost several key free agents and that they play in the
toughest division in pro football, the Packers should be considered
division and conference favorites. Sooner or later, those questions
on defense will come back to haunt the Green and Gold and, perhaps,
help open the door for a new conference champion.

1997: 9-7, 3-5 in NFC Central

yards), WR Cris Carter (13 receiving TDs), WR Jake Reed (1,138
receiving yards), DT John Randle (15.5 sacks), OT Todd Steussie
(1997 Pro Bowl), G Randall McDaniel (1997 Pro Bowl). 
Key newcomers 
WR Randy Moss, CB Jimmy Hitchcock, CB Larry Brown. 
Key losses 
CB Dewayne Washington, CB Leonard Wheeler. 
Missing piece 
The Vikings could not stop anyone in 1997. They were 29th in total
defense, 29th against the pass and last in average yards allowed
per play. Oddly, despite losing three cornerbacks to free agency,
they spent their first pick in the draft on the talented but
troubled Moss. But Green thinks he has shored up his pass defense
with the signings of Hitchcock from New England and Brown, who
spent the past two seasons in Al Davis' doghouse in Oakland.
Hitchcock, Brown and incumbent starter Corey Fuller are not Pro
Bowl players, but Green hopes they can parlay their veteran savvy
into big plays out of the Vikings' zone defense. 
Biggest test 
Overconfidence. The Vikings play eight games in 1998 against clubs
who missed the playoffs in 1997. If they can avoid too many upsets
and play .500 or better against the clubs who did make the
playoffs, Dennis Green could find himself in the playoffs again. 
Watch out for 
Moss. With the emotional guidance from former bad-boy Cris Carter,
Moss, the troubled wide receiver from Marshall University, wasn't a
problem in the off-season. If he continues on the straight and
narrow, the Vikings' explosive offensive unit could rack up a bunch
of 400-yard days. If Moss acts up, which he hasn't in more than two
years, he could take the whole team down with him. So far, so good
if you are a Vikings fan. 
Milestones 
Running back Robert Smith has not fumbled in 415 attempts from
scrimmage. 
Overview 
The Vikings have too much offense not to reach the playoffs for the
sixth time in seven seasons. And maybe this is the season the club
can sneak into the conference finals. That's highly unlikely,
though, with its questions in the defensive secondary.

CB Terry Fair. 
Key losses 
OLB Reggie Brown, C Kevin Glover, CB Corey Raymond, DT Mike Wells. 
Missing piece 
The Lions have Super Bowl-type talent limited by wild-card
quarterback Mitchell. Three of the club's losses came by nine or
more points to clubs that missed the playoffs in 1997. In those
games _ against New Orleans, Buffalo and Washington _ Mitchell
threw four interceptions and two touchdowns passes. If the Lions
are to win the division and perhaps have home advantage part or all
of the playoffs, Mitchell must play better against weaker teams. To
help him achieve that, the Lions brought in former Seattle QB Jim
Zorn as Mitchell's position coach. 
Biggest test 
From Nov. 22 to Dec. 14, the Lions are at Tampa Bay, Jacksonville
and San Francisco, and they are home against Pittsburgh on
Thanksgiving Day. 
Watch out for 
If there was ever a problem with the Lions it was their rushing
defense. Opposing offensive lines pushed around the Lions' smallish
front four of Tracy Scroggins (255 pounds), Mike Wells (287
pounds), Elliss (291) and Porcher (270) for an average of 114 yards
per game, 18th in the league. Things seemingly did not get better
in the off-season as Wells, the club's best run stopper, signed
with Chicago. The club picked up Dan Owens (290) from Atlanta to
replace him. Owens, like the other Lions defensive linemen, is a
better pass rusher (8 sacks) than run stuffer (41 tackles). In all,
the front four the Lions will put on the field this year totaled 36
1/2 sacks in 1997. So, if the Lions can force teams into passing
situations, they'll give themselves a better chance of winning. 
Milestones 
With one touchdown, Barry Sanders will move into sole possession of
eighth place on the all-time career list. Sanders has 105
touchdowns, tied with former Packers WR Don Hutson. 
Overview 
The Lions are the fourth-best team in the best division in football
and that should be enough to earn a playoff berth. If Zorn can turn
Mitchell into a clutch quarterback, and Sanders stays injury-free,
this club could go far into the playoffs.

CHICAGO BEARS 
1997: 4-12, 1-7 in NFC Central

Ticket information: (847) 615-2327

yards receiving), DT Jim Flanigan (6 sacks), MLB Barry Minter (6

Alonzo Mayes, DT Mike Wells, S Tony Parrish. 
Key losses 
LB Bryan Cox, RB Raymont Harris, KR Tyrone Hughes, DE Alonzo
Spellman. 
Missing piece 
The Bears feature three new starters at linebacker this season,
though Minter started on the outside last season. Minter replaces
Cox. Candidates to flank Minter are Michael Lowery and Sean Harris.
``Who?'' That's what Bears fans are asking. These guys will be
counted on to help a defense that ranked 19th against the run last
season and a respectable 12th overall. Minter is the closest thing
they have to a playmaker at this position. Overall, the club is
hoping that improved front-four play will hide some of the
weaknesses of its no-name linebacker crew. 
Biggest test 
Every game. The Bears have the second-toughest schedule in the
league. Each of their division opponents reached the playoffs last
season. Their first two nondivision opponents, Jacksonville and
Pittsburgh, also were in the playoffs. They do have a stretch of
four games in five weeks against non-playoff teams. 
Watch out for 
The Bears' offense, which was 28th in scoring, may surprise a few
people. First-round draft choice Enis and former Green Bay RB
Bennett are upgrades from the Bears' anemic 1-2 punch of Rashaan
Salaam and Raymont Harris. In the passing game, Conway runs a
sub-4.4-second time in the 40-yard dash. The Bears were 3-4 when he
was healthy last season, 1-8 when he was out of the lineup.
Opposite Conway, the Bears want to start World League phenom Marcus
Robinson, who is 6-foot-5 and runs a 4.35. Mayes and John Allred
give the Bears better-than-average tight ends. The Bears' offensive
line is as physical as any in the league, helping the club lead the
league in time of possession in 1997. Leading the charge will be
Kramer, who split time with the struggling Rick Mirer last season.
Management thought so highly of Kramer that they let Mirer go, and
re-signed Kramer to a three-year, $9 million contract. 
Milestones 
Among active place-kickers, the Bears' Jeff Jaeger, who spent much
of his career with the Raiders, is ninth in career field goals with
206. 
Overview 
The Bears have too many questions on defense to make much of an
impact in what is clearly the toughest division in pro football.

LONGHORNS IN HURRY TO REVEAL NEW SPEED

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Inspectors are indispensable if you need to sell a
house. As the husband of a real-estate developer, Mack Brown
understands this concept.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-year Texas coach doesn't need them on his football
team. Not if they play defense and fit the definition of the word
Brown is teaching his Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't run, you're an inspector. You get there as
everyone is unpiling and inspect what happened,'' Brown said. ``We
don't want that. We want guys who are angry and get there in time
to create chaos. To do that, you've got to have speed.''
</P>
<P>
   That has meant swapping size for speed throughout a Texas
defense that allowed a school-record 366 points last season. No
position is more indicative of the fresh mind-set than outside
linebacker, where the Longhorns plan to start a former fullback and
a converted safety at the respective spots in the team's Sept. 5
opener in Austin against New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   One is De'Andre ``DeDe'' Lewis, a redshirt freshman who played
fullback on the scout team in 1997. The other is Aaron Babino, who
made 87 tackles at strong safety, but lost his starting job in the
final month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has played a down at his new position in a college game.
But that doesn't make them unique. Of the Longhorns' 11 projected
defensive starters, seven were playing other positions at this time
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of weird to look around out in practice,'' said
middle linebacker Dusty Renfro (6-foot, 240 pounds), a senior and
third-year starter. ``I'm used to seeing two other linebackers
built like me: short, stocky, plug-the-hole guys. Now, I've got
guys on both sides that are so fast, you have to tell them to be
careful and not overrun the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis runs the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. Babino has been
clocked in 4.4. Both will be asked to blitz frequently in a
pressure-oriented scheme that will place nine men near the line of
scrimmage on most downs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who inherits a team that finished 4-7 in its final season
under predecessor John Mackovic, said he wants to use an aggressive
defense to change the team's mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitude is 90 percent of football,'' Brown said. ``You change
the attitude, you can change the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (6-1, 225) and Babino (6-1, 215) say they've enjoyed
changing positions, as well as perspectives, since last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss carrying the ball. This is where I need to be,''
said Lewis, who requested the move during off-season workouts. ``I
had no idea what type of defense I was stepping into when I asked
to move. But I've loved it since the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Babino said he did not have to think twice when coaches
approached him with the idea of playing closer to the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love blitzing. I wish they'd send me on every play,'' Babino
said. ``This gives me a chance to make more big plays. Plus, I was
already big for a defensive back. It should be easier for me to
cover the tight ends and running backs than it was to cover wide
receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players concede they have areas to improve upon in their
new positions. Lewis said he occasionally struggles with
overpursuing on misdirection plays. Babino said he sometimes feels
overmatched when taking on offensive tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro, however, said he has seen significant progress from both
during fall drills. At a recent practice, Lewis knocked out
scout-team tailback Tony Ellis with a tackle. By the end of the
workout, Babino recorded two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linebackers have to be the meanest guys on the field,'' Renfro
said. ``And they're both doing a good job of sticking their noses
up in the holes and hitting guys hard. I don't think I'm going to
have to give either one of them meanness lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Mack Brown worry about whether they should arrive on
time to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both really fast for linebackers,'' he said. ``The
negative is they don't have any experience. But the positive is,
they'll run and get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown hopes they arrive long before the inspectors.

U.S. JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSILE STRIKE ON SUDANESE DRUG PLANT IS
QUESTIONED

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chemical that the United States cited to
justify its bombing of a Sudanese factory last week could be used
for commercial products, the agency overseeing the treaty barring
chemical weapons said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has insisted that the chemical found outside
the plant could only mean that the plant was intended to make the
nerve agent VX. Sudan contends the plant made medicines and
veterinary products.
</P>
<P>
   The international treaty group, the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, conceded that it was not aware of
any commercial product on the market that contained the chemical,
nor of another chemical compound made with it.
</P>
<P>
   But its spokesman, Donato Kinigier-Passigli, said in a telephone
interview on Wednesday that a search of scientific papers showed
the chemical, known as EMPTA, could be used ``in limited quantities
for legitimate commercial purposes.'' The uses, he said, included
fungicides and anti-microbial agents, and not just the production
of VX.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon official said that the treaty organization had
simply uncovered academic examples of possible use with no real
evidence that any commercial products are made from EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you identify a chemical agent for commercial
uses, that does not mean anyone makes it,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration leveled the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant in Khartoum with a volley of cruise missiles
last Thursday, saying it had evidence linking the factory to the
manufacturing of VX and to a shadowy network of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Facing questions about the decision to bomb the factory, senior
administration officials said on Monday that a soil sample
collected nearby provided irrefutable evidence of the presence of
VX at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Kinigier-Passigli emphasized that the organization had come to
no conclusions about the administration's charges or the Sudan's
counter-charges. The independent organization administers the
chemical weapons treaty, signed by more than 160 nations and
ratified by the U.S. Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organization's disclosure raised questions about the
administration's categorical assertions that there could be no
other possible explanation for the presence of EMPTA, or ethyl
methylphosphonothionate. Wednesday's disclosure added to a number
of inconsistencies in the administration's accusations, including
statements by a senior intelligence official hours after the
bombing that the plant in Khartoum was heavily guarded and produced
no commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined on Wednesday to discuss the
evidence or the caveats raised by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. However, Defense and intelligence
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they still
believed there could be no other explanation for the presence of
EMPTA in a soil sample secretly collected outside the facility
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, several American experts in chemical warfare and
analysis offered another possible explanation. They said the
chemical's structure resembled that of an agricultural insecticide,
known as FONOFOS, which is commercially available in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While the two are not identical, they have molecular
similarities and could be confused in a laboratory test performed
under less-than-ideal conditions, said Hank Ellison, a
counterterrorism expert who ran the Army's chemical and biological
warfare programs at Fort Campbell, Ky., in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, now the president of Cerberus &AMP; Associates, Inc., a
security consulting firm in Michigan, said that while the chemical
characteristics of FONOFOS and EMPTA were not identical, they were
``very similar'' and those similarities ``could be misinterpreted
in a lab analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine this soil sample wasn't taken under the best of
circumstances, by somebody placing it in a cooler and immediately
sending it to a lab,'' he said. ``And quality control for the
storage and manufacture of pesticides and insecticides is not the
highest in the world, so that could increase the possibility of
seeing similarities in the chemical structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense and intelligence officials dismissed the possibility
that the United States could have misinterpreted the soil sample.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hague, an official with the chemical weapons
organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said scientific
research also suggested that EMPTA could be the byproduct of the
breakdown of other pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The international treaty, which the United States Senate
ratified last year despite the reservations of many conservative
Republicans, who said the organization would never be effective,
does not identify EMPTA by name.
</P>
<P>
   But the treaty covers it under the ``Schedule 2'' list of
chemicals that are subject to scrutiny by the organization's
inspectors. By definition, chemicals included on Schedule 2 can
have legitimate commercial purposes. That is unlike chemicals on
Schedule 1, which are deemed to have no other use than to kill
people and are strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is the
international agency whose more than 400 enginers and diplomats
oversee the inspections of governments and chemical companies
around the world to assure they are not making prohibited agents.
The group searched known scientific literature in respone to press
inquiries on EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan has not signed the treaty, so factories like Shifa
Pharmaceuticals are not subject to its inspectors, unlike companies
in the United States and other nations that have approved the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   While the organization did not identify any products using
EMPTA, officials said they could not rule out the possibility as
strongly as the administration has.
</P>
<P>
   The official at the organization, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the scientific research showed companies including
the Mobil Corp. and International Chemical Industries of America
had conducted research into commercial applications that used
EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan has called for an international investigation of the
missile strike, which killed one person and wounded seven others,
according to the government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carnaffin, a British engineer who worked as a technical
manager during the factory's construction from 1992 to 1996, said
he never saw any evidence of EMPTA or other materials involved in
the production of VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I went into every corner of the plant,'' he said in
a telephone interview from his home in England. ``It was never a
plant of high security. You could walk around anywhere you liked,
and no one tried to stop you.''

 &HT;    Wind, water brings rising tide of trouble
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, N.C. -- As Hurricane Bonnie crawls through North
Carolina, officials are worried about flooding today, not so much
from the storm surge caused by intense winds but simply from the
volume of rain a stalled storm will dump into the Pamlico River.
</P>
<P>
   Places in eastern North Carolina could receive up to 20 inches
of rain over the next 24 hours, said Daden Wolfe, director of
emergency management for Beaufort County, 90 miles inland from
either tip of the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good handle when (Bonnie) was going 14 mph,''
Wolfe said. ``Now it's going at a snail's pace. You're just going
to have rain on top of rain. Buckets full.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said one computer model put the eye of the storm in
Washington about 2 p.m. today. Diminished winds may be less than
hurricane force. Driving winds cause storm surge, a wall of water
that has the effect of raising sea level. The slower winds may not
be any better news for Washington, which contended with partial
flooding of downtown in 1996 during Hurricanes Fran and Bertha.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just different news,'' Wolfe said. Wednesday, some local
roads had flooded here and in nearby Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, before squall lines churned across the area in
counterclockwise fashion and contributed to scores of traffic
accidents and minor flooding, a few police officers gathered at the
bulkhead that holds the Pamlico out of downtown. They looked at
nearly 20 boats parked in the middle of the river and wondered
which ones would sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will flood so quick here,'' said Patrolman S.F. Szabo. By
late afternoon, the Pamlico lapped at the top of the bulkhead
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department is just three blocks from the river, so
officers were prepared to stow their things in patrol cars. They're
expecting to stay on continuous duty through at least tonight.
</P>
<P>
   When Fran and Bertha socked it to this area in 1996, the water
rose close enough to the top of the drawbridge that anyone standing
at the top had only to lean over to reach the river.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest of Beaufort, rain poured into the Tar River in
adjacent Pitt County. The Tar heads downstream and feeds into the
Pamlico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get some flooding,'' Wolfe said. ``We just
don't know where.''

<P>
   The collapse in the world's emerging stock markets _ the
Thailands, Polands and Russias _ has been breathtaking. Not since
these markets began to attract strong investor interest at the end
of the 1980s have they had such a sharp decline, one that wiped out
so many years of gains.
</P>
<P>
   Their plunge over the last year, worldwide, now outranks that
during the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-95 and that during the
Persian Gulf war of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Without a quick rally, August will be the worst month for stock
markets in developing economies since 1988, when their performance
began to be tracked in index form. So far this month, these markets
have lost 20 percent of their value. Since Asian financial crises
began in July 1997, they have erased all their gains back to
December 1991, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital
International emerging markets index.
</P>
<P>
   A second index, that of International Finance Corp., a member of
the World Bank Group, has the markets declining to where they were
in February 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has tried to pick the bottom has been destroyed,''
said Ron Chapman, head of international equities at Dreyfus Corp.,
who has had his own fingers burned.
</P>
<P>
   Near-panic selling in disregard of a country's economic
fundamentals is causing many investors and stock analysts to
reconsider whether these markets are sensible for even the hardy
long-term investor, the kind who has accepted volatility in
exchange for large potential gains.
</P>
<P>
   And the risks seem to be growing, with Russia's deepening
economic crisis pulling the far healthier Latin American stock
markets down with it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest phase of the Russian crisis is also exposing another,
possibly more damaging, fault line: a collapse in the prices of
emerging-market bonds. It is in the global capital markets that
emerging-market countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin
American borrow to meet government financial needs.
</P>
<P>
   If that borrowing becomes very expensive, investors will worry
about the ability of Latin American countries to pay off their
debts and to cover their trade deficits, which are already at
worrisome levels. That, in turn, will put more pressure on the
currencies, forcing countries to raise their interest rates to
defend their exchange value. Such developments could rapidly
undermine a country's otherwise stable economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging nations are already paying a lot to get investors to
buy their securities. The difference, or spread, between the yield
on emerging-market debt and U.S. Treasury securities has jumped by
nearly six percentage points, to 13 percentage points, according to
the J.P. Morgan emerging-market bond index.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the Mexican peso crisis erupted in December 1994 has
the spread widened so fast. At the peak of that crisis in 1995,
emerging markets were paying on average 19 percentage points more
than the United States did on its Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, of course, did not default on its debt, with
considerable aid from the United States and other industrial
nations.
</P>
<P>
   But the refusal of the International Monetary Fund, the United
States and its economic partners to rescue Russia before it
essentially devalued the ruble two weeks ago and defaulted on some
debt has caused a serious reassessment of the risks in all emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the system now have a lender of last resort?'' asked
Desmond Lachman, head of emerging-markets economic research at
Salomon Smith Barney and a former official of the International
Monetary Fund. ``Bulgaria didn't fail, Thailand didn't fail,
Indonesia didn't fail. But now Russia fails.'' For troubled
economies, he said, ``the IMF and the Group of Seven are no longer
there as a backstop.''
</P>
<P>
   As this view takes hold, emerging-market bonds may come under
even more intense pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For now, investors still interested in these markets must wait
until the frantic selling ceases. And this will not happen until
hedge funds and other money managers who have big losses in places
like Russia stop selling to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   Having borrowed to make many of their bets even bigger, they
need cash to pay off their loans. In some cases, that means selling
stocks in Latin America, where markets have more liquidity, as well
as in other regions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The disclosure on Wednesday that George Soros, the legendary
hedge-fund operator, lost $2 billion in Russia in the last year
shows how great the damage may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerging markets have become more a game for speculators and
traders _ and a nightmare for dedicated long-term investors,'' said
Robert Pelosky Jr., global emerging-markets strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``In the short run, fundamentals don't seem to
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after the dust clears, many investors are likely to
balk at plunging back into emerging markets despite analysts'
estimates of great opportunities at such prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some new management system for these crises,''
said Gary Kleiman, senior partner at Kleiman International
Consultants, a research and advisory firm in Washington. Without a
new international system for containing currency crises and the
fallout that often follows, Kleiman said, it will be hard to
persuade his institutional clients to bet on emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little upside and too much downside risk for those
who can't afford to leave their money there for five years to 10
years,'' he said. ``It is probably better just to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosky of Morgan Stanley said he thought that emerging-market
investors would shift from selecting specific countries to picking
specific companies. ``The game is going to be very different,'' he
continued, ``in the next two to three years.'' In the past,
investors have jumped in on economic potential _ betting, for
example, that the rapid growth and low inflation in Asia in the
early '90s would guarantee great returns.
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, he said, investing would be based more on
``what this company does and how does it compare to its
competition.'' This nitty-gritty approach fits with the long-term
hope for emerging markets: that economic fundamentals will again
determine the winners and losers.

(53); RBI McGwire (114); SB Delino DeShields (21). W Kent Mercker
(8); ERA Matt Morris (2.17). Saves Jeff Brantley (14). Strikeouts
Kent Bottenfield (88).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: In the midst of a short six-game homestand, St. Louis
took a four-game losing streak in Wednesday night's game with
Florida. The Cardinals were 11-12 this month, 22-23 since the
All-Star break and have been under .500 since June 25th. Somehow,
they still remain 9-1/2 games back in the NL wildcard race. . . .
Despite all the offensive fireworks the team's 172 homers are
second only to Atlanta's 177 St. Louis ranks seventh in NL scoring
and its team batting average (.258) is 12th. Only San Francisco has
left more men on base (an average 7.6 a game) and the team strikes
out seven times a game. . . . But it is pitching that has really
betrayed the Cards this year, through injury and ineffectiveness.
Six pitchers have been on the DL (Alan Benes has been there all
year), forcing manager Tony La Russa to experiment with 14
different starters. Darren Oliver, acquired from Texas for opening
day starter Todd Stottlemyre, is 1-2 as a Cardinal. The club has
lost 14 times after leading in the eighth inning. . . . They can
reach the fences. Ten different Cards contributed to the team's
first 34 homers this month. They have homered five times in five
games against the Braves but the Braves are hitting .279 against
St. Louis pitching, 94 points higher than the Cards. . . . Morris,
tonight's starter, only rejoined the rotation at the All-Star break
due to a tender right shoulder. He and the absent Benes comprise
the pitching future of the organization. Though just 4-3, Morris's
support has been spotty. In his 10 starts, the Cardinals have
scored three or fewer runs six times. He won in New York in his
last start, limiting the Mets to two runs on six hits through seven
innings. On the DL: RHP Alan Benes (right shoulder surgery), RHP
Mike Busby (right elbow ligament strain), INF David Howard
(shoulder strain).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: OF Ray Lankford had brought his average up 21 points
since the All-Star break, with 13 homers and 13 doubles among his
last 51 hits. OF Ron Gant has 20 homers in his last 32 games. OF
Brian Jordan is hitting .339 at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: 2B Delino DeShields is hitting .204 since coming off
the DL Aug. 10. Close Jeff Brantley has seven blown saves in 21
save opportunites.
</P>
<P>
   C Eli Marrero is hitting .189 with runners in scoring position.

 &HT;    Make no mistake

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Walk him.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the strategy for most teams facing Mark McGwire
this season. McGwire has walked 138 times in 131 games and is on
pace to break Babe Ruth's major league record of 170.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves' pitching staff takes a different approach. They
view McGwire as the ultimate challenge and go right at him with
their best. That approach is expected to continue tonight, when
Atlanta begins a four-game series against the Cardinals in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, whose 53 homers average out to one every 7.7 at-bats,
has faced Atlanta pitchers 20 times this season. He has three hits,
one home run and a .158 batting average. Atlanta pitchers have
walked McGwire once. They have struck him out nine times.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves faced McGwire in Atlanta earlier this month, he
didn't get a ball out of the infield during an 0-for-11 stretch. He
struck out seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the guys who are throwing,'' Braves pitching
coach Leo Mazzone said. ``I'll say this, that we're not going into
the game looking to walk him. We're looking to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's ability to shut down McGwire helps prove the adage
that good pitching beats good hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come up with any unique strategies or anything,''
Mazzone said. ``What we worry about is beating the Cardinals and
not placing any more emphasis on McGwire than the rest of their
lineup. He may get to us yet. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will get his chance against Denny Neagle, Greg Maddux,
Tom Glavine and Kevin Millwood. During the July-August series,
McGwire faced Maddux, Glavine and Millwood. John Smoltz, who
started Wednesday in Houston, has never pitched against McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to face him when I am at my best,'' Smoltz said.
``It would be like facing Barry Bonds of late. He's gotten me a
couple of times lately, but I didn't back down. And I wouldn't back
down to Mark. But that series we pitched against him in Atlanta,
that was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Braves pitchers has a different approach when going
against McGwire. Millwood, who struck him out twice, tried to match
him with power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went with pure stuff,'' Mazzone said. ``He didn't sacrifice
stuff for location. He didn't back off at all. He looked like he
tried to turn it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get ahead of him and take him out,''
Millwood said. ``I wasn't going to give him a pitch he could do a
lot with. I got excited pitching against him. He is a good hitter,
on top of hitting all those home runs. It is a little bit more
exciting getting those types of guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux spends his time trying to outfox McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was locating well against him, forcing McGwire to guess,''
Mazzone said. ``And he guessed wrong. That doesn't happen all the
time, but Greg has this way of fooling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine will work both sides of the plate against McGwire. On
Aug. 1, he worked the inside part on McGwire's first at-bat, then
outside. McGwire went 0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy is never going to give in to the strike zone to
anyone,'' Mazzone said. ``He's not going to accommodate him by
throwing the ball over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle probably will have to work the hardest. It will be his
first appearance against McGwire this year. McGwire was 0-for-7
against him last year with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is you can't be intimidated,'' Neagle
said. ``He is human. Guys get too nervous facing him, and they
worry about making the perfect pitch. Then they make a mistake and
give up a homer. He is a great home run hitter, but he also has
some mistakes in his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone said his pitchers have not made mistakes against
McGwire. And it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great mistake hitter, and, on a mistake pitch that
someone else may send into the air in center for an out, McGwire
hits it 500 feet,'' Mazzone said. ``Then there are times like last
year, when Tommy threw a pitch off the plate low and away, and
McGwire went down and got it and hit it into the center-field
stands. When that happens, you tip you hat to the hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Atlanta has done very few times.

 &HT;    Atlanta 500 Classic At A Glance
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any race-car driver, even the legendary A.J. Foyt, will admit
that luck has to be a factor in winning or losing. And Kenny Brack
is on an incredible lucky streak, as well as on the verge of a
historic winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do is cross the finish line first in Saturday
night's Atlanta Classic 500. A victory here would give Brack an
unprecedented three straight IRL victories.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure must be growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Brack said Wednesday. ``The only pressure on myself is
from myself. It's always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack is the hottest driver in the Indy Racing League. He has
won the last two races, the VisionAire 500 on July 25 at Charlotte
Motor Speedway and the Radisson 200 on Aug. 16 at Pikes Peak
International Raceway, in his Power Team Racing
Dallara/Aurora/Goodyear owned by four-time Indianapolis 500 winner
Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   And there is how he won, which is where the luck factor comes
in:
</P>
<P>
   At Charlotte, Brack made a daring pass of Jeff Ward with 12 laps
to go for his first career IRL win. He took the scary high position
exiting turn 2 in a three-wide formation _ the same thing could
happen at AMS on Saturday night _ on lap 196, and went on to beat
Ward by 5.602 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He ran out of fuel in turn 4 on the last lap of the Radisson 200
but coasted down the front straightaway to win his second
consecutive IRL race. Luck goes both ways _ Brack ran out of gas
while leading the Indy 500. Before the existence of IRL, drivers
have had longer streaks _ Foyt won seven in a row in 1964 _ but
racing wasn't awash in dollars then as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to race purses, the victory at Charlotte put Brack
in position to share $1 million with a fan through the MCI Pep Boys
Million Dollar Driver sweepstakes. Brack must win at Atlanta and at
the season finale Oct. 11 at Las Vegas to split $1 million with a
lucky fan who picked him to sweep the three races.
</P>
<P>
   Another turn of luck has him No. 2 in the IRL championship
points race with the chance to share another million-dollar poke.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, with 232 points, is one behind leader Scott Sharp.
Earlier in the week, the IRL took 15 points away from former
leader, Tony Stewart, as part of a penalty to Team Menard for
technical violations at the Radisson 200. Team Menard also drew a
$25,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is in third place with 227 points. Five or six points
might look like a slim lead, but Stewart won the 1997 championship
by six points.
</P>
<P>
   There should be some furious racing between Brack, Sharp and
Stewart on Saturday night, and Brack has the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   A distant seventh in the point standings after the New England
200 on June 28 at Loudon, N.H., Brack trailed leader Stewart by 58
points after that race.
</P>
<P>
   Brack and the Foyt team have done well on super speedways this
year. Brack finished third in the June 6 True Value 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway, a sister track to Atlanta Motor Speedway and
Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   He also recorded the fastest speed among drivers participating
in a Goodyear tire test July 28-29 at AMS, 221.185 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Brack will have plenty of challengers at AMS, with one of the
biggest fields of the Pep Boys Indy Racing League season competing.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate, Boat, is at the top of the list. Boat won the True
Value 500 but couldn't compete at Charlotte because of injuries
suffered in a crash at the New England 200. However, he came back
strong by winning the PPG Pole for the Radisson 200.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also must be considered a prime threat. He knows his way
around AMS, having recorded an unofficial track record speed of
228.505 mph July 7 in his Glidden-Menards Special
Dallara/Aurora/Firestone during the league's Open Test at Atlanta.

 &HT;    Earnhardts enjoy chance to unveil Monte Carlos
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seconds after Dale Earnhardt Jr. uncovered the shiny black No. 1
Chevrolet Monte Carlo with the decal of the Coca-Cola polar bear
decal on the hood, a rumble of a NASCAR engine on MLK Jr. Drive
grabbed everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Sr., driving a shiny red No. 3 Chevy with the
checkered-flag Coke bottle design on the hood, pulled beside the
other car at the World of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The fans gathered behind the crowd-control ropes cheered as if
The Intimidator had entered victory lane. ``Pretty neat, isn't
it?'' Dale Sr. said, after climbing out of the car. ``Dale Junior's
got the polar bear car with the teddy-bear driver. Earnhardt's (car
is) the classic.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Earnhardts and Coca-Cola unveiled the cars that
will be driven in a November race in Japan. Father will drive
against son for the first time in the season-ending exhibition
race, Nov. 22, at the Twin Ring Speedway in Motegi.
</P>
<P>
   It also marks Coke's return to car sponsorship in stock-car
racing for the first time since sponsoring Bobby Allison in 1974.
At the moment, it's a one-time deal, accompanied by a full line of
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Earnhardts appeared to be as excited about their cars on
Tuesday as they are to be racing against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real good-looking race car,'' Earnhardt Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change of pace (for me), with the red car and red
uniform,'' Earnhardt Sr. said. ``I didn't know if we'd ever see
Dale Jr. in a black car, because I drive the black 3, but here he
is in a black No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Earnhardts began some good-natured kidding: ``I can
ground the kid, and I also can dock his pay,'' Dad said.
</P>
<P>
   The Earnhardts race in different leagues. Earnhardt Sr., of
course, is the seven-time Winston Cup champion and winner of this
year's Daytona 500. Earnhardt Jr., who turns 24 next month, is
leading the Busch Grand National points race in his third season,
winning five times in the No. 3 Busch car that his father owns.
</P>
<P>
   The Japan race will be Junior's first in a Winston Cup car, and
his dad said Tuesday the son will move up to the big-league level
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go test Dale Jr. in Homestead and get him some time in a
Winston Cup car,'' Earnhardt Sr. said. ``He's used to the downforce
of the Busch cars. We want to get the Winston Cup car tuned in for
him.

   Team Panoz
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by a crash and a questionable decision by officials, the
best the Panoz team could do was fourth place in Sunday's Six Hours
of the Glen at Watkins Glen, N.Y. A yellow flag went out
immediately after the No. 5 Panoz team of Raul Boesel, Eric Bernard
and Andy Wallace, running first in class and second overall at the
time, entered the pits. Officials held the Panoz team for 36
seconds once the pit stop was completed because they thought the
yellow flag came out before the car had entered the pits, closed
for the first lap of the caution period. Wallace lost almost a full
lap, and Panoz never was able to regain it. The No. 4 Panoz was
involved in a multicar accident on lap seven that took it out of
the race. Driver David Brabham was uninjured. The CanAm team of
Gianpiero Moretti of Italy, Didier Theys of Belgium and Mauro Baldi
of Monte Carlo won in a Ferrari 333SP and celebrated Moretti's
retirement in victory circle.

RENO ORDERS PRELIMINARY INQUIRY INTO GORE'S FUND-RAISING PHONE

(sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno advanced a significant
step closer on Wednesday toward deciding whether to ask for an
independent prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al Gore's role
in fund raising for the 1996 campaign, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ordered a 90-day preliminary inquiry into whether Gore lied
to investigators last year when he was initially interviewed about
his telephone solicitations to donors from the White House, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Gore's fund-raising calls was reopened
after the White House produced a 1995 memo last month that
suggested Gore and other Democratic campaign officials discussed
how the money he solicited would be used.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators in recent days have interviewed
several of the meeting's participants, who have indicated that Gore
could have known that some of his fund raising would be funneled
into direct re-election efforts _ which could be illegal, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno determines at the end of the three-month investigation
that there is evidence that Gore misled investigators, she will be
obligated under the independent counsel law to refer the case to an
outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lawyer said on Wednesday that Gore had done nothing
wrong. ``The vice president volunteered to be interviewed, and he
has been interviewed twice,'' said the lawyer, James Neal. ``I am
totally satisfied that Vice President Gore has fully, completely
and honestly answered every question asked of him, and I am
confident that when this investigation is completed, the Department
of Justice will reach the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has reached this stage before in deliberating whether to
seek an independent prosecutor to examine Gore's fund raising. Some
officials doubted that her decision on Wednesday indicated that she
would ultimately seek an independent prosecutor into campaign
finance abuses _ suggesting that the evidence against Gore is
insubstantial. Others said that Reno was unpredictable on such
issues and could go forward with the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been a contentious one. For more than 18 months,
the attorney general has refused to request that an independent
counsel look into campaign finance irregularities in the face of
angry Republican denunciations that she has covered up for the
White House and has shielded President Clinton and Gore from
possible prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision on Wednesday was contained in a formal
notification to the three-member panel of appellate judges who
actually select independent counsels. But the Justice Department
did not announce its action on Wednesday, awaiting an authorization
from the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republicans attacked Reno for focusing on only one
of the numerous allegations of wrongdoing and for setting up a
timetable that will delay a decision until November, after this
year's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent counsel is a must for the entire campaign
fund-raising investigation,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is
chairman of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. Earlier
this month, the panel voted to cite Reno with contempt for refusing
to provide lawmakers with a memo from Charles La Bella, the former
head of her campaign finance unit, recommending the appointment of
an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But to Democrats her action once again raised the specter of yet
another independent prosecutor who could be appointed to
investigate an administration already battered by an inquiry by
another independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, into Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the inquiry into Clinton's conduct, an independent
prosecutor investigating even a seemingly narrow issue like the
vice president's phone calls could lead to a wider examination of
alleged campaign finance abuses. Such an inquiry could take years,
exacting a political and legal toll in an embarrassing, costly and
disruptive process that could distract the Democratic Party through
the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Gore knew that any of the 46 fund-raising
calls he made from the vice president's office raised money that in
part was diverted to ``hard money'' accounts at the Democratic
National Committee, which are subject to federal election law and
can be used to directly support candidates like Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Reno said that if Gore had used his White House
office to raise hard money, the telephone calls could be considered
a violation of a federal law barring government officials from
raising political funds on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   But last December, when Reno formally rejected referring the
phone call issue to an independent prosecutor, she absolved Gore of
wrongdoing in connection with the calls. At the time, she based her
decision on what she said was the lack of any evidence suggesting
that the vice president knew his solicitations raised ``hard
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department investigators have raised additional
questions about Gore's statements in part because of newly
discovered handwritten notations on a Nov. 21, 1995, White House
memorandum that suggests ore may not have been candid about the
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several copies of the underlying campaign budget memo had been
provided to prosecutors. But the copy with an aide's handwritten
notations was not turned over by the White House until last month,
nearly 18 months after the Justice Department first subpoenaed
campaign-related material.
</P>
<P>
   The notations, written during a White House meeting, also held
on Nov. 21, indicate that participants, who included Gore,
discussed diverting part of the contributions into hard money
accounts. The notes were written by David Strauss, the vice
president's deputy chief of staff, and were released publicly last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants at the meeting were Clinton; Donald
Fowler, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, and
Marvin Rosen, the former Democratic Committee finance chairman.
Gore appeared to be an enthusiastic participant, and was quoted by
his aide as saying ``count me in on the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss also noted ``65 percent soft, 35 percent hard,'' an
apparent reference to the division of contributions between hard
and soft money accounts. In his small neat hand, Strauss jotted a
shorthand definition of soft money as ``corporate or anything over
$20k from an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials said that interviews with other
participants, some of them taking place in the last few days, have
produced new information supporting the contention that the hard
money issue was thoroughly discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said from the start that he believed his activities
were lawful and that he thought his solicitations were for soft
money only, and he did not realize that part of the money he raised
would be deposited in ``hard money'' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said in an interview with investigators last fall, and in a
follow-up interview earlier this month, the officials said, that he
believed the contributions would be deposited in ``soft money''
accounts, to be used only for general party purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In a Dec. 5, 1997, report on her findings, Reno wrote:
``Evidence found investigators shows that the Vice President
solicited only soft money. For example no donor said the President
or Vice President solicited hard money. Donors were given
instructions on donating to D.N.C. soft-money accounts and the
amounts solicited exceeded hard money limits.''

IN TIGHT CALIFORNIA RACE, THE TOP ISSUE IS CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a new poll showing their contest a virtual
dead-heat, Sen. Barbara Boxer and state Treasurer Matt Fong traded
jabs Wednesday over abortion, the death penalty and President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, a Republican, repeatedly sought to paint Boxer, the
Democratic incumbent, as a hypocrite for having been relatively
circumspect in her initial comments about accusations that Clinton
was involved with the former White House intern, while having
strongly criticized Republicans like former Sen. Bob Packwood and
Justice Clarence Thomas over allegations of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara, your silence on this issue is deafening,'' Fong
declared at the beginning of the first face-to-face encounter of
their campaign, an hourlong debate at a television station here in
which the first three questions from a panel of journalists
involved the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most pointed exchange so far in a race that national
political analysts are watching for signs of potential fallout from
the president's admission of the relationship last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Boxer, whose daughter, Nicole, is married to Hillary Rodham
Clinton's brother Tony, sought to blunt the attack, echoing her
comments after Clinton's speech last week by saying crisply: ``What
the president did was wrong,'' and adding, ``He should have stepped
forward sooner and taken responsibility.'' But, in what quickly
became a refrain, Boxer also asserted, ``We can stand under a cloud
and get nothing done, or we can do what we have to do for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate and exchanges with reporters afterward, Fong
himself repeatedly declined to answer whether Clinton should
resign, saying that as a potential member of the Senate, which
would hold any impeachment trial, he did not want to prejudge the
case. Boxer said that meant the two of them had the same position.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the debate if she thought the president's behavior
constituted sexual harassment, Boxer said, ``That's a matter for
Monica Lewinsky to state.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she won office with 48 percent of the vote in 1992, Boxer
has reliably ranked as California's most liberal officeholder, this
in a state that has lately preferred moderates, and politicians
here have predicted for some time that she would face a close race
this year. In fact, Fong, who narrowly won the Republican
nomination after a divisive primary battle in June with Darrell
Issa, a millionaire businessman, is now within easy striking
distance, according to public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Field Poll, released Wednesday, showed Boxer and Fong
running even, with each drawing the support of 45 percent of likely
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 625 likely voters, conducted over the last week,
had a margin of sampling error of four percentage points, and it
found that Boxer's support among women had been cut in half from
1992 levels.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief news conference after the debate Wednesday, Boxer
attributed her standing in part to the fact that she had yet to
begin broadcasting television advertisements in her campaign, and
that, unlike her Democratic colleague, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who
faced a closely fought contest in 1994, she had not been a presence
on the airways in a state in which politics sometimes seems to
exist only in paid commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, Boxer displayed the verbal fluency that has made
her among the most outspoken members of Congress but little of the
abrasive edge about which critics in both parties have sometimes
complained.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the soft-spoken Fong, a lawyer and former Air Force
officer who has been state treasurer since 1995, showed his
relative inexperience with several verbal missteps, once declaring
that Boxer was ``not soft on crime,'' only to catch himself, laugh
and say he had meant the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, 57, sought to portray Fong, 44, as willing to ``unravel''
Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision upholding the right to
abortion. But Fong countered by noting that while he was an adopted
child proud that his birth mother ``chose life,'' he supported
abortion in the first trimester. He said he opposed taxpayer
financing for abortion, and favored requiring parental consent for
minors, and accused Boxer of trying to ``scare women.''
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange that pointed out how thoroughly both major
parties in California now support the death penalty, Boxer claimed
that she had voted 100 times in Congress to impose it, and balked
only at executing juvenile offenders. Fong answered the question by
saying that if anyone ever harmed his 15-year-old daughter, ``I'd
certainly want to break his neck,'' adding ``even including her
boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the debate for a clarification, Fong said, ``I would
find it very difficult'' to apply the death penalty to juveniles,
but aides said that he would be willing to do so for at least 16-
and 17-year-olds.

RILEY OUTLINES PLAN TO PREVENT SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY GEORGE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Schools will get help in preventing deadly outbursts
from troubled students, such as in Springfield, Ore., under a plan
outlined Wednesday by U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Riley was visiting Seattle and Tacoma for back-to-school pep
talks promoting business and community involvement in schools. Most
area schools start next week and Seattle starts Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Post-Intelligencer, Riley said students
need closer connections to adults, whether through a more trusting
atmosphere or smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   He said a new set of ``early warning'' recommendations call for
each school to have a violence prevention plan and to have ``an
openness for young people to feel free to talk'' about their
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are part of an advisory guide to be mailed
to all school principals within a couple of days. They are to be
announced Thursday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The guide will recommend how to tell if a student is on the
verge of an outburst, how to quell that rage and how to react if a
student actually does unleash violence at a school.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Riley to develop the guide in the wake of the
Springfield school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, 15-year-old Kip Kinkel killed his parents at home,
then went to his high school and opened fire, killing two and
wounding two dozen others. He was known to be fascinated with guns
and bombs, and was suspended for bringing a gun to school the day
before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shooting, Riley told a safe schools
conference, ``We must commit ourselves to one very basic idea: that
every child in America in a school has a positive and caring
relationship with at least one adult. This simply has to be the new
standard we set for our nation's schools and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he said his plea is still urgent.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of School Psychologists helped develop
the new guide.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the intent is to help, not to label, children.
``We'll make that clear,'' he said, adding that all children may go
through phases of strange behavior that never lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Another tool for preventing violence is smaller classes, Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley recalled his surprise earlier this year when, at a meeting
with security officers from large urban schools, the officers told
him that smaller classes would do more than metal detectors or
anything else to quell violence.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense, he said, because ``giving the teacher a chance
to have a personal interaction'' with students is crucial to
identifying who might explode into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress to spend $12 billion over the next
seven years to reduce class sizes around the nation. But the
pending proposal, unveiled in the president's State of the Union
address in February, is aimed at the 1st through 3rd grades because
of studies showing class size matters most in early learning.
</P>
<P>
   None of the school killings in recent years, such as in Moses
Lake, Wash., Edinboro, Pa., Jonesboro, Ark., West Paducah, Ky., and
Pearl, Miss., involved children in those early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, some federal money could be used to
reduce class sizes in upper grades, but only in states that have
money left over after achieving an average of 18 students in the
earliest grades.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state would get $180 million to train and hire an
additional 1,361 teachers, plus $236 million to build more schools.
Seattle alone would receive $32 million of that federal
construction money, said U.S. Education Department spokeswoman
Erica Lepping.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's acting schools superintendent, Joseph Olchefske,
agreed that smaller classes could help diffuse violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new ``early warning'' guide will enhance Seattle's
efforts, already underway, to identify and help potentially violent
students. Those efforts include ``increasing the sophistication of
our security people,'' maintaining a ``zero tolerance'' policy for
weapons and violence, and improving adult relations with middle and
high school students, Olchefske said.
</P>
<P>
   What's still needed, said Seattle School Board president Barbara
Schaad-Lamphere, is a greater effort to keep guns out of the hands
of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws are already in place. It's an enforcement issue,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Olchefske said they are considering sending letters to
all middle and high school parents, asking them to lock up their
guns and to check periodically to make sure they remain locked.
</P>
<P>
   While in town Wednesday, Riley announced $8.5 million in federal
magnet grants for Seattle and Tacoma schools over the next three
years. Seattle will receive $1.2 million a year for a new
international school scheduled to open next year, an international
program at Sealth High School in West Seattle and a performing arts
program at Rainier Beach High School.
</P>
<P>
   Riley encouraged more business support for schools in a
breakfast speech to local business, community and education leaders
including Mayor Paul Schell and Police Chief Norm Stamper.
</P>
<P>
   He and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray also toured a Tacoma middle school
and spoke with parents, students and staff there.

NFC WEST CAPSULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
NFC WEST 
 
SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 
1997: 13-3, 8-0 in NFC West 
Coach (record): Steve Mariucci (13-3) 
Stadium: 3Com Park at Candlestick Point (70,270) 
Ticket information: (415) 656-4900 
Pieces in place 
QB Steve Young (104.7 passer rating), RB Garrison Hearst (1,019
rushing yards), WR Jerry Rice, WR Terrell Owens (936 receiving
yards), WR J.J. Stokes (733 receiving yards), DT Bryant Young (4
sacks), LB Ken Norton, FS Merton Hanks, SS Tim McDonald. 
Key newcomers 
DT Brentson Buckner, CB Antonio Langham, LB Winfred Tubbs, DE Gabe
Wilkins, CB R.W. McQuarters, C Jeremy Newberry. 
Key losses 
DT Dana Stubblefield, CB Rod Woodson, FB William Floyd, K Gary
Anderson, LB Kevin Greene, TE Brent Jones, C Jesse Sapolu, DE
Marvin Washington. 
Missing piece 
At most positions, particularly linebacker, cornerback and
defensive end, the 49ers did a super job by replacing older
veterans with younger stars via free agency. Problems exist,
however, on the offensive line, especially at both tackle
positions. The club's best tackle, Kirk Scrafford, came out of
retirement, but he is not at full speed because of a neck injury.
Derrick Deese has been penciled in at right tackle, the side that
protects Steve Young's blind side. Deese started 13 games at left
tackle last season and allowed 4.5 sacks. That's not a bad number.
But more pressure will be on him in 1998, because one blind-side
hit on Young, 37, could lead to a career-ending concussion. The
left tackle is Jamie Brown, who started two games for Denver last
season. The middle of the 49ers' line is fine, but depth is a
concern after Newberry tore an anterior cruciate ligament during
minicamp. He is not expected back until November. 
Biggest test 
The 49ers have the 27th easiest schedule in the league. Part of the
reason is because the four other clubs in the NFC West combined to
go 14 games under .500 last year. No one will know how good this
club is until Nov. 1, when the 49ers play Green Bay at Lambeau
Field. 
Watch out for 
How Rice cooks. Jerry Rice, the soon-to-be Hall of Famer, has been
working maniacally to get back to 100 percent after two serious
knee injuries. After missing 14 games last season, he is expected
to begin the season in his customary starting role. But how
effective will he be? And with the development of Terrell Owens and
J.J. Stokes, will he be angry if Young does not get him the ball 90
to 100 times in 1998? 
Milestones 
Young needs four rushing touchdowns to break Jack Kemp's NFL record
of 40 career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. 
Overview 
Considering they lost their last games played against Tampa Bay and
Green Bay, the 49ers are the third-best team in the conference. But
because the rest of the conference is mediocre and the Buccaneers
and Packers play in the same division, the 49ers should be a lock
to reach the NFC Championship Game for the fifth time this decade.
They'll need a surprising performance from Hearst and an
injury-free season from Young. And that might not be enough to beat
the Packers or Buccaneers for a berth in the Super Bowl. 
Prediction: 13-3

1997: 7-9, 4-4 in NFC West

Missing piece 
The Panthers have a new offensive coordinator, former Green Bay
wide receivers coach Gil Haskell, who plans to implement a form of
the original Bill Walsh-type offense. But the quarterback in
Carolina is Kerry Collins, not Brett Favre or Joe Montana. After
being selected to the Pro Bowl in 1996, Collins had a league-low
55.7 passer rating and a league-high 21 interceptions in 1997. An
off-field racial incident and a broken jaw led to the subpar
results. Collins also didn't see eye-to-eye with Joe Pendry, the
unimaginative offensive coordinator whom Haskell replaced. The
bottom line is this: Collins must regain the form that led the
Panthers to the 1996 NFC Championship Game. 
Biggest test 
The Panthers open the season against division rivals Atlanta and
New Orleans. They get a bye before playing host to Green Bay on
Sept. 27. If they can get off to a quick start, maybe they go into
the Packers game with enough confidence at least to stay close or
perhaps to pull off the upset. 
Watch out for 
Capers was given more responsibility for personnel when GM Bill
Polian accepted a job to become president of the Indianapolis Colts
two days after the 1997 season. After the disappointing season,
Capers signed five free agents who will probably start on the
Panthers' defense, including Greene, Gilbert and Evans. The
Panthers are weak at both safety positions, but the rest of the
defense, which ranked 15th last season, is good enough to win games
by itself. 
Milestones 
Michael Bates was the first player to lead the league in
kickoff-return average in consecutive seasons since 1962-1963. No
player has led the league in that category in three consecutive
seasons. 
Overview 
Everything must fall right for the Panthers to have a shot at the
playoffs. And even then, with nondivision games against the likes
of Green Bay, Dallas, Tampa Bay, Miami and Washington, improvement
might not guarantee a much better record than last season.

ATLANTA FALCONS 
1997: 7-9, 4-4 in NFC Central 
Coach (record): Dan Reeves (7-9 with Falcons, 148-115-1 overall) 
Stadium: Georgia Dome (71,228) 
Ticket information: (404) 223-8444 
Pieces in place 
QB Chris Chandler (20 passing TDs), Jamal Anderson (1,002 rushing
yards), WR Terance Mathis (802 receiving yards), OT Bob Whitfield,
DE Chuck Smith (12 sacks), DT Travis Hall (10.5 sacks), CB Ray
Buchanan (5 interceptions), MLB Jessie Tuggle (92 tackles). 
Key newcomers 
OT Corey Louchiey, WR Tony Martin, FS Eugene Robinson, LB Keith
Brooking, G/C Bob Hallen. 
Key losses 
DT Dan Owens, WR Bert Emanuel. 
Missing piece 
Protection for Chandler. In the first half of 1997, Chandler missed
two games and parts of four others with two concussions, an ankle
sprain and a bruised sternum. The Falcons went 1-7. He stayed
healthy and started in each of the final eight games as the club
was 6-2 down the stretch, and Chandler wound up in the Pro Bowl.
But the club did not do enough in the off-season to ensure the
consistency of the offensive line. They did sign Louchiey from
Buffalo, but he has been nothing to write home about, starting 13
of 45 games for a Bills club that had its own line problems. The
hope is that second-round pick Hallen of Kent State plays his way
into a starting position at guard. Veteran free agents such as Matt
Elliott and Dave Widell offer depth. But, despite the presence of
Whitfield at left tackle, the Falcons have a ways to go up front. 
Biggest test 
It is imperative that the Falcons get off to a fast start. They
started 0-5 in 1997 and 0-8 in 1996. The first five games of 1998
are at Carolina, vs. Philadelphia, at San Francisco, vs. Carolina
and at the New York Giants. 
Watch out for 
The Falcons' pass defense. The front four combined for 31 of the
club's 55 sacks in 1997. Three of the starters are back, including
Smith, who had 12 sacks. Despite the pressure up front, the Falcons
yielded 24 passing touchdowns. Only seven clubs were worse. To
strengthen the pass defense, Reeves signed Robinson, who brings
Super Bowl savvy to the secondary. Robinson will steady a unit that
includes DBs Buchanan and Ronnie Bradford. Both improved steadily
last season and combined for 29 passes defensed and nine
interceptions. 
Milestones 
With at least 72 points this season, place-kicker Morten Andersen
will move into the top two or three all-time scorers in the NFL. He
has 1,641 points, fifth on the all-time list. Minnesota's Gary
Anderson is fourth with 1,681 points. George Blanda is the all-time
leader with 2,002, Nick Lowery is second with 1,711, and Jan
Stenerud is third with 1,699. 
Overview 
Despite their strong close in 1997, the Falcons are a season or two
away from being considered legitimate title contenders. Chandler is
one of the best in the business if he is healthy. But he needs one
more playmaker on offense, and two or three on defense before he
can lead this club out of the abyss of four consecutive seasons
without a playoff berth. 
Prediction: 7-9

NEW ORLEANS SAINTS 
997 record 
6-10, 1-7 in NFC West 
Coach (record): Mike Ditka (6-10 with Saints, 112-72 overall) 
Stadium: Louisiana Superdome (69,028) 
Ticket information: (504) 731-1700 
Pieces in place

Key newcomers

Ismail, LB Andre Royal, RB Lamar Smith, OT Kyle Turley, TE Cameron
Cleeland. 
Key losses 
CB Eric Allen, RB Mario Bates, DE Darren Mickell, LB Winfred Tubbs,
TE Irv Smith. 
Missing piece 
The Saints were last in total yards and total points scored last
season. They signed Dawkins from Indianapolis and Smith from
Seattle in free agency. Both will start, but no one should expect a
miraculous turnaround for the Saints' offense. Dawkins had six
touchdown receptions in his past three years with the Colts. Smith
had four starts in four seasons with the Seahawks. The Saints made
a few switches on the offense line and drafted San Diego State's
Turley, who has been handed the left-tackle spot. But this is
basically the same unit that allowed 50 sacks last season. Even if
the runners run, the blockers block and the receivers catch, the
quarterback is Billy Joe Hobert. He's better than the other
quarterbacks who started for the Saints last season: Heath Shuler
and Danny Wuerffel. Hobert has 16 touchdowns and 19 interceptions
in four seasons in the NFL. He is 2-7 as a starter after leading
the Saints to a 2-2 record at season's end. 
Biggest test 
The Saints have one of the easiest schedules (tie for 25th) in the
league. There is, however, a stretch of three games when they play
the New England, San Francisco and Tampa Bay from Oct. 4 to Oct.
25. 
Watch out for 
Mike Ditka. Players seem to like his fiery personality, though it
led to a rift with Allen, who was traded to Oakland. Because
quarterback is the main concern, it is up to Ditka to pick his
starter and stick with him through thick, thin and game-killing
interceptions. The Saints started four quarterbacks last season. 
Milestones 
Martin has started a club-record 112 consecutive games. 
Overview 
There are too many questions at quarterback and on the offensive
line for the Saints to be considered even an average football team.
Even the defense, ranked fourth last season, took a couple of hits
in the off-season. If the Saints match their six-victory 1997
season it will be a surprise. 
Prediction: 5-11

ST. LOUIS RAMS 
1997: 5-11, 3-5 in NFC West 
Coach (record): Dick Vermeil (5-11 with Rams, 59-58 overall) 
Stadium: Trans World Dome (66,000) 
Ticket information: (314) 982-7267 
Pieces in place 
WR Isaac Bruce (815 receiving yards), RB Amp Lee (61 receptions),
LT Orlando Pace, FB Craig Heyward, CB Ryan McNeil (9
interceptions), FS Keith Lyle (8 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
LB Eric Hill, DT Joe Phillips, DE Grant Wistrom, RB Robert
Holcombe. 
Key losses 
DT Bill Johnson, DE Leslie O'Neal, WR Torrance Small. 
Missing piece 
This is a make-or-break season for QB Tony Banks, who is in the
final year of a three-year contract. Despite his arm strength and
mobility, the former Michigan State star has not progressed as
hoped. His passer rating in two seasons is 71.5. He has only one
more touchdown pass (29) than interception (28). And he has fumbled
36 times. The Rams hope Banks can repeat the last half of the 1997
season, when he had a passer rating of 82 with nine touchdown
passes and six interceptions. He'll at least expect to have his
main weapon healthy in 1998. Bruce, who led the league with 1,338
yards receiving in 1997, missed five games with a hamstring injury
in 1997. Should third-year man Eddie Kennison can regain the form
in which he posted 924 yards and 11 touchdowns as a rookie, Banks
will be clean out of excuses if the Rams fail to improve on a
scoring offense that was tied for 23rd last season. 
Biggest test 
If the Rams have any chance of making the playoffs, they'll have to
endure a killer schedule in which they close with three of their
final four games on the road against Philadelphia, Carolina and San
Francisco. The home game sandwiched in between is, gulp, New
England. 
Watch out for 
The defensive secondary. The unit produces high-risk, high-reward
excitement. Paced McNeil, who led the league in interceptions, and
Lyle, the Rams tied for second with 25 interceptions. But the group
also played a big part in the 26 passing touchdowns allowed,
fourth-highest total in the league. The secondary basically
remained intact, although SS Toby Wright missed a great deal of
summer workouts because of knee surgery. What this unit needs is
more of a consistent pass rush from the front four. But it is hard
to see where they improved. Its best lineman, Bill Johnson, took a
free-agent contract with Philadelphia, and Vermeil released Leslie
O'Neal. So, the Rams will put their hopes on free-agent veterans
Ray Agnew and Phillips, and rookie Wistrom. Only time will tell
whether they can force quarterbacks to throw more errant throws in
1998. 
Milestones 
Bruce has three career 200-yard receiving games, one fewer than
Jerry Rice, and two fewer than the career leader in that category,
Lance Alworth. 
Overview 
The Rams have not had a winning season since reaching the NFC
Championship Game in 1989. That's eight consecutive seasons. There
are too many holes on this roster to avoid consecutive losing
season No. 9. 
Prediction: 4-12

<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ While residents of this water-logged border
town struggled Wednesday to clear the mud and debris from Monday's
flash flooding and President Clinton declared the area a federal
disaster area, the balloon of water that caused the trouble was
rolling down the Rio Grande through Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande, normally about 50 feet wide at Laredo, sluggish
and shallow enough to walk across, was a 100-yard wide
chocolate-colored surge early Wednesday evening, oozing across the
low-lying parklands, inching up the bridge pillars and carrying
past a surreal array of flotsam: telephone poles, huge tangles of
mesquite trees, lampposts, sagebrush, dead animals and a garbage
dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable flood,'' said Laredo Mayor Betty Flores
while watching the water from the roof of a riverside shopping
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Fire Capt. Louis Sosa said late Wednesday afternoon:
``The river is 26.5 feet above normal under the downtown Laredo
bridges right now. We're expecting 5 or 6 feet of rise over the
next 6 hours.'' That is several feet lower than earlier predictions
and would leave the river below the lowest of the three brides.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the international bridges in Laredo had been closed
in anticipation of the surge. The blocks nearest the river were
cordoned off by police, most downtown businesses were closed and
residents near the river were advised to evacuate. Although about
2,000 people live in the areas that Laredo officials wanted
evacuated, the officials said only about 600 residents left their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, dozens of people gathered along both banks of the Rio
Grande to watch the spectacle in a carnival-like atmosphere.
Federal officials kept spectators far from the river's banks, but
in Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side, onlookers were standing right
alongside the river, sometimes three or four deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are just flood-watchers,'' Ms. Flores said.
``The most difficult part is convincing people of the danger, not
only from water and debris but from wild animals running from it.
I've heard lots of reports of snakes seen heading for high
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the floods had crippled Del Rio's water system,
probably for days, Laredo had responded to a similar flood in 1954
by relocating its water system on high ground, so the water in the
city of 180,000 residents continued to flow. Nuevo Laredo's 600,000
residents, however, were without potable water this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush toured Del Rio on Wednesday morning,
first taking a helicopter ride over the San Felipe Estates
neighborhood in south Del Rio, where most of the destruction
occurred, and later meeting with some of the 850 flood victims who
had spent Tuesday night on cots and foam mattresses in the Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the residents had tried to return to their homes on
Tuesday, but were forced back into the shelter when another
rainstorm threatened further flooding. Some creeks in the area did
overflow their banks again, emergency officials said, but there
were no reports of fresh damage.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, many residents were making their way back home
again, although some returned to find an orange ``X'' on their
front door, declaring the structure uninhabitable and scheduled to
be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have confirmed 10 deaths from flooding in Del Rio and
directly across the border in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, and an
additional six deaths elsewhere. Scores of residents remain
unaccounted for, emergency officials said, though most of them are
thought to be safe somewhere in shelters or with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with the water receding in Del Rio, a city of more
than 30,000 people, searchers were pushing through the newly
uncovered debris to look for bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was witnessing a terrible offense of nature,''
Bush told reporters after his tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 17 inches of rain had fallen on Del Rio and surrounding
Val Verde County on Sunday and in the early hours of Monday,
choking all of the creeks and arroyos and eventually causing a
five-foot wall of water to rush down San Felipe Creek into Del
Rio's poorest neighborhood, damaging more than 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters moved downriver into Eagle Pass on Tuesday,
flooding some of that city's streets but causing no injuries. Just
beyond Laredo is Lake Falcon, which officials believe will swallow
up much of the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that caused the problems _ the remnants of Tropical
Storm Charley _ finally broke into pieces early Wednesday and
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nervousness of city officials in Laredo, the streets
along the river remained festive as the water slowly rose through
the afternoon. A man in an ultralight flew over the crowds, waving
happily.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Torres, 43, whose house is about 50 yards from the river,
leaned against the fence in her yard and watched the scene. ``I
don't expect anything special to happen,'' she said. ``Around here,
it never does.''

BIG TOBACCO PRODUCERS SHUN NEW ROUND OF TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a new round of tobacco-settlement discussions started in New
York City Wednesday, two of the nation's largest cigarette
producers have decided not to take part in them for now.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general, was
told Wednesday by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., which is owned by RJR
Nabisco Holdings Corp., and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a
subsidiary of BAT Industries, that they would not take part for now
in renewed discussions, said Fred Olson, a spokesman for Ms.
Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the only companies at the bargaining table will
be Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, and
Lorillard Tobacco Co., which is owned by Loews Corp. and is often
represented by Philip Morris lawyers in settlement discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's posture is the latest development in an effort
that began this summer to reach a new settlement between tobacco
producers and some 38 states suing the companies to recover the
costs of smoking-related health care.
</P>
<P>
   But that process, which followed the collapse in Congress this
spring of the $368.5 billion tobacco settlement proposal reached in
June 1997 between the industry and state attorneys general, has
moved ahead haltingly with little signs of unanimity on the part of
either the industry or the state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, declined
comment on the talks. A spokesman for RJR Nabisco also declined
comment, and officials of Brown &AMP; Williamson did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the companies were concerned about cigarette
marketing and restrictions proposed by state officials. But one
lawyer familiar with the talks described the company's stance as a
bargaining posture, and others held out the possibility that the
two companies might soon join the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision by R.J. Reynolds and Brown &AMP; Williamson may
be less a sign of industry dissension than a feeling on the part of
producers that time and momentum is on their side, and that a
toughened stance will result in a cheaper deal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, producers have scored several courtroom
victories, including a decision earlier this month by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., that the Food and Drug
Administration does not have the authority to regulate cigarettes
or smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, opponents of smoking appear to be scrambling
to find new momentum. For example, Richard Scruggs, a lawyer from
Pascagoula, Miss., who was an architect of last year's settlement
proposal, has been pressing federal officials to file a lawsuit to
recover smoking-related Medicare expenses from cigarette producers,
said lawyers familiar with those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs' strategy is not to proceed with the trial of such a
lawsuit, but to persuade cigarette producers to sign a consent
decree with the government under which they would agree to many of
the advertising, marketing and regulatory restrictions in last
year's plan, those lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement could be more sweeping than any achieved by
state officials. But one industry lawyer, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said that Scruggs had presented the plan to producers
and that cigarette makers had rejected it.

AFC EAST CAPSULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
AFC EAST 
NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS 
1997: 10-6, 7-1 in AFC East 
Coach (record): Pete Carroll (10-6 with Patriots, 16-16 overall) 
Stadium: Foxboro (60,292) 
Ticket information: (617) 931-2222 
Pieces in place 
QB Drew Bledsoe (3,706 passing yards), TE Ben Coates (8 receiving
TDs), WR Terry Glenn (431 receiving yards), LB Chris Slade (9
sacks), FS Willie Clay (6 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
FB Tony Carter, RB Robert Edwards, CB/S Tebucky Jones. 
Key losses 
RB Curtis Martin, FB Keith Byars, FB Sam Gash, CB Jimmy Hitchcock. 
Missing piece 
The Patriots lost three quality running backs, including Martin,
who rushed for 3,799 yards in three years with the Patriots. And
so, if there is anything to stop this club from winning its second
AFC crown in three years, it is at running back. The club drafted
Georgia's Edwards in April, but he had a run of nagging injuries in
college and his durability is a big question. Sedric Shaw, his
likely backup, is in his second season from Iowa and has not
touched the football in the regular season. The fullback is Carter,
who started 32 games in four seasons with Chicago. Carter is a nice
receiving threat with 106 career receptions. Carter, Edwards, and
Shaw, though, are a major step down from the Patriots' 1997 attack
of Byars, Gash and Martin. 
Biggest test 
The Patriots went 0-3 against Denver and Pittsburgh last season and
are 2-17 vs. both clubs since 1984. They open the season in Denver
on /{Monday Night Football/ and are at Pittsburgh on Dec. 6. 
Watch out for 
Whether he succeeds or flops, rookie Jones has a chance to make a
big impact. Jones, a former running back from Syracuse, played
safety in his only season on defense. But Carroll thinks Jones is
athletic enough to play cornerback in the Patriots' bump-and-run
scheme. If Jones can't handle cornerback, he'll learn the ropes at
safety behind Clay and Lawyer Milloy. Meanwhile, that would force
the club to play the injury-prone Steve Israel at cornerback
opposite Ty Law. Israel has one career interception in six NFL
seasons. And Carroll knows he needs a better playmaker at the
position to replace Hitchcock, who had four interceptions in two
seasons for the Patriots. 
Milestones 
Among active quarterbacks, Bledsoe's career average of 241.4
passing yards per game ranks third behind Warren Moon (243.4) and
Dan Marino (257.7) 
Overview 
The Patriots' running backs situation may cost them a game or two.
But this club has as much talent as any in the AFC. The key, then,
is Bledsoe. He has put up monster numbers in six NFL seasons. The
good news for the Patriots is that quarterbacks such as John Elway
and Jim Kelly have led weaker teams to the Super Bowl. The bad news
is that Bledsoe, at least as far as mental toughness, has not
proved to be Elway or Kelly.

NEW YORK JETS 
1997: 9-7, 2-6 in AFC East 
Coach (record): Bill Parcells (9-7 with Jets, 118-88-1 overall) 
Stadium: Giants Stadium (77,716) 
Ticket information: (516) 560-8200 
Pieces in place 
WR Keyshawn Johnson (963 receiving yards), CB Aaron Glenn (1997 Pro
Bowl), LB Marvin Jones, WR Wayne Chrebet (799 receiving yards), QB
Glenn Foley (86.5 passer rating). 
Key newcomers

Anthony Pleasant. 
Key losses 
LB Marvin Jones, TE John Burke, C Roger Duffy, DE Hugh Douglas, WR
Jeff Graham, RB Adrian Murrell, G William Roberts, OT David
Williams. 
Missing piece 
Despite the presence of high profile wide receiver Johnson, the
Jets are without a deep threat. Johnson has one 100-yard game in
his career, and he had no receptions of at least 40 yards last
season. Parcells is hoping this proves to be a breakout year for
the mouthy Johnson, who has not lived up to being the No. 1 pick in
the 1996 draft. Johnson's progress is key to the development of
Foley, who was all but given the job when the team decided not to
re-sign Neil O'Donnell. If Foley falters, however, Parcells will
have no problem going to veteran Vinny Testaverde. Either
quarterback will have slim pickings at wide receiver. There is a
dropoff after Johnson, with the overachieving Chrebet (10 career
TDs) expected to win Graham's old job. The backups are Alex Van
Dyke and Dedric Ward. 
Biggest test 
The Jets play their first /{Monday Night Football/ game in six
seasons when they travel to New England on Oct. 19. If things fall
right, the Jets could be 3-2 or 4-1 at that point. 
Watch out for 
Despite Glenn's presence, the Jets' pass defense has real problems.
The defensive front four combined for a paltry 13.5 sacks in 1997.
The cornerback opposite Glenn, Otis Smith, was burned for nine
touchdowns. Smith did collect six interceptions and returned three
for touchdowns. But the Jets must be more consistent with their
pass rush or the secondary could be in for an even longer 1998. The
club signed Pleasant from the Atlanta Falcons and is expecting him
to start. But the line is so weak that Parcells might employ a
three-man front to take advantage of the club's biggest strength,
linebacker. 
Milestones 
To mark the 30th anniversary of their Super Bowl IV upset victory
over the Baltimore Colts, the Jets will wear jerseys like the ones
Joe Namath and company wore during the 1968 season. The apparel
includes white helmets. 
Overview 
The Jets will get more consistency from the quarterback position,
and that alone will lead to one or two more victories. With that,
Parcells and company should be in the playoff hunt down to the last
week, and, if things fall right, they could make their first
playoff appearance since 1991.

MIAMI DOLPHINS 
1997: 9-7, 4-4 in AFC East 
Coach (record): Jimmy Johnson (17-15 with Dolphins, 61-51 overall) 
Stadium: Pro Player Stadium (75,192) 
Ticket information: (800) 255-3094 
Pieces in place 
QB Dan Marino (3,780 passing yards), RB Karim Abdul-Jabbar (16
TDs), WR O.J. McDuffie (943 receiving yards), MLB Zach Thomas (129
tackles), LB Derrick Rodgers (5 sacks), CB Terrell Buckley (4
interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
FS Brock Marion, G Kevin Donnalley, RB John Avery, DE Kenny Mixon,
LB Robert Jones. 
Key losses 
G Everett McIver, FB Roosevelt Potts, S George Teague. 
Missing piece 
With the Cowboys, he had Charles Haley. With the Dolphins, he has,
well, never mind. Johnson's club lacks a dominant pass rusher. In
the off-season he threw a lot of money at John Randle, Sean Gilbert
and Chester McGlockton, but each chose other clubs. So, Johnson
drafted Louisiana State's Kenny Mixon and penciled him in as the
starter at left defensive end. Fourth-round pick Lorenzo Bromell
has also shown flashes this summer and could earn a starting role
if Mixon falters. Nevertheless, one will join Jason Taylor, Daryl
Gardener and Tim Bowens. This fearsome threesome combined for 11.5
sacks in 1997. Unless one of these guys has a career year, the
Dolphins will have serious problems rushing the passer without
blitzing. 
Biggest test 
It is imperative that the Dolphins come out of training camp strong
because they play eight of their first nine games against AFC
opponents, including six division rivals. Any major slips could
push the Dolphins well out of playoff contention by mid-November. 
Watch out for 
How much does Marino have left? Will new offensive coordinator
Kippy Brown make much of a difference? There are a lot of questions
surrounding the Dolphins' offense. But this much is certain: They
will be a more physical unit in 1998. Johnson intends to reduce the
amount Marino uses audibles. The Miami offensive linemen won't have
such a mental burden right before the snap, which should allow them
to be more physical. And whoever starts the season at running back,
Abdul-Jabbar or No. 1 pick Avery, should have more holes to run
through. Early on, look for Johnson to go to a running back by
committee. 
Milestones 
Marino needs 15 passing touchdowns to reach 400. 
Overview 
The Dolphins have enough talent to be competitive in the
ever-improving AFC East and should sneak through for at least a
wild-card playoff berth. But Johnson is a few players away from
getting this team to the elite level.

BUFFALO BILLS 
1997: 6-10, 5-3 in AFC East 
Coach, record: Wade Phillips (first season with Bills, 16-16

Key losses 
LB Chris Spielman, CB Jeff Burris, T Corbin Lacina, LB Mark Maddox,

Missing piece 
The Bills gave up a No. 1 pick to Jacksonville to get Johnson. In
his only start, he was 20-of-24 for 294 yards and two touchdowns in
a 28-27 victory last season. Bills management is hoping that game
was a sign of things to come, not a fluke. Even if Johnson is as
good as his one shining moment, it will take a lot more to right
the wrongs of an offense that was 25th in total yards and 29th in
scoring, and led the AFC in turnovers by a wide margin. The main
problem is on the offensive line, which allowed 46 sacks and
numerous hurries and knockdown. To upgrade, Bills management signed
Panos, who'll play on the right side. The left guard is set with
Pro Bowler Ruben Brown. And the center is Dusty Zeigler, who has
lots of potential. But the club needs help at both tackle
positions. 
Biggest test 
The Bills have one of the weakest schedules in the league (tied for
27th). No one will know how good they really are until an Oct. 4
game against San Francisco and an Oct. 18 game against
Jacksonville. 
Watch out for 
Bruce Smith. The Bills' defensive end is 35. His performance has
really dropped off in the second half of the past two seasons. In
1996, he had two sacks in his last five games. He had one sack in
his last five games in 1997. The club is switching to the 4-3
defense, which should take advantage of the strong defensive line,
where players such as Smith, Phil Hansen, Sean Moran and Washington
will be counted on to make more plays. Smith is a future Hall of
Famer, Hansen had 122 tackles, 18 quarterback pressures and six
sacks last year, and Washington earned his first Pro Bowl berth
last season. 
Milestones 
Reed and Jerry Rice are the only players in NFL history with at
least 50 receptions in 11 consecutive seasons. 
Overview 
The Bills should be able to stay in the playoff race with their
weak schedule. But they will eventually be doomed by too many
problem areas on offense and too many aging stars on defense. 
Prediction: 7-9

INDIANAPOLIS COLTS 
1997: 3-13, 2-6 in AFC East 
Coach (record): Jim Mora (first season with Colts, 93-74 overall) 
Stadium: RCA Dome (60,599) 
Ticket information: (317) 297-7000 
Pieces in place 
RB Marshall Faulk (1,054 yards), FB Zack Crockett, WR Marvin
Harrison (866 receiving yards), DE Tony Bennett, DE Dan Footman
(10.5 sacks), LB Quentin Coryatt (2 interceptions), FS Jason Belser
(2 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
QB Peyton Manning, WR Jerome Pathon, CB Jeff Burris, LB Jeff
Herrod, G Tom Myslinski, WR Torrance Small. 
Key losses 
QB Jim Harbaugh, WR Sean Dawkins, WR Brian Stablein, G Doug
Widell. 
Missing piece 
Where have you gone, Lydell Mitchell? The Colts actually have a
great running back in five-year veteran Faulk, but the club has
strangely decided not to use him as much as they should. Well, to
keep the heat off of Manning, Faulk will need to carry the ball at
least 22 to 25 times a game. He has averaged 17.5 a game in his
career. The club will have to stay away from double-digit deficits,
where they are depending on the talented, but neophyte Manning. 
Biggest test 
We will get a good look at Manning's toughness in the first three
games of the season, when the Colts open at home against Miami,
before traveling to face New England and the New York Jets. Other
than that, Manning will get the benefit of facing 11 teams that
missed the playoffs in 1998. 
Watch out for 
The Colts' offensive line. If they fail, Manning's first year in
the NFL will be one he wants to forget. Tarik Glenn, the Colts'
first-round pick last year, is charged with playing left tackle to
protect Manning's blind side. Glenn played his rookie season at
right guard, so no one is 100 percent sure if he can block NFL
pass-rushing ends, even though he played left tackle in college.
The Colts made so many changes in the offensive line this spring
that C Jay Leeuwenburg will be the only player to play the same
position this season as he played last. 
Milestones 
K Cary Blanchard has scored more points (252) than any other player
in the league during the past two seasons. 
Overview 
Two seasons have passed since the Colts were one play away from
Super Bowl XXX. Despite last season's 3-13 record, they have enough
talent to be respectable at the very least. If Manning blooms
quickly, perhaps the Colts can make a serious run at the playoffs.
If not, look for another sub-.500 season. 
Prediction: 6-10

COMMENTARY: SHADOW OF A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `k' category) 
(JT) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Androstenedione is legal in the United States, and Mark McGwire,
a remarkably muscular man who hits home runs for a living, has a
right to use it. Whether it's a good idea to use it is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, has had a
glorious summer and is now closing in on the single-season home run
marks of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. Kids idolize him. Fans have
been filling ballparks from coast to coast to watch him swing his
mighty bat. When he comes to town, it's not enough to see the ball
game. You have to show up early enough to catch batting practice,
to watch his screaming line drives and long, towering flies.
</P>
<P>
   Even when McGwire is on the road he gets standing ovations.
After a McGwire home run on Sunday at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Stadium, the delirious Pittsburgh fans demanded a curtain call, an
extremely rare honor for a visiting player.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, somewhat embarrassed, obliged. He stepped from the
dugout and tipped his cap. The fans went wild. Later McGwire would
say, ``I wish every baseball player could feel what I'm feeling
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a controversial substance, currently
classified as a dietary supplement, that is taken in pill or
capsule form. It is converted by the body into testosterone.
Athletes take it because they believe this temporary testosterone
boost can help build muscle and increase their strength and
endurance. McGwire, who in past years has lost substantial playing
time to injuries, recently acknowledged that he uses
androstenedione. He said it increased the efficiency of his
weight-room workouts.
</P>
<P>
   This acknowledgment has cast a shadow over his dream season.
</P>
<P>
   While it can be purchased over the counter and its use has not
been prohibited by Major League Baseball, androstenedione has been
banned by the National Football League, the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and the International Olympic Committee. Randy
Barnes, the Olympic shotput champion, is facing a lifetime ban
because he tested positive for androstenedione in April.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives? Is Mark McGwire in better shape to hit home runs
because he's taking a pill that promotes the development of lean
muscle mass? A pill that can make a strong man even stronger?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows. The Cardinals and McGwire issued a joint statement
this week that said androstenedione ``has no proven anabolic
steroid effect nor significant side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Yesalis, a professor at Penn State University and
author of the book ``The Steroids Game,'' said, ``The whole idea is
to convince people that you're not really taking a drug, that this
is not cheating, and most certainly that you are not taking
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course, this is a steroid. What is debatable is
whether this is an anabolic steroid. Does it have anabolic
qualities _ tissue-building qualities?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, a professor of clinical medicine at the New
York University School of Medicine and the lead author of the
influential textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete,'' said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody particularly knows whether
androstenedione itself has anabolic qualities. But the substance
that androstenedione is converted into unequivocally has anabolic
properties. It's the father of all anabolic steroids. Testosterone.
So if, in fact, depending on the dose _ a critical issue _ if you
can raise the amount of testosterone in your blood by taking enough
of this stuff, then it's anabolic, provided you lift the weights
and do all the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is looking at
androstenedione, but Federal officials have not determined whether
it should be regulated and controlled as anabolic steroids are. Too
little is known about it, officials said, including its long-term
effects.
</P>
<P>
   So Mark McGwire is operating safely within the boundaries of the
law and the rules of his sport. But there are other considerations.
Each new home run gives the nation a thrill. As he draws closer to
Ruth's 60 and Maris' 61, each at-bat will likely be televised live
to the nation. A lot of young people will be looking on, admiring
their hero, trying to follow his example, trying their best to be
like Mark.

 &HT;    Gov. Bush tours Del Rio
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ One day after federal officials flew over a
flood-ravaged neighborhood here, Gov. George W. Bush visited
Wednesday and announced _ after receiving word from the White House
midway through his tour _ that Del Rio has been approved for
federal disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement means that hundreds of families whose homes and
businesses were badly damaged or destroyed in flooding spawned by
Tropical Storm Charley can begin applying for grants and loans to
rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived in Del Rio, a border city of 34,000 in southwest
Texas, around 8 a.m. He boarded one of the Blackhawk helicopters
used in the relief effort and surveyed the San Felipe neighborhood,
where some houses were washed away.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., the governor was wandering narrow aisles between
folding cots at a shelter where more than 900 residents spent
another night wondering where they will go from here and how they
will replace what they have lost. With each handshake, Bush heard
another heartbreaking story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real sorry for you. We're going to try to get you help as
quick as possible,'' Bush told one family, whose members smiled at
him politely. When he realized they didn't speak English, he
switched to Spanish: ``Estoy muy triste por su familia,'' meaning,
``I'm very sad for your family.''
</P>
<P>
   After exchanging a smile and a handshake with Bush, Reynaldo
Baesa, 76, said he lost everything inside his house and his 1973
Chevrolet. Just talking about it brought Baesa to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that (Bush) visited us and talked to us, because we
need help, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to help us very quickly,'' said Delma
Rodriguez, who has been at the improvised shelter at the city's
civic center since she and her family evacuated their home early
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Six people in Del Rio have been confirmed dead from the
flooding. As of Wednesday, 14 people were confirmed missing and the
whereabouts of more than 40 others could not be determined, said
Lt. Judy Altom, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Public
Safety. Altom said workers were going to specific houses trying to
locate people and had found 26 who previously had been unaccounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   The flood destroyed 300 homes and seriously damaged 100 others.
The state Health Department has shipped in 3,000 doses of tetanus
vaccine in anticipation of flood-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Robert Chavira said the city plans to restart its water
system by Friday afternoon, but he cautioned residents that the
water will not be potable right away because the lines were
contaminated during the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
toured the city on Tuesday, and halfway through Bush's visit
Wednesday, an aide handed him a cellular phone. On the other end,
President Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, gave him the
news this city has waited all week to hear: Val Verde County has
been declared a federal disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   Residents can qualify for FEMA's disaster housing grant to help
rebuild homes and the individual and family grant program which
will help pay for damage to belongings, damages to cars, medical
expenses and funeral expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration will offer loans to replace
and repair homes and businesses, said U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla,
R-San Antonio, who accompanied Bush on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The small business administration offers several disaster
low-interest loans to homeowners, renters and business-owners.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster declaration could be expanded to other counties,
and the scope of the aid could be widened after damage assessments
are completed, the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate how quickly (the federal government)
responded to the request,'' Bush said. ``A lot of people are
suffering. My heart breaks for the families who went from nice
secure homes to no homes at all.'' Bush said, adding that the state
may send in mobile homes to house flood victims until they can
rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the state could have done more for Del Rio
immediately after the flood, Bush said ``it seems to me that
everything that could possibly be done is being done. We are making
progress, and that's what people need to know -- there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, whose district includes Del
Rio, also pledged his help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build a stronger, more alert, more aware Del Rio, to
prevent this from ever happening again,'' Gallego said.
</P>
<P>
   About 550 people in the hardest-hit part of town, along San
Felipe Creek, were evacuated for a second time in 48 hours when
rain brought a renewed threat of high water late Tuesday and early
Wednesday. The creek rose at least 2 feet, but no flooding
occurred, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 20 percent chance for more rain today in Del Rio and
Eagle Pass, with temperatures in the mid 90s under partly cloudy
skies, said Jeff Orrack, with the National Weather Service in New
Braunfels. Orrack said no rain is expected in Laredo today and
temperatures should heat up to about 100 with partly cloudy skies.
The Rio Grande is rising expected to crest at 35 feet by midnight
Wednesday. Residential flooding will occur at about 38 feet, Orrack
said.

 &HT;    Coast dwellers make the most of anxious wait
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, N.C. -- As Hurricane Bonnie inched its way Wednesday
toward this riverside town named for the first president of the
United States, accountant Sharon Brickhouse paid homage to the man
who could not tell a lie: She was busy making a buck.
</P>
<P>
   With her office downtown just 200 yards north of the Pamlico
River, which has a history of spilling its banks during major
storms, Brickhouse worked till about 1 p.m. Wednesday despite a
lingering hurricane warning. She was a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather just wasn't bad enough not to work,'' said
Brickhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with a mottled sky _ gray, white and blue in
spots, giving rise to the notion that nothing bad was afoot.
</P>
<P>
   That had changed by late afternoon, when feeder bands _ squalls
that radiate from the hurricane's eye like a pinwheel spinning
counter-clockwise _ swept over the area and inundated several of
the city's low spots.
</P>
<P>
   The storm stalled Wednesday afternoon, heightening the chance
for local flooding. Beaufort County officials reported some downed
trees and power lines attributed to a tornado that didn't stay on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses heeded warnings. On U.S. 17 five minutes from
downtown, the fast-food row of McDonald's, Long John Silvers,
Wendy's and KFC stayed closed Wednesday. Burger King opened briefly
for breakfast while Popeye's served as a general canteen, its
deep-fryers cranked up from 9:30 a.m. till midday.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, which partially flooded two years ago during
hurricanes Fran and Bertha, was just as free of business. Shop
owners nearest the river piled sandbags at their doorsteps to keep
the Pamlico River out.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Dellinger wasn't one of them. She opened her pawn shop on
the north side of Main Street at 9 a.m., ``like normal.'' Instead
of sandbags at the entrance, a $3,000 black Peavey drum greeted
customers. In the back, 11 television sets were tuned to the
Weather Channel, where brilliant radar pictures fanned across the
screen like the plume of a peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger exuded nonchalance. ``I don't think it's going to be
as bad as they predicted,'' Dellinger said. She took comfort in
being on the high side, perhaps dryside, of Main. ``Usually, this
side of the street is better than the other,'' she said. ``People
on the other side need to be better prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   To break a day of boredom, 37-year-old Washington native Donny
Woolard window-shopped at Dellinger's.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted Bonnie with the shrug of a shoulder, the cockiness of
someone who's weathered hurricanes before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't a whole lot to it,'' he said. ``If it hits, it
hits. There's not a whole lot you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Leggett owns Nicki's restaurant across the street. He
lives in an apartment above the restaurant and spent the night
there. Wedged between two buildings and 1-foot thick brick walls,
Leggett pronounced himself safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Fran and Bertha, this building was like a rock,''
Leggett said. Nicki's stayed open during Bonnie's late night
wake-up call, serving emergency crews from the city. ``You just sit
here and wait,'' said waiter Roger Meylane.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilmington, which caught the early, first wave of Bonnie, the
scene was a little more frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wiggins and his Siberian husky, Sam, sat in his white
pickup truck Wednesday as the sea water lapped over the front
wheels and pieces of driftwood knocked against the door. Wiggins
wanted to take one last look at his boat, Hammerhead, before
retreating inland from Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen three go by so far, just out of control. Gone, just
floating,'' the Wrightsville Beach man said, wondering if his boat
would suffer the same fate. ``It's covered. It's insured. What
happens, happens.'' The few cars out on the road didn't bother to
stop for the red lights, not that many still worked. The winds blew
water in zigzag patterns down the slowly flooding roads.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the blocked drawbridge to fragile Wrightsville
Beach, Jay Lowe videotaped through the open window of his rented
red Chevy Cavalier, oblivious to the saltwater creeping up from the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is a State Farm Insurance agent from Irving, Texas, but he
wasn't there to drum up business _ he's an amateur hurricane
chaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home, I'm known as the hurricane man,'' said Lowe, who
flew into Newport News, Va., just before midnight Tuesday and drove
down to the find the storm's eye. ``I go to speak to the kids in
school about hurricanes, and they're always wanting video.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe has chased eight hurricanes, and he always tries to call
his wife when he's in the eye. He's been in Wilmington so many
times he's even staked out a favorite phone booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like deja vu,'' he said as the car rocked in the wind.
``I was just here two years ago with Bertha. Forty days later, I'm
down here with Fran in the same phone booth, calling her. And now,
here I am again. I just can't believe this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. Out of all the coastline we have in the United
States, I keep ending up in Wilmington.'' Mark Attar of Lucky Star
Chinese Restaurant in Wilmington, made 25 deliveries in the midst
of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy, huh?'' said Attar, as he ran a $25 sesame chicken order
up to the sixth floor of the Comfort Inn along I-40, where the
elevator wasn't working because there was no power. ``It's kind of
fun and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He received an $8 tip for the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   As he tried to leave the building, hungry guests besieged him
with orders as he shouted, ``No, no more deliveries today. It's too
dangerous.''

U.S. WEAPONS INSPECTOR IN IRAQ RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Expands earlier story.)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The senior U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq resigned Wednesday,
charging that the U.N. secretary-general, the Security Council and
the Clinton administration had stymied the inspectors on ``the
doorstep'' of uncovering Iraq's hidden weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector, William Ritter, said in his resignation letter
that the failure to push aggressively ahead with the inspections
was ``a surrender to Iraqi leadership'' that made a ``farce'' of
the commission's efforts to prove that Iraq was concealing
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter asserted that the lack of will stemmed from a policy
shift by the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general that
was backed ``at least implicitly by the United States.'' He made
his resignation letter public in an effort to force the United
States and the United Nations to return to a tougher stance.
</P>
<P>
   The administration heatedly denied Ritter's conclusions, saying
it had faithfully backed the inspections in Iraq. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan declined to comment, as did Richard Butler, chairman of
the inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ritter asserted that the administration had
been secretly trying since late last year to find a diplomatic
solution for its confrontation with Saddam Hussein and in doing so
had abandoned a policy _ in effect since the end of the Persian
Gulf war in 1991 _ to use sanctions and the threat of military
force to compel the Iraqi leader's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has publicly backed the inspectors, who have
insisted on full and unfettered access to sites in Iraqi suspected
of being used to conceal weapons or the expertise needed to make
them. Twice in the last year the United States has threatened
military action against Iraq for obstructing the inspections, and
in February, U.S. warships were moved within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, U.S. officials acknowledged that the United
States and Britain had privately urged Butler to stop trying to
hold surprise inspections of sites in Baghdad. The officials said
they wanted to avoid an open confrontation with Iraq after Hussein
said he would no longer cooperate with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms
control at all,'' Ritter wrote Wednesday. ``What is being
propagated by the Security Council today is such an illusion, one
which in all good faith I cannot, and will not, be a party to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, joined the
commission in September 1991, soon after its creation, and was
assigned to help the inspectors ferret out whether Iraq was hiding
information and material relating to its programs to build weapons
of mass destruction, and if so, how.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis moved to block many of the inspections led by him and
accused Ritter of being a U.S. intelligence officer, a charge
Washington emphatically denied.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that the ``beginning of a slow death'' for the
inspection team began in earnest last October after Iraq blocked
inspectors and provoked a crisis that led Clinton administration
officials to predict that military action would be necessary if
Iraq did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said administration officials told the inspectors then
for the first time that ``there was not enough military power in
the region'' to provoke a confrontation with Iraq, even though the
inspectors had ``indisputable proof'' that the effort to hide
information relating to Iraq's weapons programs was ``run by the
presidency of Iraq and protected by the presidential security
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration repeated its assessment in late November, he
said, warning the inspectors again not to conduct more inspections
aimed at revealing how Iraq was concealing the information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, Ritter said, administration officials told the
inspectors that military action over the Christmas holidays was
``domestically unsustainable,'' meaning it would be politically
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to discuss which administration officials gave
him and the other inspectors this guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defuse the crisis in February, Annan and Saddam
Hussein signed an agreement that allowed new rules governing the
inspections. Ritter said that while he and other inspection
officials were deeply worried about the agreement's impact, he
decided not to resign, but rather to test Iraq's willingness to
comply with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He was encouraged, he added, by the fact that the Security
Council warned Iraq of ``severest consequences'' if it blocked the
inspectors _ language that suggested the United States might carry
out military strikes on Iraq if Baghdad reneged on its word.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, in fact, returned to lead a controversial inspection in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, Ritter said, the Clinton administration decided
that it would no longer support intrusive inspections solely for
the purpose of gaining access to sensitive sites, inspections that
Ritter characterized as critical to the inspectors' mission.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with his U.S. counterparts at the State Department
and the Pentagon, he said, he sensed a lack of support for what he
called ``concealment inspections,'' and felt that such inspections
were becoming in the administration's view a ``political
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   In July the inspectors received what Ritter called ``two of the
best pieces of intelligence information we've had in a long time''
about Iraqi weapons activities. Ritter declined to disclose the
nature of the information. But he said he advised Butler, the
chairman of the inspection team, that the time had come to act, and
that Butler agreed.
</P>
<P>
   While Ritter refused to discuss the nature or target of the
inspections that he claimed the administration helped stop, he said
they were aimed at one of Saddam Hussein's principal secretaries,
Abed Hamid Mahmud, who he said is responsible for orchestrating
Iraq's effort to conceal information and material, and at the
Special Security Organization, which carries out Mahmud's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Foley, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday:
``Scott Ritter has done an admirable job under difficult, even
dangerous, circumstances. He has our respect for the substantial
contributions he has made to UNSCOM. We regret, therefore, that
Ritter decided to leave UNSCOM. He has been a key member of the
UNSCOM staff, particularly in his efforts to investigate the means
by which Iraq continues to conceal its prohibited weapons program.
We agree with Ritter that inspections should be continued, for this
work continues to be necessary to verify Iraqi disarmament.''

 &HT;    MLK slaying: Attorney general initiates probe of new allegations
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno opened a limited investigation
Wednesday into the killing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 30
years ago in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department probe will look at two recent allegations
that indicate that James Earl Ray may have been involved in a
conspiracy or may not have been the triggerman.
</P>
<P>
   In March, former FBI agent Donald Wilson revealed two pieces of
paper with the name ``Raul'' written on them. Wilson said he
retrieved the papers from Ray's abandoned car in an Atlanta housing
project a week after the April 4, 1968, assassination. Ray, who
pleaded guilty in 1969 but recanted within days, maintained he had
been set up by a shadowy smuggler he only knew as ``Raoul.'' Ray
was serving a 99-year sentence when he died in April.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the probe will focus on allegations made in
1993 by former Memphis cafe owner Loyd Jowers that a now-dead
Memphis produce dealer with mob ties to New Orleans paid him
$100,000 to hire an assassin to kill King.
</P>
<P>
   On the 30th anniversary of King's death in April, Coretta Scott
King and her four children asked President Clinton for a full
investigation that would include a truth and reconciliation
commission with power to offer immunity from prosecution in
exchange for testimony. Clinton referred the matter to Reno, who
had been in discussions with the Kings for a couple of months over
the scope of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Saying this is ``a first step toward revealing the truth,'' the
King family accepted the attorney general's decision when she
informed them of it in a brief telephone call Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would have hoped that the truth and
reconciliation commission would have been granted,'' Mrs. King said
Wednesday evening. ``We feel, though, that this is an important
first step and will remain cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno decided not to use the FBI or its laboratory in the probe
because the King family and others have questioned the agency's
impartiality. Under the instigation of the late Director J. Edgar
Hoover, the FBI engaged in a widespread pattern of surveillance and
harassment of King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be very suspect if they were involved,''
Dexter Scott King said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a further move that would seem to signify Reno's desire to
avoid any appearance of improperiety, she assigned the case to be
investigated by the department's civil rights division instead of
the criminal unit.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will be headed by Barry Kowalski, who prosecuted the
federal case against the Los Angeles police officers who beat
motorist Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jowers nor Wilson knew Wednesday how much they will
cooperate in the investigation. Jowers has offered to testify if
granted immunity, but Memphis prosecutors have refused. It was not
known whether federal officials will make any such offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if he's going to voluntarily tell them anything
unless he obtains some type of immunity or promise not to
prosecute,'' said Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation conducted by Memphis prosecutors this year
determined that Jowers was not involved in the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his suburban Chicago home, Wilson said he had not
been contacted by Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait to get official word from them about what they're
going to do before I decide what my response will be,'' said
Wilson, a 10-year FBI veteran whose first assignment was in Atlanta
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the FBI dismissively referred to Wilson's evidence as
a ``fabrication'' and insisted he was not involved in the search of
Ray's 1965 white Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they want to be nice,'' said Wilson, who added that the
only way to find the truth is to empanel the commission the Kings
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of that,'' he said, ``is a waste of taxpayers'
time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno insists, though, that she will conduct a thorough and
unbiased probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence gathered during the inquiry will be followed
wherever it may lead,'' Reno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will consider whether any further action
might be needed and will issue a report when the investigation is
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at whatever information comes our way, but our
focus is on these two aspects,'' said Justice Department spokesman
Myron Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who question Reno's commitment. Circuit Judge
Arthur J. Hanes Jr. of Birmingham is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hanes and his late father, Arthur J. Hanes Sr., were Ray's first
lawyers in 1969, before he fired them in favor of Percy Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Hanes said Wednesday he has evidence that he refused to
characterize but which he termed ``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the attorney general has any interest in what the truth is,
she can contact me,'' said Hanes, who maintains that Ray was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in the fact that the evidence at the time was
such that there was a conspiracy and that he did not fire the shot
that killed Dr. King,'' Hanes said. ``The attorney general is
probably grandstanding to divert the focus of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ray's brothers, Jerry Ray, also expressed little faith in
the probe Wednesday and called for the appointment of a special
prosecutor. The Justice Department considered that option but
decided to give the case to Kowalski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't amount to anything,'' Jerry Ray said. ``It might turn
out worse because they'll come back and say everybody's lying and
this is the third or fourth time we've investigated, so let's put
an end to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial FBI probe in 1968 fingered Ray as the sole culprit.
An investigation by the House Select Committee on Assassinations
determined in 1979 that Ray was the gunman, though it's possible he
was involved in a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, the U.S. attorney general at the time of King's
murder, supported Reno's decision, though he says he's still
convinced that Ray acted alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't close investigations,'' he said. ``You just keep
looking. You do whatever's reasonable under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The new probe also found support from one of Ray's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' said Memphis attorney Wayne Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also expressed optimism, particularly because they're
not limiting themselves to this investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one avenue,'' Dexter King said. ``We still haven't
pursued other avenues. We are also considering complementary
alternatives, which may include civil litigation and/or
congressional intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison, Jowers' attorney, said his client is willing to
cooperate, especially since he's in failing health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's agreed that if they want to sue him for the purpose of
history, he'd go along with it,'' Garrison said.

STARS PICK UP ENFORCER, SIGN SEVERYN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars filled their void for an enforcer
yesterday, signing unrestricted free agent Brent Severyn to a
one-year contract paying $425,000.
</P>
<P>
   Severyn, 32, brings size (6-foot-2, 211 pounds) and a notable
zeal for fighting _ something the team will be able to use as they
move into the Pacific Division, where every team has stocked up
with an enforcer over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fighting so much as a physical presence. And every
team in our division has that,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``These players know their role, and they have a sense of timing.
And Brent is a guy who I think can fit very well into our system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took their time looking for a tough guy throughout the
summer, general manager Bob Gainey said, because they wanted to do
research. Severyn is a former teammate of Stars forwards Mike Keane
and Brian Skrudland, and came highly recommended as a player who is
tough but is skilled enough to log eight to 10 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a terrific team person and a solid role player,''
Hitchcock said. ``Our philosophy is that if you're going to play
for us in October, we'd like you to be playing for us in May or
June. And we see that in Brent.''
</P>
<P>
   Severyn is not expected to contribute much in the scoring
department _ he has scored 37 points (nine goals, 28 assists) in
298 career games. But he has 775 career penalty minutes, including
133 in 37 games last season with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   He might be best known by Stars fans for his two fights with
Darryl Sydor in the Ducks' bench-clearing brawl with the Stars on
March 13 _ where he was standing up for Ducks superstar Teemu
Selanne, who had been knocked out by Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a heavyweight; I assure you of that,'' Sydor said. ``We
have a good, tough team, but he's a solid addition to our
toughness. He can throw them.''
</P>
<P>
   Severyn missed 32 games with a herniated disk in his neck Oct.
25-Jan. 1, but is recovered. He can play left wing, right wing or
defense, giving the Stars plenty of options on their fourth line. &QL; 
HULL CHOOSES NO. 22 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Stars winger Brett Hull has chosen No. 22 for his sweater.
Hull had worn No. 16 his entire life, but said when signed by the
Stars on July 3 that he would not try to take that number away from
fellow veteran Pat Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   No. 22, he said, has no special meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no one's birthday or not lucky or anything, it's just
what they had left over,'' Hull said.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Not long ago, Bill Clinton promised a New Covenant. Envisioned
as a spiritual contract of compassion and prosperity, the president
pledged to make America a better place for all.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, and in spite of scandal, Bill Clinton fulfilled
his promise. In the six years of his presidency, the economy has
expanded, wealth increased, the budget balanced, creative social
programs launched, and welfare reformed.
 &HT;    Unbelievably, he did much of what he promised and what some
considered impossible -- he combined the economic shrewdness of
conservatism with the social passion of liberalism. He kept this
covenant with the American people.
 &HT;    However implicit, we had another covenant as well. After
candidate Clinton admitted causing ``pain in his marriage,'' we
forgave him and expected him to behave himself in the future.
 &HT;    But he broke this promise.
 &HT;    If not for Monica, Bill Clinton would go down in history as an
innovative -- if not great -- president.
 &HT;    In the midst of events, it is difficult to know how history will
judge anyone. If current attitudes, however, are any guide, future
generations will look back with ambiguity on this unseemly episode.
 &HT;    Excluding those who have always hated him, most of us feel
ambivalent about Clinton. We approve of how he has handled his job;
we disapprove of his character.
 &HT;    Until recently, we ignored his personal life, dismissing rumors
with pseudo-sophistication. ``Personal morality doesn't matter,''
became the mantra, ``Look at Kennedy, Eisenhower, even Thomas
Jefferson. They had mistresses. They were good presidents.''
 &HT;    True enough. Does sexual fidelity matter?
 &HT;    Asking the question is rather new. Traditionally, Americans
expected leaders to be good, faithful family men (back then, men).
Equally, however, people expected affairs to be discreet. One lover
-- maybe two -- in the past or kept out of public view.
 &HT;    Until Ronald Reagan, no president had been divorced -- even that
vaguely immoral. Americans assumed fidelity essential to
leadership.
 &HT;    Those assumptions grew from Victorian values where biblical
literalism reigned and ``polite'' society silenced talk about sex.
During this century, however, sexual ethics changed radically.
Sometimes for the worse, sometimes better, but generally toward
greater openness and compassion.
 &HT;    We may worry over our children's choices, or rue our mistakes,
but few of us prefer our great-grandparents' world when it comes to
sex.
 &HT;    It is not surprising that the question of fidelity and
leadership should arise during the nation's first baby-boom
presidency. After all, baby- boomers came of age in this new
climate. We imbibed sexual situational ethics -- where sexual
morality is determined by context. No rules; only informed personal
choice.
 &HT;    Given this potential chaos, it is surprising there exists any
agreement regarding sexuality. But there are generally accepted
guidelines: Partners should respect one another. Relationships
should be honest and responsible. People should postpone sex until
maturity. A faithful marriage is the ideal for sexual fulfillment.
 &HT;    Whether straight or gay, single, divorced or married, most
people think standards basic to healthy sexuality. As a culture, we
believe sexual expression rests on adult choice -- not fear of the
rules.
 &HT;    In a more rigid culture, Clinton might not have broken the
rules. Too risky. Or, as with Kennedy, he would not have been
caught because no one dared ask.
 &HT;    In our permissive society, however, no social taboo compelled
him to keep his pants zipped. And everyone -- including Ken Starr
-- is rude enough to ask.
 &HT;    Moreover, Clinton violated the code of sexual situation ethics.
Not that he had an affair -- or even an affair with a much younger
woman. Rather, he made bad choices. He broke his marriage covenant
for no good reason (did he love or was only using Monica?) in the
Oval Office (of all places!) and then lied about it to his wife,
God and everybody else on television.
 &HT;    The affair was stupid; the context made it even worse.
 &HT;    In an age of situational ethics, fidelity matters. In every
case, a person must be trusted to make good decisions, to judge
situations wisely and make choices equal to a particular demand.
 &HT;    When constrained by rules, fidelity is less important. People
are faithful because they must be and an individual's character
matters less. With no external pressure, however, character --
fidelity and trustworthiness included -- becomes crucial to
leadership. Expanded moral choice makes it harder to govern well.
 &HT;    Although we often deny it, public and private covenants are of a
piece. Personal morality grounds public behavior.
 &HT;    If honest, we know how hard it is to live in fidelity. Knowing
our failings, we forgive.
 &HT;    Rest assured, Bill, like Hillary, we'll forgive again. We know
you can keep promises. Nevertheless, the question nags: which ones?

AFC CENTRAL 
PITTSBURGH STEELERS 
1997: 11-5, 6-2 in AFC Central 
Coach (record): Bill Cowher (64-32) 
Stadium: Three Rivers (58,600) 
Ticket information: (412) 321-0650 
Pieces in place 
QB Kordell Stewart (21 passing TDs, 11 rushing TDs), RB Jerome
Bettis (1,665 rushing yards), WR Charles Johnson (568 receiving
yards), FS Darren Perry (4 interceptions), SS Carnell Lake (6
sacks, 3 interceptions), LB Jason Gildon (4 1/2 sacks), LB Levon
Kirkland (5 sacks). 
Key newcomers 
C Roger Duffy, CB DeWayne Washington. 
Key losses 
OT John Jackson, G Tom Myslinski, WR Yancey Thigpen, CB Donnell
Woolford, LB Greg Lloyd. 
Missing piece 
The Steelers were hurt by free agency again in the off-season. But
the lumps were felt most in the club's receiving unit, where
Thigpen (79 receptions, 1,398 yards, seven TDs) signed a free-agent
contract with the Oilers. Too bad, because Stewart appears on the
verge of being a Pro Bowl quarterback. Now, he'll have to improve
on his first season as a starter with a group of untested veterans.
Replacing Thigpen will be Courtney Hawkins (45 receptions, 3 TDs)
and Will Blackwell, who caught 12 passes in an injury-plagued
rookie season. The veteran of the wide receivers is Stewart's best
friend, Charles Johnson. In 1996, when Thigpen was hurt, Johnson
had his best season with 60 receptions for 1,008 yards. The
Steelers would love it if Johnson can have that kind of performance
this season. 
Biggest test 
From late October until the end of the season, the Steelers, who
have the league's toughest schedule, will be in a war. Oct. 26 and
Nov. 9, they are on /{Monday Night Football/ against Kansas City
and Green Bay. They close with five of their final seven against
teams that reached the playoffs in 1997. 
Watch out for 
The thing that can separate the Steelers from a nice record of 11-5
and an outstanding record of 14-2 will be special teams. The club
did not block a punt, field goal or extra point last season, and
forced only two fumbles. In the final seven games, punter Josh
Miller had seven punts of 26 yards or less. Also, the punt-coverage
team allowed 11.8 yards per return, among the worst in the league.
If the Steelers don't shore up this unit, they could find
themselves on the wrong end of close games against mediocre teams. 
Milestones 
Lake was the first defensive back to lead his team in sacks since
it became an official statistic in 1982. 
Overview 
The Steelers return most of the key parts from their rushing
offense and defense, both of which ranked No. 1 in the NFL last
season. If Stewart continues to improve, the Steelers could make
their second Super Bowl appearance of the 1990s. 
Prediction: 12-4

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS 
1997: 11-5, 6-2 in AFC Central 
Coach (record): Tom Coughlin (24-24) 
Stadium: Alltel (73,000) 
Ticket information: (800) 618-8005 
Pieces in place 
QB Mark Brunell (18 passing TDs), WR Jimmy Smith (1,324 yards), WR
Keenan McCardell (1,164 yards), LT Tony Boselli, DE Tony Brackens

points). 
Key newcomers 
C Quentin Neujahr, LB Bryce Paup. 
Key losses 
S Dana Hall, FB Ty Hallock, RB Natrone Means, DE Clyde Simmons. 
Missing piece 
The Jaguars have a dominant passer, dominant wide receivers and a
huge offensive line. What they have never had is a dominant running
game. They'll need one if they are to make a serious Super Bowl
run. Means went back to San Diego, and Hallock is in Chicago. The
halfbacks competing for Means' job will be the Jaguars' No. 1 pick
this year, Fred Taylor, and their No. 1 pick in 1995, James
Stewart. A 1,000-yard season from one of these guys would give the
Jaguars one of the most dominating offenses around. But even that
figures to be a challenge as no Jaguars running back has rushed for
more than 823 yards in a season since the team began play in 1995. 
Biggest test 
Five of the Jaguars' last seven games are against teams that
reached the playoffs in 1997: Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Detroit,
Minnesota and Pittsburgh in the season finale on /{Monday Night
Football/. 
Watch out for 
The Jaguars signed Paup to pump life into a pass rush that was
already solid, netting 48 sacks last year, sixth-most in the
league. Paup had 9.5 sacks last year and has 65.5 in his career. He
should easily make up for the departure of Simmons, who was waived
in a salary-cap move last spring despite leading the Jaguars with
8.5 sacks. The Jaguars have questions at cornerback, with the likes
of Dave Thomas, Deon Figures and Aaron Beasley competing for a job.
All are coming off injuries in 1997. 
Milestones 
The Jaguars are the only expansion team to reach the playoffs in
two of its first three seasons. 
Overview 
The Jaguars have enough talent to reach the playoffs for a third
consecutive season. To get to the next level, this club needs to
get meaner. That means establishing the running game and stopping
the other guys from running the ball. They used the off-season to
shore up the running game on offense, but the defense against the
run remains suspect. They'll be able to hide this deficiency during
the regular season, but it'll catch up to them in the later rounds
of the AFC playoffs. 
Prediction: 10-6

TENNESSEE OILERS 
1997: 8-8, 2-6 in AFC Central 
Coach (record): Jeff Fisher (24-30) 
Stadium: Vanderbilt Stadium (41,600) 
Ticket information: (888) 313-8326 
Pieces in place 
QB Steve McNair (2,665 yards), RB Eddie George (1,399 yards), DE
Kenny Holmes (7 sacks), C Mark Stepnoski, CB Darryll Lewis (5
interceptions), FS Marcus Robertson (5 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
TE Jackie Harris, P Craig Hentrich, WR Yancey Thigpen, WR Kevin
Dyson, CB Samari Rolle. 
Key loss 
G Kevin Donnalley. 
Missing piece 
The Oilers were solid on defense last season, but they desperately
need playmakers, people who can sack the quarterback, force fumbles
and make interceptions. Only five clubs had fewer than the 35 sacks
Tennessee had in 1997, and the club's 14 interceptions were tied
for 19th. Because pressure on the quarterback usually causes
fumbles and interceptions, the Oilers are hoping for continued
improvement from Holmes, who led NFL rookies in 1997 with seven
sacks. DT Gary Walker also had seven sacks in 1997. But if CBs
Lewis and Denard Walker hold up, Fisher will probably blitz more,
utilizing the once-famous ``46'' defense to help the cause.  
Biggest test 
Four of the Oilers' first six games are against AFC Central
opponents. They end with eight clubs that were a combined 88-55 in
1997, including Pittsburgh, Jacksonville, Green Bay and Tampa Bay. 
Watch out for 
This is a make-or-break season for McNair. Already backed by a
George-led ground game that ranked No. 3 in 1997, McNair will have
an outstanding group of wide receivers to speed his development.
The club stole Thigpen (1,398 yards, 7 TDs) from Pittsburgh and
drafted Dyson in the first round. Some had Dyson the top-rated wide
receiver on the board, ahead of Randy Moss. With all this offensive
firepower, McNair must produce. In his first season as a starter,
McNair completed 52 percent of his passes with 14 touchdown passes,
13 interceptions and a quarterback rating of 70.4. He seemed to get
worse as the season went along, throwing four TD passes and six
interceptions in the final eight games. The Oilers are talented
enough offensively, and if McNair struggles and the playoffs are in
sight, don't be surprised if the club goes with 40-year-old Dave
Krieg late in the season. 
Milestones 
LG Bruce Matthews has played 165 consecutive games. 
Overview 
The Oilers have the talent to compete in most divisions. But the
AFC Central has two of the strongest teams in the AFC. Tennessee
will do well to reach the playoffs as a wild card, but it needs
McNair to play like the Oilers' brass think he is capable of
playing.

CINCINNATI BENGALS 
1997: 7-9, 3-5 in AFC Central 
Coach (record): Bruce Coslet, (14-11 with Bengals, 40-49 overall) 
Stadium: Cinergy Field (60,389) 
Ticket information: (513) 621-3550 
Pieces in place 
RB Corey Dillon (1,129 yards, 10 TDs), WR Darnay Scott (797 yards),
CB Ashley Ambrose (3 interceptions), CB Corey Sawyer (4
interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
DE Michael Bankston, QB Neil O'Donnell, CB Thomas Randolph, DE
Clyde Simmons, LB Takeo Spikes, LB Brian Simmons. 
Key losses 
DT Brentson Buckner, LB Andre Collins, QB Boomer Esiason, DT Dan
Wilkinson. 
Missing piece 
Jeff Blake went into training camp as the starter, and many in the
organization want to see him succeed the way he did from 1995-1996,
when he threw 52 touchdown passes. But he lost his starting job to
O'Donnell, whom the Bengals signed in the off-season. O'Donnell
locked up the starting position with a 15-18 performance in a 33-19
exhibition game victory against the Lions Saturday night. He needs
to provide that kind of leadership for the Bengals to contend. If
he fails, Blake could get another chance. 
Biggest test 
The Bengals have the third-toughest schedule in the league. Nine
games are against 1997 playoff teams. The club's home schedule
includes Super Bowl XXXII participants Denver and Green Bay. 
Watch out for 
Opponents walked all over the Bengals' 29th-ranked defense in 1997.
But things should change drastically in 1998. The club signed
run-stopping Bankston and pass-rushing Simmons. It drafted Simmons
and Spikes to upgrade the linebacking crew. These acquisitions
should greatly improve the front seven of the Bengals' 3-4 defense.
The fact that the club expects former New York Giants reserve
Randolph to start at cornerback shows how weak the Bengals are in
the secondary. But if the front seven can pressure the quarterback
in 1997, perhaps the secondary can play better. 
Milestones 
Lee Johnson, an 11-year veteran, has had punting averages of at
least 42 yards for eight consecutive seasons. 
Overview 
The Bengals have not had a winning season since 1990. An improved
offense and defense should make them respectable, and if O'Donnell
produces, and running back Corey Dillon plays like he did in 1997,
a winning season is not out of the question.

BALTIMORE RAVENS 
1997: 6-9-1, 3-5 in AFC Central 
Coach (record): Ted Marchibroda (10-21-1 with Ravens, 81-88-1
overall) 
Stadium: Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards (68,400) 
Ticket information: (410) 261-7283 
Pieces in place 
LT Jonathan Ogden, MLB Ray Lewis (4 sacks), OLB Peter Boulware
(11.5 sacks), WR Michael Jackson (918 receiving yards), DE Michael
McCrary (9 sacks). 
Key newcomers 
QB Jim Harbaugh, FB Roosevelt Potts, RB Errict Rhett, CB Rod
Woodson, CB Duane Starks, WR Pat Johnson. 
Key losses 
WR Derrick Alexander, RB Earnest Byner, CB Eugene Daniel, CB
Antonio Langham, RB Bam Morris. 
Missing piece 
The Ravens have the size on the offensive and defensive lines to
play with anyone. But their situation at wide receiver and
defensive back is questionable. At wide receiver, the club lost its
leading yardage man, Derrick Alexander, to Kansas City in free
agency. The other wide receiver, Michael Jackson, is coming off an
injury-plagued season. Baltimore drafted Oregon's Johnson in the
second round. But the club expects to go with Jackson and
second-year veteran Jermaine Lewis (648 yards, 6 TDs). In the
secondary, the club signed the aging Woodson; even with his age[
what is it?? ], Woodson is the club's best defensive back.
Baltimore drafted Miami's Starks in the first round, and he could
replace DeRon Jenkins if he does not improve. SS Stevon Moore had
off-season surgery on both knees. 
Biggest test 
Five of the Ravens' first eight games are against teams that went
to the playoffs in 1997: Jacksonville, the New York Giants,
Pittsburgh twice and Miami. 
Watch out for 
The Ravens are pinning their rebuilding hopes on outcasts Harbaugh
and Errict Rhett. In 1995, Harbaugh led the Indianapolis Colts
within one play of a Super Bowl berth, but quickly fell out of
favor. The feeling here is that he is at least better than the man
he replaced, Vinny Testaverde. But how much better? He doesn't have
the arm strength that Testaverde had, but he is more mobile and
coaches feel he is more of a take-charge guy in the fourth quarter.
Rhett had early success in Tampa Bay before a contract holdout and
rookie sensation Warrick Dunn cost him his job. Rhett is a two-time
1,000-yard rusher who reminds Marchibroda of great rushers he has
coached such as Lydell Mitchell and Thurman Thomas. 
Milestones 
The Ravens have not reached the playoffs since they were the
Cleveland Browns in 1994. 
Overview 
The Ravens play a fifth-place schedule, but it ranks as the
11th-toughest in the league. That's because they play in one of the
toughest divisions in the league. That alone will keep the Ravens
below .500, although they figure to show some improvement. 
Prediction: 5-11

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ A vast and plodding Hurricane Bonnie rumbled
ashore near the mouth of the Cape Fear River on Wednesday
afternoon, bringing whipping winds and horizontal squalls through a
region that is still recovering, both physically and emotionally,
from the trauma of back-to-back hurricanes in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Wednesday evening, there were no reports of deaths
or serious injuries in the region from the category 3 hurricane,
which carried maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour. But
state officials and weather forecasters worried that the worst
could still be ahead as the slow-moving storm continues its
northerly movement up the North Carolina coast Wednesday night and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern for residents of the Outer Banks, a narrow
and ecologically fragile chain of barrier islands, was that Bonnie
would move straight up Pamlico Sound nd create surging floodwaters
that could cut new inlets and submerge the islands' single highway.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that damage assessments of the Outer
Banks, and of much of the rest of the North Carolina coast, would
not be possible until well into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie finally made land after two days of anxious
anticipation, residents here seemed fatalistic about the weather
currents and rotten luck that have brought three hurricanes to
their quaint, well-mannered town in only two years. In 1996, a mild
hurricane named Bertha struck in July, only to be followed two
months later by a devastating category 3 storm named Fran. That
hurricane resulted in 24 deaths in North Carolina, and 34 total,
and caused an estimated $6 billion in property damage, including
hundreds of downed trees in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Fran's impact was symbolized by the destruction of the
197-foot-tall steeple at the First Baptist Church, a local landmark
that is still being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when we heard about this one was that it
couldn't happen again, that you just can't have three in a row,''
said C. Bruce Williams III, a spokesman for New Hanover County's
emergency management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just one of those things.'' Gary Green, a
37-year-old cook who was waiting out the storm at a shelter at MCS
Noble Middle School here, said he liked the area enough to put up
with the enduring threat of wicked weather. ``Where are you going
to run on this planet?'' he asked. ``If you go to the Midwest you
put up with tornadoes. You go to the west coast and you put up with
earthquakes. You choose your poison as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Miami said that Bonnie's speed
had decreased gradually throughout the day to 8 miles per hour from
nearly double that speed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie will be persisting over eastern North Carolina for at
least another day, creating a serious flood threat from rain,'' the
forecasters said in their 5 p.m. advisory. ``Rainfall totals of 6
to 12 inches are possible. Totals could be much larger, possibly in
excess of 15 or 20 inches if the forward speed of Bonnie decreases
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the deputy director of the hurricane center, said
that the eye of the storm moved lethargically from Cape Fear on
Wednesday afternoon to a point just off Wrightsville Beach at about
8 p.m. Mayfield said the hurricane was expected to move in a north
to northeast direction. But he said the storm's slow speed made it
difficult to predict whether it would hug the coastline or take a
more inland path.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the storm should move out to sea near the
border between North Carolina and Virginia. A hurricane warning
remained in effect Wednesday night from Cape Romain, S.C., to the
North Carolina-Virginia border, while a tropical storm warning was
in effect from Chincoteague, Va., to Cape Henlopen, Del.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million residents and tourists evacuated
coastal areas of North Carolina and South Carolina on Tuesday and
Wednesday morning, filling makeshift emergency shelters in schools
and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews were declared across the region and most bridges from
the mainland to barrier islands were blocked by police cars. An
estimated 97,500 households were without electricity along North
Carolina's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Supply, about 30 miles south of Wilmington, Bonnie's winds
destroyed a portion of the roof at Brunswick Hospital, forcing
officials to move 34 patients to another unit. Here in Wilmington,
a gust blew out a 40-foot section of windows at New Hanover High
School.
</P>
<P>
   On Bald Head Island, near the point of the hurricane's landfall,
47 people were stranded after missing the last ferry Tuesday night
and some took shelter in the island's lighthouse after breaking its
lock. ``It certainly would be better than even the more modern
houses,'' said Andy James, a spokesman for the state's emergency
management team. ``It's been there a long time and weathered a lot
of storms.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse squatters were not the only ones trapped by the
storm. On North Topsail Beach on Wednesday afternoon, two young men
stranded on the island ran through the blinding rain when they saw
a sheriff's car stopped on a road. Mitch Fowler, of Burlington, and
Dennis Poythress of Sneads Ferry, had spent the day trying to
repair Fowler's car.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting the car going, it became buried in the sand
and was eventually flooded by rising sea water, Poythress said. ''I
didn't care if it was the pope,'' said a soaking Poythress as he
crawled into the sheriff's car. ``I was ready to get off the
island. I'm about to starve. I want some dry clothes and a dry
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wilmington, the storm splintered a number of the oak
trees that give this city of 60,000 its elegant grace. Power lines
all across town drooped limply from poles and debris-littered
streets became obstacle courses for the few drivers braving the
roads. The almost universal outages forced the daily newspaper
here, the Morning Star, to send its eight-page Thursday edition to
Fayetteville to be printed.

<P>
   Although local officials warned that it was early to make broad
assessments, the damage to trees and property here seemed far
milder than that caused two years ago by Hurricane Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some air views of damage and some scouting around by
people,'' David Paynter, a spokesman here for the New Hanover
County Emergency Management Agency, said late Wednesday afternoon.
``It seems the hurricane has not created that much damage, but
we've got at least seven more hours before the main part of the
storm leaves this area.''
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of people along the coast fled the hurricane, at
least one family drove here deliberately to witness it. Doug Shales
and his 21-year-old daughter, Sarah, detoured to Wilmington while
returning from Tampa, Fla., to their home in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to experience a hurricane for a long time,''
Shales said. ``We just came on the spur of the moment. It's very
special for us to happen to land somewhere where you're going to be
in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shaleses spent the day watching the hurricane through the
picture windows in their room at a Holiday Inn. Shales noted that
his family spent time in 1993 in an historic blizzard atop Beech
Mountain. ``We just kind of really enjoy weather extremes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here remained exasperated that they had been
struck by another hurricane before finishing repairs from the last
one. Kathy Rackley, a 39-year-old housewife from Wilmington, said
she still has trees in her yard that were felled by Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of depressing,'' she said. ``You want to see
everything done before something else comes along and blows it all
down.'' Jack Goodhue, who fled a barrier island to take shelter in
a Wilmington motel, summed up the mood of many. ``What's happened
here?'' he asked. ``Have they pinned a target on Wilmington?''

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ For southeastern North Carolina's beach
towns, the story was scripted in plywood nailed to ocean-facing
windows at Carolina Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scram Fran,'' a leftover from the September 1996 hurricane
warned. ``Cheers Bertha,'' read another piece used during the July
1996 hurricane that swept by Pleasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent addition read: ``My Bonnie lies over the ocean _
Wish she would stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning Wednesday, that wish appeared to be a pipe dream.
In Carolina Beach, Hurricane Bonnie's progress was measured in the
size of objects it kicked about on vacant streets _ first shingles,
then street signs and finally plywood and trees.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true in Brunswick County, where officials said
beach towns, and Southport, had considerable damage.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming winds and late predictions of a direct hit led some
people to make a last-minute escape Wednesday morning from Pleasure
Island. But scores more decided to ride out their second Category 3
hurricane in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   As strong gusts tossed shingles and store signs about the
streets of Carolina Beach, Ron Leach wondered if he should stay on
a 42-foot fishing vessel moored in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes to the east or the north, I'm going to ride it
out,'' Leach said from The Hooker, a fiberglass boat equipped with
a generator. Other than that, I'll look pretty foolish staying
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched television as the boat tossed steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said he was going to pick a spot on the bulkhead and would
flee to his beachfront home two blocks away if the water rose above
that point. He had promised to keep an eye on the $180,000 vessel
for the owners, who didn't have time to move the boat because they
were boarding up their inn Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'm probably safer here than in my house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m., emergency crews prohibited anyone from driving on
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Gusts kicked sand onto Carolina Beach Avenue along the northern
end of the island, where Fran buried the streets in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nine cavalier Carolina Beach residents were staring into
Bonnie's fury at The Mariner, a 10-unit apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors, who gathered on a common porch connecting the
second floor apartments, stayed put for Fran as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Calvary said the small American flag crackling in the
wind on their porch was the group's good luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it after Fran, and it's been there ever since,'' she
said. The group drank beer and soda at 8 a.m. Wednesday as they
listened to rock music and Bonnie's whistling winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay here until it blows us into the house,'' Calvary
said. Joe Bishop, another member of the cheerful group, said Fran
sent the ocean tumbling over the dune line and into the apartment
below.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building should be fine,'' he said. ``It used to be an
army barracks.''
</P>
<P>
   To the north, Wrightsville Beach Fire Chief Everett Ward saw
3-to 4-foot swells in Banks Channel around 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some docks were floating high and likely would see damage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 50 Wrightsville Beach residents who had decided to
tough it out found themselves calling police for a ride out as
winds hit gale force Wednesday morning. Police obliged.
</P>
<P>
   The town had turned off power and water to the beach at
midnight. In Topsail Beach, Becky and Fritz Lenker were having
coffee Wednesday morning in the kitchen of their their-story home.
</P>
<P>
   With steady wind at 50 mph to 60 mph and gusts to 70 mph, Lenker
said shingles were flying, roads were flooding and 15-foot waves
were breaking, though they had not washed over the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   She said they had stayed during Fran and Bertha and previous
storms. This time, she said, her husband wouldn't leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound old-fashioned, but my husband won't leave, and I
don't want to leave without my husband.'' She said their house,
which lost its roof during Fran, has a strong frame. ``It's
strapped from A to Z and bolted down well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they had lost power and water, they were fully equipped
with hurricane supplies and had boarded up all but one window, in
the kitchen, which was giving them some light.
</P>
<P>
   Six other family members were staying with them, as well as nine
cats and two dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a touch apprehensive,'' she said.

SOROS FUND LOSSES IN RUSSIA PUT AT $2 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: EMERGING-MARKETPLACE, DERIVATIVES)  
(lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Russia's financial crisis has deepened, Wall Street traders
have played a guessing game: Which international investors have
taken the biggest hits since the ruble was devalued and Russia
announced its drastic debt restructuring? And when would they start
owning up?
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures began Wednesday as several big-name investors
stumbled out of the Russian chaos. Stanley Druckenmiller, the
manager of George Soros' Quantum Fund, said that Soros' $21.5
billion group of funds _ operated by Soros Fund Management _ had
lost $2 billion in Russian markets during the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, said that
even with the losses the Quantum Fund's assets of $10.6 billion
were up 19.13 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller is known for making big bets in currencies, bonds,
stocks and commodities around the world. The fund's investments in
Russia were a mix, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of it was equities,'' Druckenmiller
continued. ``There were some GKOs and some dollar bonds,'' he
added, referring to the country's short-term ruble-denominated
zero-coupon Treasury bills and its dollar-denominated bonds,
respectively. So far this year, Russian stocks are down 80.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Soros fund losses, which were first disclosed on the
CNBC cable channel, came less than two weeks after The Financial
Times of London published a letter from Soros in which he voiced
concern over the turmoil overtaking the Russian economy and
financial markets. ``The meltdown in Russian financial markets has
reached the terminal phase,'' began the letter, which appeared on
Aug. 13. ``Immediate action is required.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Soros argued that the International Monetary
Fund's solution to the Russian economic crisis _ imposing tight
monetary and fiscal policy on the nation _ was wrong. Instead, the
financier advocated the introduction of a currency board in Russia
after a modest devaluation of between 15 percent and 25 percent for
the ruble. A currency board is a system that fixes a nation's
currency to the value of its richest trading partner, thereby
taking away discretion over monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The day Soros' letter was published, Russian stocks plunged 15
percent before trading was halted for 35 minutes. The market
recovered a bit the following day but ended the week down 13.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts immediately began to wonder if Soros, one of the
world's most famous financial speculators, was ``talking his book''
_ or advocating a devaluation so as to benefit his concern's
investment portfolios. Had he still owned Russian stocks, for
example, he would have been hurt. Had he sold short Russian stocks
or the ruble, he would certainly have benefited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted the letter to serve as a wake-up call'' to the
leading industrial nations, said Pattison, the Soros Fund
Management spokesman. ``The Russian media looked at it in terms of
him calling for a devaluation. He didn't advocate the devaluation
unless it was carried out along with the currency board.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pattison, Soros went on Russian radio advocating
that the nation's leaders accelerate tax reform and set up a
streamlined bankruptcy process for the country's enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurt by the attempt to blame him for the events of Aug.
13,'' added Pattison, referring to the tidal wave of selling that
hit Russian markets that day.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, who considers himself something of a diplomat on
financial affairs, is perhaps best known for the $1 billion he said
he made selling British pounds in 1992. That trade made him known
as the man who broke the Bank of England. The investors in Soros'
hedge funds tend to be wealthy individuals with an appetite for
risk.
</P>
<P>
   What Soros is up to now is anybody's guess.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Druckenmiller declined to comment on whether he was going to
return to Russian markets anytime soon. He did say in his interview
with CNBC that Yeltsin's days are numbered. ``Yeltsin is clearly
out; it is just a formality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another money manager hurt by the Russian crisis is Leon
Cooperman, head of Omega Advisors and former partner at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., whose firm manages approximately $4 billion in assets.
Three Omega Advisors employees were leaving the firm for reasons
related to performance, the firm said in confirming a report by
Bloomberg News. The individuals were not identified. The firm is
said to have invested less than 1 percent of its portfolio in
Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Russia announced the terms of its debt
restructuring, replacing some $48 billion in debt with bonds of
longer maturities worth roughly 30 percent of their previous value.
It then became clear how much investors in the debt, a favored
hedge-fund play, had been hammered as well. Because hedge-fund
managers borrow money to make their investments, one bad call can
wipe out much of their capital.
</P>
<P>
   There were some very big sellers of long-term U.S. Treasury
securities on Wednesday, a sign to some traders that firms were
liquidating profitable positions to cover margin calls from
unprofitable ones.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Jonas, managing director at Fimat U.S.A. said: ``If hedge
funds have losses in Russia, there's only one thing they can do and
that's shrink their portfolio. They have to sell other things to
meet margin calls.''
</P>
<P>
   One money manager said that Wall Street had bought into the view
that ``Russia was too big to fail,'' adding that ``it's going to be
quite a long time before foreigners step back into this market.''

U.S. JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSILE STRIKE ON SUDANESE DRUG PLANT IS
QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  
 (Subs for new 7th graf on reaction from chemical industry experts
and identification of a U.S. company that makes EMPTA)   (See also: ATTACK-CAMPS, ATTACK-CAPETOWN) 
(sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chemical that the United States cited to
justify its bombing of a Sudanese factory last week could be used
for commercial products, the agency overseeing the treaty barring
chemical weapons said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has insisted that the chemical found outside
the plant could only mean that the plant was intended to make the
nerve agent VX. Sudan contends the plant made medicines and
veterinary products.
</P>
<P>
   The international treaty group, the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, conceded that it was not aware of
any commercial product on the market that contained the chemical,
nor of another chemical compound made with it.
</P>
<P>
   But its spokesman, Donato Kinigier-Passigli, said in a telephone
interview on Wednesday that a search of scientific papers showed
the chemical, known as EMPTA, could be used ``in limited quantities
for legitimate commercial purposes.'' The uses, he said, included
fungicides and anti-microbial agents, and not just the production
of VX.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon official said that the treaty organization had
simply uncovered academic examples of possible use with no real
evidence that any commercial products are made from EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you identify a chemical agent for commercial
uses, that does not mean anyone makes it,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the chemical industry, experts said they were not aware of
any commercial uses for EMPTA, nor could they foresee any practical
uses based on what is known about the chemical. Aldrich Chemical
Co. in Milwaukee makes the chemical and sells it at $45 a gram to
laboratories for research. But a spokesman said the company was not
aware of its use in any commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration leveled the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant in Khartoum with a volley of cruise missiles
last Thursday, saying it had evidence linking the factory to the
manufacturing of VX and to a shadowy network of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Facing questions about the decision to bomb the factory, senior
administration officials said on Monday that a soil sample
collected nearby provided irrefutable evidence of the presence of
VX at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Kinigier-Passigli emphasized that the organization had come to
no conclusions about the administration's charges or the Sudan's
counter-charges. The independent organization administers the
chemical weapons treaty, signed by more than 160 nations and
ratified by the U.S. Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organization's disclosure raised questions about the
administration's categorical assertions that there could be no
other possible explanation for the presence of EMPTA, or ethyl
methylphosphonothionate. Wednesday's disclosure added to a number
of inconsistencies in the administration's accusations, including
statements by a senior intelligence official hours after the
bombing that the plant in Khartoum was heavily guarded and produced
no commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined on Wednesday to discuss the
evidence or the caveats raised by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. However, Defense and intelligence
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they still
believed there could be no other explanation for the presence of
EMPTA in a soil sample secretly collected outside the facility
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, several American experts in chemical warfare and
analysis offered another possible explanation. They said the
chemical's structure resembled that of an agricultural insecticide,
known as FONOFOS, which is commercially available in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While the two are not identical, they have molecular
similarities and could be confused in a laboratory test performed
under less-than-ideal conditions, said Hank Ellison, a
counterterrorism expert who ran the Army's chemical and biological
warfare programs at Fort Campbell, Ky., in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, now the president of Cerberus &AMP; Associates, Inc., a
security consulting firm in Michigan, said that while the chemical
characteristics of FONOFOS and EMPTA were not identical, they were
``very similar'' and those similarities ``could be misinterpreted
in a lab analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine this soil sample wasn't taken under the best of
circumstances, by somebody placing it in a cooler and immediately
sending it to a lab,'' he said. ``And quality control for the
storage and manufacture of pesticides and insecticides is not the
highest in the world, so that could increase the possibility of
seeing similarities in the chemical structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense and intelligence officials dismissed the possibility
that the United States could have misinterpreted the soil sample.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hague, an official with the chemical weapons
organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said scientific
research also suggested that EMPTA could be the byproduct of the
breakdown of other pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The international treaty, which the United States Senate
ratified last year despite the reservations of many conservative
Republicans, who said the organization would never be effective,
does not identify EMPTA by name.
</P>
<P>
   But the treaty covers it under the ``Schedule 2'' list of
chemicals that are subject to scrutiny by the organization's
inspectors. By definition, chemicals included on Schedule 2 can
have legitimate commercial purposes. That is unlike chemicals on
Schedule 1, which are deemed to have no other use than to kill
people and are strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is the
international agency whose more than 400 enginers and diplomats
oversee the inspections of governments and chemical companies
around the world to assure they are not making prohibited agents.
The group searched known scientific literature in respone to press
inquiries on EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan has not signed the treaty, so factories like Shifa
Pharmaceuticals are not subject to its inspectors, unlike companies
in the United States and other nations that have approved the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   While the organization did not identify any products using
EMPTA, officials said they could not rule out the possibility as
strongly as the administration has.
</P>
<P>
   The official at the organization, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the scientific research showed companies including
the Mobil Corp. and International Chemical Industries of America
had conducted research into commercial applications that used
EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan has called for an international investigation of the
missile strike, which killed one person and wounded seven others,
according to the government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carnaffin, a British engineer who worked as a technical
manager during the factory's construction from 1992 to 1996, said
he never saw any evidence of EMPTA or other materials involved in
the production of VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I went into every corner of the plant,'' he said in
a telephone interview from his home in England. ``It was never a
plant of high security. You could walk around anywhere you liked,
and no one tried to stop you.''

Cowboys' concerns put limits on starters 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Kevin Lyons 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ He grimaced the way you would if the price
of your favorite stock plunged in a bear market. Uneasy about how
cornerback Deion Sanders awkwardly landed after defending a pass at
practice a few days ago, Cowboys team owner Jerry Jones nervously
asked why his highest-paid defensive player seemed to walk with a
limp.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was fine. But with the recent spate of serious preseason
injuries to the likes of New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn,
Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Bobby Taylor and Eagles defensive
end Mike Mamula, you can bet Jones will be feeling lightheaded
whenever any of his money men come up lame.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be cringing tonight when the Cowboys (0-4) end the
exhibition season against the Jacksonville Jaguars (1-2) at Alltel
Stadium? Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Darren Woodson
and possibly Sanders will play a quarter or so before making way
for a host of rookies and free agents who are fighting for roster
spots.
</P>
<P>
   For Jones, who once sat on the NFL competition committee,
preseason is one of the necessary evils of this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sat around for hours and hours trying to figure out what
to do about the preseason,'' Jones said. ``Do we cut it to two
games, to one game? With our sport, though, you need the work
before the season starts, and unfortunately, injuries are a part of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Aikman led the first-team offense to two
touchdowns and 258 total yards against the St. Louis Rams last
week. But he came out of that game with a nasty bruise on his nose,
courtesy of an errant Rams' hand through the face mask. He would
like his offensive teammates to continue their momentum against the
Jaguars' defense. But he and coach Chan Gailey knows the important
thing is that this team stay healthy for the season opener against
the Arizona Cardinals in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew we weren't going to get anybody hurt, we'd probably
play the entire game,'' Aikman said. ``Yet, we've got to be smart
about it. That is something that Chan has been cautious about and
addressed during the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the starters will take off about half the night, the
coaches will be hard at work. They have decisions to make, which
include choosing between Billy Davis and Ernie Mills as the No. 2
wide receiver and Omar Stoutmire, Kenny Wheaton and George Teague
as the starting free safety.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gailey and company will watch film to evaluate
who makes, and doesn't make, the final roster. The club must cut
down to 53 players by Sunday. So, this could be the last chance to
show off for the players on the bubble, including offensive lineman
Steve Scifres, fullback Nicky Sualua, defensive end Denny Fortney,
linebacker James Bates and safety Singor Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either guys are going to show up or they are going to be
gone,'' said Davis, who made the team in 1995 as an undrafted free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to play.'' Cowboys claim fullback The Cowboys
claimed fullback David McCann off waviers from the Pittsburgh
Steelers. McCann played for Murray State.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the 60-man roster, the Cowboys released
defensive end Harold Gragg. Autograph session Several Cowboys are
scheduled to be available for autographs at the Cowboys Kickoff '98
on Saturday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The players are scheduled to sign autographs from 5 p.m. to 9
p.m. Admission is free, but parking is $5 and $1 coupons must be
used to play the interactive games available. Coupons for autograph
sessions will range from $5 to $25. A portion of the proceeds will
benefit the National Marrow Program.

POSSIBLE STRIKE BY PILOTS SEEN AS A RARITY
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the pilots at Northwest Airlines go on strike this weekend,
it will be the first time a major airline has been shut down in the
age of so-called fortress hubs _ the big metropolitan airports that
are dominated by a single carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the major domestic carriers have largely
retreated from competition with one another, focusing instead on
routing passengers through a handful of hub airports that they all
but control.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines dominates Houston and Cleveland, while
Delta Air Lines dominates Atlanta and Cincinnati, and United
Airlines dominates Denver. But no major carrier has a tighter
stranglehold on its hub airports than Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Northwest controls 75 to 82
percent of all airplane seats, according to a study by Lehman
Brothers released this year. That dominance makes Northwest's role
so crucial to the regions it serves that the prospect of a strike
to many state and local officials is practically unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the more and more communities become dependent
exclusively on a single provider,'' said Alfred E. Kahn, the Carter
administration official who presided over the airline industry's
deregulation in 1978 and is a professor emeritus at Cornell
University, ``the more the public interest cannot become
indifferent to a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   This raises the question of whether the government would permit
a lengthy airline strike, or any strike at all.
</P>
<P>
   Both Northwest executives and the Air Line Pilots Association
say they hope no one has to find out. Indeed, the chances of a
strike seemed to fade slightly Wednesday as one person who was
briefed on the negotiations said the two sides had made significant
progress, with the key issue of pay remaining unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest announced Wednesday that it was canceling 400
flights Friday and Saturday in preparation for a strike if a
settlement is not reached by 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the deadline set
by the pilots. Northwest also said that it might be forced to lay
off some workers temporarily if a strike dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Layoffs are the last option we consider in any strike
situation,'' said Jon Austin, a Northwest spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Clinton stepped in minutes after 9,300
pilots at American Airlines walked out, invoking his authority
under the 1926 Railway Labor Act to force the pilots back to work
for 60 days while a presidential emergency board tried to broker a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the act, the president has the power to create an
emergency board if a labor dispute threatens ``to interrupt
interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of
the country of essential transportation service.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time a president had halted an airline strike
since 1966. Many people believe that it will be difficult for
Clinton not to intervene if Northwest stops flying because the
economic repercussions, particularly for the upper Midwest, would
be as bad or worse than those faced when American, a unit of the
AMR Corp., went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the White House is being coy about its plans in an
attempt to force both sides to settle. Administration officials
have even told Northwest executives, who they believed were a
little too confident that the president would ride to their rescue,
not to count on intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake for anybody to negotiate assuming that
the president will appoint a board,'' a White House official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But if the pilots do strike, Clinton may be forced to act.
Though Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest airline, is
much smaller than American Airlines, the No. 2 airline, it has a
tighter grip on its hubs. Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, where
American has bases, are among the handful of major airports where
there is still competition among major carriers, said Philip
Baggaley, the chief airline bond analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration estimated last year that the American
strike would strand about 43,000 passengers a day at a cost of $200
million to the economy, a figure that was subsequently challenged
by several economists. Northwest said that 67,200 passengers a day
would be affected if its pilots walked out and that a strike would
cost $737 million in its first 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' union dismisses those estimates, saying that other
airlines will move in to pick up Northwest's passengers. But
Northwest's virtual monopoly means that there are few alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines said Wednesday that it would fly larger
planes between Minneapolis and its hub in St. Louis beginning this
weekend to pick up the slack. But the extra capacity amounts to
just 85 seats a day, a fraction of what would be lost if Northwest
stopped flying.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air, a year-old carrier based at Detroit City Airport, said
its two 146-seat 737 jets were already flying more than 12 hours a
day, making it hard for it to add flights. And United Airlines, a
unit of the UAL Corp., said it was unlikely to add more flights
between Minneapolis and Detroit and its hub in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Braswell, the corporate travel manager for Chrysler
Corp., which has its headquarters outside Detroit, believes that
Northwest's dominance increases the likelihood of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were competition in the market, it would preclude
either side from being out for any length of time,'' he said.
``They may lose customers when they go out, but they know they will
end up winning them back again once they come back because there
are so few choices.''

NOMO FANS 10 IN METS' 4-1 WIN OVER GIANTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hideo Nomo has seemed to spend as much of this
season battling himself as he has opposing hitters. Coming into
Wednesday's game against San Francisco, he was tied for the
National League lead in both walks and wild pitches and was coming
off three poor performances in a row, all of them losses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday afternoon at 3Com Park, Nomo responded with one of
his best performances of the year, a complete game in which he gave
up just 3 hits and 1 run while walking 2 and striking out 10. For
one day, at least, he was the old Nomo and that led to a 4-1
victory that let the Mets (73-60) break a three-game losing streak
and hang on to their one-game wild-card lead over the Chicago Cubs;
the Giants dropped two games back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why my control is bad, so when it's good, I don't
know why, either,'' Nomo said through his interpreter. He insisted
that he had done nothing different Wednesday from any other outing
this season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try and analyze it, I'm just going to take it
for what it is,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``And it was
fabulous. I think if we give him some runs to work with, you will
see a guy who can be devastating. And Lenny took care of that with
one swing of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lenny in question was Lenny Harris, who, Valentine said,
figures to see more playing time now that Todd Hundley will no
longer play left field. Leading off the game, Harris, starting in
right field, homered off Orel Hershiser on his first swing.
</P>
<P>
   And when Brian McRae singled home Edgardo Alfonzo from second to
give Nomo a 2-0 advantage before he had even thrown a pitch, Nomo
had all the runs he would need, as he tossed four perfect innings
before keeping the Giants in check on three singles the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can pitch better than that, I'd like to see it,''
Valentine said. ``He had an explosive fastball, a devastating
splitter, he got his curveball over when he had to and he pitched
out of that one jam. He looked like the guy we need. Not only did
he keep a real hot team from scoring any runs, he kept our bullpen
out of the game. I couldn't have asked for more.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nomo (6-11), the performance had to be a confidence booster.
And it came in a park where the pitcher has had success. In 31
innings here, Nomo has allowed just four earned runs, for an earned
run average of 1.16. For his career, Nomo is 3-0 in the stadium
that used to be Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he just feels comfortable here, I don't know,'' the
Mets' pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, said. But, Apodaca added, Nomo
did seem to benefit from sessions in the bullpen on Sunday and
Monday, when he worked on not opening up too soon with his front
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those sessions helped, Nomo certainly threw more
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had more than one pitch today, and he was throwing them
over the plate,'' catcher Mike Piazza said. ``The thing that has
hurt him most has been the walks. His stuff has been good enough to
get guys out when he's over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the day began, Nomo was third in the league in both
strikeouts per nine innings and accumulated batting average of
opponents. And he did nothing to hurt those statistics by striking
out Barry Bonds three times Wednesday on split-finger fastballs and
not allowing a base runner until Jeff Kent opened the bottom of the
fifth with a single.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Nomo had a 4-0 lead, thanks to a two-run fifth in
which the Mets were helped by a Rich Aurilia throwing error, a
Hershiser wild pitch and another run-scoring single from McRae.
After Kent singled in the fifth, however, Nomo walked Ellis Burks.
Kent then took third on a wild pitch, and Burks stole second. Then
Joe Carter hit a sacrifice fly to drive Kent home.
</P>
<P>
   In other outings, Nomo might have crumbled. But he got Bill
Mueller to ground out to second. And then John Olerud made a
sensational diving play to rob Brian Johnson of an extra-base hit
and get the Mets out of the inning. The only other time Nomo was in
trouble was in the seventh, when he stranded Giants at first and
third by striking out Mueller to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' Piazza said, when he was asked why Nomo
can be so out of control one day, and be so in control the next.
</P>

CHARTING THE GLOBE ON A COCKTAIL NAPKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (for release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The right drink does more than slake a thirst. It takes you
somewhere, even though ``somewhere'' might be the very place you
happen to be sitting.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of calvados in the fall sends a fragrant message
straight from the orchards of Normandy. Consumed on the spot, at a
cafe in Rouen, it fills in a tiny blank space on the imagination's
map. With a poet's concision, it explains the place. For centuries,
Normandy has been apples and apples have been Normandy. What could
bring the point home more memorably than a few ounces of the local
spirit? A snifter is worth a thousand words.
</P>
<P>
   In the great age of travel, this romantic link between drink and
destination could get out of hand. In ``The Gentleman's
Companion,'' written in 1939, Charles H. Baker Jr. outlined a grand
cocktail tour that took the reader on imaginative flights fueled by
drinks like the Tiger's Milk, ``from the historic Wagons-Lits in
the Peking Legation Quarter,'' or ``the unpredictable Balloon
Cocktail from Calcutta's smartest restaurant, Firpo's.''
</P>
<P>
   American readers whose idea of exotic travel went no farther
than the Grand Canyon could go to their kitchens and shake up a
Colombo Flying Fish or a Rangoon Star Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   Baker went overboard, but in principle he was right. As often as
not, drinks exude a heady local atmosphere, because they have a
profound connection with the region or the city that gave birth to
them. Wine, beer and spirits literally spring from the soil
underfoot, and, like a magic potion, they can transport a traveler
straight to the roots of the territory he or she is exploring.
France offers finer wines than Muscadet, but who, stepping off the
ferry from Dover, would order anything else with a platter of
oysters?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, when my wife and I settled in for a week
in Les Montades, a one-street village in Languedoc, our landlady
greeted us with a chilled bottle of Picpoul de Pinet _ not a great
wine, but a profoundly local one. It was like getting a key to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Cocktails, too, speak with a local accent _ not all of them, but
enough of them to make the shrewd traveler think twice before
reflexively ordering a generic vodka and tonic. Colonial rule has
vanished, but the parched traveler in Bombay is allowed to conjure
up one Merchant-Ivory moment by ordering a Pimm's cup, stirred with
a slice of cucumber, or a Somerset Maugham moment drinking a
Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And breathes there a man with a soul so dead that he would not
order a sidecar at Harry's New York Bar in Paris? This titan among
drinks, a combination of cognac, Cointreau and lemon juice, may or
may not have originated at Harry's, but the bar is without question
its spiritual home. Ordering one is an act of solidarity with the
wave of Americans, Hemingway and Fitzgerald among them, who bent an
elbow at Cinq Rue Danou, in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans can reasonably claim to be the most different city
in the United States. It is in the nation but not necessarily of
it. Exhibit A in this case would be the city's native cocktails,
idiosyncratic concoctions that evoke the cosmopolitan, polyglot New
Orleans of the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Order a sazerac or a Ramos gin fizz anywhere else in America and
you will be rewarded with a blank stare. At Antoine's, or Arnaud's,
or (needless to say) the Sazerac in the Fairmont Hotel, they know.
The sazerac is a creolized old-fashioned, a rye cocktail enlivened
and Frenchified with a splash of Pernod (it used to be absinthe)
and a dash of the locally produced Peychaud's bitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramos gin fizz, an ideal brunch cocktail, is a feather-light
gin cocktail made with lemon and lime juice, orange-flower water,
egg white and cream, shaken until it becomes a fragrant foam. It
takes a lot of work, but New Orleans has always been a place where
people put a little extra effort into their pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Most New Yorkers think of the Waldorf-Astoria as a hotel, but
for cocktail enthusiasts it is a bar, richer in history than any
other bar in the city. It takes a little imagination to reclaim the
place and turn back the clock, since the old Waldorf Bar
disappeared with the old Waldorf-Astoria in 1929 after serving as a
``potent school of bibulous instruction,'' in the words of one
historian, from 1893 to the onset of Prohibition in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   But the new bar salvaged the bronze bull and bear that presided
over the old place and maintained the heavy, ornate look and the
lavish sense of space that spelled luxury in the days when giants
like Bet-a-Million Gates roamed Manhattan, and Buffalo Bill Cody
held court, happy to accept a free drink with the words ``Sir, you
speak the language of my tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock ticker is electronic now, and the sporting element has
disappeared, but the Bull and Bear, as the bar is now called, is
still a good setting in which to sniff the faint lingering aroma of
an older, brasher New York, the New York of tycoons, Tin Pan Alley
and Tammany Hall. The appropriate drink helps. There's no point in
asking for a McKinley's Delight, a 1915, a Trilby or most of the
more than 400 cocktails served at the Waldorf Bar, but a Bronx
might put you in business.
</P>
<P>
   Before Prohibition, this beguiling combination of gin, orange
juice and sweet and dry vermouth ranked as one of the city's most
popular cocktails. Overconsumption of bathtub gin disguised by
orange juice pretty much ruined that particular flavor combination,
and the noble Bronx died an untimely death. It deserves to be
rehabilitated and placed right next to the Manhattan as one of New
York's many gifts to the civilized world.
</P>
<P>
   The history-minded cocktail lover could cut a wide swath back
and forth across the United States, sipping a Ward Eight in Boston,
a Clover Club in Philadelphia and a Hemingway-sized daiquiri in Key
West.
</P>
<P>
   A pisco punch in San Francisco would honor the clipper-ship era,
when pisco brandy made its way up the coast from Peru, and no
California trip would be complete without a swooping move south for
the island fantasy drinks that Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic
unleashed in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra's Fang and the Shark's Tooth are no longer with us,
but the Zombie and the Mai Tai live on, reminders that Los Angeles
is the mighty dynamo powering the American fun factory.
</P>
<P>
   There's a purely selfish reason to drink local. You stand a
better chance of getting a quality product. In Dijon, a kir is
fail-safe. Elsewhere, it tends to taste like vinous Kool-Aid. The
mint julep never did much for me until the day I found myself in
Jocelyn's, a small family-run restaurant in Ocean Springs, Miss.
When the waiter drifted over and asked for drink orders, one of the
diners, a local resident, said, ``Go on and try the julep _ they're
pretty good here.''
</P>
<P>
   They were better than pretty good. The waiter returned with a
tray of tall glasses beaded with condensation. I lifted an
ice-packed glass, buried my nose in a sprig of the mint garnish and
let the rich, sweet bourbon trickle down my throat. As thirst
quenchers go, this one ranked near the top of the major leagues.
But don't ask for it in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Recapping, a few drinks from the Bull and Bear bar in the
Waldorf-Astoria:
</P>
<P>
   BRONX: A gin, orange juice and vermouth mix that's out of
fashion but worthy of an urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   MANHATTAN: A glassful of civility (and rye and vermouth).
</P>
<P>
   GIN FIZZ: Not as frothy as its cousin Ramos from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   MAI TAI: Hollywood casting brings together rum, liqueurs and
fruit juice to create an island fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   SINGAPORE SLING: A permanent guest at Raffles Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ZOMBIE: Combining various rums to induce that walking-dead
feeling.

LIBYA SIGNALS ACCEPTANCE OF PLAN TO TRY LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change ``apparently accepted'' to ``indicated it would

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In guarded language, Libya indicated Wednesday
that it would accept an American and British proposal that two
Libyan suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am jet in 1988 be tried in
the Netherlands by Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
   A statement was read Wednesday night on Libyan television and
circulated by the official news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the one-page statement was there any promise to turn
over the two suspects, and further Libyan delays are widely
expected. But an agreement in principle among the Libyans, British
and Americans on how to proceed with the trial would be the first
major breakthrough in the case in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan statement said only that the government would ``deal
positively'' with the American and British offer ``and give it the
interest and care it deserves.'' Libya also demanded a complete end
of the sanctions imposed on the country in 1992; Washington has
proposed suspending the curbs as a first step.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and the Arab League, where the
proposal originated, reacted cautiously to the announcement,
sensing that there may be further demands by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Libyans indicated that they had not finished
studying the proposals. In one passage, as circulated in English by
the official news agency, Libya seeks proof that the proposals
``are free from any conditions laid down by the governments of the
United Kingdom and the United States to impede the holding of the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   British and American diplomats say that the plan is
straightforward: All Libya needs to do is turn over the suspects,
and then justice will take its course.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan announcement was a response to a proposal formally
offered on Monday. The proposal included a resolution presented to
the United Nations that would suspend sanctions when the two
suspects reach the Netherlands but would also threaten further
steps if the Libyans failed to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi asked the Council to
postpone voting on the British and American resolution; the vote
may come on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the Scottish judiciary would establish an
unusual offshore court in a still undecided location in the
Netherlands. The explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people _ 259 aboard the plane and 11 on the
ground. There were 189 Americans among the dead on the
London-to-New York flight.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council, Ramadan Barg, Libya's
charge d'affaires at its U.N. mission, said Libyan judicial
authorities needed ``sufficient time'' to study the plan and other
relevant documents, which are being translated into Arabic. But the
Libyans got no support for a delay from Arab nations or members of
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no decision to delay anything,'' said Danilo Turk,
Slovenia's representative and this month's Security Council
president, when asked about the Libyan letter after Wednesday's
session.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's request for more time was seen by some diplomats here as
a last-ditch attempt by Gadhafi to avoid exposing intelligence
agents to scrutiny in a foreign court.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans also want to draw Secretary-General Kofi Annan into
the deliberations, further holding up movement toward a trial. Some
Arab diplomats say Gadhafi wants assurances that questions at the
trial will involve only Lockerbie, and that his intelligence
network, which many accuse of supporting terrorism, will not be
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In Edgartown, Mass., a spokesman for the vacationing President
Clinton said Wednesday that the United States was losing patience
with Libya. ``Libya must comply promptly,'' said the spokesman,
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League, where the proposal for a Scottish trial in the
Netherlands originated, obliquely warned the Libyans against
obstructing the compromise, which Gadhafi endorsed in January
before the United States and Britain adopted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Libya has counted on the support of the Arab, African and
nonaligned countries to bring about a solution to this problem,''
Hussein Hassouna, the Arab League's representative at the United
Nations, said in an interview Wednesday before the Libyan
announcement. ``I don't expect them to take a position that will
lose them this support in coming phases of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gomersall, the deputy British representative, said he
was ``very encouraged'' by the support for their proposal that
Britain and the United States were getting around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Libyan government obviously has the right to study the
text,'' Gomersall said. ``But the Libyan government has also had
access to legal expertise on the Scottish system for a long time.''
The proposal to try the Libyan suspects in the Netherlands in front
of Scottish judges had been discussed for months before it was made
public in July.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Hauser, an international lawyer and former American
delegate to the United Nations who is now chairman of the
International Peace Academy, described the promotion of the
proposal by Britain and the United States as a ``highly creative''
move that had caught the Libyans off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other case where a country was willing to
move an entire court to another country in this way,'' she said.
``Libya probably thought that the U.K. and the U.S. would never
agree to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and London had earlier insisted that the two
suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifa Fhimah, be
tried in the United States, the home of most of the victims, or in
Scotland. The midair explosion killed 259 people on the plane _ 189
of them Americans _ and 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gomersall said Wednesday that there was no time limit
set on Libya's accepting or rejecting the proposal, the American
and British resolution now taking shape in the Security Council
puts pressure on the Libyans to accept, or face wider sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   There was also pressure on the United States and Britain to make
the offer before a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement in South
Africa. At the meeting, which begins this weekend, more than 100
nations are expected to follow the lead of the Organization of
African Unity and declare they will no longer abide by sanctions
against Libya, even if there is no movement in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain, which have seen enthusiasm for
sanctions eroding, could not afford to see the erosion of the
limited sanctions _ bans on air travel to Libya and on some imports
from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hassouna, of the Arab League, said Arab and African nations had
welcomed the British and American offer as ``the best practical way
to bring about an early solution to this crisis that has been going
on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has left, on one hand, the families of the victims not
having their legal redress,'' he said, ``and on the other hand, a
whole country suffering from the hardship of sanctions because just
two suspects were not brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya also has an outstanding case with France. In 1989, UTA
Flight 772 was blown up over Niger, killing 171 people. The French
accused Libya of plotting the explosion, and the case remains
unresolved.

FLOODED SOUTH TEXAS GETS DISASTER DECLARATION

<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ After visiting areas devastated by flash
flooding and learning firsthand of survivors' misery, Gov. George
W. Bush announced what this stricken community wanted most: a
federal disaster declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was holding back my tears the whole time,'' Bush was heard
confiding to Del Rio Mayor Robert Chavira after chatting with and
sometimes hugging some of the 947 residents who took shelter at the
civic center after their homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, residents spent two days preparing for flooding, and
hundreds moved into shelters. But officials said Wednesday
afternoon that the Rio Grande was about as high as it will get, and
the only flooded area was a mall parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Three international bridges linking the city with Nuevo Laredo,
Mexico, were closed all day. Officials planned to meet Wednesday
night to consider reopening at least one bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The worst flooding in Del Rio occurred Sunday night and Monday,
but rain pelted the area again Tuesday night, spurring a more flash
flood warnings and sending even more people into shelters.
</P>
<P>
   About 750 people took shelter in a school and church, said Jane
Pratt, a Del Rio Red Cross official. She said people remain
traumatized by the flooding, which occurred after remnants of
Tropical Storm Charley dumped about 18 inches of rain within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   When flash flood warnings went out again Wednesday night, some
people were crying and upset, Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people who had lost everything, and here we had
more rain. They were devastated,'' she said. But the rain Tuesday
night caused only minor flooding, and the death toll remained at
six.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Wednesday, officials said that more than 80 people were
still considered missing, but by evening that number was down to
54. Border Patrol spokeswoman Patricia Mancha said 40 were
unaccounted for, meaning that others have reported them missing and
they haven't checked in at shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen more are ``verified missing,'' Mancha said, after
house-to-house checks could not locate them. Authorities have been
given only vague information about four others whose whereabouts
are unknown, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was told of the federal disaster declaration Wednesday in a
phone conversation with White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart breaks for those who went from nice, secure homes to
no homes at all,'' Bush said. He thanked Bowles for expediting the
request and told him simply, ``It's really sad here.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, dressed in cowboy boots and jeans, was confronted
by a schoolgirl who said her father had left for San Antonio before
the storm hit, and she wondered if he knew they were hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're listening, your little girl is here'' Bush later
said, addressing the girl's father through a line of TV cameras at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the governor we're afraid,'' said Diana Ortiz, 35, a
mother of two who was to start a new job Monday and whose husband
is disabled. ``We don't know what's going to happen to us. We've
lost our furniture, our cars, our home. He promised to help.''
</P>
<P>
   With the disaster declaration, Bush said, Small Business
Administration loans will be available to individuals and
businesses, and smaller cash grants will be provided to people who
do not qualify for loans.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agencies will arrange temporary housing, which
at first will probably be mobile homes, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Millwee, state coordinator of the Texas Emergency Management
Division, said a survey showed that the flooding in Del Rio
destroyed 300 homes and caused major damage to 100 and lesser
damage to 600. In addition, 50 businesses were destroyed or
sustained major damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of water and sewer service remains a major problem. On
Tuesday, the water department reinstalled four 200-horsepower pump
motors on the city wells and then quickly pulled them out when new
flood warnings were issued.
</P>
<P>
   The flood destroyed $150,000 worth of electronic equipment at
San Felipe Springs, which is the city's water source and is where
the first Mass in Texas was celebrated in 1675, local residents
say.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the springs and the main pump station are between the
sixth and seventh holes of the San Felipe Country Club golf course.
A backup pump station, also shut down by the flood, is between the
fourth and fifth holes.
</P>
<P>
   With the pumps reinstalled, the first flow of untreated water
was expected Wednesday night, water superintendent Mitchell Lomas
said. He estimated that chlorinated drinking water won't be
available for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents formed long lines to collect drinking water
at a supermarket parking lot, and they got water to flush toilets
at the Penney's parking lot or from nearby creeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend three hours a day picking up water,'' said Dan
Peterson, 80, who was pushing a supermarket cart filled with empty
jugs. His wife and 9-year-old daughter pushed another cart outside
the H.E.B. Supermarket, which is bringing in potable water in
5,500-gallon tank trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of floodwater from Del Rio pushed the Rio Grande well
above flood stage Wednesday in Laredo. As a precaution, officials
shut down much of the downtown tourist district, and Mayor Betty
Flores said about 900 people sought refuge in temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been hard to convince people that there's a flood
coming, because we're still in a drought,'' Flores said. ``But this
is a very dangerous river right now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those hard-to-convince people was 38-year-old Freddy
Madrigal, who lives in a riverside ``colonia'' south of Laredo.
Madrigal plunged into the river for a swim Wednesday and retrieved
a deflated inner tube that was floating downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to fear from this river if you know what
you're doing,'' Madrigal said, but officials said his actions were
foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   The river at Laredo was at about 25 feet Wednesday afternoon,
well over its flood stage of 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indications are, at least at this stage, that the water's
slowing down,'' said Gene Garza, Laredo port director for the U.S.
Customs Service. ``But this is the most water I've ever seen on the
river.''

BASEBALL TO STUDY AREA OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to stem the debate over a
testosterone-producing pill that Mark McGwire has acknowledged
using, the baseball commissioner and the players' union chief
issued a joint statement Wednesday saying they have asked their
medical experts to study the whole area of nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pill, androstenedione, is legal and available over
the counter, its use by a baseball player of McGwire's stature has
become controversial because it is banned by the International
Olympic Committee, the National Football League and the National
Collegiate Athletic Association. It is not prohibited by Major
League Baseball, the National Basketball Association or the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, in one of his first pronouncements as commissioner,
and Donald Fehr, the union chief, acted because baseball is
concerned that the controversy will undermine the mushrooming
interest in the pursuit of the home run record by McGwire and Sammy
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   The home run chase is the biggest thing to hit baseball in years
and has fans flocking to ball parks where McGwire and Sosa play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent days,'' the Selig-Fehr statement said, ``there have
been press reports concerning the use of certain nutritional
supplements by major league players. The substances in question are
available over the counter and are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration. In view of these facts, it seems inappropriate
that such reports should overshadow the accomplishments of players
such as Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the debate isn't abating, however, Selig and Fehr added,
they have asked their medical experts to ``gather the relevant
scientific and medical data and to consult with other experts on
the general use of nutritional supplements by major league
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's medical experts are Dr. Robert Millman for the clubs
and Dr. Joel Solomon for the players. They have been involved
primarily in cases involving illegal drugs, such as cocaine. They
are expected, too, to seek input from club medical personnel. Each
team has trainers and a set of doctors that care for its players.
</P>
<P>
   Selig separately expressed concern for the health of baseball's
players and said the sport wants to ``take every precaution to
assure they receive the most accurate medical and scientific
information.'' Fehr said players shouldn't ``be faulted for staying
entirely within the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the use of the pills say baseball should make
them illegal. The sports organizations that ban androstenedione
believe it produces an advantage in competition through added
strength and the ability to recover more quickly from rigorous
training and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to McGwire's ability to play this season
injury-free compared with some of his previous seasons, suggesting
that the pills have made that possible. Baseball people, on the
other hand, ask what is wrong with staying healthy. They further
ask what the difference is between taking a pill to prevent injury
or help heal an injury and having a player get a cortisone shot for
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball people further argue that the andro pill doesn't help a
player make contact with a baseball thrown at 96 miles an hour.
And, they point out, before McGwire or anyone else can hit a home
run, he has to make contact. Furthermore, lest anyone think a pill
can help a player hit home runs or hit balls greater distances,
they note that McGwire has always been a home run hitter and has
never hit cheap home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has to hit the ball,'' Devon White of the Arizona
Diamondbacks said earlier this week. ``Guys get on guys who do
steroids or whatever it is they do. But they still have to go to
the gym and work hard and they still have to hit the baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate pills such as
androstenedione because it says supplements are closer to a food
than a drug. And no definitive studies have been made to determine
long-range effects of the use of this particular supplement.
Potential but unknown ill effects are what concerns some medical
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune, citing a June 9 memo it obtained, reported
Wednesday that General Nutrition Centers, a national chain of
nutrition-supplement centers, ordered its 3,700 stores not to sell
androstenedione because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Professional Team Physicians, made up of
doctors from professional teams, issued a position paper earlier
this week in which it called for a ban on the use of
androstenedione in competitive sports and for its removal from
over-the-counter purchase. The group's position is that the
substance is an anabolic steroid. Presumably some of the
association's members will offer their thoughts to Millman and
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   The Selig-Fehr statement said there would be further comment
``following review of the relevant scientific and medical
information.''

FINANCIAL BARON'S MANEUVERS CONTRIBUTED TO RUSSIAN PREMIER'S
OUSTER 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Berezovsky, one of Russia's emerging tycoons, had
waited months for this moment of triumph, quietly plotting to
depose Russia's earnest Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Berezovsky went to the White House, the mammoth,
Soviet-era government headquarters that looms over the Moscow
River, and there, in a private meeting with Anatoly Chubais, one of
the government's most passionate reformers, he told Chubais that
the Kiriyenko team was finished. President Boris Yeltsin,
Berezovsky declared, would soon sign a decree sacking the entire
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais did not resist, people familiar with the weekend's
events said. He sensed it was a fait accompli and later told
Kremlin aides that Berezovsky's aim in telegraphing the punch was
to demonstrate clearly that the financial barons that dominate
Russia's industry and banks were making a move to reassert their
power.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko had concluded his days might be numbered. Russia's
wealthy businessmen, who had made a fortune buying and selling
companies once controlled by the government, had bridled at his
tough talk about collecting back taxes and allowing money-losing
enterprises to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the day after Berezovsky delivered the news, Yeltsin
summoned the prime minister to his dacha outside Moscow and told
him that he was planning some unspecified personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   Confused, Kiriyenko left the meeting unsure when the axe might
fall. Within hours, though, the official notice came. Kiriyenko was
out. Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who was fired in the
last shake-up, was back in.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden demise of Kiriyenko's four-month-old government came
partly from the deepening financial crisis and Yeltsin's penchant
for sacrificing loyal subordinates. But it also was a demonstration
of the power of Berezovsky and other tycoons, who exploited the
crisis and Yeltsin's weakened position, to install a more pliant
government.
</P>
<P>
   Now Berezovsky and his allies are playing the role of go-between
in the formation of that government, helping Chernomyrdin negotiate
with the Communists who dominate the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The drama is still far from over. The burning issue now is not
whether the Parliament will approve Chernomyrdin _ that seems
assured _ but whether a physically ailing and politically besieged
Yeltsin will cede to Chernomyrdin by eventually resigning and
calling early elections.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable Chernomyrdin to take the reins as the nation's
acting chief executive and would give him an enormous advantage as
a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big danger for the country,'' Boris Nemtsov,
one of the Kiriyenko supporters who resigned his top Kremlin post
this week, said in an interview. ``A resignation would be bad not
just because of the problem with the currency but because of the
history of Russia. If any czar decides to resign it could lead to a
real time of troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky had never made a secret of his opposition to
Kiriyenko or his own doctrine that the government should be a
servant of well-connected businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   A former mathematician, Berezovsky made a fortune as a car
dealer and media mogul after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He
was one of Yeltsin's major financial backers during the 1996
presidential elections and claimed his reward by being named deputy
secretary of the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, he locked horns with Kremlin reformers like
Chubais, who once presided over Russia's troubled privatization
program.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov, the former governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region who
Yeltsin once touted as possible successor, prevailed on the
president last year to fire Berezovsky from his security post,
complaining that the businessman was mixing his business and
government interests.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, however, remained close to the corridors of power.
He maintained connections with Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's chief
of staff, and Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter and political
adviser. And he used his control over the ORT television channel
and his newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, to attack his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, when Yeltsin anointed Kiriyenko _ a former energy
minister, banker and Nemtsov ally who also comes from Nizhny
Novgorod _ as prime minister, Berezovsky inveighed against the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it appeared that Berezovsky would be the loser. Aided
by Chubais, the Kiriyenko team negotiated a $17 billion bailout
package with the International Monetary Fund. Western officials
praised the new prime minister's dedication and acumen.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so enthusiastic. Some of Russia's financial
community was alarmed by Kiriyenko's talk about putting the
nation's house in order by refusing to bail out well-connected
banks and enterprises. Some of Russia's new tycoons, who had built
their fortunes by buying privatized government enterprises at
bargain prices with the help of political connections, have not
proven to be very adept business managers and now fear the idea of
free market competition
</P>
<P>
   Even with the IMF bailout, investors continued to flee the
world's emerging markets. The Parliament resisted Kiriyenko's
program, much of which was tied to the additional loans from the
fund. Worse, the ruble began to falter and Russian banks were
having trouble paying back their borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government, after insisting that it would never
devalue the currency, reversed itself and allowed the currency to
decline in value. It also took some steps to protect the nation's
oligarchy, including a 90-day moratorium on the repayment of the
banks' foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia financial crisis also gave the prime minister's
opponents the opening they had been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiriyenko prepared a packet of measures to that would lead to
the bankruptcy of ineffective banks or financial industrial
groups,'' Nemtsov said. ``When the oligarchs sensed this they
decided to change the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As last week came to an end, there was talk that Kiriyenko might
be ousted, but it was far from clear who might take his place.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls of the Kremlin, several successors were mentioned:
Moscow's pugnacious major, Yuri Luzhkov; Yegor Stroyev, the head of
the upper house of Parliament; and Chernomyrdin, the prime minister
Yeltsin unceremoniously ousted in March.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had his liabilities. During his first term as prime
minister he had gone along with Russia's stutter-step journey
toward a capitalist democracy. But he had also presided over the
insider deals and half measures that led to its economic quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, however, he had good connections across the
spectrum. As the former head of Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas
monopoly, he was an unofficial member of the financial oligarchy.
He also enjoyed close ties with the Communist leadership in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   During the months after he was cast out of the Kremlin, he also
met with Berezovsky, including a reported meeting this month in
southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky glories in self-promotion and his enemies also
sometimes exaggerate his role. But while Berezovsky was not the
only baron supporting Chernomyrdin, he was an active and important
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Berezovsky schemed behind his back, Kiriyenko worried that he
was running out of time. But when he went to see Yeltsin on Sunday
he wasn't sure what would happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was asked by the president: would I agree to stay
in the government if some changes in it took place,'' Kiriyenko
told the newspaper Kommersant Daily. ``I answered that first of all
I would like to take a break. Secondly, it would be wrong as a
matter of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting with Yeltsin, Kiriyenko huddled with his old
friend, Nemtsov, who had worked on and off with Yeltsin for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Kiriyenko describe the conversation with the
president, ``I said the decision will be made immediately,''
Nemtsov recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That night Kiriyenko and Nemtsov ventured out of the White House
for a final meeting with striking coal miners who have pitched a
nearby squatters' camp to protest the failure to pay back wages.
</P>
<P>
   Still the buttoned-down technocrat, Kiriyenko was dressed in a
gray suit and tie. But the telegenic Nemtsov was wearing blue jeans
and had a sweater draped around his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted Kremlin officials brought a bottle of vodka as a
gift. A gaggle of body guards accompanied the dispirited pair from
the government headquarters but maintained a respective distance.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 minutes, the former ministers and the unpaid miners
commiserated about the cut-throat world of Russian capitalism, as
some of the miners snapped photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed a lot of topics, including the oligarchy,''
Nemtsov said. ``They asked who is stealing the money. The prime
minister said it was the result of crony capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   To the miners Kiriyenko appeared nervous and shaken while
Nemtsov seemed more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and said, `Guys, we're unemployed like you and
we don't know where to go,'' recalled Volodya Kapyto, a 45-year-old
miner from Perm. ``They said, `We wanted to do something, but they
did not let us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Added Valera Ustiantsev, a 46-year-old miner, ``They said they
wanted to pay the government's internal debts, but that Yeltsin
chased them out.''
</P>
<P>
   After the guests left, however, Sergei Pervushkin, a 30-year-old
miner from the far northern city of Vorkuta, grabbed the vodka
bottle and smashed it against the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have come sooner and not with vodka, but with
concrete proposals,'' Pervushkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin did not explain his decision until the next day. Looking
drawn, the 67 year-old president gave a terse, mid-day television
address, in which he touted Chernomyrdin as a force for stability
and his heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five months ago, no one expected the world financial crisis to
hit Russia so hard,'' Yeltsin said, alluding to his earlier
decision to substitute Kiriyenko for Chernomyrdin. ``Today we need
those who are commonly referred to as heavyweights.''
</P>
<P>
   The political U-turn has sparked a further collapse of Russia's
weakened ruble and unnerved investors, who fear Chernomyrdin will
retreat from Kiriyenko's reformist course.
</P>
<P>
   It also plunged the nation into a political upheaval as
financiers vie for posts on the new government team along with
Communists, whose support Chernomyrdin needs to win approval in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   While the composition of the government is unclear, one thing
that is certain is that Kiriyenko's allies will go.
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin official said that Chernomyrdin and Berezovsky are
pushing to strip Chubais of his post as head of Russia's electrical
monopoly. Chubais held that job when he negotiated last month with
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moscow is debating whether the prime minister post
Chernomyrdin has regained is a waystation to the presidency.
Yeltsin has suggested that Chernomyrdin would carry forward his
banner in the election in 2000. But some officials say Chernomyrdin
and his sponsors may not want to wait that long.
</P>
<P>
   If Yeltsin were pressed to resign for reasons of health,
Chernomyrdin would become acting president and early elections
would be organized when Chernomyrdin enjoyed the benefits of being
an incumbent but before he may be blamed for a collapsing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin knows that his chances of being elected president
are slim if he waits until 2000,'' the newspaper Segodnya observed
Wednesday. ``But the situation will be radically difference if he
runs for president as an acting president in 1998.''

AFC WEST 
DENVER BRONCOS 
1997: 12-4, 6-2 in AFC West 
Coach (record): Mike Shanahan (37-16 with Broncos, 45-28 overall) 
Stadium: Mile High Stadium (76,078) 
Ticket information: (303) 433-7466 
Pieces in place 
QB John Elway (27 TDs), RB Terrell Davis (Super Bowl XXXII MVP,
1,750 rushing yards), TE Shannon Sharpe (1,107 receiving yards), WR
Rod Smith (1,180 receiving yards), DE Neil Smith (8.5 sacks), DT
Maa Tanuvasa (8.5 sacks), DE Alfred Williams (8.5 sacks), CB Ray
Crockett (4 interceptions), FS Steve Atwater (68 tackles). 
Key newcomers 
WR Marcus Nash, S Eric Brown, DE Marvin Washington, G Leo Goeas. 
Key losses 
LB Allen Aldridge, OT Jamie Brown, G Brian Habib. 
Missing piece 
The Broncos gave up chunks of yardage on the ground in 1997, but
the club's real concern is in the secondary. The club reluctantly
put KR Darrien Gordon at cornerback when the projected starter in
1997, Tory James, suffered a knee injury in the first preseason
game. James will start if he's healthy, but has never started an
NFL game yet. At strong safety, the Broncos may have to go with
rookie Brown of Mississippi State if the overachieving Tyrone
Braxton, 33, slows down. This questionable secondary will be asked
to cover the opposing wide receivers for an extra split second in
1998 because the pass rush is without one of its cogs. Williams
could be out until November because of a triceps injury. 
Biggest test 
From Nov. 16 to Dec. 21, the Broncos play four of six on the road
against Kansas City, San Diego, the New York Giants and Miami. 
Watch out for 
Davis will make another run at 2,000 yards. But the bigger story
out of Denver will be the farewell tour for Elway. And you can bet
that his teammates will play hard for him. But how bad does he
really want to win again? With that elusive Super Bowl championship
ring finally on his finger, will he take it easy during his last
season? Or does he try to go out with a bang? Whatever the case,
history is against him leading his club to a repeat title. None of
the retired quarterbacks with the 20 highest passer ratings in
league history won their last NFL playoff game. 
Milestones 
Elway has won 138 games as a starting quarterback, most in NFL
history. 
Overview 
The Broncos have been the AFC's best team for the past two years.
Nothing should change if the club stays healthy. Other AFC figure
to be much hungrier than the Broncos, and that could lead to their
demise as defending Super Bowl champions. Nevertheless, look for
Elway to at least make it to the AFC Championship Game in his final
season. And that is not a bad way to go out. 
Prediction: 13-3

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 
1997: 13-3, 7-1 in AFC West 
Coach (record): Marty Schottenheimer (97-56-1 with Chiefs, 143-87-1
overall) 
Stadium: Arrowhead Stadium (79,101) 
Ticket information: (816) 924-9400 
Pieces in place 
QB Elvis Grbac (1,943 passing yards), WR Andre Rison (1,092 yards,
7 TDs), NT Dan Williams (10.5 sacks), LB Derrick Thomas (9.5
sacks), Nickel CB Mark McMillan (8 interceptions), CB James Hasty
(3 interceptions, Pro Bowl), CB Dale Carter (2 interceptions, Pro
Bowl). 
Key newcomers 
DE Leslie O'Neal, DE Chester McGlockton, WR Derrick Alexander, OT
Victor Riley, RB Rashaan Shehee. 
Key loss 
RB Marcus Allen. 
Missing piece 
Despite the retirement of Allen and the waiving of Greg Hill,
Schottenheimer did not go after a running back in free agency, and
he passed on several in the first round of the draft. He'll put his
ground game hopes on a committee. HB Donnell Bennett, FB Kimble
Anders and second-round pick Shehee are the early candidates to get
most of the work. Schottenheimer even played speedy WR/KR Tamarick
Vanover at the position during the preseason. All are steady, but
none has shown much in the way of game-breaking ability. And that
could very well be the difference in the Chiefs' season: finding a
back who can turn a 4-yard run into an 80-yard touchdown dash. 
Biggest test 
The Chiefs play three of their final four games on the road, at
Denver, Dallas and Oakland. Each of the Chiefs' three losses in
1997 came on the road. 
Watch out for 
The club's play at quarterback was a big issue in 1997. Elvis Grbac
was the starter, but Rich Gannon led the team to a 5-1 record when
Grbac sat because of a broken collarbone. Grbac came back for the
playoffs, but his play against Denver in the playoff loss was
nothing special. Grbac is the starter in 1998, and the club is
expected to allow him to call more audibles. And Grbac has more
weapons to work with. Alexander (1,009 yards, 9 TDs) pairs with
Rison to give the Chiefs one of the most potent duo of wide
receivers in the league, if Alexander can shake off a ribcage
injury. 
Milestones 
With a starting record of 14-5, Grbac has the best winning
percentage (.737) as a starter among active NFL quarterbacks. 
Overview 
The Chiefs have the defense and passing game to beat any team. If
the running game produces, perhaps this club can attain home-field
advantage in the playoffs again. Whatever happens, this club will
only be judged by what they do in the playoffs. And maybe this is
the year that a Schottenheimer team goes all the way. Prediction:
12-4

SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 
1997: 8-8, 4-4 in AFC West 
Coach (record): Dennis Erickson (23-25) 
Stadium: Kingdome (66,400) 
Ticket information: (888) NFL-HAWK 
Pieces in place 
WR Joey Galloway (1,049 yards, 12 TDs), DE Michael Sinclair (12
sacks), DT Cortez Kennedy, FS Daryl Williams (8 interceptions), LB
Chad Brown (6.5 sacks). 
Key newcomers 
RB Ricky Watters, LB Darrin Smith, G Brian Habib, C Kevin Glover,
LB Anthony Simmons, P Jeff Feagles, RB Ahman Green. 
Key losses 
C Kevin Mawae, RB Lamar Smith, RB Chris Warren, P Rick Tuten. 
Missing piece 
The Seahawks were one of four teams to finish in the top 10 in
total offense and total defense. But they were the only team of
that foursome _ Denver, Green Bay and Pittsburgh were the others _
that missed the playoffs. One of the reasons was because of the
Seahawks' disastrous special teams. Two losses came because of
missed field goals in overtime. Two fumbles were returned for
touchdowns. One punt went minus-6 yards. A punt was blocked for a
safety. A dropped punt snap that set up a touchdown. In the
off-season, the Seahawks added a new special-teams coach (Pete
Rodriguez), a new punter and holder (Feagles), a new kickoff
returner (Green) and a new deep snapper (Jason McEndoo). Galloway
and CB Shawn Springs are also expected to challenge incumbent
Ronnie Harris for the punt-return job. Still, kicker Todd Peterson,
who missed those two overtime field goals, remains. And if this
team is to take it to the next level, he'll have to be perfect, or
close to it, in close games. 
Biggest test 
The Seahawks play six consecutive games against division foes from
Oct. 4 to Nov. 15. 
Watch out for 
How Jon Kitna performs as this club's starting quarterback if
41-year-old Warren Moon retires or gets hurt. The wide receivers
are there with Galloway and Mike Pritchard, and so is the running
game with Watters. Much of Kitna's or Moon's success will depend on
the offensive line, which is probably this club's only spot of
contention. It is solid, with Pro Bowl center Glover and Habib.
There is potential for greatness with LT Walter Jones and LG Pete
Kendall. Both are young, and since they protect the quarterback's
blind side, any mistake could lead to injury. 
Milestones 
The Seahawks have not posted a winning record since 1990. 
Overview 
This team has the talent to reach the playoffs, and with a schedule
that ranks as the 23rd ``toughest,'' in the NFL, there should be no
excuses. To be sure, there is a question at quarterback. But
billionaire-owner Paul Allen didn't dig deep in his pockets to
field a team that is only competitive. He wants a winner. If one is
not produced, this could be Erickson's last year. Prediction: 9-7

OAKLAND RAIDERS 
1997: 4-12, 2-6 in AFC West 
Coach (record): Jon Gruden (first year) 
Stadium: Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum 
Ticket information: (800) 949-2626 
Pieces in place 
QB Jeff George (3,917 yards, 29 TDs), RB Napoleon Kaufman (1,294
rushing yards), WR Tim Brown (104 receptions, 1,408 yards), FS Eric
Turner, DT Russell Maryland. 
Key newcomers 
CB Charles Woodson, OT Mo Collins, CB Eric Allen, TE Derek Brown,
SS Anthony Newman. 
Key losses 
CB Larry Brown, LB Rob Fredrickson, G Lester Holmes, DE Chester
McGlockton. 
Missing piece 
The Raiders were atrocious on defense in 1997, finishing last in
the league in rushing defense and passing defense, and 28th in
scoring defense. Drafting Heisman Trophy winner Woodson to play
cornerback should help. But the problems for the defense are up
front, which suffered a big blow with the off-season death of
rookie DT Leon Bender. The team will go with Russell Maryland and
Darrell Russell, last year's No. 1 pick, at the tackles. Russell
played end last year, and coaches think the switch back to his
natural position will help. The Raiders are really weak at
linebacker, where they traded away their best player at the outside
position, Fredrickson. Team owner Al Davis did not deal for a
linebacker or grab one early in the draft. So that spot will
probably be a weakness again for the Raiders in 1998. 
Biggest test 
They Raiders could be out of playoff contention before the end of
September. They are at home against Kansas City, the New York
Giants and Denver, then are at the Cowboys. 
Watch out for 
A bunch of games that end 45-40. The Raiders might not play enough
defense to stop a good college team. But their offense can score
points on anyone. With 3,917 yards passing, 29 touchdowns and only
nine interceptions, George probably put up the best stats ever
while leading a 4-12 team. Kaufman gained 1,294 yards on only 272
carries (4.8-yard average), and Brown led the AFC with 104
receptions. No telling how much more offense there will be in 1998
as Gruden, a West Coast disciple, hired Gary Stevens as his
offensive coordinator. Stevens came over from Dan Marino's Miami
Dolphins. 
Milestones 
At least the Raiders draft well. Four of their past five No. 1
draft picks are starters with the team. That doesn't include
Woodson, this year's No. 1, who is the projected starter at
cornerback. 
Overview: The games should be exciting. And Davis' relationship
with the young Gruden will bear a story or two. But the results
will be the same: Another sad season for what was once one of the
league's top franchises.

SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 
1997: 4-12, 1-7 in AFC West 
Coach (record): Kevin Gilbride (4-12) 
Stadium: Qualcomm Stadium (71,000) 
Ticket information: (619) 280-2121 
Pieces in place 
LB Junior Seau, G Raleigh McKenzie, DE William Fuller (3 sacks), SS
Rodney Harrison, CB Dwayne Harper, DT Reuben Davis. 
Key newcomers 
QB Ryan Leaf, RB Natrone Means, LT John Jackson, LG Aaron Taylor,
WR Mikhael Ricks. 
Key losses 
RB Gary Brown, K Greg Davis, QB Jim Everett, WR Tony Martin, WR
Eric Metcalf. 
Missing piece 
The Chargers could be pretty decent on offense, with the drafting
of Leaf, and the free-agent signings of Means, Jackson and Taylor.
But the defense still has a bunch of problems, particularly the
pass rush, where the Chargers did nothing in the off-season to
upgrade. Davis, the club's best tackle, is back after missing 1997
with an Achilles' heel injury. But Fuller, who is 36, and Marco
Coleman, who has underachieved, combined for five sacks in 1997.
You need much more pass rush production than that from your
starting ends to survive the pass-happy AFC West. The Chargers were
23rd against the pass and last in the league in points allowed. And
even with Seau, that total statistic doesn't figure to change
much. 
Biggest test 
The Chargers have only five games against playoff teams, including
two each against Kansas City and Denver. Some of the weak teams
they face are the Indianapolis, Oakland (twice), Arizona,
Baltimore, Buffalo and Philadelphia. But, those teams are probably
saying the same thing about having the Chargers on their schedule. 
Watch out for 
How Leaf falls. The last first-year quarterback that had a great
impact on the league was Dan Marino in 1983. So no one should
expect too much from the rookie from Washington State. The key
things to determining his development are all tangible. Does he
have respect from his teammates? Does he show no fear in the
pocket? If the postseason answer to both is ``yes,'' then the
Chargers will be better off, no matter how many losses pile up. 
Milestones 
The Chargers tied the Broncos last year by scoring an NFL-high 10
touchdowns on defense and special teams. 
Overview 
This is a rebuilding year for Gilbride and GM Bobby Beathard. With
a weak defense and an offense featuring a rookie quarterback and
starting wide receivers that have combined for five career
touchdown receptions, expect a lot of games to get out of hand. If
Leaf stays healthy, the season will have been a success. 
Prediction: 3-13

`TITANIC' VIDEO TO DOCK AT STORES TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Get ready for another pop culture frenzy of
titanic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The home video of James Cameron's Oscar-winning ``Titanic'' goes
on sale Tuesday, and Paramount Studios has already shipped more
than 20 million copies to retailers. Many stores will re-open at
midnight or stay open all evening Monday so that legions of
``Titanic'' fans can buy or rent the video as soon as it's
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt this is going to draw a lot of 15-year-old
girls,'' said Barbara McNamara, an industry tracker with Alexander
&AMP; Associates. ``Making it into an event will draw in the real
Leonardo DiCaprio fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Many outlets in the 4,000-store Blockbuster chain, which
generate a third of the nation's video revenues, plan to hold ``bon
voyage'' parties Monday night and the chain is running a nationwide
sweepstakes to win a cruise vacation to anywhere in the world. Best
Buy will re-open all of its 289 stores at midnight and give all
``Titanic'' buyers a free ``Titanic'' calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Cable-shopping giant QVC reported it has received more than
230,000 orders for the video, which it will ship Tuesday, since it
began selling the tape for $19.95 on June 15. It topped QVC's
record for pre-orders, set by the ``Star Wars'' trilogy, three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin Megastore in suburban West Hollywood will feature
performances by Gaelic Storm, the band that appeared in the movie
in the party scene in steerage, beginning at 10 p.m. Monday before
the tape actually goes on sale at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount and Virgin also will set up a ``green screen'' video
system to tape fans and drop them into a scene from the movie,
Paramount publicist Corey Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The hype has reached the Internet too, where Reel.com is taking
a calculated financial bath by selling the tape for just $9.95,
plus $3.90 in shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledged it's losing money on every ``Titanic''
order, but hopes to draw customers to its site at www.reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Many brick-and-mortar chains have offered customers the chance
to pay $5 down in exchange for trinkets like ``Titanic'' lapel
pins. ``Pre-sales were the highest for any title we've ever had and
exceeded our expectations,'' said Best Buy's Laurie Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, which received high marks for its handling of the
theatrical release, launched the video campaign in mid-August.
Shipments to retailers included warnings that the studio would
clamp down on anyone selling before 12:01 a.m.. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having to be very adamant about people not selling the
tape early,'' said Paramount spokeswoman Dorrit Ragosine. To that
end, Paramount has set up a toll-free phone line for rival
retailers to report violations and will punish offenders by
delaying future orders.
</P>
<P>
   The double-cassette version of the 193-minute movie comes just
as the film is crossing the $600 million mark in domestic
theatrical grosses. That's nearly $140 million more than the
nearest rival _ ``Star Wars,'' which generated $450 million in its
two releases. Even after 36 weeks, ``Titanic'' was still able to
gross more than half a million dollars at 570 theaters last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Video sales should reach equally uncharted waters, according to
analysts. Most expect it to easily top the current live-action
record holders: ``Independence Day'' and ``Jurassic Park,'' both
with 17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's well short of The Walt Disney Co.'s top four hits
_ 30 million copies of ``The Lion King,'' 25.5 million for ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' 24 million for ``Aladdin'' and 22
million for ``Beauty and the Beast.'' Disney's heavyweights became
breakout successes due to the studio's ability to target parents of
young children wanting to watch the animated stories over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 20 million for `Titanic' seems like a reasonable
number,'' said Tom Adams, president of Adams Media Research. ``But
it's not going to do `Lion King' numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes hitting the 20-million mark impressive is that the
most likely buyers _ the teen-age girls and young women who
generated most of the repeat business for ``Titanic'' _ are not
traditionally heavy buyers of videos. ``This is an opportunity for
the industry to expand their customer base,'' McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' should also help the home video business wipe out
the memory of an anemic 1997, when it posted its first year-to-year
decline with domestic revenues falling 6.5 percent. Analysts
believe both rentals and video sales will post single-digit upturns
this year, due in no small part to the ``Titanic'' effect.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox, which sold off part of its ``Titanic'' rights
to Paramount for a $65 million investment, will start selling the
video in foreign markets on Sept. 30; those sales could amount to
another 10 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of videotapes are impressive: Titles costing $4
each to duplicate are sold to wholesalers for $12. That means
Paramount and Fox stand to take in another $200 million in profits
_ not revenues _ to add to the $400 million in profits the studios
have already banked from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing turnaround from last summer, when ``Titanic''
wasn't just a movie about a 1912 disaster; it was also a financial
disaster. It had been pulled from the summer release schedule and
its $200 million production cost made it appear a certain
money-loser.

WATCHDOGS' BITES CAN CUT DEEPLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The other day at Valley Ranch, Troy Aikman was involved in a
lengthy interview with a guy from The New York Times _ yes, the
very regal New York Times.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But upon spotting one of the local media mutts in the
locker-room hallway, Aikman's mood quickly changed from serious to
jovial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he yelled, ``what about that new picture in the
Star-Telegram, with your arms perched up there real dainty like?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Aikman applied his gig. ``You'd better watch it, or you'll
end up like me. People questioning your sexual preference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times' writer cracked up. I, too, was laughing, but Aikman
enjoyed his own humor the most.
</P>
<P>
   Now he can. There was a time, of course, when that subject
caused the darkest of moments in Aikman's personal and football
life.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a no-longer-around-here member of the local
media turned street rumors into a public forum by going to print
with them in a book.
</P>
<P>
   It is, unfortunately, a seamy side of the sports media business,
locally and nationally. It may be only one of us, it may be many,
but regardless, all are lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the media, and sometimes rightfully so.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire now has been unfairly stung by the scorpion. It
doesn't matter if it's a legal-in-baseball-over-the-counter
substance, his Roger Maris chase has become tainted. And not
because of something called ``andro,'' but how the media had
reacted to McGwire using it.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed here is the popular theory among the jock kingdom that
only the Albert Belles would be treated in such fashion. As opposed
to a Belle, McGwire ranks high in sports on the ``media friendly''
chart. So, for that matter, does Aikman, who during his decade in
Dallas has been accused in print of being everything from gay to
racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Arlington in '72,'' said Rangers' TV announcer Tom
Grieve. ``Some of the same media guys are still here. But like
everywhere else, the role of the media has obviously changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more \Rmedia\S, the competition is more intense,
and everything and every topic is fair game. The days of the media
just reporting on-the-field stuff is certainly gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve has dealt with the local media longer than anyone, first
as a player in the '70s, then as the Rangers' general manager in
the '80s and '90s, and now he's a media member.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a player, it was common to go out to dinner with
sportswriters, have a beer with them, whatever. There was a line
drawn between reporting on baseball and getting personal. But that
line has disappeared in most cases. So many athletes today bring
negative scrutiny upon themselves due to their conduct, but I think
all athletes have had to go on the defensive in dealing with the
media, and rightfully so.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman says while the ``hurtful times were not pleasant, I do
not in any way have a cynical attitude about the profession. I
think most in the media want to deal with us fairly. But you do
have to learn to take the bad with the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've been asked this week about the McGwire story, and
while I don't know a darn thing about andro or steroids, what
McGwire is doing is legal by baseball definition. Therefore, it's
not a discussion to me. I hate to see this happening to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the athletes seem to be more forgiving, or at
least more tolerant, of the media than the fans. Case in point, the
neck slashing incident in Wichita Falls involving Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin remained media-friendly, as long as the questions were
about football. And I still say the best advice Jerry Jones ever
received _ from where, I don't know _ was to issue a long string of
``no comments.'' To this day, at least, no one has publicly accused
Jerry of lying to the media about what happened in the dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Emmitt Smith seems to wants to use the local
media as a motivating force. It sounds like mumbo-jumbo, but
Emmitt's latest stance is accusing the media of ``trying to run me
out of town.'' Then again, if the more he whines the better he
performs, the better story for the media he becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that, however, to some members of the Stars, who only 15
months ago were publicly asking the media for more rip jobs on the
team. No. 1, they wanted us to give hockey the same intense
coverage of other local teams, plus, as Guy Carbonneau said, maybe
a little motivational kick in the butt was needed.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a long way from the current media involvement with
McGwire, or some of the Aikman things in the past. When the sports
media is bad, it tends to be very bad.

RENO DECIDES TO OPEN PRELIMINARY INQUIRY OF FUND-RAISING CALLS BY
GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has decided to take a
second look into whether an independent counsel is needed to
investigate campaign fund-raising calls made by Vice President Al
Gore, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day preliminary inquiry by Justice Department lawyers
will focus on dozens of telephone calls Gore made from his
government office in late 1995 and early 1996 soliciting money for
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Reno ended a similar probe, saying there was not
sufficient evidence to require naming an independent counsel to
conduct a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who faces mounting political pressure from Republicans in
Congress, on Wednesday notified a three-judge court that oversees
independent counsels that she was initiating a second preliminary
inquiry, an indication that there is a specific allegation of
wrongdoing by the vice president needing further examination.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department last week obtained a 1995 White House
memorandum bearing handwritten notes that appear to contradict
Gore's account of his fund-raising telephone calls, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The notes indicate that Gore and several Democratic Party
officials discussed how some of the large, soft-money contributions
being solicited by the vice president would be channeled into
hard-money accounts to directly finance the Clinton-Gore campaign,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The note contradicts Gore's repeated claims that the 45 calls in
question were made to solicit only soft-money contributions for
party building and issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   While raising soft money from federal property is legal, many
experts believe hard-money solicitations are strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten notation by Gore's deputy chief of staff at the
time, David Strauss, was on a memo summarizing a Nov. 20, 1995,
meeting of high-level White House and Democratic National Committee
officials about fund raising. Strauss' note quotes Gore saying
``count me in on the calls'' and later indicates the money raised
would be ``65 percent soft/35 percent hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Gore was interviewed by Justice Department
investigators and asked about the DNC memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president volunteered to be interviewed, and he has
been interviewed twice,'' said his private attorney, James F. Neal.
``I am totally satisfied that Vice President Gore has fully,
completely and honestly answered every question asked of him, and I
am confident that when this investigation is completed, the
Department of Justice will reach the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported late Wednesday that former White
House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes also was questioned about
the memo. Unnamed sources quoted by the AP said Ickes told
investigators that Gore was present at two or three White House
meetings in which so-called hard- and soft-money contributions were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   A report submitted to Reno in mid-July by Charles LaBella,
former head of her campaign finance task force, asserts that Ickes
was at the center of an effort to circumvent campaign-funding
restrictions. Ickes has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years Reno has resisted calls from congressional
Republicans for an independent counsel investigation into alleged
Democratic fund-raising abuses in the 1996 campaign. A House
committee on Aug. 6 cited Reno for contempt of Congress for
refusing to turn over the LaBella memo and correspondence from FBI
Director Louis Freeh, who _ like LaBella _ had recommended
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 90-day preliminary inquiry, Reno can ask for
an additional 60 days to wind up the probe, seek appointment of an
independent counsel or report that her agency found no credible
allegation warranting further inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the panel that cited Reno for
contempt, was not satisfied with the attorney general's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general's action _ or inaction _ today has done
nothing to allay our concerns that something is seriously wrong at
the Justice Department,'' the Indiana Republican said. ``Earlier
this month, the attorney general promised a decision in three
weeks, now she says it will take three more months.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president had not been
notified of Reno's decision. ``At whatever stage this review
process ends, we are confident it will once again conclude that
everything the vice president did was legal and proper,'' Lahane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after word of Reno's decision was sent to the three-judge
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Gore arrived back on the U.S.
mainland after a two-week Hawaiian vacation and headed immediately
to a Democratic fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was the main draw at a cocktail party in a
giant stone mansion overlooking San Francisco Bay to raise money
for a former aide, Machela Alioto, who is running for California
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's schedule also calls for him to attend a fund-raising
luncheon for California Democratic gubernatorial nominee Gray Davis
on Thursday before flying back to Washington.

LIE EXPOSED, A MURDERER IS BACK IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They came for Joseph Yandle on Wednesday, as he had
feared they would: two Massachusetts parole officers to escort him
from his home in Rutland, Vt., back to prison, possibly for life.
</P>
<P>
   His lie had unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   It had been not merely a fib but a whopper. Sentenced to life
without parole for first-degree murder and desperate to be freed,
Yandle had passed himself off to the governor of Massachusetts, the
state pardon board, veterans' groups and national news outlets _
including CBS News' ``60 Minutes,'' which introduced him to the
country _ as a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. In fact, he
did serve during the Vietnam War, but only as a clerk with the
Marines on Okinawa, he has now admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' reported that Yandle had
served two tours in Vietnam as a Marine and ``came home with a
Bronze Star for valor, two Purple Hearts and something else, too: a
heroin habit.''
</P>
<P>
   That Vietnam-acquired habit, Yandle's story went, had led him
into crime, including a string of armed robberies that ultimately
cost the life of a liquor store clerk, Joseph Reppucci, in a 1972
holdup that Yandle helped a partner commit.
</P>
<P>
   With veterans' support, and sympathetic news coverage that
focused largely on how he had been rehabilitated in prison and even
earned both a bachelor's degree and a master's while incarcerated,
Yandle won commutation in 1995 and was freed on the parole that his
sentence had denied him. He had served 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not the only element in the decision to commute
Yandle's sentence, his claim of Vietnam combat clearly influenced
the pardon board and William Weld, then the governor, who made the
final decision. Weld said at the time that Yandle ``went to serve
his country in Vietnam'' and ``returned a scarred man, and he has
served a lengthy prison sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci moved to revoke the
commutation of Yandle's sentence. Cellucci submitted his
recommendation to that effect to the eight-member Governor's
Executive Council, which is to consider it next Wednesday. In the
meantime, Yandle is being held in state prison, because the state
parole board is already considering revocation of his parole, the
board's spokeswoman said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle's fabrication might have held, and he might have kept
living with the wife he had married and the two children he had
fathered on prison furloughs, if not for a Dallas businessman named
B.G. Burkett, also known by the nickname Jug, who had turned up his
lies in the course of writing a book about Vietnam veterans and
impostors.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett took his doubts to ``60 Minutes'' about four months ago,
said Kevin Tedesco, the spokesman for the program. On Monday,
Wallace finally succeeded in interviewing Yandle about the
accusations that he had lied. In a segment broadcast that night on
the ``CBS Evening News,'' Yandle admitted to lying and said he felt
particularly sorry about hurting the real combat veterans who had
earned real medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the people that I most need to apologize to,'' he
said, ``the Vietnam veterans and the people who supported me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yandle, now 49, managed somehow _ he has not publicly specified
how _ to fabricate a convincing set of documents attesting to his
phony wartime record. Both The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald
carried apologies Wednesday from Yandle in interviews. In the
Herald, he said he had made up the Vietnam lie as a way of
protecting himself in prison, and ``it snowballed into something I
could no longer control, as most lies do.'' In the Globe, he
admitted, ``The fact is, I just wanted to go home after 23 years in
prison, and I had no other opportunity of ever getting home.''
</P>
<P>
   But his apologies seem to be having little effect. Cellucci, for
one, has denounced Yandle's lie as ``a massive fraud'' and ``an
insult to veterans who clamored for the commutation and to the
family of the victim.''

MANHATTANITES NOW CALLED LESS FREQUENTLY FOR JURY DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With twice as many people showing up for jury duty in
Manhattan because of recent reforms to the system, residents of the
borough are now being called for jury duty only once every four
years instead of once every two years, New York state's chief judge
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The less-frequent jury service, effective Aug. 1, is the fruit
of a host of changes implemented by Chief Judge Judith Kaye that
have forced more people to heed the call to sit on juries. The
changes, made over the last four years, have eliminated exemptions
from jury duty for 20 professions, allowed for broader lists of
potential jurors, and required stepped-up enforcement against those
who ignore summonses.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the changes, the percentage of Manhattan
residents responding to the summonses has increased to 35 percent
today from roughly 15 percent in 1993, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, court officials have tried to make jury duty more
pleasant, rather than a drawn-out civic nightmare marked by filthy,
overcrowded jury rooms and surly court officials.
</P>
<P>
   With the change in Manhattan, the Bronx remains the only county
in the state where residents are called for jury duty every two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be room for improvement. Erie County, which
Judge Kaye praised as a model, requires jury duty every seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye said her long-term goal was to have all residents of
the state called for jury duty at the most every four years. And
once called, residents should serve as jurors on a single trial or
for a single day if they are not immediately chosen to sit on a
case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials say that people are not only being called less
frequently, but they are also spending less time in the courthouse
once called. These days, Manhattan residents are spending as little
as two days waiting to be selected, as opposed to as long as a week
on average in the past, court officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Julia Vitullo-Martin, director of the Vera Institute of
Justice's Citizens Jury Project, an independent group selected by
Judge Kaye to monitor the implementation of reforms, praised the
initial efforts as a national model. But she cautioned that
improving the system further _ including changing the grand jury
and civil court duties _ could prove more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Kaye has taken care of the major set of complaints,''
Ms. Vitullo-Martin said. ``And now we need phase two.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vitullo-Martin said the project had installed booths in
three courthouses in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn to gather
feedback. She said jurors still complained that they spent hours
waiting before they were assigned to a jury or dismissed. She said
the courts needed to install a computerized system and new
procedures to minimize the time wasted by prospective jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vitullo-Martin also said that some fundamental problems
still needed to be addressed, like overcrowded court buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye agreed that problems remain. ``I'd say we'd come a
good distance, and we have a long way to go,'' she said. ``It's a
huge system.''

   NEW YORK _ For the truly committed, the risk paled next to the
potential high.
</P>
<P>
   While New York City closed all seven of its beaches for swimming
Wednesday because of the huge waves and merciless undertows
generated by Hurricane Bonnie, for the die-hard surfers at Rockaway
Beach in Queens, the red flags signaling the beach's closing were
like a matador's cloth waving in front of a bull.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen surfers were riding the rapture Wednesday
afternoon, with the waves, at 5 feet, double their normal height.
</P>
<P>
   After washing onto shore, Yakira Cordero, 21, of Brooklyn,
called the force that propelled her ``the wave of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, a student at St. John's University, saw the rough surf
as an opportunity, rather than a menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been tracking the storm, waiting for it to get bigger,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane reached land in North Carolina Wednesday with 115
mph winds and closed beaches along the East Coast, as its force
churned the surf, creating strong riptides and dangerous conditions
for swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a job,'' Cordero said. ``Professionals only.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials, concerned about an invisible but potentially
deadly undertow, closed all city beaches for the first time in at
least six years, said Henry Stern, the city's commissioner of parks
and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   One swimmer in the region drowned on Monday and another is
presumed to have drowned after they encountered heavier than usual
currents that were attributed to Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   At Rockaway Beach, Arthur Skotedis, 42, of Astoria, Queens, went
swimming after lifeguards had left the beach and was sucked down by
the undertow. After he was pulled unconscious from the water by two
surfers, rescue workers tried unsuccessfully to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Antonio Mandarino, 23, of Oakland, N.J., was
caught by a riptide and pulled out to sea while wading at Point
Pleasant Beach in New Jersey. He is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that lifeguards and park enforcement patrol officers
were waving surfers in from the water, but would not go into the
ocean after them unless they were in distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask lifeguards to risk their own lives to rescue
surfers looking for the big wave,'' he said, but added that people
who swim or surf at closed beaches may be subject to fines.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said the hurricane will veer out to sea near the
North Carolina-Virginia border and is not expected to hit the New
York region.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, lifeguards at state beaches also had their
hands full because of Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding was so severe at Jones Beach, as well as Robert Moses
and Hither Hills State Parks, that it created large pools in picnic
areas and on the sand, said George Gorman, a spokesman for the New
York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to swim in the ocean, children were swimming in the
pools, Gorman said, and the lifeguards were charged with monitoring
the ``little lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service had heavy surf and small craft
advisories in effect yesterday, but that didn't deter determined
riders of the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero said that earlier in the day, she had been at Long
Beach, on Long Island, where the waves were eight feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to paddle out for about 30 minutes, but I couldn't
make it,'' she said. ``The rip was really strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than give up, she had simply moved to the beach in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to live on the edge a little bit,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading in the rapidly devaluing ruble came to a screeching halt
Wednesday, renewing concerns about Russia's ability to manage $40
billion in ruble-denominated debt, roughly 10 percent of which is
held by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Western investors and banks could face greater losses from
the complex financial instruments known as derivatives. Indeed, the
amount of Russian derivatives at risk for foreign investors may be
sharply higher than that of bonds and loans.
</P>
<P>
   While the lack of public disclosure makes estimates difficult,
some currency traders and emerging-market specialists have set the
value of derivatives at risk in Russia as high as $100 billion.
Many analysts, however, think the figure is probably much lower
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives, among the most innovative and volatile products
born of a new era in computer-generated financial alchemy, have
been a boon to companies trying to limit risks and have also proved
seductive to speculators trying to make a fast buck.
</P>
<P>
   The value of derivatives is pegged to that of underlying assets,
like stocks, bonds and currencies. They are typically used by savvy
financial players to lessen the pain of unforeseen economic shifts,
such as the swift ruble devaluation that has stung so many
investors in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers of ruble-denominated bonds entered into a variety of
derivatives contracts requiring rubles to be exchanged for dollars
or German marks at set rates in the future to cushion tumbles in
the ruble's value, in much the same way as homeowners buy insurance
to protect themselves in case their houses burn down. And the
ruble's drastic drop has already burned a broad range of investors
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston said Wednesday that its profits for
the first six months of the year would be reduced to $500 million,
from $254 million, largely because of heavy losses in Russia. Funds
managed by George Soros, the globe-trotting investor and currency
speculator, lost about $2 billion in Russia in the last year,
according to an announcement his group of funds made on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western investors described the debt restructuring
announced by the Russian government on Tuesday as punitive, but
some were also willing to acknowledge that the losses they suffered
had as much to do with the risky nature of the markets they were
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, all of us made a bet on the ability of the government
to get its fiscal house in order,'' said Andrew Ipkendanz, head of
global emerging markets for Credit Suisse First Boston in Moscow.
``They didn't; we lost money, and so you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear what kind of damage U.S. banks may suffer in
Russia. Large U.S. banks have relatively little exposure in Russia
given their size _ about $7.68 billion, according to Brown Brothers
Harriman &AMP; Co. Derivatives make up part of that amount, but other
undisclosed positions could add to the banks' derivatives worries.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about mounting losses in emerging markets in Eastern
Europe, Asia and Latin America sent the stocks of most major U.S.
banks _ principal players in the derivatives market _ sharply lower
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's shares plunged 4.9 percent, to $92.125; J.P.
Morgan's shares sank 2.43 percent, to $117.9375; BankAmerica's
shares fell 1.9 percent, to $77.625, and Citicorp's stock dropped
1.65 percent, to $133.875. Chase Manhattan, however, edged up 0.2
percent, to $64.25.
</P>
<P>
   Still, trying to determine what is the total value of currency
derivatives in Russia, and who may wind up on the winning and
losing sides of the deals, is a guessing game. Although the global
derivatives market is huge and lucrative, the contracts are
privately negotiated and the value of the deals are not disclosed
on public exchanges like the stock market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Relatively little disclosure about derivatives is required of
U.S. banks, although accounting rules were recently changed to
remedy that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly difficult to quantify, because the disclosure
just isn't there,'' said Elisabeth Jackson-Moore, manager of
Moody's Investors Service's office in Nicosia, Cyprus, who analyzes
Russian banks. ``We're certainly concerned that there could be a
chain reaction because Western investors may have hedged their
position with Russian banks, and Russian banks may have hedged
their positions with other banks, and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting firm
specializing in derivatives, estimates the Russian foreign-exchange
contracts and currency derivatives of one form or another currently
total about $65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ipkendanz of Credit Suisse First Boston said that Russian
central bankers told creditors this week that $10 billion in
currency contracts with Russian banks were maturing by the end of
the year, a figure that does not include contracts with offshore
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   How well these contracts are honored, Ipkendanz added, will be
the ``next chapter'' of Russia's financial saga. When two parties
agree to take opposite sides in a derivatives deal, the prospects
that the loser will pay the winner are only as good as the paper on
which their contract is written and the integrity of the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan was forced to designate $587 million in currency
swaps in Asia as nonperforming earlier this year, largely because
of disputes with Asian counterparts about the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banks are currently operating under the protection of a
90-day debt moratorium. It is unclear what their financial health
will be when the moratorium ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, it's only a 90-day moratorium,'' said Charles
Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York.
``But if the banks are bankrupt at the end of the period, they
won't make good on any of the currency swaps.''
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be the case, Western investors can expect to
swallow further losses in Russia.

FRANCHIONE TAKING CHARGE AT TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Dec. 15, 1997, and Dennis Franchione had just finished
being paraded around as the new TCU football coach in front of the
media, faculty and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Then came his most important meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He stood before 60 or so young men who had just become his new
team. Franchione informed his captive audience that he was now
theirs and they were his.
</P>
<P>
   Then he looked into the dazed eyes of a group still reeling from
a 1-10 season, and started asking questions: Who, in the room,
aspired to win a Western Athletic Conference championship?
</P>
<P>
   Arms shot toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   With his suit coat off, tie loosened and sleeves rolled up,
Franchione followed with the most telling of questions: How many
were willing to work for that title?
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the players responded by raising their arms toward the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to TCU football, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really set the tone for what we had to do,'' said TCU
punter/receiver Royce Huffman. ``Coach Fran is real strict and
stern about what he wants to do and how he's going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of his way or the highway, which is the way it needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs understand and even expect it as they turn to
their new coach to rebuild the confidence left after 2 1/2 losing
seasons under former coach Pat Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   In Franchione they find a man who readily admits, ``I've done
this before, I've rebuilt struggling programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now facing the man who transformed a once
bottom-feeding New Mexico into last season's WAC Mountain Division
champs and Insight.Com Bowl invitees is whether he can fit the
pieces of the TCU football puzzle into a recognizable picture. That
of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can believe in somebody who believes in himself,'' said
senior tailback Basil Mitchell. ``Coach Fran certainly believes in
himself and what he is doing. And he has a proven track record
behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione says the four qualities the Frogs need immediately
are not all that much different than what he found in his previous
programs. There are needs for attention to detail, organization,
discipline and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things that have been missing in every program that
I've taken over,'' said Franchione, who had three winning seasons
at New Mexico and compiled a 33-36 record in six years. ``There may
have been others, but those are the common threads.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaining the belief and trust in the new coach has certainly been
paramount, but now Franchione faces his biggest task _ convincing
the Frogs to believe in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that saw its hopes ripped apart often in the
fourth quarter last season. The team expected to find a way to
lose. The only victory was in the season-finale, when TCU upset SMU
to avert the program's first winless season since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had not only lost faith in Sullivan's system, they
were no longer certain of their own abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying to the team la2D &AMP;E &Cx1f; n &QL; 5atJ

 &HT;    Galarraga suspended for fight
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston, Texas _ To the surprise of no one, the National League
suspended Andres Galarraga on Wednesday. Just as predictably, the
Braves first baseman is going to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   NL president Len Coleman notified Galarraga via fax he would be
suspended three games and fined $1,000 for charging Los Angeles
right-hander Darren Dreifort after being hit by a pitch Saturday.
The suspension is effective today, though Galarraga is free to
continue playing until his appeal can be heard, most probably
during the Braves visit to New York next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the umpires don't know what happened before,'' said
Galarraga, alluding to the Aug. 16 game in L.A. when Dreifort hit
Galarraga a first time. ``It's almost automatic, anytime you fight
_ three games. It's not fair. I shouldn't get a suspension for any
days.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the Braves contention Dreifort threw purposefully at
Galarraga, a charge that is difficult to prove, even though the
first incident included words and gestures between the two players.
Though suspensions are rarely overturned, the Braves are eager for
a day in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait to tell our side of the story,'' said
manager Bobby Cox, who lambasted Dreifort as an ``idiot'' after the
fight. ``It's not we're a team that has a problem with that type of
thing in the last nine years.''

 &HT;    Damage piling up as N.C. takes brunt
 &HT;    By Steve Visser and Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. -- Hurricane Bonnie continued to batter the
North Carolina coast Wednesday night after rumbling ashore at Cape
Fear at the southern end of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The extremely wide storm slowed to a forward crawl of 6 mph,
allowing 115 mph winds to pummel the historic city of Wilmington,
said Cathy Henry, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like stalled,'' she said early in the evening.
``Our coast is being pounded by hurricane-force winds. There won't
be a total on damage for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the best ``guesstimate'' Wednesday was that the storm
would lay siege to North Carolina for 36 hours. ``But Bonnie has
been an unpredictable storm,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the massive
storm did a lot of damage in Brunswick County, especially along
Holden Beach and Caswell Beach. Winds ripped a roof off
Columbia-Brunswick Hospital, caused extensive flooding and knocked
down trees.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane had wiped out electricity to more than 200,000
homes in North Carolina and 80,000 more in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Five people took refuge from the brunt of the storm in a
historic Bald Head Island lighthouse. They went back to their homes
later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilmington, wind gusts bent trees sideways, and torrential
rain came in stinging, horizontal sheets. A salt spray smell hung
in the air. Broken tree limbs and downed power lines littered some
areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane _ the third to hit Wilmington in two years _
surged ashore Wednesday afternoon at the Cape Fear River.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was expected to continue pushing slowly northward
through North Carolina throughout Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Gillikin was waiting for Bonnie in its full form in
Beaufort, N.C., and he knew enough about hurricanes to joke that it
helped to have a small brain or a large bottle to ride one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and raised down here, and I've been through a lot
of them, and none have been pleasant,'' he said, weathering Bonnie
out in this town just south of the Cape Lookout National Seashore.
``This one is just going to be long. It's not the meanest one we've
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm followed a similar course to Bertha and Fran,
hurricanes that punished eastern North Carolina in July and
September 1996. Bonnie slowed as it passed near Wilmington,
spurring predictions that the huge storm would hurl sustained winds
and tidal surges throughout today as it plodded northward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just going on forever and forever,'' said Bruce
Williams, New Hanover County's agricultural extension director.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500,000 people were ordered off North Carolina's coastal
islands and out of South Carolina's two northernmost coastal
counties ahead of the storm Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Bertha, I think people are
beginning to pay more attention to hurricane watches and
warnings,'' said Henry, the spokeswoman for the North Carolina
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Three critical-care patients and a mother and her premature baby
at Columbia Brunswick Hospital in Supply were transferred Wednesday
afternoon to Grand Strand Hospital in Myrtle Beach after wind blew
off a section of roof of the Brunswick County hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind got under one corner of the roof and lifted it off,''
Brunswick County spokesman Huey Marshall said. He described the
section of roof as the ''size of a golf cart.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage occurred near the hospital's electrical supply boxes,
so administrators were planning to close the hospital and transfer
patients to other facilities, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid gusts that reached 110 mph, five Bald Head Island residents
left their homes Wednesday and broke into ``Old Baldy,'' a
lighthouse built in 1817. Another 42 people remained on the resort
island at the mouth of the Cape Fear Island, village manager Wade
Horne said.
</P>
<P>
   Horne said there were reports of minimal damage to homes and
some trees down.
</P>
<P>
   One Bald Head homeowner reported to Horne that he planned to
take his dog for a walk when he saw the sun come out during the
passing of the storm's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no major overwash and no infrastructure damage,''
said Horne, who had left Tuesday night. Despite an evacuation order
that required vacationers to leave and urged residents to do so,
Horne said, some residents claimed they were left behind by Bald
Head's boats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain people on the island who would like to
portray that we left them,'' he said. ''We did not intentionally
leave people.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Brunswick County, the storm blew the roof off a
bank on Sunset Beach, and a tidal surge washed over the two-lane
road at Caswell Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Trees fell on several homes in Calabash, a fishing village near
the South Carolina line. Tumbled trees knocked out electricity in
rural areas, although county officials couldn't provide an estimate
of how many residents lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Carteret County officials reported the storm blew away a roughly
60-foot section of Iron Steamer Pier at Pine Knoll Shores, a
community between Atlantic Beach and Emerald Isle.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sheer width of the storm that astounded Gillikin up
in Beaufort, which he said has historically been sheltered by
barrier islands from the brunt of storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of one this big. It's 140 miles from the eye
to the outside of the hurricane,'' he said. ``A 140 miles as the
crow flies is from here to Raleigh on both sides of the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina officials prepared for the worst. Gov. Jim Hunt
had already requested federal disaster relief from President
Clinton and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose Atlanta
office would evaluate the request, Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Power and Light Co. had 2,100 line and service workers
staged in inland cities like Raleigh and Florence, S.C., ready to
go to work once Bonnie did its damage.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Mike Hughes said an additional 600 linemen were
expected to arrive from Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama on
Wednesday. ElectriCities _ a confederation of municipal power
systems in the state _ said it also had crews from Tennessee,
Georgia, Virginia and South Carolina on standby.
</P>
<P>
   Other states were helping out with the basics. Ten truckloads of
ice were on the way from Ohio, 10 truckloads of water were coming
from New York and a convoy of ``comfort stations'' was motoring
from Texas. The comfort stations include ice and water trucks and a
rest room truck.
</P>
<P>
   The state prisons had convicts lined up to help clear roads and
debris, as they did after Bertha and Fran.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several towns and counties near Wilmington were
taking precautions against any looting even before the hurricane
hit. Carolina Beach officials enacted a curfew effective at 10:30
a.m. Wednesday. The curfew prevents anyone except for emergency
personnel from roaming the town. Kure Beach ordered a curfew
effective at 11:30 a.m. A countywide curfew was ordered for Pender
County from 9 p.m. Wednesday until 6 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   While emergency management officials warned the slow storm would
probably dump dumpsters of rain, North Carolina Agricultural
Commissioner Jim Graham said the state was much drier than it was
before Hurricane Fran and the low-water levels should avert some
flooding and associated pollution problems. The coast is the center
for the state's pork industry with nine million hogs, already in a
whirlwind of controversy because of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``As dry as it's been, I don't expect any (animal waste) lagoons
to overflow,'' Graham said. ``Bring the rain on. We can use it. ...
But we don't need it beating us on the head. The good Lord's
shining on us this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said much of the tobacco crop already has been harvested,
but corn, soybeans and cotton are vulnerable because harvesting has
not yet started.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials were more worried about flooding. Richard Moore,
North Carolina's secretary of public safety, expressed concern
about strong winds raising water levels in the northeast sounds by
9 to 11 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about one burst of water, like a tidal
wave,'' he said. ``We're talking about the water being backed up in
our sounds by the winds for as long as the hurricane lingers.''

 &HT;    Danielle loses some of its strengthen
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The angry Atlantic gave Florida more
worries and riptides Wednesday. Hurricane Bonnie stirred seas as it
exited and Hurricane Danielle stirred emotions as it approached.
</P>
<P>
   Waves as high as 8 feet pounded Palm Beach County's shoreline,
chasing swimmers out of the water and surfers into it.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle, a compact storm in a hurry, continued its dash to the
west-northwest but lost strength.
</P>
<P>
   Winds fell from 105 mph to 85, and the National Hurricane Center
expected no strengthening today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are forecasting some weakening during the next 12 to 24
hours, but a gradual strengthening is indicated thereafter,'' said
Lixion Avila, a hurricane specialist at the center. ``It's a very
similar path to Hurricane Bonnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving at a brisk 21 mph, Danielle was expected to stay well
north of the Leeward Island of Anguilla, and forecasters said there
was only a slight chance the eye would pass within 65 miles of the
Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The strong surf generated by Bonnie's passing swept a Lake Worth
woman under the barnacle-covered north jetty at the Boynton Inlet
just before noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An Ocean Inlet Park lifeguard, Brian Daub, 38, of Delray Beach,
and Florida Marine Patrol Officer Ron Simmons helped Rosa San
Miguel onto a buoy, until lifeguard Lt. Brad Cripps came with an
inflatable boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waves pushed her into the jetty and she was stuck in
there,'' Cripps said. ``(Daub) could see her face and he reached in
and grabbed her. If he hadn't been there, she would have been a
goner.''
</P>
<P>
   San Miguel was covered in scrapes from the rocks and pilings but
escaped serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Most beachgoers thought better about venturing into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't that many swimmers,'' said Julia Leo, Palm Beach
County beach patrol spokeswoman. ``They took one look at the surf
and just sunbathed instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Surf was breaking over the jetties at Jupiter Inlet and dozens
of surfers rode waves, but erosion south of the inlet was minor,
said lifeguard Paul Drucker. At nearby Carlin Park, 6-feet waves
were breaking onshore, said lifeguard Dave Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's off the scale,'' Taylor said. ``We recommended swimming
in DuBois Park (inside Jupiter Inlet) for weaker swimmers.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ocean Reef Park on Singer Island, surfers skipped work and
enjoyed the rare 4- to 6-foot swells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the whole week off work,'' said Terence Branch of
Delray Beach. ``This is the biggest it's been in a while. I'm my
own boss, so I make my own hours. I'll just have to make up for it
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bussert, of Juno Beach, had two broken fingers, but went
surfing anyway. ``We've been waiting for this,'' he said. ``Waves
like this only come once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nahed drove from Miami to surf at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waves here are bigger. It's crazy,'' he said. ``It just
keeps getting better. When I heard about the hurricane, I was
hoping it would bring waves down south, too.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4:15 p.m. in the Boynton Inlet, a small boat capsized in
the strong current and two people were thrown into the water. A
patrol boat pulled them out and neither required medical attention,
said Joe Peloquin, safety supervisor for the six beaches in south
county.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a real good swimming day,'' Peloquin said. ``Most of
the people at the beach were staying out of the water. For
conditions like this, people were respecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach lifeguards made no rescues, though two young women
from Italy said they felt themselves being pulled into a rip
current and quickly swam clear, lifeguard Lt. Eric Feld said. ``A
lot of educated people (were) making sure they talked with the
lifeguards and swam near lifeguards,'' Feld said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tropical wave near Cuba that forecasters thought
might develop into a depression faded as a threat but could still
bring some rain today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got caught between Danielle and Bonnie and couldn't get its
act together,'' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters called for cloudy skies today with a 30 percent
chance of rain and a high in the low 90s. The wind should diminish
to 10 mph and continue from the northeast, helping to reduce
humidity. The weekend forecast calls for scattered showers and
cloudy skies.

 &HT;    Compton loss has no effect on stature
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rochester, N.Y. _ Erik Compton's abilities to inspire were
evident early in his U.S. Amateur experience. On Tuesday, during
the second round of qualifying, Compton was followed faithfully by
14-year-old Daniel Gilbert, a Rochester ninth-grader who has
undergone two heart surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   For Compton, 18, who for six years has carried the transplanted
heart of a donor under an 8-inch scar on his chest, they will go
down as his most heartwarming moments of what become a shattered
week on Wednesday. After qualifying play concluded Tuesday night,
Gilbert and his family entertained Erik and his parents, Eli and
Peter, with a barbecue dinner at their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if he could do it, so could I,'' said Daniel, who
read a newspaper article about Compton and eagerly awaited his
arrival at Oak Hill Country Club as his host in golf's showcase
amateur event. ``That's when he became my motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he followed every shot,'' said Compton, who will play
at the University of Georgia this fall. ``It was nice. I don't mind
talking about (the transplant), especially when it inspires people
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Daniel was in the gallery again Wednesday as Compton, who
is from Miami, was upset by Auburn's Jason Dufner in his
first-round match 2 and 1. Shaken and depressed after the defeat,
Compton walked away from the scoring area, his head down. Up walked
little Daniel. Compton emerged briefly from his thoughts, put an
arm around the boy and said, ``Good luck, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton's appearance in the U.S. Amateur is a noteworthy
accomplishment, but it was difficult to convince him Wednesday, as
he reflected on a round that got away. Three-up early, Compton
allowed Dufner to go 1-up by 4-putting the 14th and totally lost
his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted probably worse than anyone could have putted in the
whole world,'' Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Dufner, fully aware of Compton's medical history, the
victory was not without compassion for his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get too caught up in it emotionally,''
Dufner said. ``He's definitely had a rough go compared to everybody
else, but I just had to look at him as a golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, it's all for the best,'' Compton said. ``If I putted
like that the rest of the week, I would never have had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The real chance, of course, came six years ago, when a new,
healthy heart could beat in Compton's chest, thanks to the family
of an anonymous car-accident victim in Tampa. Then 12 years old and
suffering from dilated congestive cardiomyopathy, which weakens and
enlarges the heart, Compton was at the time merely trying to
survive. Now he can lead a relatively normal life with twice-a-day
medication, regular biopsies and blood work. Erik's mother, Eli,
who is of Norwegian descent, doesn't mind that her son's medical
situation has become the reason for media inquiries. She likes to
say, ``He's a good golfer who just happens to have a transplant.''

 &HT;    Kuchar advances with strong round at U.S. Amateur
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ For first-round matches in a title defense, it
was the equivalent of Evander Holyfield flooring his sparring
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Winning his last six holes and one-putting seven times,
defending champion Matt Kuchar, 20, of Georgia Tech defeated Jamie
Broce of Muncie, Ind., 8 and 7 Wednesday at Oak Hill Country Club
in his first-round match at the U.S. Amateur Championship. If
Kuchar's putter remains this hot, the Yellow Jacket junior could be
hanging around all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you putt well, it's really tough on your opponent,''
Kuchar said. ``I played wonderfully today. It was all I could
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Joel Kribel, Kuchar's opponent in the 1997 finals and
a loser to Tiger Woods in the 1996 semifinals, was not so fortunate
Wednesday. After emerging as the qualifying medalist with rounds of
70-66, Kribel was eliminated 2 and 1 by Texas Christian's J.J.
Henry of Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go as far as I have the last couple of years and then have
some high expectations, to happen like this in the first round is
really disappointing,'' Kribel said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, who meets Florida Southern's Matthew Sagilo of
Clearwater, Fla., in the second round today, could face Spain's
Sergio Garcia, the British Amateur champion, in Friday's
quarterfinals. Third-round matches are this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia freshman Erik Compton of Miami, the first heart
transplant recipient to play in the U.S. Amateur, was eliminated in
the first round, 2 and 1, by Auburn's Jason Dufner. Also ousted was
Georgia's No. 1 player, Ryuji Imada, who was beaten by Bob Kearney
of Houston, 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Bryce Molder, of Conway, Ark., the nation's top
collegiate player last year, after being 2-down after 12 holes,
defeated David Miller of Daphne, Ala., 1-up, and today faces Jerry
Courville of Milford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Mauricio Muniz bogeyed the 18th hole, but
prevailed 2 and 1 when his opponent, Brad Hyler of Raleigh
double-bogeyed. Muniz meets Richard Dukelow of Chicago today.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta's Charles Howell of Oklahoma State won his first-round
match against Australia's Cameron Percy, 4 and 2, and today plays
Ryan Lavoie of Pasco, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Andy McLendon of Carrolton won his match against Rich Morris of
El Dorado, Kan., 2 and 1, and today faces Bill Lunde of
Hendersonville, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Jedd McLuen of Colbert, Ga., who shot a second-round 67 to make
match play, advanced with a 1-up, 21-hole victory over Chris
Mundorf of Greensboro, N.C. Wilfredo Morales of Columbus State lost
5 and 4 to Randy Leen of Dayton Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Notes...Storms that hit the course late Tuesday afternoon sent
scores soaring for players caught in the altered conditions.
Roswell's Mark Northey of Georgia was one of the victims, shooting
a 79 after a first-round 68 and failing to qualify for match play.
...Former USGA and PGA Tour official David Eger lost to Andy
Miller, son of Johnny Miller, 3 and 2.

 CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa: dinky shavers.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other Republicans were more reserved in assessing Giuliani than
Kidwell, who seemed to bond with the mayor on some law-enforcement
level. Still, many said that the ``story of New York City'' _ as
they often referred to the re-emergence of the city as a safer,
kinder tourism mecca _ distinguished Giuliani in the parade of
politicians who have recently eaten their share of Iowa corndogs,
asking to be remembered in the months to come: former Vice
President Dan Quayle, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Steve Forbes and
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are but a few.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they said, Giuliani is the one who, the comedian Jay
Leno tells them, cleaned up Times Square. He is the one who dressed
like an old woman on ``Saturday Night Live.'' But when it came to
whether they would actually support him as a presidential
candidate, many demurred _ complimenting his abilities, but
reserving judgment because of the obstacles that an Iowa caucus
presents to a moderate Republican from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Iowa,'' explained David Yepsen, a political reporter
for the Des Moines Register. ``People can be very civil, very
hospitable. They'll hear him out.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending a fundraising event in Milwaukee on Tuesday
night, Giuliani began his Iowa tour in Iowa City, at a fundraising
luncheon for Rep. Jim Leach. More than 100 people paid $25 each to
dine on grilled-chicken salad, admire the American flag
centerpieces at their tables, and hear the mayor regale them with
stories from New York City. He was introduced by the Olympic
wrestler Dan Gable, who told of how his wife had recently visited
New York City, ``and it was as safe as her own house.''
</P>
<P>
   In a part of the country where murder is a titillating rarity,
Giuliani told of reducing the murder rate from 2,000 a year to
under 800, a statistic that had many in the audience shaking their
heads in disbelief. He also told of reducing the city's welfare
rolls, which once hovered at about 1.2 million people _ about a
third of Iowa's population. In a theme that is standard to his
on-the-road speeches, he talked of returning freedom to the city's
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Barker, a retired high school principal, was so moved that
after the speech he made a point of shaking the mayor's hand and
thanking him for rejuvenating New York City, which he considered to
be ``our city as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he would support a Giuliani candidacy,
Barker laughed, took another bite of a chocolate chip cookie, and
delivered what amounted to a general letter of recommendation: ``I
don't know him that well. But he certainly has to be taken
seriously in whatever endeavor he chooses to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani then traveled 20 miles to Cedar Rapids to talk to
law-enforcement officials about fighting crime and, particularly,
drugs. He seized the opportunity to repeat his stand against
methadone, and to criticize the country's drug czar, Barry
McCaffrey, for promoting the use of the drug to stem the habits of
heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   After that speech, Grubbs extended his invitation to the caucus.
He later explained the complicated calculus behind his offer. If
enough candidates run in the caucus, then those against abortion
will split 75 percent of the vote, leaving 25 percent to the
moderates _ like Giuliani. As a result, he could finish second or
third.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Giuliani's aides have informally conducted any number
of calculations. Publicly, Giuliani gave standard statements of
non-committal. ``The people of Iowa are concerned with the same
issues that the people of New York are concerned with,'' he said.
Asked whether he was flattered by being asked so often about his
future plans, he answered, ``It's better than being booed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was 70 miles to Waterloo, for a $50-a-plate fundraising
dinner for former Rep. Jim Ross Lightfoot, who is running for
governor. There Giuliani was alternately referred to as the
country's ``king of mayors'' and the man who had managed to make
even the citizens of New York friendlier.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Giuliani waved off questions about his aspirations,
saying that he would return to Iowa if he were asked to go golfing.
After concluding his speech, he and his aides left the Lightfoot
function for a private flight _ paid for by Iowa Republicans _ back
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But one aide had developed a quantitative analysis of his final
Iowa appearance for the day: six applause breaks and two standing
ovations.

AFTER YEARS OF TRANQUIL AFFLUENCE, BRUNEI NOW HAS TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `f' category)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei _ Beneath a canopy of crystal
chandeliers in a dazzling throne room here earlier this month, a
gentle-looking young prince in a golden tunic was handed a
jewel-encrusted dagger and proclaimed heir to the Islamic Sultanate
of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   Royal succession is a serious business in this secluded,
oil-rich country on the northern coast of Borneo, where Sultan Muda
Hassanal Bolkiah has ruled with absolute authority since Brunei
gained independence from Britain in 1984. And never more so than
now, when the sultan is battling both a bitter family feud and a
free fall in oil prices, which has thrown the fief into a financial
bind.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning of the sultan's eldest son, the 24-year-old Prince
Al-Muhtadee Billah, was a suitably solemn affair _ steeped in six
centuries of Malay tradition that gave it an almost otherworldly
aura.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been praying for this day,'' a young woman said after
the Aug. 10 ceremony as the prince was drawn through the capital in
a gold-and-white chariot. Like most of Brunei's 305,000 people, she
regards the royal family with a reverence verging on awe. Thanks to
the richest oil reserves in Southeast Asia, the sultan has
transformed his country into an enclave of docile affluence.
</P>
<P>
   But the investiture of Prince Billah comes at a time of rising
turmoil in this normally peaceful country, although it is still
relatively unscathed by the Asian economic crisis swirling around
it. The sultan recently stripped his younger brother, Prince Jefri
Bolkiah, of his posts as head of Brunei's state investment agency
and its largest conglomerate, reflecting allegations that the
Prince squandered billions on bad investments and a profligate life
style.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sultan has come under scrutiny for living like Croesus
while a decline in oil prices drains Brunei's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Building a 1,788-room palace with air-conditioned stables and
hiring Michael Jackson to perform at his 50th birthday party was
fine as long as oil sales were pumping nearly $2 billion a year
into Brunei's coffers. But with oil prices down one-third since
January, Brunei has already lost about $400 million, or 20 percent
of its revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant oil producer, Brunei Shell Petroleum, a unit of the
Royal/Dutch Shell Group, is sending home expatriate workers, while
local merchants are feeling the pinch as shoppers flock to
neighboring Malaysia to buy cheaper goods. Analysts say Brunei is
experiencing something new in its well-lubricated history: a
cash-flow squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   That squeeze may force the country to cut back on entitlement
programs that earned it the nickname ``Shellfare state.'' At
$25,200, Brunei's citizens already have the highest per capita
income in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the government still doles out free health care and
education _ not to mention subsidized rent and interest-free loans
for civil servants to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate in our history because we've never had to
prioritize,'' said Deputy Finance Minister Selamat Munap. ``We've
been able to take care of our children, our sick, our elderly.
Perhaps we will have to be more rigorous in our standards for
government spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Selamat delicately avoids mentioning the royal family, which has
taken care of itself best of all. But diplomats here say the sultan
now recognizes that his relatives must curb their lavish ways. The
sultan, they say, is particularly angry with Prince Jefri, who set
off on an epic spending spree in the early 1990s, buying luxury
hotels from Paris and London to New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a dawning appreciation that they were getting ahead
of their earnings,'' said one Western diplomat, who, like almost
everybody here, insisted on anonymity out of fear of offending the
sultan.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the rift in the royal family became clear when
Prince Jefri stayed away from Prince Billah's investiture, the most
important ceremony since the sultan's coronation in 1967. Prince
Jefri, who is in self-imposed exile in the United States, issued a
statement that he could not return to Brunei because ``there is
little I can do to oppose the destructive action of reactionary
forces, which are becoming increasingly entrenched at all levels of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Prince Jefri said Islamic fundamentalists from
Libya and Iran were playing an influential role in Brunei's
government _ a contention that the government dismisses as
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the government starting a global investigation of
the prince, and the prince hurling brickbats in response, Brunei is
being dragged out of its velvet-lined obscurity. Before
independence, it had been a British protectorate. Its origins date
to the 13th century, when a prince from western Borneo became the
first sultan of this lush, heavily wooded land.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Brunei's troubles are rooted in its most
fortunate event: the 1929 discovery of oil off the coast. By 1996,
Brunei was pumping 160,000 barrels a day, mostly for export to
Japan. Oil and natural gas now generate 90 percent of the
government's income.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even to people who could not find his country on a map, the
sultan of Brunei became famous as the richest man in the world. It
is a title he only recently ceded to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
Like that of other oil barons, the sultan's net worth declines as
fast as the price of crude.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated fortune that reached $35 billion in the early
1990s, the royal family has enjoyed life on a grand scale. Prince
Jefri, 44, savored it with particular gusto, buying playthings like
a sleek yacht, an Airbus jet, a Sikorsky helicopter and five-star
hotels such as the Plaza Athenee in Paris, the New York Palace and
the Bel Air in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri's ambitions extended beyond shopping. As finance
minister from 1984 to 1996, he built, among other projects, a giant
amusement park, free to visitors. Prince Jefri pursued his ventures
through a web of private companies and government agencies. Amedeo
Development Corp., a private company owned by the prince, built the
amusement park and other projects in Brunei. Amedeo Crown, a Prince
Jefri-owned company listed in the British island of Jersey,
acquired Asprey, the London jeweler, while Prince Jefri family
trusts own the American hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The Brunei Investment Agency, a government operation that the
prince led as chairman, manages investments and owns more hotels,
including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing what happened at these companies is difficult
because their operations are cloaked in secrecy. The reputed
advisers will not even confirm whether they work for Prince Jefri,
the royal family or the government.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with ties to Prince Jefri said that Amedeo and the
Brunei Investment Agency were both audited by the accounting firm
KPMG Peat Marwick. Citibank is said to be their main adviser. Given
the blurry line between the interests of the royal family and those
of the state, these executives said it would be hard for any
outsider to impose strict financial controls.
</P>
<P>
   In July, reports began to surface of huge, undisclosed losses at
both Amedeo and the Brunei Investment Agency. Financial analysts
said the investment agency's assets might have been pledged to buy
hotels. The losses came as an acute embarrassment to the sultan,
who had offered loans to help his ailing neighbors, Thailand and
Indonesia, only to discover that Brunei could not afford them.
</P>
<P>
   So the sultan abruptly stripped Prince Jefri of his jobs at both
organizations and ordered the government to seize Amedeo's assets
in Brunei. The sultan hired auditors from Arthur Andersen in London
to calculate the losses, which some analysts say could reach
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Selamat, the deputy finance minister, declined to comment on
Amedeo's collapse but acknowledged that ``any major corporate
failure is going to have some impact on the economy of Brunei.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri's financial troubles came after another
embarrassing episode, in which Shannon Marketic, a former Miss
U.S.A., accused him and the sultan of trying to turn her into a sex
slave. The lawsuit is pending, though the sultan has sovereign
immunity and Prince Jefri has immunity as a potential heir to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri would seem to have a bleak future in Brunei. But he
contends that because his overseas properties are owned by separate
companies and trusts, he still owns those assets and intends to
keep them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not seek a fight and prefer to be left alone,'' he said
in a statement. ``I shall, however, vigorously defend my position
and interests of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Prince Jefri, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the government was exaggerating the losses at
Amedeo to discredit the prince and destroy his power base within
the country. The government also recently seized three oil
concessions that gave Prince Jefri a steady stream of income.
</P>
<P>
   Now the prince and his advisers are plotting a strategy to hold
on to the remaining properties. Brunei's investigation has set off
alarm bells in Europe and the United States, and Prince Jefri's
lieutenants have had to reassure employees and suppliers that the
hotels and other properties are not about to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri may be finally tightening his belt, too. At Asprey
Group, the venerable but money-losing luxury-goods company he
bought for $388 million in 1995, the Prince is merging the flagship
Asprey with its sister company, Garrard, and selling off
unprofitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that because we have a principal who is a prince, we
can spend whatever our hearts desire, is not true,'' said Ian Dahl,
the chief executive of Asprey in London. ``We run a very
tightfisted company.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Jefri's adviser said he was being hounded by Islamic
militants, including another of the sultan's brothers, Prince
Mohamed. ``This is a classic power struggle between those who favor
a more conservative, religious approach and those who favor a more
open, tolerant approach,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunei has become more straitlaced in recent years. Alcohol is
no longer served in bars or restaurants. But other facts of life
here may have less to do with religion than money. Several
observers said the sultan's largesse had created a politically
satisfied, even sedated, populace. Even people who live in houses
on stilts in Brunei's 500-year-old water village own satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people feel they've gotten a good deal from the sultan,''
said Rex DeSilva, the editor of the Borneo Bulletin, which calls
itself an independent newspaper even though it is controlled by
Prince Mohamed. ``If a ruler can't be popular with all that, who
can?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sultan's biggest challenge may be economic rather
than political. For years, he has promised to wean Brunei from its
reliance on oil by diversifying its economy. Yet the government's
efforts to become a trade and tourism center have come to naught.
Given that Brunei has about 23 years of oil reserves left, that
problem may fall to the sultan's son.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Prince Billah may help overcome some of Brunei's
current ills. Unlike his playboy uncle, Prince Jefri, or even his
father at a younger age, Prince Billah projects a less frivolous
image. Educated at Oxford, Prince Billah is said to be a sober
young man. His idea of indulgence, according to royal propaganda,
is a game of snooker and the tame saxophone music of Kenny G.

 Sun-Diamond Unit to Pay Fine for Contributions   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A subsidiary of Sun-Diamond Growers pleaded guilty yesterday to
violating federal campaign finance laws and agreed to pay $480,250
in fines.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its plea agreement with the Department of Justice, the
subsidiary, Sun-Land Products of California, acknowledged that in
1992 and 1993 it used stipends paid to outside directors to make
$37,000 of illegal campaign contributions to the Bush-Quayle
presidential campaign and Senator Robert Dole's political action
committee.
</P>
<P>
   To settle two misdemeanor counts, Sun-Land agreed to pay the
maximum $400,000 criminal fine, an $80,000 civil penalty to the
Federal Election Commission and $250 in special assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Land, which produces dried fruits and nuts for Sun-Diamond,
was originally investigated by independent counsel Donald Smaltz as
part of his probe of illegal gratuities by the giant Pleasanton
agricultural co-op and its units to former Secretary of Agriculture
Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   Once Smaltz's staff determined that Sun-Land's $2,500 stipends
to 16 nonmanagement directors benefited politicians other than
Espy, they turned over their findings to the Justice Department. A
federal law prohibits corporations from contributing to federal
election campaigns or directing others to make contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after issuing the stipends, unnamed Sun-Land managers
``suggested'' that the Bush-Quayle '92 Primary Committee receive
contributions. Subsequently, nonmanagement directors and certain
family members gave $16,000 to the Republican presidential
campaign. The following year, $21,000 in stipends similarly were
directed to Dole's Campaign America committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Land said it is ``pleased to have this investigation come to
an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Smaltz has had mixed results in his case
against Sun-Diamond. Two years ago, a jury in the District of
Columbia convicted the co-op of one count of making illegal
gratuities worth $6,000 to Espy, two counts of mail fraud and five
counts of making illegal campaign contributions. But in March, a
federal appeals court threw out the gratuities conviction. Another
conviction against longtime Espy friend and former Sun-Diamond
executive Richard Douglas was overturned, but last month he was
fined $3,100 for lying to the FBI about making illegal gratuities
to Espy.

 AMD's New Chip Can't Catch Intel   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In its race to keep up with Intel, Advanced Micro Devices will
unveil a faster version of its K6-2 chip Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But AMD's 350 megahertz chip already is lagging Intel's 450 MHz
Pentium II processor, which was announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they're making good progress with the K6 and
ramping up the clock speed,'' said Linley Gwennap, editor of
Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ``That's good news
for AMD, but Intel keeps running faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dana Krelle, vice president of marketing for AMD's computer
products group, conceded, ``We are not quite able to match them all
the way up the line, but we're closing the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which is based in Sunnyvale, has been Intel's biggest
thorn, pioneering the chips for personal computers that sell for
under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel of Santa Clara, the world's largest chipmaker, now
concedes that it was late in recognizing the importance of the
low-cost PC and this week unveiled a new version of its inexpensive
Celeron chip.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a lower-priced chip, Intel won't match AMD's prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same performance level, AMD is 25 to 30 percent less
expensive,'' Gwennap said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's 450-MHz Pentium II, for instance, will sell in volume to
PC-makers for $669, while AMD's 350-MHz chip is selling in bulk for
$317 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Krelle said AMD will have a 400-MHz chip out later this year.

 Traditional Pastimes Trump Other Web Games   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Traditional games like hearts, chess, spades, backgammon and bridge
have become more popular among Internet game players than action or
role-playing games, according to the online research firm Jupiter
Communications.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous swing in momentum back toward card
games, parlor games, traditional games and away from the `Dune'
audience that helped build the hype for online gaming,'' said Mark
Mooradian, a director of consumer content research for Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Why the swing? Mooradian said traditional games attract a
wider audience who like the familiar games they grew up with. Also,
some action games suffer from ``time lag'' glitches, which don't
matter when you're playing a slower, problem-solving game like
bridge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no clear statistics showing how many traditional game
players are online, but overall, Jupiter estimates about 3.7
million gamers will be online by the end of this year. That total
is expected to surge to 26.8 million by 2002, although there may be
a swing back toward action games by then as game console-makers
start to offer online services, Mooradian said.
</P>
<P>
   Online game revenues are projected to hit $81 million for 1998,
about double the total last year, and soar to $1.1 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Old-time parlor games like bridge, blackjack and backgammon are
gaining more popularity at online sites like Microsoft's Internet
Gaming Zone, Yahoo Games and Mpath.
</P>
<P>
   For bridge players in particular, setting up a game online can
be easier than bringing partners together in one room. The most
experienced bridge players now practice online to keep sharp for
major tournaments, said David Silber, CEO of the American Contract
Bridge League.
</P>
<P>
   The ACBL, which is the game's major organizing group for North
America, has 165,000 members, but hopes online games will help
bring in new members in a game that has seen flat growth in the
past decade, Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be good news for Matthew Clegg, a University of
California at Berkeley graduate who turned his online bridge
playing software into a $2 million a year business, OKbridge, based
in San Diego. The service, which has about 13,500 members paying an
average $99 per year, has found a niche among champion bridge
players and high-powered executives like Warren Buffett and Bear
Stearns CEO James Cayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bridge Federation estimates there are 1.5 million
people who play bridge competitively,'' Clegg said. ``There's quite
a lot of room for growth within the market of serious bridge
players.''

 The Billionaire Bridge Club   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Sharon Osberg looked like she was settling in for a night with a
good book, not a challenging game of bridge with multibillionaire
Warren Buffett.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But there she was, wrapped in her fuzzy old blue bathrobe and
reclining on her comfy living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter how Osberg looked, because Buffett was 1,600
miles away. His only presence was on Osberg's laptop as his online
bridge alter-ego, ``tbone'' (his favorite food).
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, big one, Warren, an ace,'' Osberg, aka ``sharono,''
said as she rooted on her virtual partner. ``Oh ... that wasn't
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry that I blocked the suit,'' tbone replied in an
electronic message.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical Friday night for Osberg, a vice president of
online financial services for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco and
two-time bridge world champion.
</P>
<P>
   The evening gave a vivid demonstration of why familiar low-tech
games like bridge are now driving the $81 million Internet game
industry: Osberg played with the Nebraska business tycoon without
leaving her home in San Francisco's Forest Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Internet bridge is becoming a preferred training ground for
bridge players who want to keep their sharp edge, Osberg said.
Online players can schedule more games with top-notch competitors
who are in geographically distant places.
</P>
<P>
   With Osberg, 48, bridge is a more than just a hobby. She is a
serious bridge player who took up the game in college. And she
reached the pinnacle of the game as a member of United States teams
that won World Bridge Federation championships in 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Online bridge, which started in the early 1990s, was a natural
for Osberg, whose job involves developing new Internet services for
Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Of course, unlike Osberg, not everybody gets to play the likes
of Warren Buffett or his other bridge buddies like Microsoft chief
executive Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg was introduced to Buffett five years ago by a mutual
friend, Carol Loomis, a business writer for Fortune magazine.
Osberg and Buffett became close friends because they both loved the
age-old card game.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg eventually convinced the technophobic Buffett that he
needed to get a computer for the first time just so he could play
bridge online. Now, she and Buffett hook up about three times a
week via a Web-based service called OKbridge  &LR; (www.okbridge.com) &LR; ,
which members join both to play bridge online and to ``drop by''
and watch as contestants like sharono and tbone compete.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Buffett, who also has played the game since childhood,
has become an Internet bridge junkie, known to play all night until
the stock markets open. In response to a question typed in by
Osberg, tbone said he plays about 12 hours a week online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you asked about quantity rather than quality,'' tbone
wrote back.
</P>
<P>
   For Osberg, online bridge with Buffett has introduced her to the
jet set. In May, for example, Osberg and Buffett were invited to
Gates' palatial mansion in Redmond, Wash. Osberg teamed with former
Washington Post Publisher Katharine Graham against two of the
richest men in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought down the net worth at that table significantly,''
Osberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Buffett just gets a bridge itch and they jump online
to challenge all comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time on a Saturday morning, Warren called because he felt
like playing bridge,'' Osberg said. ``We figured it was a Saturday
morning, we should have an easy game. But we sat down and the
Israeli national team was practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Osberg and Buffett lost. ``We could have done better, but we
held our own. We did OK,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg said Buffett has become a better player since he's gone
online because he learns quickly. They even teamed up for a live
world class tournament and did well enough to get to the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   How's Gates? ``He's got a good feel for the game,'' Osberg said.
``If he put his mind to it, he could be a hell of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, through his company Berkshire Hathaway, also happens to
be the biggest investor in Wells Fargo Bank. But Osberg doesn't
receive any special financial insight from Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren doesn't ask me for my investment advice,'' Osberg
joked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Buffett's game gives a little insight into his investment
strategies. Buffett routinely declines press interviews, but agreed
to answer several questions posed through Osberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach and strategies are very similar in that you
gather all the information you can and then keep adding to that
base of information as things develop,'' Buffett said. ``You do
whatever the probabilities indicate based on the knowledge that you
have at the time, but you are always willing to modify your
behavior or your approach as you get new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``In bridge, you behave in a way that get the best from your
partner. And in business, you behave in the way that gets the best
from your managers and your employees.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his bridge game resembles how he plays the
stock market, Buffett said, ``I don't play the market. I buy
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Osberg added, ``He likes to win.''

 A Software Survivor, Symantec's CEO Says the Thrill Isn't Gone   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When Gordon Eubanks started cranking out PC software way back in
1975, singer Paul Simon ruled the charts with his hit ``Still Crazy
After All These Years.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now 23 years later, as chief executive of Symantec Corp.,
Eubanks still is grinding out anti-virus software and, hopefully,
quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many (computer) people from the '70s or even the
'80s who are still around,'' Eubanks reflected the other day,
citing a tiny club that includes Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, Eubanks didn't invite me to his Cupertino
headquarters to stroll down memory lane. He was flogging Symantec's
new product, a $100 software suite called SystemWorks that includes
a slew of utilities to prevent disk crashes, repair system glitches
and cure viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks is a great source, one of the rare execs who is both
candid and accessible. So of course, I was happy to listen. But as
I sat there thinking this sounded like the software equivalent for
new-formula Metamucil, I wondered: How does Eubanks feel after all
these years on the job?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At 51, he's forced to compete with the likes of 43-year-old
Network Associates chieftain Bill Larson, who has boundless
ambition and a seemingly insatiable appetite for buying smaller
anti-virus and software utilities firms.
</P>
<P>
   So as politely as possible, I asked Eubanks whether the thrill
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He blinked, like he couldn't understand why I'd ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a job like this, you're the steward of something more
important than yourself,'' he said. ``It isn't about making the
most money, it's about creating jobs and creating value for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the '70s and '80s, when many software firms
flopped because they made ``cool'' rather than ``useful'' their
watchword, Eubanks is fanatic about the corny notion of giving good
value.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks insisted that his customer-care formula would repel the
onslaught of Network Associates and other barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can provide customers with a superior value, we're
betting we take more share from our competitors than from
ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Young blood: &LR;  Stephan Schambach is software's latest
wunderkind. At 28, he is chief executive of Intershop
Communications, a San Francisco firm that sells the software used
by companies like Hewlett-Packard and Electronic Arts to run their
electronic-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry of young studs, Schambach has an added
distinction. He and co-founders Wilfried Beeck, 38, and Karsten
Schneider, 34, are natives of what once was East Germany who caught
entrepreneurial fever after the Berlin Wall fell.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in his office overlooking Multimedia Gulch,
Schambach explained how Intershop's e-commerce software was a
byproduct of his first business _ selling and installing PCs in
Jena, in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to phone in orders to his supplier, Schambach got tired
of waiting on hold. A self-described technology freak, Schambach
used a NeXT workstation, Steve Jobs' spectacular hardware failure
of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  But even in failure, NeXT spawned one insanely great thing:
The World Wide Web was developed on NeXT computers, and Schambach
was one of the first to plug in.
</P>
<P>
   So in his spare time, Schambach wrote a program to put his
supplier's 20,000-product inventory into a Web page. He offered to
sell the software to his supplier in 1994. When they refused, he
offered to give it away to save the aggravation of ordering by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   When the supplier again refused, Schambach decided to start
Intershop. In 1996, he got $1 million in seed funding from one of
Germany's two venture capital firms and flew to San Francisco to
locate his new company in the heart of Net country.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he employs 100 people in San Francisco and another 150 or
so in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Intershop went public on the Neuer Markt, Germany's
version of the Nasdaq, where investors valued it at $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schambach smiled as he told me the punch line. About the same
time Intershop was going public, his old supplier, the one that
wouldn't take his software for free, sold itself to a larger firm
for about one-ninth of Intershop's market cap.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, to be young, rich and enjoy such revenge!
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; No exit? &LR;  How does Silicon Valley cook up so many companies
and create so many jobs? Insiders cite three reasons: lots of smart
entrepreneurs, plenty of early stage money to back startups, and a
stock market receptive to new offerings, giving financiers and
execs an ``exit strategy'' _ that is, a way to get rich quick.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries have the brains, and some are developing
Valley-style venture funds. What has been lacking is stock markets
to buy up shares in young firms to create this exit path.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I think the Neuer Markt, which has listed some two
dozen companies and created 4,500 jobs since it opened last spring,
is a story of a German high-tech Renaissance waiting to be told.

 New Robotics Tap the Mind, Help the Heart   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Heart bypass operations that require a deep chest incision could
soon be done with no more than a skin cut.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists unveiled yesterday a new robotic device, developed by
a Peninsula firm, that will allow doctors to perform the complex
operation by slipping a pencil-size instrument through a small cut
and controlling it remotely.
</P>
<P>
   The device &UR;  &LR; was among a host of new robotic technologies,
including artificial muscles and robotic Legos, which SRI
International in Menlo Park showed off yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was part of a promotion for the robotic Legos,
which SRI helped develop. The toy, called Lego Mindstorm, is being
rolled out next week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SRI, a not-for-profit research center spun off by Stanford
University in the 1960s, has been the birthplace of some of Silicon
Valley's most important innovations, including the modem, the mouse
and liquid-crystal display technology.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old center has created technology behind such
wind-ranging products as household laundry detergent,
high-definition television, a medicine for malaria and a
telecommunications system for the hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The institute has been building robots since the 1960s, when a
roomful of computers was needed to operate a single robot costing
millions of dollars. Now, SRI is building sophisticated robots like
a mine-detection robot that can be mass-produced for as little as
$2,500, said S. Venkat Shastri, senior research scientist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Some of the institute's work is independent. Other research
is conducted under contract for government or commercial clients.
In the past few years, the institute has been spinning off
businesses with commercial potential. Total revenues from all
ventures top $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One spin-off, Intuitive Surgical of Mountain View, is working
on a new surgical technique based on technology developed at SRI
that makes it possible for doctors to use minimally invasive
surgery for complex operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't cut you open with this technology,'' said Joel
Jensen, program manager at SRI. ``Instead of making a big incision,
the surgeon just pokes a tubelike instrument between the ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike current instruments, which are hard to manipulate,
so-called telepresence instruments mimic the movements of the
surgeon's hand.
</P>
<P>
   SRI's device looks like a video arcade game. The surgeon sits at
a console, looks at a 3-D image and grasps the control handles.
Watching the screen, the doctor manipulates the surgical
instruments quickly and precisely _ just as in conventional
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Several tests of the new cardiac surgery were performed this
year, and Intuitive Surgical is in the process of applying to the
FDA for approval to market the system commercially.
</P>
<P>
   While Jensen performed mock surgery in one corner of the room,
Roy Kornbluh used electrical impulses to make an artificial
butterfly's wings flap.
</P>
<P>
   Kornbluh, a research engineer, is part of a team making
artificial muscles that work like real ones. Eventually, the
muscles may be used in prosthetic hands and other limbs, but
scientists currently are working with U.S. defense agencies on a
more unusual kind of project: building robotic bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs _ cockroaches, mainly, and some butterflies _ could be
used as tiny spies, infiltrating enemy territory unnoticed,
Kornbluh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to pay attention to a butterfly fluttering
around you? Probably not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs use artificial muscles made from rubber and electrodes
and controlled by a microprocessor. They can carry tiny cameras or
microphones and send data back to military officials, transmitting
information about hostage situations, pictures of buildings,
battlefield terrain or even enemy positions.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs represent the newest generation of robots at SRI.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects include a robot called Magpie being used by Osaka
Gas of Japan to inspect gas lines. The same technology could be
used to inspect sewer lines, Shastri said, acting as ``remote
roto-rooters.''
</P>
<P>
   SRI is also developing robots that look for hidden land mines,
Shastri said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display was a simple robot-building kit developed by
SRI, MIT and Lego that will be mass produced and sold in stores,
starting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Lego Mindstorm, the $200 kit contains all the
equipment _ microprocessor, CD-ROM, 727 Lego pieces, light and
touch sensors and two motors _ needed to build a robot that can
walk across a table, wink, and deal cards. Kids can program the
robot to do other things as well.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists see the kit as a tool for learning and creativity:
Kids learn simple programming and problem-solving and get to put
their ideas into action.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS TESTIFY ABOUT OLD, FAILING EQUIPMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RONKONKOMA, N.Y. _ Even though the government has spent many
millions of dollars to upgrade air traffic control equipment in the
New York area, several controllers and technicians testified
Wednesday that much of the indispensable electronics gear at
airports and control centers in the region is aging and close to
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's being held together with spit and gum,'' said
Henry Brown, a representative of the Professional Airways Systems
Specialists union. Noting that much of the equipment was 35 years
old, he said: ``In some cases we have no spare parts left on the
shelf and have to go shopping at Radio Shack. We need to update and
repair our aging critical systems before any more rubber meets the
runway.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose union has long been at odds with the Federal
Aviation Administration, was among several witnesses who testified
at a public hearing at a Long Island hotel held by Rep. John
Duncan, R-Tenn., chairman of the House Transportation Subcommittee
on Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called at the request of Rep. Michael Forbes, a
Republican whose district encompasses much of eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems each year in New York we are presented with evidence
of something seriously wrong in our skies,'' Forbes said. ``Error
rates are highest in the New York region, and the New York center
that controls all flights entering New York airspace has an error
rate over three times the national average. It's high time the
Federal Aviation Administration responded.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hevelone, the FAA's regional facilities manager, said the
agency was working to reduce the error rate, and he disputed
Brown's contention about the older equipment as a gross
exaggeration. ``We have brought in a lot of new state-of-the-art
equipment, and it's held together with modern materials and
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hevelone said that older equipment was carefully monitored and
that 99.8 percent of it was operational at all times, and backed up
by an adequate supply of redundant equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Brown acknowledged that engineers and
technicians did manage to keep the equipment running 99.8 percent
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to work our people to death to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers said at the hearing that efforts by the
government to train more controllers were falling far short of the
number projected by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Monaghan, a representative of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, which has battled the FAA for two decades,
noted that there had been ``an alarming increase in the number and
severity of operational errors and near midair collisions'' at the
metropolitan area's three major airports over the last two and a
half years.
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been one nonfatal accident, 11 near-collisions
and approximately 22 less serious violations of federal rules, all
due to controller errors, which he attributed to cuts in staff and
lack of qualified replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hatfield, the FAA's New York regional air traffic manager,
told the hearing that the number of controllers working in the New
York region had increased during the last two years from 218 to
340.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that only 235 members of the staff were fully
qualified.

ECONOMIC TURMOIL IN RUSSIA TAKES TOLL IN LATIN AMERICA

 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Russia's effective devaluation of the ruble last
week has sent panic throughout the world's emerging markets, with
the Latin American economies likely to be among those that suffer
the most.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has pummeled the region's markets, caused currencies
throughout the region to drop and forced interest rates so high
that some bankers are urging customers not to borrow. Analysts are
lowering what had been healthy growth estimates for Latin America
for next year and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The market turmoil is being compared to the most painful
financial disasters in memory, including the regional debt crisis
that plunged dozens of Latin countries into recession in 1981 and
took more than a decade to unsnarl.
</P>
<P>
   No one is yet predicting long-term economic disaster on that
scale. In many Latin countries, reforms including the privatization
of state-owned enterprises, the overhaul of banking systems and the
establishment of private pension systems have strengthened local
economic resilience. Barring unforeseen further disasters, analysts
still expect the region to grow this year. Warburg Dillon Read is
predicting regional growth of 2.8 percent in 1998, down from 5.2
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But what may be most frustrating in financial capitals from
Monterrey to Buenos Aires is that today, faraway contingencies like
whether China devalues the yuan or Japan reforms its economy seem
likely to have as much to do with market stability as Latin
America's own beleaguered policy-makers. Indeed, this year's Latin
malaise has come largely from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Mexico's devaluation in 1994, people feared the crisis
would spread to other regions, but it didn't,'' said Gray Newman,
senior Latin American economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``Things
calmed down. The difference between then and now is that today
contagion is alive and with us. The difficulties in Japan and
Russia are moving to Venezuela and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a wave of selloffs since the ruble was devalued,
Mexico's Bolsa index Wednesday fell 3.39 percent, Brazil's Bovespa
index dropped 3.93 percent and Argentina's Merval index was off
2.69 percent. In Venezuela, where last week's worldwide panic has
been felt most acutely, the stock index was off 1.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been fleeing Latin markets for months. The
Venezuelan stock market ha plunged 62.73 percent for the year to a
29-month low. The Mexican Bolsa is down 37.77 percent, and if
losses from the declining peso are taken into account, it is down
48.74 percent for the year. Shares have dropped 36.39 percent in
Brazil this year 41.23 percent in Argentina and 30.76 percent in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's Brady bonds also lost ground Wednesday as
traders, disappointed by the terms of Russia's local debt
restructuring, also unloaded Latin holdings.
</P>
<P>
   What has alarmed many economists is that investors have been
abandoning local currencies and regional markets with little regard
for the strengths of individual economies, tarring all emerging
markets with the same rough brush.
</P>
<P>
   David Malpass, chief international economist at Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co., pointed to similarities between the current panic across Latin
America and the situation in 1981, when high real interest rates in
the United States and plunging worldwide commodities prices sent
the region into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some aspects of the current situation resemble the 1981
crisis, which was a time of impending doom for Latin America,''
Malpass said. ``But there are reasons to be less pessimistic about
the current environment. The U.S. economy is growing today, whereas
in the early 1980s we were in deep recession. And economic policies
in most Latin countries are much better today than they were in
1981.''
</P>
<P>
   One gauge of the current investor fear of Latin investments is
the widening spread between the rates its Brady bonds pay and
equivalent U.S. Treasuries. A Mexican analyst quoted by Reuters
said this week that spreads on emerging market Bradies over
Treasuries until October 1997, when the Asian crisis really began
to be felt internationally, had been about 450 basis points. A
basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. But since
Russia effectively devalued last week, spreads have widened to
1,150 basis points, the equivalent of an additional 7 percentage
points, the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial turmoil has been greatest in Venezuela, where
plunging oil prices have worsened a chronic budget deficit and
raised fears of a currency devaluation. On Friday, as thousands of
Venezuelans sought to exchange bolivars for dollars, the government
said the bolivar would be allowed to trade toward the bottom of the
band set by the central bank to regulate exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a potential assault on its currency, the Venezuelan
government needs to husband its $14 billion in foreign reserves. As
it tries to raise cash to finance its deficit, interest rates have
shot up to more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A volatile Venezuelan presidential campaign, in which one
leading candidate has suggested that the country should stop making
payments on its foreign debt, has also alarmed investors. Some
analysts say the outcome of the December balloting may provide an
early indication of whether the region's economies are headed for
prolonged crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign could come in Brazil, where speculators have begun
a new assault on the real, hoping to force a devaluation. The
government fended off a similar attack last year, and Brazil has
amassed $70 billion in foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian picture, too, is roiled by the uncertainty of
a presidential campaign. Polls suggest that President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso will be re-elected on Oct. 4, which investors
would probably interpret as a national commitment to continued
economic reform.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest casualty among currencies has been the
Mexican peso, which has fallen 21.7 percent this year, to 10.19
American cents.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in the peso has been accompanied by a surge in interest
rates. On Tuesday, the yield on Mexico's benchmark 28-day Treasury
bill surged 516 basis points to 27.16 percent, its highest level in
20 months.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction, the head of the Mexican Banking Association urged
potential borrowers to avoid taking out loans. ``Rates are too
high, so I've told bank customers to wait a few weeks until this
market overreaction dies down,'' Carlos Gomez y Gomez, the
association's president, said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Mexico is being fed partly by the plunge in oil
prices, which have forced cuts in government spending, and by
continued haggling between political parties over accusations of
corruption in a banking scandal. But until last week's panic, some
analysts were still predicting more than 4 percent growth next
year. On Wednesday Merrill Lynch revised its Mexico growth
estimates for 1999 downward to between 3 and 3.2 percent from 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Goodman, chief economist at Santander Investment, said
that even though sound economic policies in some countries appeared
to count for little amid the current panic, they would pay off
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the fear factor right now is resulting in a
selloff across the board, every country has strengths and
weaknesses that will eventually lead investors to distinguish
between countries,'' Goodman said. ``Countries that have embraced
reform and have limited their reliance on foreign capital will have
helped to insulate themselves from the vagaries of international
market sentiment.''

SENSOR DEVICE MAY AID MINIMED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Officials at MiniMed Inc. said say the company
could see an unexpected boost in 1998 sales after the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration granted an expedited review to its blood
glucose sensor.
</P>
<P>
   If review of the device goes smoothly, MiniMed could begin
marketing the sensor on a limited basis as early as this fall, said
President Terrance Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect this product to be approved by the end of this
year and then limited release into commercial channels,'' Gregg
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe sales of the device could add a few hundred
thousand dollars in fourth-quarter revenue, though Gregg would not
comment on projected sales.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Phillip Nalbone at investment bank Volpe Brown Whelan in
San Francisco said within three years the glucose sensor could
generate $30 million in annual sales for MiniMed. ``We think the
medical community will really embrace the idea of continuous
glucose monitoring,'' Nalbone said.
</P>
<P>
   Existing methods for testing a diabetic's blood-sugar level
generally involve pricking a finger with a pin and squeezing out a
drop of blood for testing. In addition to being painful, the method
offers only a snapshot of the glucose level at the moment of the
test.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed's sensor, which is inserted under the skin of the
abdomen and can be worn for up to three days before being replaced,
offers continuous monitoring, offering patient and doctor a clearer
picture of daily blood sugar cycles and allowing for more
aggressive treatment of diabetes, Nalbone said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if a patient's glucose level falls dangerously low, the
sensor will sound an alarm, alerting the person to take a dose of
insulin. MiniMed already markets an external insulin infusion pump
that provides a steady flow of insulin into the bloodstream over
the course of the day.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed shares fell 50 cents Wednesday to close at $58.125.

BONNIE HOWLS ASHORE IN NORTH CAROLINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Bonnie howled ashore near here
Wednesday afternoon and then slowed to a dangerous crawl, raising
fears of severe flooding Thursday as it continued to unleash heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Wednesday, no deaths or serious injuries were
reported from the storm, which carried winds of 115 mph and spawned
tornado watches inland. Power was cut to more than 500,000 people,
roads were flooded and commercial signs and trees were twisted and
flattened. A hospital lost its roof in Brunswick County.
</P>
<P>
   But residents who had stayed behind in lowland and coastal towns
that were nearly emptied by massive evacuations Tuesday were
surprised by the storm's slow, sloppy advance.
</P>
<P>
   The area, no stranger to hurricanes, was raked as recently as
1996 by Hurricane Fran, a smaller storm that crashed ashore,
smashing hundreds of homes and killing several people.
</P>
<P>
   The main threat late Wednesday was slow inundation from hours of
heavy rain as Bonnie languished over the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit land at Cape Fear, slowing from 16 mph to 4 mph
after it landed. Forecasters said it could stay over North Carolina
for more than a day and drop 20 inches of rain before veering out
to sea farther north near Virginia. Tides were expected to reach 11
feet above normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about one burst of water, like a tidal
wave,'' state Public Safety Secretary Richard Moore told The
Associated Press. ``We're talking about the water being backed up
in our sounds by the winds for as long as the hurricane lingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Knight, spokesman for the North Carolina Emergency
Management Services, said the eye of Bonnie passed over Wilmington
at 8 p.m., EDT, and was moving slowly north. But he said much of
the huge storm, which stretched 400 miles wide, remained out at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said 121 shelters had been opened in North Carolina to
absorb some of the thousands of evacuated residents and tourists.
About 11,000 people were in shelters Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some coastal residents ignored evacuation warnings and spent
Wednesday watching their boats rocking in the chop of the
intercoastal waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Cartier stood on the expansive veranda of her
Wrightsville Beach home looking across the water, trying hard not
to think about the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about it,'' she said grimly of the
prospect of damage to her house. ``Besides, what's the point? You
can't control Mother Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other New Hanover County residents, Cartier
had lost electrical power to her home about 2 a.m. Wednesday, but
kept her gas and telephone.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said that at the height of the storm at least
97,000 Carolina Power and Light customers were without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Wednesday, New Hanover County emergency
management officials were expressing cautious optimism that they
had seen the worst of what Bonnie had to offer even though the
``backside'' of the storm was still to pass over the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a storm, a strong storm,'' said Allen O'Neal, New
Hanover County manager. ``It was a little worse than Bertha, but
not nearly as bad as Fran. At this point, though, it looks like we
may be lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bertha also made landfall near here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One official said preliminary reports indicated minor damage
from Bonnie to the county's three, fragile barrier islands _
Wrightsville, Carolina and Kure beaches _ and their structures.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials cautioned that if Bonnie stalled and dumped
rain for several days flooding and erosion would be severe.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Hoffman, with the North Carolina Emergency Management
Services, said low lying areas would be inundated and barrier
islands might be re-sculpted ``When you have a storm this size
behaving the way this one is we have the potential of new inlets
being cut and there is some evidence that this is already
occurring,'' she said, comparing Bonnie to Hurricane Hazel in the
1950s. That hurricane followed a similar slow pattern and caused
storm surges that carved new breaches in the state's barrier
islands.
</P>
<P>
   Relative to other Category 3 hurricanes, however, initial damage
Wednesday from Bonnie was moderate. Officials said the damage would
mount as the storm lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Brunswick Columbia HCA hospital in Brunswick
County lost part of its roof. Thirty-one patients, including a
premature infant born Tuesday night, had to be evacuated to Myrtle
Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   David Wittmer, a ``semi-retired'' construction engineer stood in
his front yard near Wilmington after the winds and rain had
subsided and looked at his neighbors' flooded homes. His house,
which stood on a hill only a few yards higher, was dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quote me on this,'' he said. ``I hate these things
now. After Bertha and Fran, I'm really getting to hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie approached the North Carolina coast Tuesday, officials
in that state, South Carolina and Virginia had ordered the
evacuation of 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   David and Linda Myers and their four children heeded that order
and spent the night at the Topsail Middle School. On Wednesday,
along with nearly 300 others, they sat and waited while Bonnie made
up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably stay here until the weather breaks, whenever
that is,'' David Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials predicted that break might not arrive for 36
hours.

IT'S LADIES FIRST AT U.S. OPEN DRAW
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The women came first at Wednesday's U.S. Open draw:
both a symbolic gesture to honor the 25th anniversary of equal
prize money at this tournament and a clear reflection of the
current appeal and strength of the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   But when the names of the last seeded players had been picked at
the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, the men's draw had,
as usual, produced the more enticing early matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Marcelo Rios, the struggling Chilean who has
played catch with the No. 1 ranking this season, must face Daniel
Vacek in the first round. This is the same Vacek who beat Rios,
6-3, 6-2, on a Cincinnati hardcourt earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Patrick Rafter, the defending men's champion here,
must face Hicham Arazi, the left-handed Moroccan trick-shot artist
who is quite capable of the sublime, the ridiculous and the upset.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski, the hard-serving neo-Briton who lost
to Rafter in last year's final, must play Wayne Ferreira, a former
member of the top 10 who has a 4-3 career edge over him. The No.
12-seeded player, Jonas Bjorkman, the likable Swede, must play
Cedric Pioline, the versatile Frenchman who has reached the
semifinals at every Grand Slam event except the Australian Open.
The No. 15-seeded Alberto Berasategui must face the aging but still
dangerous Thomas Muster in a match that would draw a bigger crowd
on Paris clay than Queens DecoTurf.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it may not take long for several seeded players to
stop germinating at this year's Open, which begins Monday. Pete
Sampras should not be among the early victims. The top-seeded
Sampras, who will attempt to equal Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand
Slam singles titles, drew Marc-Kevin Goellner of Germany in the
first round. The only other seeded American man is No. 8, Andre
Agassi, who has had a fine season and is in the same quarter of the
draw as Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least this year, that hasn't worked out too well for
Sampras,'' said Tom Gullikson, the American Davis Cup captain,
referring to Agassi's 2-1 edge over Sampras in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing success of Sampras and Agassi, American
men's tennis is clearly on the decline. Only nine American men were
accepted directly into the main draw this year. That is the lowest
total in the event's history by a wide margin: The previous low was
13 in 1997, and the high was 74 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   American women appear to be heading in a different direction.
Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport has been the world's best player in
the last month and has a comfortable draw. So does sixth-seeded
Monica Seles, winner of last week's Canadian Open. Fifth-seeded
Venus Williams was a finalist here last year, losing to Martina
Hingis. If Williams has recovered from her chronic knee problems,
she also should have little trouble with her first-round opponent:
Elena Wagner of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis will play a qualifier but could have a greater test in
the second round when she plays either Anke Huber or 1997 French
Open champion Iva Majoli. In past U.S. Opens, third-seeded Jana
Novotna might have been an underdog against Jennifer Capriati in
the first round, but Capriati is still chasing the shadow of her
consistency and on-court success as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The five-time U.S. Open champion Steffi Graf is also searching
for her previous form. Graf skipped last year's Open after knee
surgery and though she is ranked only 38th, she is seeded eighth
here. She has not lost a singles match at Flushing Meadows since
the 1994 final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. But Graf has a
potentially testing first-round encounter with Corina Morariu, 20,
a promising American left-hander.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-serving U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq resigned
Wednesday, charging that the U.N. secretary-general, the Security
Council and the Clinton administration had stymied the inspectors
on ``the doorstep'' of uncovering Iraq's hidden weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector, Scott Ritter, said in his resignation letter that
the failure to push aggressively ahead with the inspections was ``a
surrender to Iraqi leadership'' that made a ``farce'' of the
commission's efforts to prove that Iraq was concealing chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter asserted that the lack of will stemmed from a policy
shift by the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general that
was backed ``at least implicitly by the United States.'' He made
his resignation letter public in an effort to force the United
States and the United Nations to return to a tougher stance.
</P>
<P>
   The administration heatedly denied Ritter's conclusions, saying
it had faithfully backed the inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official insisted that the United States was
``keeping up the pressure on Iraq in ways that really affect him.''
Within the last week, for instance, the United States and its
allies have quietly moved ships into waters near Iraq to keep
President Saddam Hussein from smuggling out oil by sea.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the secretary-general, Kofi Annan, said he
``does nothing at the behest of Iraq.'' Richard Butler, chairman of
the inspection team, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ritter asserted that the administration had
been secretly trying since late last year to find a diplomatic
solution for its confrontation with Saddam and in doing so had
abandoned a policy _ in effect since the end of the Persian Gulf
war in 1991 _ to use sanctions and the threat of military force to
compel the Iraqi leader's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has publicly backed the inspectors, who have
insisted on full and unfettered access to sites in Iraqi suspected
of being used to conceal weapons or the expertise needed to make
them. Twice in the last year the United States has threatened
military action against Iraq for obstructing the inspections, and
in February, U.S. warships were moved within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, U.S. officials acknowledged that the United
States and Britain had privately urged Butler to stop trying to
hold surprise inspections of sites in Baghdad. The officials said
they wanted to avoid an open confrontation with Iraq after Hussein
said he would no longer cooperate with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms
control at all,'' Ritter wrote Wednesday. ``What is being
propagated by the Security Council today is such an illusion, one
which in all good faith I cannot, and will not, be a party to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, joined the
commission in September 1991, soon after its creation, and was
assigned to help the inspectors ferret out whether Iraq was hiding
information and material relating to its programs to build weapons
of mass destruction, and if so, how.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis moved to block many of the inspections led by him and
accused Ritter of being a U.S. intelligence officer, a charge
Washington emphatically denied.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that the ``beginning of a slow death'' for the
inspection team began in earnest last October after Iraq blocked
inspectors and provoked a crisis that led Clinton administration
officials to predict that military action would be necessary if
Iraq did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said administration officials told the inspectors then
that ``there was not enough military power in the region'' to
provoke a confrontation with Iraq, even though the inspectors had
``indisputable proof'' that the effort to hide information relating
to Iraq's weapons programs was ``run by the presidency of Iraq and
protected by the presidential security forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration repeated its assessment in late November, he
said, warning the inspectors again not to conduct more inspections
aimed at revealing how Iraq was concealing the information _ what
Ritter called ``concealment inspections.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ritter said, administration officials told the
inspectors that military action over the Christmas holidays was
``domestically unsustainable,'' meaning it would be politically
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to discuss which administration officials gave
him and the other inspectors this advice.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defuse the crisis in February, Annan and Saddam
signed an agreement establishing new rules for the inspections.
Ritter said that while he and other inspection officials were
deeply worried about the agreement's impact, he decided not to
resign, but rather to test Iraq's willingness to comply with the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He was encouraged, he added, by the fact that the Security
Council warned Iraq of ``severest consequences'' if it blocked the
inspectors _ language that suggested the United States might carry
out military strikes on Iraq if Baghdad reneged on its word.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, in fact, returned to lead a controversial inspection in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, Ritter said, the Clinton administration decided
that it would no longer support intrusive inspections solely for
the purpose of gaining access to sensitive sites, inspections that
Ritter characterized as crucial to the inspectors' mission.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings at the State Department and the Pentagon, he said,
he sensed a lack of support for what he called ``concealment
inspections,'' and felt that such inspections were becoming in the
administration's view a ``political liability'' in the
administration's view.
</P>
<P>
   In July the inspectors received what Ritter called ``two of the
best pieces of intelligence information we've had in a long time''
about Iraqi weapons activities. Ritter declined to disclose the
nature of the information. But he said he advised Butler, the
chairman of the inspection team, that the time had come to act, and
that Butler agreed.
</P>
<P>
   While Ritter refused to discuss the nature or target of the
inspections that he claimed the administration helped stop, he said
they were aimed at one of Saddam Hussein's principal secretaries,
Abed Hamid Mahmud, who he said is responsible for orchestrating
Iraq's effort to conceal information and material, and at the
Special Security Organization, which carries out Mahmud's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said he had gone to London to ask the British government
to supply personnel and material for the inspection. He said Derek
Plumbly, the director of the British Foreign Office's Middle East
command, was enthusiastic about the inspection and agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after consultations with Washington, he added,
Plumbly changed his mind. Ritter accused the administration of what
he called a ``cowardly act,'' namely, putting pressure on the
British not to cooperate with the inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter would not identify the administration officials he says
put pressure on London. On Wednesday night, the administration
heatedly denied that any such pressure had been exerted and
repeated a denial earlier this month that it had softened its
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, said a spokesman for the National Security
Council, ``regrets Ritter's resignation and has the highest regard
for Ritter and his work.'' But the spokesman added, ``Any
suggestion that senior administration officials had conversations
with the Brits about canceling inspections is a total
fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CBS News reported Wednesday night that Ritter is
being investigated by the FBI for reportedly sharing classified
intelligence with Israel. Ritter could not be reached for comment.
But an inspection official, while not confirming such an
investigation, said, ``Scott Ritter is on very firm ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter had even harsher criticism of Annan. In his letter, he
accused Annan of becoming ``a sounding board for Iraqi grievances,
real or imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for the secretary-general, said
Wednesday night that Annan, who is in Ghana, had not yet seen the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Ritter's charges that Annan had become a ``sounding
board'' for Iraqi grievances, Eckhard replied, ``That's really part
of his job description, to listen to the complaints of member
states.''

WATERFRONT SITES FOR SALE, ALL EQUIPPED WITH GENERATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not every day that 88 acres of waterfront
property _ some with spectacular views of Manhattan _ go on sale in
New York City. But there is little chance that luxury apartment
buildings will rise on these sites any time soon; the parcels for
sale include the huge power plants that have supplied New Yorkers
with electricity for decades, and will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison, under pressure from regulators, is
reluctantly selling virtually all of its electric generation
stations in the city. The sale marks the end of an era that began a
century ago, as Thomas A. Edison was perfecting the light bulb and
creating the company that would supply power to almost all New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The properties include landmarks like the Ravenswood generating
station, with its three striped smokestacks, at the foot of the
59th Street Bridge in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who is interested in the properties should become clear
early next year, when Con Ed expects to announce the winning
bidders in an auction that began this month. Con Ed's investment
advisers at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter have sent information to
more than 100 potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   While any billionaire with a yen for power is a theoretical
possibility, the most likely buyers are other power companies,
according to the utility and its regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, neither customers nor passers-by will notice
much difference after the plants change hands. ``The only thing
they'll see that's different is the name on the plants,'' said
Andrew L. Jacob, Con Ed's chief engineer for energy management, who
is running the sale.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer term, the sale should help reduce electric
rates for city consumers and businesses, who pay some of the
highest prices in the country, said Maureen Helmer, chairwoman of
the New York State Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators hope to force electric companies to compete against
one another to generate power the way that long-distance companies
now compete to provide telephone service. Generation costs account
for a third to a half of a customer's electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, customers will be able to choose the generating
company that gives them the best deal. When generating companies
make their money based on how much energy they sell, rather than on
how much money regulators allow them to charge, they will have
incentives to operate more efficiently, Helmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed will continue to distribute electricity to homes and
businesses, and, of course, to send bills. It will buy electricity
from other utilities, generate some through its ownership of the
Indian Point 2 nuclear plant near Buchanan in Westchester County,
and have the ability to generate a relatively small amount at
plants that also generate steam.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all of its generators in the city are on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Ravenswood plant, the generating stations, which
last year supplied 23 percent of the electricity Con Ed sold to
customers, include the giant Astoria plant near the Triborough
Bridge; the Arthur Kill station, whose lone smokestack rises over
western Staten Island near the Fresh Kills landfill, and two gas
turbines located on barges off Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The properties have been divided into three ``bundles,'' each of
which must go to a different buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The plants employ about 700 people, and Con Ed officials say
they hope those workers will be hired by whoever buys the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Con Ed officials nor Helmer of the commission would
speculate on how much money the plants might bring. For accounting
purposes, the company values the generators at about $1.2 billion,
Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, New York State Energy &AMP; Gas announced that
it and a partner had sold a generating station in Pennsylvania for
$1.8 billion, or almost $1,000 for each kilowatt it can generate.
At that rate, Con Ed's plants could fetch more than $5 billion.

IMPENDING BREAKUP GIVES WAC A PECULIAR FEELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is little doubt that defending champion Colorado State
ranks as the preseason marquee team in the Western Athletic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded with veterans and riding a nine-game winning streak
capped by a bowl victory, Sonny Lubick's Rams represent the
league's best early hope for national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Rams' growing popularity is such that their annual
in-state brawl with Colorado has been moved to Denver's Mile High
Stadium to accommodate the expected crowd.
</P>
<P>
   All of which prompted a member of the Colorado media to approach
WAC commissioner Karl Benson recently and remark, ``Well, I guess
we'll see you on Sept. 5.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Benson replied, ``You will if you're in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the third, last, and probably ugliest season in the
brief history of the 16-team WAC. Next June, according to the
announced scenario, eight members _ Colorado State, Wyoming, Air
Force, Brigham Young, Utah, New Mexico, San Diego State and
Nevada-Las Vegas _ will take their ball and form a new league.
</P>
<P>
   So, as far as Benson is concerned, the Rams can trample Michigan
State in their opener (Aug. 29), rise to Mile High glory against
Colorado and cover themselves with national acclaim, and it will
matter little.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, Benson will be in Rice Stadium watching the Owls and
SMU, two members of next year's WAC, of which he will still be
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Those two will be joined by TCU, Tulsa, UT-El Paso, Fresno
State, San Jose State, Hawaii and, possibly, a guest or two to be
named later.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long that configuration will last is anyone's guess _
and everybody has one _ but Benson is certain of one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is going to be an awkward year.''
</P>
<P>
   It began in the spring, when Benson was lying in bed at home,
recuperating from eye surgery, and the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   The voice on the other end was that of Dr. Albert Yates, the
Colorado State president, calling with the remarkable news that the
presidents of eight universities had managed to hold secret talks,
concoct an alliance, and were severing all ties with the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   Given the myriad problems the WAC had _ it was hurriedly
conceived, snubbed by the Bowl Alliance, suffered from logistical
problems and insufficient revenue sources, and had the geographical
cohesiveness of OPEC _ the decision to break it up was not all that
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as New Mexico basketball coach Dave Bliss said last year,
``There's a reason why nobody else has a 16-team league.''
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which it was done, however, left a bad taste in
several mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really shocking,'' said Rice athletic director Bobby
May. ``Whoever choreographed this thing certainly did not have the
league's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it started out with three presidents talking, and
that became five. Pretty soon they had eight, and they just decided
to bolt. It's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU athletic director Jim Copeland has similar thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the eight schools that did this really thought
this thing through before they made their decision,'' he said.
``But it's done now, and there's no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of the meetings this year will be a little
stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the catalyst for the split was a realignment plan that
separated Air Force from traditional rivals Colorado State and
Wyoming, the WAC simply had too many problem areas for survival in
16-team form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew the league was too big,'' said Wyoming AD Lee
Moon, whose son, Lee Jr., was a freshman guard on TCU's basketball
team last year, ``but there was no mechanism for asking people to
leave. There was no other way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's done, Benson said, a large headache remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job will be to try and wear two hats, represent both
factions for one more year, but it will be difficult,'' he said.
``There are many issues to be resolved, including some legal ones.
One of the most difficult things, probably, is that in the future
we will be competing with the other group for television contracts,
bowl bids, and a number of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said he strongly feels the snub of fifth-ranked BYU by
the Bowl Alliance in '96 was a blow from which the WAC never really
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of revenue was involved, along with a major stake in how
the WAC was perceived nationally,'' he said. ``It was a major blow
to everyone in the league, and I'm sure that a lot of the thought
process that led to this was set in motion then.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the league is struggling to salvage ties to the Holiday and
Cotton bowls, and could be facing a scenario this year where its
champion winds up in the Aloha.
</P>
<P>
   Projections (and rumors) about the future of the remaining WAC
include expansion, or a situation in which the remaining members
scatter to whatever havens are available. At UTEP, abandoned by old
pal New Mexico at the last moment, athletic director Bob Stull is
even talking about a revived Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there are mostly brave smiles. But there has
also been a meeting of the abandoned eight, and some are feeling
life might not be so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   At SMU, where Mike Cavan's football team had a winning season
and challenged for a division title, things are on the upswing.
Football recruiting has picked up, both basketball teams are
strong, alums are flocking back, and a $53 million facilities
upgrade, including a new stadium, is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had a meeting, and I think there was definitely
a sense of solidarity,'' Copeland said of the remaining eight.
``It's a little strange to have teams on our schedule this year
that we're not really in the same league with anymore, but there's
nothing we can do about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a league, we need to look at a lot of things _ bowls, TV,
revenue sharing _ and that process is beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with the situation three years ago, Copeland
said he thinks SMU is both better-positioned, and looking at
different goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we joined the WAC, our supporters were just thankful that
we were in a league,'' Copeland said. ``But there really wasn't
much of a sense of identity with our new partners, and it was hard
to build enthusiasm. And even then, people just weren't real sure
about this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we are definitely working on the commitment that we
have to be in a strong league, whatever that turns out to be. I
think that this time, we will be in a position to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, the school has acquired an
energetic new president, R. Gerald Turner, and Copeland has made
strong hires in football (Cavan) and men's basketball (Mike
Dement). Rhonda Rompola's women's basketball team is a perennial
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our best fund-raising year since the mid-'80s, and we
get the plans for the new stadium Sept. 1,'' Copeland said. ``What
we're going through now ... we have no doubt that we will emerge at
the other end in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of getting from here to there.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rice, Ken Hatfield has put together back-to-back 7-4 seasons,
average attendance has climbed to 35,000, and future schedules
include Texas, Michigan, Nebraska and Oklahoma. Women's basketball
is strong, and Wayne Graham's baseball team is a national power,
playing in four consecutive regionals and reaching the College
World Series two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a little differently than we did when the SWC
folded,'' May said. ``Back then, it was pretty frightening, but
this time we feel that in most respects we're where we want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, realistically the WAC is a moving target right now.
There's a lot of uncertainty, and that may not be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are rapid changes all over the industry these days,
and they occur in a very short time frame. There are likely to be
changes all around us in the next few years _ things popping up
with other leagues _ and you never know what that will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   For the present, May said, things could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an eight-team league, and we have to make it the best
that it can be,'' he said. ``There are some distant destinations
that will put more of a strain on our budget, but that goes with
it. It could also expand to nine schools or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the increased exposure in football and baseball the
last few years has helped us; it has given us a chance to put what
Rice stands for on display, and we have an underdog quality that
people seem to identify with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, about all any of us can do right now is play the cards
we were dealt. It may not be the situation you would have picked
for yourself ... but we didn't have that option.''

   CRISIS IN RUSSIA WORSENS AS COUNTRY ABANDONS RUBLE
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank of Russia said it could no longer afford to
protect the ruble after spending $8.8 billion doing so in the last
two months. With the ruble poised for a free fall, the acting prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, went to Ukraine to try to persuade
the head of the International Monetary Fund not to cut off its next
installment of $4.8 billion in credits.
</P>
<P>
   The market turmoil in Russia, the plunge of the ruble, the
increase in prices and the banking crisis led that country's
financial barons to reassert themselves and install an acting prime
minister who will accede to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Russia has caused turmoil in Latin America. It has
pummeled the region's markets, caused currencies to drop and forced
interest rates so high that some bankers are urging customers not
to borrow. Analysts are lowering what had been healthy growth
estimates for Latin America for next year and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS DECLINE ON PROFIT CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell as the Russian crisis deepened fears that slumping
economies around the world would cut corporate profits. The Dow
Jones industrial average decreased 79.30 points, to 8,523.35. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.66, to 1,084.19, and
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.04, to
1,768.13. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks fell 9.34, or 2.4
percent, to 380.42.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE HALTS THE SALE OF CREDIT DATA
</P>
<P>
   A federal administrative law judge ordered one of the United
States' largest credit bureaus, Trans Union Corp., to stop selling
detailed credit information from consumers to advertisers and
marketers without the consumers' permission. Trans Union said it
would appeal. The company maintains financial records on as many as
200 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MERCK IN ACCORD WITH FTC
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co. and its Merck-Medco Managed Care unit have agreed
with the Federal Trade Commission to bar Medco from discriminating
against drugs made by Merck's competitors or exploiting private
marketing information about other drug makers that Medco receives.
</P>
<P>
   STARWOOD SET TO CHANGE STRUCTURE
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide is expected to announce
Thursday that it will convert to a standard corporate structure.
Starwood recently lost a battle with Congress and the White House
to extend the tax advantages of its corporate structure as a
``paired share'' real-estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ROSE IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   Orders placed with the nation's manufacturers for durable goods
unexpectedly rose 2.4 percent in July as demand for aircraft and
electronics offset a fall in auto orders linked to the General
Motors strikes. Excluding transportation goods, durable goods
orders rose 3 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   HARNISCHFEGER TO CUT 3,100 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Harnischfeger Industries said it would cut about 3,100 jobs, or
20 percent of its work force, because a glut of paper was reducing
demand for its products. The company also reported a quarterly loss
that was wider than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCHERS SHRINK COMPUTER CHIP
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Texas Instruments have invented a computer-chip
manufacturing technology that will allow the company to build the
tiniest transistors ever, with a length of just 0.07 micron _ a
thousandth of the thickness of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   LONG BOND YIELD PLUNGES TO 5.42 PERCENT

 &HT;    Bautista out with ailing knee
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Outfielder Danny Bautista left the team Wednesday and
returned to Atlanta for an MRI on his right knee. Thought at first
to have sustained a mere bruise in a Monday collision with Los
Angeles catcher Tom Prince, subsequent examinations found the knee
to be so loose that trainer Dave Pursley sent him for a
precautionary examination by team orthopedist Joe Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to play (Tuesday) night,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
``He was kind of mad. We're just trying to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bautista, who has made 24 starts in left field in a right-handed
platoon situation with Ryan Klesko, plowed into Prince while trying
to score on a safety squeeze in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be out for a while,'' said Cox. ``His knee is a
little wobbly. I haven't seen the report yet but it never swelled
up. It fooled us a little bit. He could go upstairs and downstairs
but when he turned on it, it bothered him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Bautista require some time on the disabled list, Damon
Hollins appears the first option from Class AAA Richmond. Curtis
Pride has been slowed by a nagging leg injury and the right-handed
hitting Hollins would better fit the needs for the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Attrition
</P>
<P>
   Already down to 24 men after Bautista returned to Atlanta, Cox
found his roster dwindle down to 22 before the Braves got out of
the first inning. Chipper Jones was lost for ``a few games,''
according to Pursley, when he aggravated a muscle pull in his right
rib cage in his first at-bat. Jones first felt the pull during
batting practice but when he put his first ball in play with a
line-out to center, the pain was enough that he barely made it down
the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart had been penciled in at second base, after
resting a sore right hamstring for three games. But after testing
the leg in batting practice, he was pulled and replace by Tony
Graffanino.
</P>
<P>
   Precedent
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga served a three-game suspension last year after
taking on Dennis Cook, then pitching for Florida, after hitting him
in the same game Galarraga struck a 529-foot homer at Pro Player
Stadium. His appeal was denied then. After being suspended again
Wednesday, he does not expect his appeal to be successful this time
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit me many times after I hit a home run,'' said the
Atlanta first baseman. ``Why they won't hit me after I strike
out?''

 &HT;    Duke hopes experience begins to pay off
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Durham, N.C. _ Fred Goldsmith says this is the best football
team he's had at Duke since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bold stuff until you look at his record and you see that
since 1994, when Duke started 7-0 en route to its last bowl
appearance, his teams have won only five games. Yet, the Blue
Devils do have a couple of things going in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   First, they have a dozen four-year juniors and three-year
sophomores playing key roles on this squad. Secondly, although
compiling only a 2-9 mark last season, Duke played eight teams
tough, losing late in the game to Virginia and Clemson and almost
overtaking Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will survive what we've been through the last few years,''
Goldsmith said. ``We've done better than we deserved in recruiting,
and we've gotten some pretty good talent here. I can see
improvement. But how is that going to be reflected against our
opponents? That's the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith also points out that at least one player from every
Duke team for the past 20 seasons has gone on to medical school.
Although that stat won't help on an off-tackle slant, it did help
the Devils sign their starting quarterback _ Spencer Romine.
</P>
<P>
   Romine, from Cullman, Ala., is an excellent student who wants to
become a pediatrician, thus his matriculation at Duke instead of
Georgia Tech, which also recruited him. It's no coincidence that
Romine was the quarterback of record in Duke's two wins last
season. He played in only six games, sitting out the other five
with a hip injury and a severe ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had a lot of very young players, and they were
concentrating on playing instead of winning,'' said Romine, a
redshirt sophomore. ``This year, we've got some experience. I'm
absolutely convinced we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a healthy Romine, Duke has an excellent tailback
in Letavious Wilks and a very good fullback in Dawud Rasheed.
Freidman and Rasheed are the only two senior starters on offense.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver position is also strong, if not deep, with Scottie
Montgomery and Richmond Flowers capable of making first-team
all-ACC. Reco Owens is the only backup receiver with any
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Blue Devils return eight starters, with the
defensive line anchored by Chris Combs, a 6-foot-6, 275-pound
all-conference tackle. Lamar Grant might be one of the better
cornerbacks in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter which way you cut it, Duke is 0-16 in the league
the past two years and 1-23 the past three. The Blue Devils might
not finish in the cellar of the ACC this year, but they won't
finish in the upper half of the conference, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a better understanding of the offense,'' said senior
left guard Lennie Friedman, another pre-med major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our quarterbacks, especially Spencer, have so much confidence,
it has spread throughout the team. You can tell he's making the
calls and checks so much quicker. We played in a lot of close games
last year. The fact that we didn't graduate that many people,
that's going to make a difference.''

 TOMS RIVER LITTLE LEAGUERS DON'T MAKE EXCUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Perhaps it was during the East regional
tournament in Bristol, Conn., that Toms River East manager Mike
Gaynor had a feeling about what his Little League team was capable
of. Gaynor stepped up to the plate with one of the players' bats
during a practice and was jammed by the pitch, fouling it off.
Gaynor started complaining that the bat was too small, and without
hesitation, every member of the Toms River team, in unison, yelled
at Gaynor, ``No excuses, coach!''
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of attitude that has carried Toms River to
a perfect 3-0 record thus far in the 52nd annual Little League
World Series. With a spot in Thursday night's semifinal game
against Greenville, N.C., Toms River is only two victories from
winning the Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't say boo,'' Gaynor said of his players'
attitude. ``They just go out and play baseball. I don't know if
it's their personalities, but they just go out and play ball and
they've been getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because these unflappable 12-year-olds have been too
busy having fun, despite not having spent a lot of time with their
families, in the last three weeks. During the Toms River practice
Wednesday morning on one of the fields outside Howard J. Lamade
Stadium, you would not have thought that they had a big game coming
up. When they were not practicing, the kids were busy trading
stories about pranks they have pulled on one another or teasing
shortstop Todd Frazier about the picture that ran in a newspaper
showing Frazier after his two-run home run Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody grabbed my leg,'' Frazier said, trying to explain his
facial elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids step on the plate and celebrate with their
teammates,'' Gaynor said jokingly to Frazier. ``You step on the
plate and look for the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   But hamming it up for the camera aside, Frazier has proven to be
an important asset to Toms River, hitting two home runs, scoring
seven runs and pitching a complete-game victory in the three games
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our spiritual leader,'' Gaynor said of Frazier. ``He's
the reason I felt we'd have success here because he's an `up' kind
of kid.''
</P>
<P>
   If Frazier is the spiritual leader, then second baseman Joey
Franceschini has to be the unofficial mascot. Standing 4 feet 9
inches and weighing 65 pounds, the 12-year old Franceschini is the
lightest player at this year's World Series. Wearing a jersey that
is too big for him _ or maybe he's too small for it _ Franceschini
bats fourth in the Toms River batting order, a spot usually saved
for kids who weigh at least twice as much as he does. Donna
Franceschini, whose husband, Joe, is a coach for Toms River,
rejoiced in her son and her husband at Wednesday morning's practice
and marveled at the wonder of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected anything like this,'' Donna Franceschini said
of the Toms River team. ``It just shows that size does not matter,
but heart does. And boy, they have heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Between my husband and my kid, it's hard not having
them around. But it's worth it just by being here. We have a
lifetime together, so three weeks is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   With banners lined up on Route 37 in Toms River and Muggsy's,
the local Toms River sports bar, packed for every game this week,
the bandwagon is clearly gaining speed. ''If there's not 500 East
people here tomorrow, I'll be surprised,'' Gaynor said.
</P>
<P>
   As practice ended and the kids headed back to the dorms, catcher
Brad Frank stopped and said to the reporters gathered around the
practice field: ``No more comments, except for Franceschini's
nickname.''
</P>
<P>
   After hesitating for a minute, he said proudly, ``We call him
Teeny-Weeny Fettuccine Franceschini.''

POLICE SAY FORMER FOOTBALL STAR KILLED PREGNANT WIFE
</HEADLINE>

 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Underwood, a standout running back for Wagner College when
it won a Division III national championship in 1987 and a
three-time all-American, has been arrested and charged with
murdering his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Monmouth County, N.J., said Underwood stabbed his
wife, Theresa, who was six months pregnant, at their Aberdeen,
N.J., apartment on Monday night while their two children slept in
another room.
</P>
<P>
   Former teammates and coaches of Underwood, who went on to play
in the Canadian Football League and in Europe, reacted with shock
to the charges Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Terry all my life,'' said Mike Jones, who played
football with Underwood at Matawan (N.J.) High School and at
Wagner. ``We went to church with Theresa. ... We can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's bail was set Wednesday at $350,000, and he remained
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Underwood, 31, called the Aberdeen police at
1:39 a.m. Tuesday and said he had returned home to find Theresa,
30, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Underwood murdered his wife and then tried to
establish an alibi by going to a friend's house to watch a football
game and by talking to a toll collector before returning home.
There were no signs of forced entry, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Underwood died from stab wounds, prosecutors said, and
her body showed signs of blunt trauma. The children, Terry, 5, and
Alexandra, 4, were not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does maintain his innocence,'' said Brian Ansell,
Underwood's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ansell said Underwood worked for an organization called Spur
Services in Orange, N.J. Calls to the group's office were not
answered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Underwood worked as a dental hygienist and taught a
Bible class for children at Calvary Baptist Church in Aberdeen. A
man who answered the telephone at the home of her parents said the
family had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shocked and all just kind of shattered over this
tragedy,'' said Steve Oswalt, the pastor at Cavalry Baptist Church.
``She was a wonderful lady, an extremely devoted mother and a very
sweet spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple began dating as teen-agers at Matawan High.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Underwood still holds school records at Wagner for most rushing
yards in a career (5,010), in a season (1,809) and in a game (363).
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is in Staten Island and has an enrollment of about 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a terrific kid, good work ethic, good sense of humor,
who fit in well,'' said Mark Collins, the head coach at St. Peter's
College, who was an assistant at Wagner when Underwood was there.
``I don't recall a dark side or a bad temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood went to training camp with the Jets but was cut in
August 1989. He played in just two games with the Toronto Argonauts
of the Canadian Football League, rushing 29 times for 135 yards and
1 touchdown. He played in the World Football League in Europe for a
short time and then returned home, where he went to work for
nonprofit organizations that worked with children.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Underwood was somewhat bitter that he never succeeded
in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was having some financial problems,'' Jones said.
``You can't make any money working like that with kids. He had been
making a lot of money when he was playing in Europe, but now he was
living in an apartment with two kids and waiting for a third kid.
It was difficult.''

 &HT;    DeBerg to be evaluated before others considered
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljoh n
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons did not try Wednesday to acquire any players
released by other teams, and general manager Harold Richardson said
team officials have had no discussions with the Cincinnati Bengals
or the agent for quarterback Jeff Blake about acquiring him.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and coach Dan Reeves also said it's very unlike the
Falcons will attempt any such moves any earlier than Saturday, if
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback continues to be the area of greatest concern,
but coaches want to get another look at 44-year-old Steve DeBerg
before doing anything. He'll play the second half Friday night in
the final preseason game against the Bengals in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are unlikely to try to trade for Blake, who has lost
his starting job to Neil O'Donnell, but might be interested if he
is released this weekend, when rosters must be cut from 60 to 53
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals want to renegotiate Blake's contract, which calls
for a salary of $1.95 million this year, and $2.65 million next.
Blake and his agent, Ralph Cindrich, are resigned to the idea of
renegotiating, but while they want to do it for one year, the
Bengals want to do it for two.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is paying quarterback Neil O'Donnell about $5
million, and reserve Paul Justin about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Reeves said it's not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bridge isn't even open,'' he said after a two-hour
practice Wednesday. ``I'll cross it if it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said looking at other players before coaches can
evaluate DeBerg _ and players at other positions for that matter --
would be ``counterproductive.'' He said the only way the Falcons
would go after a player right now is if they were positive the
player would make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Another player released Tuesday who could be of interest to
Atlanta is guard Doug Widell (released by the Packers), brother of
Falcons reserve C/G Dave Widell. The Widell brothers played
together with Denver (and Reeves and Richardson) from '90-92.

   The thing is 53 guys playing as a collective unit, winning
games'
</P>
<P>
   By Matt Winkeljohn(backslash)
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Atlanta Falcons in 1994 after four seasons
with the New York Jets, Terance Mathis has seen his career take
off. During the first four years of his career, Mathis, a Stone
Mountain native and Redan graduate, scored four touchdowns. Since
then, he has caught 320 passes, third in Falcons history behind
Andre Rison's 423 and Jim Mitchell's 359, and scored 33 touchdowns,
fourth in team history behind Rison's 56, Alfred Jenkins' 40, and
Michael Haynes' 34. At 5-feet-10, 185 pounds, Mathis is crafty,
sneaky quick and works hard. He puts in a lot of time off the
field, too. His Terance Loves Children (TLC) Foundation began in
1996, and he helps hand out 1,000 turkeys during the holidays. He
also has ``adopted'' 10 families at Christmas. Seldom at a loss for
words, Mathis sat down with Journal-Constitution Falcons beat
writer Matt Winkeljohn.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Do Atlanta sports fans take the Falcons seriously? Why or
why not?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: When you play in the same city with the Atlanta Braves,
America's team that everybody watches on TBS, cheering for a
hometown football team which hasn't been successful is tough. In
the past, I think (the Falcons were) just a gimmick around here.
You had (former coach) Jerry Glanville and the run-and-shoot. You
had Deion Sanders, Andre Rison, Jeff George _ you had some talented
guys. That's not the thing, though. The thing is 53 guys playing as
a collective unit, winning football games.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What's the biggest mis-impression fans have about NFL
players?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: That we're aggressive, we have tempers, that we're
rowdy. That may be 10 percent of the players around the league.
Fans need to realize that football is what we do; it is not what we
are. When we leave the Georgia Dome, we go home to our families
like any other working man and deal with problems at home,
situations like any other man. I think people need to realize we're
not bigger than life. We're men.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: That said, pro athletes obviously are held up as role
models, chiefly by children. Is that reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: Kids want the money, the fame, the nice car, the
clothes, the big house, the jewelry and all that. What I tell young
people in general is ... once a professional athlete retires, he's
out of the limelight, he's no one's hero anymore. You need to look
in your own homes, churches, neighborhoods, wherever, and find
people you interact with every day (to look upon as role models).
You interact with us on television, radio, billboards; maybe you
get a chance to meet a professional athlete once in your life, so
why would you make that guy your role model? What is he or she
giving back to the community? What kind of impact does this person
have on society besides sports?
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Speaking of the way public figures are held up to different
standards, which camp do you belong to, that Bill Clinton's private
life is his business and not the nation's, or that as president his
private life is a national concern?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: Who are we to judge? We're not God. He has to face his
creator. There's not a perfect person on this Earth. Whatever
president Clinton does on his personal time, that's his personal
time. He has to deal with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What's going to make this team better than last year's?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: What's going to make this team better is believing in
each other. Last year, we were finding ways to point fingers at
someone and say it was his fault or the coaches fault, or the plays
were bad. I think now, whatever play is called, we're determined to
execute it. When the game is close... there's a mentality now that
we're going to win. There's not a panic situation, and I think
that's what's going to take us over the top.

A FIFTIES QUESTION RECONSIDERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., August 30)  
 (JT)  
 By JAMIE DIAMOND    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With jowls, deep lines around her mouth and about
30 extra pounds, Halle Berry doesn't look like the Halle Berry
we've come to know. Still, on this sound stage in February, she
moves regally, like a star, which is exactly what she's playing:
Zola Taylor, the flashy singer for the Platters, at the age of 48.
What's most important about this scene, set in a federal court in
New York in 1986, however, is the fact that Zola Taylor is the
widow of Frankie Lymon, the pop singer who wrote the 1950s doo-wop
hit ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' And she has come to court to
claim a share of his royalties.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem. Two other women are there, and each
says she is Lymon's widow. Apparently divorce was not in the
golden-voiced singer's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Ms. Berry stands off to the side, breathing
deeply, hand over her face, an actor preparing. Then, wearing a
``fat pad'' _ a leotardlike garment with batting at the hips, bust
and stomach _ under a fashionable suit, she takes the witness stand
as Zola Taylor to describe a relationship with the self-destructive
Lymon. ``He was talented and funny and knew how to work that charm
thing on me,'' the character testifies. Her voice is a minute away
from tears. She tells of losing her home because Lymon bought
heroin and entertained other women rather than paying the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   During this emotional testimony, the director Gregory Nava lifts
a pencil up and down as if he's conducting an orchestra. Ms. Berry
finishes, and the crew claps. Nava turns to the actress and asks:
``I think we got it. What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry is so drained she can only nod.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' which opened on
August 28 and also stars Vivica Fox, Lela Rochon and Laranz Tate,
courtroom testimony takes up only a few minutes. But that a legal
battle really happened is the reason the story of Frankie Lymon
finally made it to the screen at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a script based on Lymon's life was written by
Tina Andrews, a soap-opera actress. It was a faithful account of
how this charismatic singer came to have his big hit in 1955 at the
age of 13 _ with a group called the Teen-agers _ and then enjoy a
few more years of stardom. In the 60's, unable to sustain a career
as a soloist, Lymon became a heroin addict, and he died of an
overdose in 1968 at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   That script kicked around Hollywood for years before Ms. Andrews
showed it in 1995 to Rhino Films, a division of Rhino Records,
which had just acquired the rights to Lymon's music. She had the
words, they had the tunes; it should have been a wonderful
marriage. ``But we didn't want it,'' Stephen Nemeth, a co-producer
of the film, says of the original screenplay. ``It was a standard,
linear biopic. He dies of a heroin overdose. No one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the end of it, except for the fact that the
folks at Rhino had seen a television program and then a story in
The Philadelphia Inquirer about a legal fight over Lymon's
royalties _ and the surprising appearance of three Mrs. Lymons. So,
they ordered a transcript of the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was, by far, the most interesting way to tell
the story, with three gals battling it out in court with no prior
knowledge of the others' marriages,'' says Nemeth, who relayed
these thoughts to Ms. Andrews. ``We had a star, a hooker and a
schoolteacher: we couldn't have written better fiction. We got to
tell Frankie's story a la `Rashomon,' and have three tour-de-force
roles for women of color. And unlike a `black film,' which is not
embraced in the foreign market, this one everyone could relate to.
We've all been fools in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Nava is known for making movies that are explicitly steeped in
Hispanic culture (``El Norte,'' ``Mi Familia,'' ``Selena''), but
there was a certain logic, too, in his being chosen to direct ``Why
Do Fools Fall in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did `Selena,' one of the most popular pictures about a rock
singer last year,'' explains Paul Hall, another co-producer, who,
like Ms. Andrews, is black. ``He has heart in terms of his
storytelling, and he can look at the emotions of the culture. Also,
this film is about rock-and-roll, which brought the cultures
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the rock-and-roll connection was as important a factor
in getting the film made as finding a more upbeat framework for the
narrative. ``Without the music, it's just three widows talking
about a junkie,'' says Hall. But the casting of the widows was
crucial. Everybody wanted to play the dazzling singer Zola Taylor,
wife No. 1, and nobody wanted to play the drab schoolteacher Emira
Eagle, wife No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered the role of Emira, but I always play sweet,
innocent girls-next-door,'' says Ms. Berry. ``Or crack heads. I'd
never played a diva, and I wanted to do something a little
saucier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zola role was spoken for, so Ms. Berry made other plans.
Later, things changed; Ms. Berry won the part she wanted and, with
a significant amount of sauce, got to strut around like a diva in
eye-catching outfits, big hair and very high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Ms. Fox, who plays Elizabeth Waters, wife No. 2,
wasn't impressed by the part she was offered either. ``Elizabeth
goes to jail, gets strung out, becomes a prostitute and Frankie
kind of kills her dog,'' she says. ``I didn't think my audience
could handle seeing me like that. I'm coming off the successes of
`Independence Day' and `Soul Food,' and, in a way, I'm America's
little sweetheart.''

SPRINTER REVS UP FOR NEW SPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The question tested Marcus Bivines' memory: ``So
how long have you been playing football?'' He thought for a second
before answering the question with a question: ``How long have we
been in camp?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to both questions is, about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bivines is practically a world-class sprinter but a football
novice. Yet he's also one of the most impressive newcomers in camp
at Cal State Northridge and could realistically become a fixture in
the Matadors' running-back rotation.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer from the University of Oklahoma, Bivines was eighth
in the nation this year in the 55-meter dash, clocking a
6.18-second finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old sophomore has no track record to speak of in
football. He didn't watch it growing up in Midwest City, Okla.,
hasn't played a down at any level, never even stepped onto a
football field until his senior year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a nerd, in fact. I graduated with a 3.9 (GPA),'' Bivines
said. ``I wasn't into sports.... I was more into reading a book or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asthma kept Bivines away from athletics as a youth, but he
overcame the affliction as he grew older. He tried to play football
his senior year, but his lack of experience meant spending the
entire season on the scout team. He ran track for the first time
that spring and earned a partial scholarship to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Bivines clocked a 10.3 in the 100-meter dash and was
part of the nation's fifth-fastest 4x100 relay team. Then Bivines
convinced NFL scouts, who were visiting campus, to let him
participate in their tests. His 4.33-second 40-yard dash was the
fastest time they saw, and they urged him to play football.
</P>
<P>
   With that encouragement, Bivines arranged to transfer to CSUN
and has received scholarships in track and football. Alhough he's
probably third or fourth on the depth chart, he has impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows incredible potential,'' head coach Ron Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   Bivines is the fastest man in camp but is learning how to be a
running back instead of a runner. Still, Ponciano said he'll use
him on kick returns and might even give him a few carries next
Saturday at Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quarterback quandry: No decision has been announced, but it
appears redshirt freshman Marcus Brady has a firm grip on the
starting-quarterback job. The Matadors held their second full-speed
scrimmage of camp Wednesday, and Brady again took the majority of
snaps with the No. 1 offense and again performed well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four quarterbacks competing for the starting job,
junior Josh Fiske holds the edge in experience, but Brady has
played the best. Ponciano plans to name a starter today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his steady play, Brady said he doesn't feel like the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do better,'' he said. ``I'm still making mistakes out
there. I'm just trying to make the least amount of mistakes
possible.'' &UR; !dlim!!end!

 LOS ANGELES: little sweetheart.''

<P>
   She changed her mind, though. And as the floozy, she got to
deliver lines with the most punch.``I got to be the one who wasn't
perfect and pretty all the time,'' says Ms. Fox. ``And it was fun
to play someone really raw. I didn't have to worry about dieting. I
didn't have to eat all those carrots. When you're perfect, people
love to find out what's not right with you. Elizabeth's flaws are
hanging out all over the place, and as a result, you root for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Which still left the troublesome Emira. ``I didn't think I was
right for her at all,'' says Ms. Rochon. ``She's so
goody-two-shoes. But I got together with Gregory and came up with
the story line that she's the one who never got over Frankie. She
buried him. She still wears her wedding ring. And she still loves
him. That gave me higher stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the film is structured around the battle for royalties,
the three actresses have several scenes in which they squabble and
nearly pull one another's hair out. Asked if it is something of a
stereotype to show women fighting, then bonding, Nava bristles.
``When you do a Latino film, or a film of this type, you hear the
word stereotype bandied about,'' the director says. ``But I've
never heard of anyone reading `Hamlet' and saying: `You know what?
This play is going to put forth the stereotype that all white men
from Denmark are indecisive.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the courtroom scene, Tate, who plays Lymon, is
wearing an Army uniform, holding a bouquet and standing in front of
the oldest building in Santa Monica. The building, nestled between
a boarded-up adult theater and a youth hostel, is doubling as an
Atlanta schoolhouse. The scenes filmed here will make up a montage
showing Frankie, well past his glory days, as a traditional suitor,
albeit an AWOL one, falling in love with Emira.
</P>
<P>
   He paces in front of the schoolhouse, waiting for her to emerge,
and eventually she does, wearing a wool jumper and a turtleneck,
covered by a shapeless brown coat.
</P>
<P>
   To capture the look of three different decades, the wardrobe,
hair and props people have been kept busy. ``Back in the 50s, black
people pressed and curled their hair with heated pressing combs and
curling irons, not with chemicals,'' says Ken Walker, the primary
hair stylist. ``So we have a little stove and I can just tell by
the smell of it when it's heated up right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Emira is dressed in brown. The wives have
been color-coded. ``Emira's from the South, the homeland of
African-American culture, so that's the earth,'' explains Nava.
``Her story is about groundedness, so she wears earth-tone colors.
Zola wears bright colors because she's a flamboyant entertainer.
And Elizabeth has no grounding; she's always changing, like water.
So she wears muted water colors, blues and grays.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his earth-tone Army uniform, Tate shyly hands Ms.
Rochon the bouquet. She responds with a little smile, and Frankie
Lymon is another step down the road to polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   So, why did these women _ fools or not _ fall in love with a cad
like Lymon? Nava prefers to talk about the situation's farcical
aspects. ``That comedy and tragedy are two sides of the same coin
is very much the way Latinos see the world,'' he says. ``All our
literature, like `One Hundred Years of Solitude,' for instance, is
funny and tragic. And I like the double-edgedness of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate simply believes that everyone involved, including Lymon,
was human. ``He's not hard to defend, because I don't think he was
a bad person,'' the actor says. ``Do you look at Chris Farley and
say he was a bad person? Was John Belushi a bad person? Frankie
Lymon touched people. He made them feel like dancing and singing
and cheering.''

OWNERS GIVE $2.3 MILLION TO CLONE DOG
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Missy may have a dog's life, but researchers at Texas
A&AMP;M University are hoping to re-create that life several times over
after receiving a $2.3 million donation from her unidentified
owners to clone the pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a joke?'' is one of the first points addressed on the
the Missyplicity Project's Web site, www.missyplicity.com, which
provides information on the cloning effort, coordinated by the Bio
Arts and Research Corp. of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer,'' the Web site says, ``is that we are quite
serious and fully intend to see the project through completion.
Cloning a dog is largely a matter of the right talent _ which we've
assembled _ combined with sufficient time and money _ both of which
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Westhusin, an associate professor of veterinary
physiology and pharmacology at Texas A&AMP;M's College of Veterinary
Medicine in College Station, Texas, heads the project. Westhusin
said the owners were sincere in wanting a copy of their pet, and
realized that the project might not work. But he said his team was
in a ``no-fail'' situation because of what will be learned about
reproduction in dogs, a little-studied subject.
</P>
<P>
   The information could be used in developing animals for use as
rescue dogs or as guide dogs for the blind, and providing data for
new methods of contraception and sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if we had really good birth control methods
for dogs,'' said Westhusin, who will lead about 10 researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The project involves removing genetic material from Missy, which
has already been done, and inserting it into an egg from a donor
dog. The egg is then implanted into a surrogate mother for
gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Missy, a 12-year-old border collie and husky mix, rescued by the
couple from an animal shelter when she was 4 months old, has been
returned home, her work done. But researchers estimate it could be
at least two years before they will see results.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the project got out, the Scottish scientists who last
year cloned Dolly, the sheep, dismissed the idea, saying that ``it
perpetuates the myth that you can re-create an individual through
cloning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioethicists also questioned whether a pet, loved for its
personality, could be cloned with the same success as sheep, which
all seem the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genes are not the whole story when it comes to behavior,''
said Dr. Arthur Caplan, who heads the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``They shape it, but they don't
determine it. A small difference in behavior makes no difference
for a mouse, but it makes all the difference for Fluffy and Fido.''
</P>
<P>
   Westhusin agreed that it would be difficult. ``Pets are going to
be different than farm animals,'' he said, ``but that's what makes
it a challenge.''

 HAROLD EZELL, 61, IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL IN WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Harold Ezell, who as a federal immigration
official supported amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants only
to become a decade later the co-author of a state initiative
denying them public benefits, died on Tuesday at Hoag Memorial
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 61 and lived
in Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   After working as an executive for Wienerschnitzel International,
a hot dog franchise company, Ezell was commissioner for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's western region under
Presidents Reagan and Bush. He supported the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986, which granted legal residency to about 3
million illegal immigrants, more than half of them in California.
</P>
<P>
   In promoting that amnesty offer, Ezell donned a sombrero and
appeared as part of a group called Trio Amnestia, with his deputy
and an Hispanic radio personality called El Tigre. At the same
time, he crusaded to stop illegal immigrants from entering the
United States, organizing night tours to the Mexican border to show
illegal immigrants coming into the country and conducting raids on
factories and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after leaving the immigration agency, Ezell
found a niche as a go-between for foreign millionaires seeking U.S.
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we've done a great job with boat people, and I think
that a few yacht people are not going to hurt America,'' he told
The New York Times in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As California's economy remained in the doldrums into the
mid-1990s and public sentiment against illegal immigration grew,
Ezell helped write Proposition 187, which would have denied public
benefits, including health care and education, to illegal
immigrants. Though the measure was approved by Californians in
1994, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled it unconstitutional and
it has not been enforced, but many of its provisions were embodied
in the federal welfare reform act.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed people should be welcome in this country, but they
should come in in a legal manner, and that illegal activity of any
kind should not be rewarded,'' said State Sen. Dick Mountjoy, a
Republican from suburban Los Angeles who supported Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   But Ezell often raised the ire of immigrant and civil liberties
advocates with comments that critics said made it impossible to
have a dispassionate discussion of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ezell is survived by his wife, Lee; two daughters, Pamela Ezell
of Los Angeles and Sandi Bushnell of New Jersey; his mother, Edna
of Wilmington, Calif., and his brother, Donald, of Wilmington.

DOWN AND OUT ON THE SUNNIER SIDE OF ORWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)  
 (JT)  
 By TY BURR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gordon halted outside a great, garish picture-house. He hated
the pictures, of course, seldom went there even when he could
afford it. Why encourage the art that is destined to replace
literature?''
</P>
<P>
   So wrote George Orwell in his 1936 novel, ``Keep the Aspidistra
Flying,'' but it is not a vignette that makes it into Robert
Bierman's ``The Merry War,'' the new film adapted from the book.
That comically high-minded rebuke hangs over the movie, though, and
over every attempt to bring the work of this gifted, peculiar
writer to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Orwell is unfilmable; there is at least one fine
version of ``Nineteen Eighty-four,'' and the ingratiating ``Merry
War,'' which opened August 28, has the casting advantage of the
marvelously splenetic Richard Grant as the penniless would-be poet
Gordon Comstock and Helena Bonham Carter (not, for once, playing an
Edwardian twig) as his levelheaded girlfriend, Rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Orwell spent his career trying, as he put it
in the essay ``Why I Write,'' ``to make political writing into an
art.'' Whereas commercial movies, at their best, make an art out of
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   This quandary isn't of Orwell's making, needless to say. Any
reader of ``Nineteen Eighty-four'' and of splendid nonfiction
writings like the Spanish Civil War memoir ``Homage to Catalonia''
knows that the former Eric Arthur Blair succeeded at his mission
with hard-won clarity and underappreciated wit. And, in truth,
filmmakers would probably be content to leave Orwell in peace if
his ``Nineteen Eighty-four'' _ Big Brother, newspeak, rats and all
_ didn't take up such a chunk of real estate in the greater pop
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Nineteen Eighty-four,'' published in 1949, is
not a book that shoehorns easily: dense, dyspeptic, reveling in the
awful nuances of totalitarian thought, it is less a novel than a
warning (and more grimly parodic than is generally acknowledged).
None of which has stopped filmmakers from lifting off the love
story that floats uneasily on its surface and plonking it down as a
narrative centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the novel's appearance and three years after
Orwell's death from tuberculosis in 1950 at the age of 46, the
first stab at visualizing the tale appeared on American television,
as a one-hour Studio One presentation starring (are you sitting
down?) Eddie Albert as the fitfully rebellious Outer Party drone,
Winston Smith, and Lorne Green as his avuncular Inner Party
tormenter, O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   At least a British television version produced the next year
pinched a nerve: the BBC was flooded with angry protests,
front-page editorials both condemned and praised the production,
and a motion was introduced (unsuccessfully) in the House of
Commons to prevent a scheduled repeat showing. The irony, of
course, is that Orwell had used the BBC as his model for the
fearsome Ministry of Truth in ``Nineteen Eighty-four.''
</P>
<P>
   Both these teleplays emphasized the doomed, furtive romance
between Winston and Julia, punishable by death in this totalitarian
future. As did a 1956 film version. During its making, the producer
N. Peter Rathvon went so far as to brag that ``the book was a story
of a background _ what we will have on the screen is a love story
against a background of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The casting here was particularly wrongheaded: for the
``smallish, frail'' Winston, Rathvon picked the beefy, bellowing
Edmond O'Brien; for the role of Julia, a heroine with ``thick, dark
hair'' and ``freckled face'' in the novel, blond soignee Jan
Sterling was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   In case distributors weren't keen on an ending that, as in the
book, extinguishes all hope, an alternate wrap-up was provided in
which Winston and Julia die as proud martyrs, shouting ``Down with
Big Brother!'' as the bullets slam home.
</P>
<P>
   Among the appalled was Sonia Orwell, the author's widow and
literary executor. When the rights reverted to her in 1974, she
promptly took the film out of circulation, and years later, when a
Chicago lawyer named Marvin Rosenblum approached her with the
breathless notion to remake ``Nineteen Eighty-four'' in 1984, she
agreed only after certain stipulations were met (one was to avoid
turning the film into a ``Darth Vader Is Watching You'' sci-fi
extravaganza).
</P>
<P>
   That means Michael Radford's resulting film gets a lot right,
especially in the perfect casting of John Hurt as Winston and
Richard Burton, in his last and most subtle performance, as the
soothing torturer O'Brien. Missing, however, is the darkly satiric,
feverishly articulate political awareness that is the great
strength of ``Nineteen Eighty-four.''
</P>
<P>
   And how could it be otherwise? Who expects a movie to screech to
a halt, as the book does, for ``The Theory and Practice of
Oligarchical Collectivism,'' the endless, crystalline dissection of
the new socialist police state put forth by the fictional Emmanuel
Goldstein? It's so much easier to get the characters naked and pump
up the Eurythmics soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, ``Nineteen Eighty-four'' is not the only Orwell
work before ``Aspidistra'' to have reached the screen, and the 1954
animated version of his 1945 book ``Animal Farm'' reflects the Cold
War paranoia of its times. True, Orwell modeled his revolutionary
pigs on the likes of Stalin and Trotsky, but this depressive,
politically reductive Looney Tune is ham-handed to the point of
having the barnyard denizens singing the ``Internationale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Merry War'' takes the opposite tack: it wants to introduce
us to George Orwell, comic novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Written in 1936, just before the Spanish Civil War matured him
as both a man and a writer, ``Keep the Aspidistra Flying'' is
written from the point of view of Comstock, a 30-year-old Londoner
fiercely embracing downward mobility. He has quit his job as an
advertising copywriter to write reasonably awful poetry, work in a
dead-end used bookstore and inveigh against the bourgeoisie, the
potted aspidistras they keep in their front windows and, above all,
money. ``Social failure, artistic failure, sexual failure: they are
all the same. And lack of money is at the bottom of them all,''
rants Gordon (he has just struck out with his girlfriend).
</P>
<P>
   Orwell didn't look kindly on the novel in later years, writing
in 1946: ``There are two or three books which I am ashamed of and
that is one of them. At that time I hadn't a book in me, but I was
half-starved.'' In fact, he was living a life very much like
Gordon's, working in a London bookstore in self-imposed penury. In
effect, ``Aspidistra'' is a goodbye to a younger self, a sort of
therapeutic, literary suicide. Perhaps that's why, for all its
closely observed humor, it's an incredibly dispiriting read. Orwell
limns all the paradoxes of his hero's threadbare world view, but he
can't bring himself to like him; when Rosemary slaps Gordon, you're
tempted to stand in line.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you're not sure to be thankful or concerned that ``The
Merry War'' turns Gordon's vendetta into a sprightly, proto-yuppie
farce.
</P>
<P>
   The film has charms, to be sure, chief among them a performance
of deeply wise pluck from Bonham Carter. But whatever ``The Merry
War'' is (the title comes from a passing reference to Gordon and
Rosemary's combative banter), it isn't dark. Where the London of
``Aspidistra'' is drizzly and grim, the film is pure House of
Merchant-Ivory, sunlit, swank and art-directed to a fare-the-well.
Even Gordon's Lambeth garret looks to have been accessorized by
Pottery Barn (it'd fetch two grand a month at least in
pre-millennial New York).
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon loses his job after a self-destructive bender and is
forced to move to his squalid new lodgings, Orwell shows him biting
into his own decay with defensive rage. ``Life had beaten him; but
you can still beat life by turning away,'' he wrote. ``Down, down
into the ghost-kingdom, the shadowy world where shame, effort,
decency do not exist!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Merry War'' depicts this stage as a lark; Grant's Gordon
finally loosens up and smiles. Indeed, the whole film is a dream of
dropping out, whereas Orwell was renouncing a nightmare. As usual,
Gordon Comstock had it wrong: Judging by what has been wrought out
of his creator's works, film is in no danger of ``replacing
literature'' _ George Orwell's literature, at least _ any time
soon.

JUDGE REJECTS EFFORTS TO BLOCK MILLION YOUTH MARCH IN HARLEM
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge ordered New York City Wednesday to
allow the so-called Million Youth March to take place next week in
Harlem, saying the city's decision to deny marchers a permit was
unconstitutional and based on rules that were ``breathtaking in
their lack of standards.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they would immediately appeal the decision.
But with only nine days remaining before the event, organizers of
the march said they would forge ahead with planning and step up
efforts to recruit young black people from around the country to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The march has been the subject of increasing controversy in
recent weeks, with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denouncing it as a poorly
planned ``hate march'' and the organizers accusing the city of
violating their constitutional rights and vowing to hold the event.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Judge Lewis Kaplan of Federal District Court said
the city's rules for weighing permits for street events were too
broad and its decisions too arbitrary. He also said the alternative
venues the city had proposed _ Randalls Island or Van Cortlandt
Park in the Bronx _ were unacceptable because they were remote and
would ``adversely affect'' the organizers' ability ``to get their
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said that the city had considered the application ``on an
ad-hoc basis'' and that the city was not ``free to impose a ban
like this without a persuasive showing that the event poses a
significant threat'' to governmental interests, like public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers have billed the march, which would actually be a
stationary rally along Malcolm X Boulevard, as a show of unity
among young blacks from across the country, much like the Million
Man March that was held in Washington in 1995. But Giuliani has
repeatedly condemned the event's chief organizer, Khalid Abdul
Muhammad, for making anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks, and has
criticized Muhammad's plans to invite gang members to the march.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and the other organizers sued the city in Federal
District Court last week, saying that discriminatory policies of
the Giuliani administration prompted it to deny their application
for what the organizers called a ``First Amendment Educational
Event.'' But Kaplan's ruling did not address whether the city
rejected the application based on the philosophies of Muhammad, who
was ousted from the Nation of Islam after a 1993 speech in which he
referred to Jews as ``bloodsuckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, based on testimony by police and fire officials, Kaplan
said the city had ``ample ability'' to insure the safety of
participants in the rally, onlookers and residents.
</P>
<P>
   He told the organizers that they would have to abide by whatever
safety provisions the police deemed necessary, like keeping
emergency lanes open on either side of Malcolm X Boulevard. But he
rejected the city's argument that the neighborhood could not
accommodate the thousands of people expected to attend the march,
planned for between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he understood Kaplan's concern about First
Amendment issues and acknowledging the marchers' right to make
their point, Giuliani, who was in Iowa for Republican fund-raisers,
ridiculed the judge's determination that the police could handle
the event safely. ``The judge said he was sure the Police
Department could handle it,'' he said. ``The Police Commissioner
isn't sure, and he knows a little more about the Police Department
than the judge does.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city had tried to convince Kaplan that the march
could not take place over the Labor Day weekend because other major
events, like the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, were already
in the works. Police resources would be too strained, they said. If
hundreds of thousands of people crowded onto Malcolm X Boulevard,
the march could be ``catastrophic,'' said Michael Hess, the city's
corporation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizers, who originally predicted that more than a
million people would attend, told Kaplan that they expected no more
than 175,000. The judge said he thought that even fewer people
would come and that they would ``drift in and out'' of the rally
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Even if more show up, he said, the city has enough police
officers ``to deal with whatever problems of congestion, emergency
action, overcrowding and fire risk may arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has kept a low profile throughout the dispute, allowing
his lawyers and fellow organizers to wage a public battle with the
city. But he was in the courtroom for most of the eight-hour
hearing Wednesday.

ASBESTOS PROBLEM PUTS 400,000 IMMIGRATION FILES OUT OF REACH

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Annie Ceballos struggled as she searched for the
right English words to describe her yearlong problem in getting
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to act on the
residency application of her 18-year-old son, who is back home in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but there is something poison inside the INS,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best of times, the immigration service is plagued
with delays. But since April, about 400,000 files have been out of
the reach of agency employees because they are in a 16th-floor
records room here that became contaminated with asbestos after
water leaked through ceiling tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Quarantillo, the district director for the INS office
here, confirmed the ``unique situation,'' saying that many of the
agency's most significant functions could not be performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals will be disadvantaged because of this problem and
will have to wait a little longer than usual,'' she said. ``Every
one of those 400,000 files is someone's life, and we know it is
hurting people that we can't get to them. But at the same time, we
can't deport someone without those files, either.''
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be November before the agency finally begins to
clean up the asbestos. In the meantime, Ms. Quarantillo said, the
agency will create a priority list that will allow cleanup workers
to retrieve, clean off and forward to immigration officials the
files of those who have been waiting the longest for action on
their cases.
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos contamination has not been a secret, immigration
lawyers and advocacy groups say. Notices have been put up at the
building that somewhat euphemistically refer to ``an environmental
problem'' that is causing some delays. But most people were never
told that their records were temporarily adrift in a sea of
asbestos contamination and out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mrs. Ceballos, a night clerk at the Federal
Express depot at Newark International Airport, and her husband, a
mechanic for a garage in Roselle Park, N.J., have not seen their
son Rodrigo for two years. Almost weekly, relatives have taken him
to the U.S. Embassy in Santiago for an immigration interview, but
each time the consular officers have told them that the INS records
detailing his parents' legal status as permanent residents with
green cards and jobs have not arrived.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, the General Services Administration, which manages
federal offices, has known about the asbestos insulation in the
ceiling of the top floor of the 36-year-old building. As long as it
was contained, it presented no health hazard. But last spring, Ms.
Quarantillo said, rain damaged the building's flat roof, causing
leaks that loosened ceiling tiles and breached the containment.
</P>
<P>
   The problems surfaced in March, but no asbestos contamination
was found at first. A month later, however, contamination was found
in Ms. Quarantillo's office and the offices of other staff members.
At the time, the problem did not involve the records room, but it
was placed off limits as a precaution. Environmental Protection
Agency inspections of the floor found, however, that a more
extensive cleanup was needed, especially in the records room.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the cleanup agency's regional
office, said that the agency would generally require cleanup by a
company certified to handle asbestos. Asbestos is carefully
monitored because its fibers, once embedded in human lungs, can
cause respiratory problems, including lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has to contract out for the cleanup _ a process that
will not be completed until 30 days from now. Then, Ms. Quarantillo
said, the employees of the cleanup company must go through a
background check before they are allowed near the confidential
records.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quarantillo said that while she sympathized with those in
Mrs. Ceballos' position, there was little she could do short of
jeopardizing the health of workers in the service's sixth-largest
office.

   DEL RIO, Texas _ While residents here struggled Wednesday to
clear the mud and debris from flash flooding and President Clinton
to declare its county a federal disaster area, the balloon of water
that caused the trouble was rolling down the Rio Grande through
Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande, normally about 50 feet wide at Laredo, sluggish
and shallow enough to walk across, was a 100-yard wide
chocolate-colored surge early Wednesday evening, oozing across the
low-lying parklands, inching up the bridge pillars and carrying
past a surreal array of flotsam: telephone poles, huge tangles of
mesquite trees, lampposts, sagebrush, dead animals and a garbage
Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable flood,'' said Laredo Mayor Betty Flores
while watching the water from the roof of a riverside shopping
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Fire Capt. Louis Sosa said late Wednesday afternoon:
``The river is 26.5 feet above normal under the downtown Laredo
bridges right now. We're expecting 5 or 6 feet of rise over the
next 6 hours.'' That is several feet lower than earlier predictions
and would leave the river below the lowest of the three brides.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. Wednesday, Darwin Ockerman of the U.S. Geological
Survey said the crest had flattened out and the worst was probably
over.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the international bridges in Laredo had been closed
in anticipation of the surge. The blocks nearest the river were
cordoned off and residents were advised to evacuate. Although about
2,000 people live in the areas that Laredo officials wanted
evacuated, the officials said only about 600 residents left their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, dozens of people gathered along both banks of the Rio
Grande to watch the spectacle in a carnival-like atmosphere.
Federal officials kept spectators far from the river's banks, but
in Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side, onlookers were standing right
alongside the river, sometimes three or four deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are just flood-watchers,'' Ms. Flores said.
``The most difficult part is convincing people of the danger, not
only from water and debris but from wild animals running from it.
I've heard lots of reports of snakes seen heading for high
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the floods had crippled Del Rio's water system,
probably for days, Laredo had responded to a similar flood in 1954
by relocating its water system on high ground, so the water in the
city of 180,000 residents continued to flow. Nuevo Laredo's 600,000
residents, however, were without potable water this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush toured Del Rio on Wednesday morning,
first taking a helicopter ride over the San Felipe Estates
neighborhood in south Del Rio, where most of the destruction
occurred, and later meeting with some of the 850 flood victims who
had spent Tuesday night in the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the residents had tried to return to their homes on
Tuesday, but were forced back into the shelter when another
rainstorm threatened further flooding. Emergency officials said
there were no reports of fresh damage.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, many residents were making their way back home
again, although some returned to find an orange ``X'' on their
front door, declaring the structure uninhabitable and scheduled to
be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have confirmed 10 deaths from flooding in Del Rio and
directly across the border in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, and an
additional six deaths elsewhere. Scores of residents remain
unaccounted for, emergency officials said, though most of them are
thought to be safe somewhere in shelters or with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with the water receding in Del Rio, a city of more
than 30,000 people, searchers were pushing through the newly
uncovered debris to look for bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was witnessing a terrible offense of nature,''
Bush told reporters after his tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 17 inches of rain had fallen on Del Rio and surrounding
Val Verde County on Sunday and in the early hours of Monday,
choking all of the creeks and arroyos and eventually causing a
five-foot wall of water to rush down San Felipe Creek into Del
Rio's poorest neighborhood, damaging more than 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The flood waters moved downriver into Eagle Pass on Tuesday,
flooding some of that city's streets but causing no injuries. Just
beyond Laredo is Lake Falcon, which officials believe will swallow
up much of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that caused the problems _ the remnants of Tropical
Storm Charley _ finally broke into pieces early Wednesday and
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nervousness of city officials in Laredo, the streets
along the river remained festive as the water slowly rose through
the afternoon. A man in an ultralight flew over the crowds, waving
happily.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Torres, 43, whose house is about 50 yards from the river,
leaned against the fence in her yard and watched the scene. ``I
don't expect anything special to happen,'' she said. ``Around here,
it never does.''

RESEARCHERS USE SPICE TO KILL E. COLI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could a strong dose of cloves in your hamburger help ward off E.
coli?
</P>
<P>
   For centuries spices have been used to retard the spoilage of
food in countries close to the equator.
</P>
<P>
   More recently outbreaks of E. coli in hamburger and apple cider
have heightened fears of potential outbreaks in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers at Kansas State University in Manhattan have
discovered that common spices such as garlic, clove, cinnamon,
oregano and sage can kill up to 99 percent of this
food-contaminating bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tested 23 spices in E. coli-contaminated raw
ground beef and salami. They found a mixture of 7.5 percent clove
to 92.5 ground beef killed 99 percent of the bacteria in hamburger.
Hefty doses of garlic killed 99 percent of the bacteria in salami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used spices straight off the shelf, although the amount we
put in is more than most people really do,'' says Daniel Fung, a
food microbiologist with K-State's department of animal sciences
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   A more palatable 2.5 percent clove in hamburger killed 90
percent of the pathogens. When a more moderate dose of garlic was
used the spice killed about half of the E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, a heavy dose of spice does not eliminate
the need to thoroughly cook hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Fung presented the research findings earlier this summer at a
meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists in Atlanta. He says
a scheduled two-hour presentation quickly turned into a four-hour
talk with food industry representatives and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these spices can kill E. coli there are also applications
for salmonella and other food-borne pathogens. E. coli is very hard
to kill compared to other pathogens,'' Fung says optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as news of the work has spread, Fung has received calls
from around the country. Many of the callers are eager to suggest
other applications for his research.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after talking with cider producers, one of his
student researchers will test whether the addition of cinnamon can
kill E. coli in apple cider.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the young farmer in North Carolina who called to
tell Fung that he had added spice to chicken feed and detected a
lowered incidence of E. coli in the chicken feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? If you feed chicken spices, you may get good
flavor! This whole thing can go on and on,'' Fung says with obvious
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Fung and associates E. Ceylan and D.H. Kang also plan to test
the spices on cooked hamburger products. Their goal is to try to
isolate the compounds in the spices that kill E. coli. ``We need to
think about how to put more spice in food so we can put more
protection in food,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of cloves in hamburger doesn't sound very appealing?
</P>
<P>
   Fung insists ``human eating habits can change. Chinese don't
usually like blue cheese when they first get here, but then in time
they begin to like it.''

MAKING RICKY WILLIAMS THE BEST IS BEST FOR TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mack Brown, Texas' first-year football coach,
figured he was at the apex of his honeymoon period with Longhorns
fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was mid-January, eight months before Brown would have a
chance to lose his first game and a few days after tailback Ricky
Williams, the team's Heisman Trophy candidate, announced he would
bypass millions in projected NFL earnings and return for his senior
season.
</P>
<P>
   As Brown toured the city, familiarizing himself with local
landmarks in his first month as an Austin resident, he passed a
sign of the times. On a small message board in front of one
business was a poignant reminder that a coach's public-relations
work is never done.
</P>
<P>
   The sign read: ``Give it to Ricky 40 times, Mack, you idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Little did the business owner realize that the new coach, unlike
the old one, had no concern about a maximum number of carries each
game for a player who could break the NCAA career records for
rushing yards and rushing touchdowns with a standout senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed with them. I didn't think that was too harsh,'' Brown
said of the hand-scrawled message that he will adopt as a plan of a
attack in 1998. ``A lot of people said I did a great job of talking
Ricky into staying. The truth is, I should have begged him. I
didn't know how good he was.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the 6-foot, 225-pound Williams in spring drills
and fall two-a-days, Brown has a better handle on the type of
talent he will feature as the centerpiece of the Texas offense. In
fact, Brown has made Williams' Heisman quest the rallying point for
a team trying to rebound from a 4-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman Trophy is not an individual award. It's obviously
a team award,'' Brown said. ``You never see a player with the
Heisman Trophy on a team that doesn't perform at the highest level.
So, from our standpoint, we've challenged our football team. We
told them, `If you want Ricky to win the Heisman, we've got to win
a lot of football games.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a novel method of motivation. But the Longhorns, who
inherit 1997 powers Nebraska (13-0) and Kansas State (11-1) as road
opponents on the rotating Big 12 schedule, have not been projected
among the title contenders in a conference they won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows his team needs some sort of seasonlong rallying
point. And the players seem to like the idea of playing for
Williams, the top returning vote-getter in the Heisman balloting
last season, when he finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, winner of last season's Doak Walker National Running
Back Award, needs 1,928 yards to break the NCAA career rushing mark
set in 1976 by Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett (6,082 yards). He needs 20
rushing touchdowns to eclipse the NCAA career record of 64 by
Indiana's Anthony Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 games last season, Williams rushed for 1,893 yards and 25
touchdowns, leading Division I-A players in both categories. But he
averaged only 25.3 carries per game, a figure Brown has vowed to
increase dramatically to take advantage of Texas' four returning
starters in the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   A heightened workload for Williams, it is assumed, will lead to
increased yards and points. And increased production by the offense
will take pressure off a defense that allowed a school-record 366
points (33.3 per game) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Dusty Renfro, an Alvarado High School
graduate, is on board with the idea of teammates banding together
in an effort to put a Heisman on Williams' mantel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of thing that gives you drive to do better is good.
And it would be good for us having him in the Heisman race,'' said
Renfro, the team leader in tackles (116) and sacks (four) last
season. ``Ricky means a lot to this team. I would die for the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not always been the case, Renfro pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him, I didn't like his looks. I didn't like
his dreadlocks,'' said Renfro, a senior who joined Williams as a
member of Texas' 1995 recruiting class. ``But I learned to like
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is a good guy who always has a smile on his face and
doesn't treat people bad. He's the premier player in college
football, but he hasn't let that go to his head. I realize now my
first impression of him was 100 percent wrong. There's nothing I
wouldn't do for the guy, and a lot of players on this team feel the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Adams, a two-year starter at right guard, said Williams has
``a selfless nature that inspires the entire team.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' decision to cut short his summer baseball season and
begin voluntary football workouts in July further endeared him to
Texas teammates. A member of the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A
team in Batavia, N.Y., Williams was hitting .288 when he returned
to Austin to lift weights and concentrate on his Heisman chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tied the last piece of the puzzle together,'' Renfro said
of Williams' early return from professional baseball. ``It showed
us that Ricky really cared about us and thought we could win. The
offensive linemen have set a goal to get him 2,000 yards. We're all
excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Williams, who has taken a hands-on approach in helping
school officials craft what is being billed as a low-key Heisman
campaign. After announcing his return to Texas and receiving
permission from Brown to switch to jersey No. 34 for his senior
season, Williams suggested to school officials that he and Brown
pose for a publicity picture with the new digit.
</P>
<P>
   John Bianco, Texas' associate director of media relations for
football, said Williams envisioned a shot that would parody NFL
draft-day photos of first-round picks holding their new jerseys
while posing with commissioner Paul Tagliabue. So, Williams and
Brown posed, side-by-side, with each holding a shoulder of a Texas
jersey with the No. 34 on it. The photo graced the cover of Texas'
spring prospectus, above the headline, ``A Perfect Fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky wanted something that said, `I picked Mack,' '' Bianco
said. ``He's having fun with this (Heisman hype). Some days, he'll
come in and answer the phone for half an hour when he has time to
kill. He knows nine out of 10 calls are to set up interviews with
Ricky Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Bianco said, Williams takes a message and lets Bianco
arrange an interview at a time of mutual convenience. But Williams
surprised a couple of out-of-town reporters this summer by saying,
``This is Ricky'' and doing interviews on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a computer maven, also has sent e-mail to Heisman
voters, offering his personal top-10 lists on topics ranging from
music to the greatest college running backs of all time. He has
taken part in electronic chat rooms with ESPN SportsZone.
</P>
<P>
   Bianco's goal, as the season unfolds, is to keep Williams' name
on the minds of Heisman voters without oversaturating them. To that
end, he is unsure if Texas will engage in weekly mass mailings to
promote their tailback. A weekly conference call, Bianco said, is
probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is going to be a pretty low-key campaign,'' Bianco said.
``He's going into the season as a front-runner, so the most
important thing he needs to do is keep putting up the numbers. I'm
not sure he needs more exposure. My job will be more trying to
control his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' job will be to avoid opposing tacklers. He said he
looks forward to the challenge and the Heisman spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not once have I looked back and wished I'd made a different
decision,'' said Williams, who was projected to be one of the top
seven picks in the 1998 NFL draft if he bypassed his senior season.
``The Heisman is important to me. The records are important. But
it's more important to win ball games. If we win enough games, all
the individual stuff will come to me later. That's why I try and
focus attention back on the team. Without them, I'm nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It could just as easily be argued that, without Ricky Williams,
the 1998 Longhorns would have no rallying point. For now, however,
his quest for a Heisman Trophy dominates the thoughts of coaches
and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Even opponents envision college football's most coveted award
landing in Williams' trophy case this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserved it last year,'' said Missouri linebacker
Barry Odom, who watched Williams carry 23 times for 235 yards
against the Tigers in 1997. ``It seems like, to win the Heisman,
you have to be in contention to win the national championship. But
it's supposed to go to the best player in the nation. I think Ricky
Williams was that last year. And, once again, I think he has a good
chance to be that again this year.''

`SLUMS' SPINS CHARM, ORIGINALIITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' a comedy, is rated R for language
and adult situations. Running time is 1 hour 31 minutes. Three out
of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian has a big problem _ or more accurately, two big problems.
</P>
<P>
   They're between her neck and her waist, and they're driving her
crazy. It's 1976, she's a teenager, and her breasts are taking over
her life.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, she thinks they are. The daughter of an
unsuccessful businessman who keeps moving the family from place to
place, Vivian has enough to worry about without also having to deal
with lustful males.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' spins something charming and
original from this dubious premise is due not only to the lightly
comic touch of writer//director Tamara Jenkins but also to the
film's quirkily charismatic star, Natasha Lyonne.
</P>
<P>
   As the scrappy but vulnerable Vivian, Lyonne (``Everyone Says I
Love You'') delivers a performance of loopy authority. Her Vivian
is a reluctant nomad, a girl who constantly encounters new
surroundings only to leave them.
</P>
<P>
   When her father, Murray (Alan Arkin), steers Vivian and her two
brothers into the latest in a series of rundown apartments _ this
one on the outskirts of Beverly Hills _ she assumes it will be just
another stop. But the move will permanently affect her attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is a coming-of-age story, but without
the self-conscious angst that often infects that genre. Although
Vivian's situation is sometimes painful, the character isn't
self-pitying or powerless. She's just a kid who feels overwhelmed
by the world. It's called adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer of gross-out comedy, ``Slums'' is an anomaly. It's
funny without being insulting, sensitive without being sappy,
insightful without being earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins doesn't push for laughs. Rather, she creates an
atmosphere in which they emerge organically and surprisingly.
Characters, not shocks, come first.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Jenkins has assembled a splendid cast.
Arkin convinces us that Murray deserves his children's love without
neglecting his childlike irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   As a laid-back neighbor, Kevin Corrigan (who recently turned up
in both ``Buffalo 66'' and ``Henry Fool'') shows off his trademark
blend of affability and eccentricity. And as Vivian's troubled
cousin Rita, who moves in with the family in an attempt to
straighten herself out, Marisa Tomei is as incandescent as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In this company, it's no small achievement that Lyonne commands
attention. Claire Danes, Christina Ricci and Natalie Portman will
have to make room for yet another impressive young actress.

RUSSIAN DRAMA IS WIDE-EYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Thief,'' a drama, opens is rated R for sexual situations
and nudity. Running time is 1 hour 37 minutes. In Russian with
English subtitles. Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Child actors are at their best when they haven't yet discovered
that they're actors.
</P>
<P>
   Check out Jackie Coogan's crying scene in Chaplin's ``The Kid.''
It works because there's not even the slightest suggestion of
manipulation in the boy's performance. It's absolutely heartfelt
and real.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happens in the Russian ``The Thief,'' a drama
of disillusionment about a Stalin-era crook as seen through the
eyes of a 6-year-old boy. Misha Philipchuk delivers an absolutely
captivating performance as our wide-eyed protagonist _ and I mean
``wide-eyed'' in both the physical and intellectual sense.
</P>
<P>
   Young Philipchuk possesses two of the biggest, roundest, bluest
eyes ever captured on celluloid. His face is soft, almost
featureless, with his tiny mouth usually clenched in a tight
grimace. But those eyes ... they allow us to read every thought,
every emotion that passes through his tiny frame.
</P>
<P>
   And Sanya, his character, experiences a lot. The son of a Soviet
soldier who died in combat before the boy's birth, Sanya is being
raised by his doting mother, the beautiful Katya (Ekaterina
Rednikova), who is little more than child herself.
</P>
<P>
   As the film begins in 1952, they're on a crowded train where
they encounter Tolyan (Vladimir Mashkov), a charismatic army
officer who in short order sweeps both mother and son off their
feet. Mama responds to him sexually. As for Sanya, he's won over
when Tolyan conspiratorially asks the kid to keep watch over his
automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as a family, the three move into a boarding house in a
provincial city. The adults indulge is lots of lovemaking. Sanya
makes friends with a neighbor girl and gets picked on by the local
bullies. Tolyan rises to heroic status when he coaches the boy in
self-defense. (In one glorious moment Sanya triumphs over his
adversaries and has to be dragged from the fray; halfway home he
spins around and kicks viciously at nothing in particular, just out
of sheer machismo.)
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with all this cozy domesticity is that it's
built on a lie. Tolyan isn't an army officer. He's a career thief
who routinely cleans out their fellow tenants, then makes his
escape with Katja and Sanya on a midnight train. In the next city
they'll repeat the process.
</P>
<P>
   Katya may complain, but she's in love and can't leave him _ even
when he resorts to thuggish behavior to impose his will.
</P>
<P>
   A nominee for this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film,
``The Thief'' gets a great deal of mileage out of its setting.
Besides the fine performances, writer//director Pavel Chukhrai
expertly evokes the atmosphere of Stalinist Russia _ the monumental
government buildings, the cramped apartments and communal kitchens,
the drab clothing, the sound of accordion-music drifting down a
poorly lighted hallway.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an overtly political film _ none of the characters seem
to harbor particularly strong beliefs, although most accept without
question that Comrade Stalin has their best interests at heart. But
metaphorically it's all about politics _ like Stalin, Tolyan has
the ability to make others think he's generous, outgoing and
patriotic. In reality, he cares about nothing but himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson that little Sanya will learn the hard way, and
that will stay with him forever.

FILMMAKERS ARE STAR-STRUCK JUST LIKE THE REST OF US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Grey Gardens,'' a documentary, is unrated. Running time is 1
hour 35 minutes. Two and a half out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edie are elderly women who
live on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Their home is filthy, and they're unkempt. They bicker. They
talk to the filmmakers. A raccoon pokes its head into the house.
The women bicker again.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture. This is cinema verite, and the fact that
we're allowed to listen to these women nattering on in their ratty
mansion is supposed to mean something.
</P>
<P>
   But all it really means is that the highly overrated Maysles
Brothers, who directed the film, first released in 1976, were as
starstruck as the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   You did catch the name Bouvier, didn't you? As in Jackie O. As
in Kennedy. `It's highly likely that the only reason 79-year-old
Big Edie (the mother) and 56-year-old Little Edie became film
subjects was because they were the aunt and first cousin of
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. And therefore fascinating. Right.
</P>
<P>
   The case could be made that Albert and David Maysles (along with
three collaborators) were trying to solve a mystery: How could the
two Edies, formerly entrenched in high society, sink so low? Or
maybe they were simply attempting to show the dark side of the
Kennedy clan. Or maybe they just wanted to embarrass the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   But on all three counts, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Each strategy could have yielded fertile results. But the
brothers don't follow through. It's as if they thought just turning
on the camera and filming extensively was enough. Right _ if you
like tedium.
</P>
<P>
   What the late David Maysles and brother Albert apparently lacked
was the sense of irony that would have made ``Grey Gardens''
something more than a gross invasion of privacy. Neither did they
possess the artistry to make the film a metaphor for lost hope.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these criticisms, the film is weirdly compelling in a
``Truman Show'' sort of way. Just watching these two apparently
clueless women being exploited is an odd thrill. And a shameless
thrill, to be sure. Who wouldn't enjoy catching a glimpse of a
79-year-old woman's backside?
</P>
<P>
   These days, you take your thrills where you can get them.

   Another look at Diana
</P>
<P>
   Young, naive and unsophisticated, Princess Diana first emerged
in the public spotlight under the influence of her mother's dowdy
English style.
</P>
<P>
   When she married Prince Charles, she fell under the tutelage of
the English Vogue editors, thanks to her sister, Lady Jane
Fellowes, who had once worked at the magazine. Diana frequently
made her own decisions, however, and in an effort to fit in with
the royals and in keeping with the excessive fashion of the early
1980s, she was often a vision of fussy hats and suits that seemed
too old.
</P>
<P>
   But as she matured and suffered through painfully public
personal difficulties, she honed her instincts. Ultimately she
learned to use her image to enhance both her personal power and
effectiveness in her charity work.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary Monday of Princess Diana's death has triggered
publication of a series of new Diana books. One notable example is
Diana, The Secrets of Her Style (GT Publishing, $30) by Diane
Clehane, in which her transformation from Sloane Ranger to
Cinderella bride to a Versace-dressed beauty is eloquently traced.
</P>
<P>
   The author, an American reporter who covers celebrities, talked
to British designers such as Donald Campbell, who dressed Diana in
the beginning. ``She thought fashion was a necessary evil,'' he
said of those early years. She made her own decisions generally
without his advice or approval.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, she adapted a sleek, simple look that emphasized
her beauty. She became the woman of whom Donna Karan said: ``...She
took a role and created it with style and grace under enormous,
enormous difficulty ...''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she inspired women to copy her sleek haircut and her
penchant for pearl chokers, but it was the reinvention of herself
as a strong, modern woman to whom we could relate that made her a
style icon in the '90s. The book, with many photos not seen before,
is a worthy tribute.
</P>
<P>
   You're on what corner?
</P>
<P>
   You're traipsing about New York City in desperate search for,
say, Diesel jeans or antique buttons. You can't remember how to get
to Barney's, the trendy specialty store. You're in SoHo streets and
you're starving. Or you're determined to find the J. Crew store on
lower Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Here is help. It's the New York Shopping Guide, 1999 (Tobe, $18)
produced by editors of The Tobe Report, a weekly retail trade
publication. The paper-bound book contains 11 walking tours by
neighborhoods and includes department stores, boutiques and home
furnishing stores along with restaurants and museums from New
Yorkers who know about such things. The information includes
addresses, type of merchandise and business hours.
</P>
<P>
   To order, call (212) 867-8677, Ext. 226, or fax (212) 867-8662.
Count on $3 for shipping.

TEXAS LONGHORNS CAPSULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
TEXAS LONGHORNS 
1997 record: 4-7, 2-6 in Big 12 
Coach (record): Mack Brown (first year at Texas, 86-74-1 overall) 
Stadium: Darrell K. Royal-Memorial Stadium (80,216) 
Ticket information: (800) 982-BEVO, (512) 477-6060 
PIECES IN PLACE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senior TB Ricky Williams (1,893 yards, 25 TDs), senior TE Derek
Lewis (20 catches, 2 TDs), senior RT Jay Humphrey (1997
all-conference selection), senior MLB Dusty Renfro (116 tackles, 8
for losses), junior DE Aaron Humphrey (76 tackles, 12 for losses).
Williams, the team's Heisman Trophy candidate, has an experienced
line in front of him and a chance to carry at least 35 times per
game. Beyond that, off-season overhauls of the passing game,
kicking game and defense make all three areas unknown commodities. &QL; 
KEY NEWCOMERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LB De'Andre Lewis, CB Chris Butcher, K Kris Stockton. Lewis, a
converted fullback, is expected to be one of the team's primary
pass rushers from his outside linebacker spot. Butcher, a converted
tailback, must master man-to-man coverage skills to succeed in the
team's blitz-oriented defense. Stockton might be the first Texas
player since Russell Erxleben in 1978 to handle both punting and
placement duties. &QL; 
KEY LOSSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QB James Brown, K Phil Dawson, C Ryan Fiebiger. The Longhorns
will be hard-pressed to replace Brown, a four-year starter and the
leading passer in school history. Dawson, a two-time All-American,
became a security blanket for an inconsistent attack. Fiebiger, a
three-year starter, provided stability and a consistent crease for
Williams between the tackles. &QL; 
MISSING PIECE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senior Richard Walton, Brown's replacement at quarterback, has
completed 84 of 153 passes for 1,091 yards in spot duty during his
college career. But he struggled in 1997, throwing for only 314
yards with more interceptions (three) than touchdowns (one). Walton
seemed to lose confidence after Texas was swamped by UCLA, 66-3, in
his only start. Regaining the form Walton exhibited in his first
two seasons, rather than 1997, will be critical for the team's
success. &QL; 
BIGGEST TEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A two-week stretch with road games at UCLA (Sept. 12) and Kansas
State (Sept. 19) should tell volumes about the team's mental
makeup. Texas cratered after a 66-3 loss to UCLA in 1997, and Mack
Brown has vowed not to let disappointment fester with this team. &QL; 
WATCH OUT FOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blown defensive assignments, especially early in the season.
Four projected defensive starters played other positions last
season, and Brown has indicated a willingness to play all four of
his incoming freshmen linebackers to get more speed on the field.
Radical changes in personnel and defensive philosophy might work
over time, but expect some growing pains in September. &QL; 
Milestones: Brown must win at least six games to match the initial
efforts of the past three men who have tried _ and failed _ to
replace coach Darrell Royal in the hearts and minds of Texas fans.
Fred Akers was 11-1 in 1977, David McWilliams was 7-5 in 1987, and
John Mackovic was 6-5 in 1992. &QL; 
PREDICTION: 6-5 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas will be overmatched physically against Top 25 opponents
UCLA, Kansas State, Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M. They'll make a
difficult road trip to Texas Tech (Nov. 14) and have a tough home
game Nov. 7 against Oklahoma State. A winning record is not
guaranteed. But Williams should be good enough to squeeze this team
into the Alamo Bowl. &QL; 
OVERVIEW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change in philosophy from the stoic Mackovic to the
emotional Brown should breathe life into an underachieving team.
But at some point, the excitement will fade and talent will win
out. And Texas, at this point, does not have enough defensive
talent to be much better than a .500 team. &QL; 
PUZZLE PIECE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Richard Walton must throw the ball effectively
enough that defenses can't crowd the line against tailback Ricky
Williams, the team's Heisman Trophy hopeful. &QL;

CADARET JOINS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Greg Cadaret joined the Rangers yesterday and
was pleased to be with a contender, but he's not quite sure what
he's doing here. The left-handed reliever was released by the
Anaheim Angels despite having a respectable 4.14 earned-run average
and holding left-handed batters to a .230 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to be released there,'' he said. ``They had no
explanation other than they needed a roster spot. It was totally
unexpected and frustrating, to be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   While he joins a contender, he leaves a first-place team. The
Rangers trail the Angels in the American League West. Cadaret would
like nothing more than to catch his old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a lot of spice to it,' he said. ``I had intended to
help them win the pennant. It's a good group of guys over there.
But I'd be more than happy to take that playoff spot away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret doesn't yet know if he'll be the first or second lefty
out of the bullpen, but he said that's not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the role is,'' he said. ``It's all about
winning the pennant. I'll throw every day the rest of the season if
that's what it takes.''
Trying too hard
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Dick Bosman watched tape of Todd Stottlemyre's
outing against the Tigers on Tuesday, and came away with one
inescapable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``His location is not good,'' Bosman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman didn't spot anything mechanical that would lead to the
bad location, but suspects it's because Stottlemyre is
overthrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good competitor,'' Bosman said. ``He wants to do well,
and when the wheels come off you try to do more. When you try to do
more, you generally end up doing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, whose ERA rose to 7.03 after allowing five runs on
eight hits in 3 1/3 innings, sustained an injury to his lower back
and rib cage sliding into a base for the St. Louis Cardinals before
the trade to the Rangers. But manager Johnny Oates said that is not
a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind he's healthy,'' Oates said.
``Mechanically, I don't see anything different than I've ever seen.
It's just a matter of relaxing and making pitches.''
Newson optioned out
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Warren Newson was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma to
make room on the roster for Cadaret as the Rangers elected to keep
12 pitchers instead of an extra bench player.
</P>
<P>
   Oates opted for the pitcher because the Rangers play a
doubleheader tomorrow in Chicago and because designated hitter Lee
Stevens, like Newson a left-handed hitter, could return from the
disabled list by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a doubleheader coming up, and with the possibility of
Lee coming back we felt that was the way to go,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with more than five years of major-league service,
Newson could have refused an assignment and declared free agency.
But after being assured he would rejoin the team in 10 days, he
decided to go to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the situation,'' he said. ``I'm the lowest man on
the totem pole.''
Gonzalez out of field
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez was the designated hitter for the second
consecutive game, and he is unsure when he'll return to right
field. Gonzalez has a sore right calf muscle that shows no signs of
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bothering me,'' he said. ``I don't feel good.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez took a .298 batting average into last night's game, and
is aiming for a .300 batting average for the third time in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power hitters don't need to hit .300,'' he said. ``But when
you get close, you try harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Rocky Roe left the crew that worked the game yesterday
because of a knee problem that will require surgery. He was
replaced by Eric Cooper. Farm report Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific
Coast League): The RedHawks lost at Omaha, 3-2 in 12 innings,
Tuesday. Eric Moody pitched 4 2/3 innings in relief, but lost on an
unearned run. Center fielder Les Norman had three hits, including
his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): The Drillers lost to Jackson,
6-1, with starter Ken Juarbe giving up all the runs in 5 2/3
innings. Scheduled starter Dan Smith was scratched because of the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Charlotte (Florida State League): Shawn Gallagher
homered and drove in two runs as the Rangers won at Clearwater,
7-6. Gallagher is third in the FSL with 22 homers and leads with
105 runs batted in. Francisco Saneaux earned the victory in relief
by allowing one run in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): The Sand Gnats won at
Columbus, 5-4, to snap a six-game losing streak. Starting pitcher
Aaron Bond gave up two runs in 6 1/3 innings, but wasn't involved
in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski (Appalachian League, rookie): Starting pitcher Matthew
Kosderka struck out 14 batters in seven innings, the most for a
pitcher in the Texas organization this season, but the Rangers lost
at Martinsville, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Coast (Gulf Coast League, rookie): The Rangers fell to the
Red Sox, 9-3, to fall out of first place in the Western Division of
the Gulf Coast League.

HOMER MAKES WILLIAMS UNLIKELY HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about making the most of an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Williams hit his first career major-league home run
Wednesday and it couldn't have come at a better time. His blast in
the first game of the doubleheader gave the Angels a 3-2
fifth-inning lead on their way to a 6-4 win over the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never envisioned having a shot in a pennant race,'' said
Williams, who before this season had played 10 years of
professional baseball but only 15 games in the majors. ``God has a
way of working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was called up from Triple-A Vancouver Aug. 10,
threw his fist into the air as he ran between first and second on
the homer and was obviously excited upon reaching the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He about broke everybody's hands high-fiving in the dugout,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``He should be (excited). He's
just trying to have some fun. It's been a long season for a lot of
us. Guys like him and (Orlando Palmeiro) have brought some life to
the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 32, spent most of his career in the Angels
organization until being traded to the Dodgers for pitcher Mike
James in 1994. The Dodgers released him after the 1996 season and
he was playing in Mexico last summer when the Angels signed him
last August.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going on guts: Troy Percival needed 39 pitches to throw 12/3
innings and save Tuesday's game and wasn't expected to be available
for Wednesday's first game. Not only was he available, Percival
closed it out, pitching the ninth for his career-high 37th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I can do,'' Percival said. ``It's August. We're in a
pennant hunt right now. Unless I don't think I can get the job
done, I'll go out there. We've got guys like (Gary) DiSarcina and
(Darin) Erstad grinding every day for nine innings, I can go one
(inning).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Up, then down: Yankees pitcher Ryan Bradley made his first
major-league start in the first game and just his third
major-league appearance. He got the start because scheduled starter
Ramiro Mendoza was a late scratch after having a cyst removed from
his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the Yankees' first-round pick out of Arizona State last
year, shut the Angels out through four innings but surrendered
three runs in the fifth, three more in the sixth to take the loss.
</P>
<P>
   He started this season in Single-A, then made stops in Double-A
and Triple-A before joining the Yankees on Aug. 21. But after the
game, Bradley was optioned to Triple-A Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Angels third baseman Troy Glaus had a reunion of
sorts. In 1996, Bradley was playing for Arizona State and Glaus for
UCLA when Bradley hit Glaus in the head with a pitch, sending Glaus
to the hospital. There were hard feelings, and Bradley hit Glaus
with a pitch the next time the two faced each other later that
season. Wednesday, Bradley got the best of Glaus, striking him out
twice in two at-bats.

   __ Roster shuffling: &UR; !off! &LR;  The Angels will be forced to move
someone off the roster on Friday to make room for Ken Hill.
Left-handed reliever Trevor Wilson is expected to go.

BASTIANELLI SETTLED AS SURE RECEIVER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC wide receiver Mike Bastianelli fractured
his collarbone last spring, but he's shown no ill effects from the
injury and is considered one of the Trojans' top two receivers
heading into Sunday's game against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Billy Miller, Bastianelli will be expected to pick up
the slack for R. Jay Soward, who is suspended from the Purdue game
for poor academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bastianelli relishes the extra responsibility, in part because
he feels he has matured this summer. He recently got married and is
now more worried about graduating and planning his future life than
just playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up. I don't do anything anymore,'' Bastianelli
said. ``I'm a husband. I sit at home. I don't go out and goof off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, I consider myself to have become a
totally different person.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed are Bastianelli's sure hands. He
is USC's No.1 possession receiver after catching 33 passes last
season and he figures to surpass that total this year.
</P>
<P>
   His versatility remains a key for the Trojans. Bastianelli will
hold on field goals and extra points this year and is also a backup
punter. He can also kick off if needed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Alumni return: Former USC defensive linemen Matt Keneley and
David Webb visited practice Wednesday. Keneley was on his way out
of town before stopping at UC Irvine. He was called by the Detroit
Lions on Wednesday morning and told to report to their training
camp, where he will join the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Offensive lineman Ken Bowen is officially
listed as questionable with a hyperextended elbow, but it is
unlikely he will play. Freshman quarterback Jason Thomas' sore
ankle was examined by doctors Tuesday evening and rest was
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he's ruled out being an emergency player, he will be
standing right next to me (during the game),'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Collision course: It's one thing to practice with reckless
abandon, but things got out of hand when graduate assistant Jason
Gelber and a motorized cart he was driving flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Gelber barely escaped injury, but the noise and smoke from the
accident were of a serious enough magnitude to stop the nearby
drills.

FRESH PRINTS AROUND BRUINS CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's no secret why UCLA is ranked No.7 in both
polls and picked to win the Pac-10 championship. Quarterback Cade
McNown is a Heisman Trophy contender. Strong safety Larry Atkins
and left tackle Kris Farris are among the best in the nation at
their positions, while Chris Sailer is an All-America kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the Bruins get to the Rose Bowl or better still, the
Fiesta Bowl it won't be without a big contribution from this year's
freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 24 scholarship players UCLA signed in February was
rated either No. 1 or No. 2 in the nation by five recruiting
services and it hasn't taken long for it to make an impact. Even by
the time the Bruins had their first full-contact practice
Wednesday, seven of the recruits had crept up to at least third
string.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo said he expects 8 to 10 of the freshmen to
play this year about twice the norm and a handful could start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're physically capable and mentally capable, there's no
reason for them not to play,'' Toledo said. ``In this day and age,
freshmen have to play and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, one of 14 Bruin upperclassmen who played as freshmen,
says the most important thing is arriving at school ready to play
mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing in order for a true freshman is to spend the
summer thinking about what it takes to play college football,''
McNown said. ``The coaches don't know what to expect but you'll get
a chance. If show you can do it, there will be more
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The players expected to contribute the most this year are
tailback DeShaun Foster, inside linebacker Robert Thomas,
cornerback Lovell Houston and nose guard Ken Kocher.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Foster and Kocher each were unanimous Best in the West
selections this year and Houston was one of the most coveted
defensive backs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a 6-foot-1, 205-pounder from Tustin High, is the one
running back the Bruins have who can replace Skip Hicks as an
every-down back. But Foster has missed most practices so far by
re-aggravating a groin injury he first hurt practicing for the
Californa-Texas Shrine game last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher, a 6-4, 292-pound nose guard from San Diego Patrick
Henry, will help the Bruins get bigger and stronger up front, one
of Toledo's top recruiting priorities. ``He's mature and his
capable,'' Toledo said of Kocher. ``The only thing will be how fast
can he learn, but he will play. It will be kind of like (sophomore
defensive end Kenyon) Coleman. We'll get him a certain number of
snaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, a 6-1, 180-pounder from Denver Jefferson, has been
slowed by a thigh injury, but he's expected to play at cornerback
and also may have an impact returning kicks, something ``we need
dearly,'' said Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 6-2, 225-pounder from Imperial, has such tremendous
speed that he's drawing comparisons to All-Pro linebacker Ken
Norton Jr., a former Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of pressure,'' Thomas said of the expectations.
``I'm a highly touted linebacker and I expect to play, but I enjoy
the pressure. Everyone's good out here and that makes you want to
work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Blake Worley and right guard Mike Saffer have also
been impressive, moving up to second string. But playing time may
be hard to come by backing up Farris and Andy Meyers, one of the
Pac-10's to guards.
</P>
<P>
   The best opportunities to play are on defense where only four
starters return and only two players Atkins and outside linebacker
Brendan Ayanbadejo are guaranteed starting jobs. Julius Williams, a
cornerback and teammate of Foster's at Tustin, has looked good in
coverage drills, moving up to third string. Rusty Williams, an
outside linebacker/defensive end from Vista, has impressed
defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti.
</P>
<P>
   Two walk-ons, kicker Adam Griffith from Gardnersville, Nev., and
long snapper Jeff Grau from Loyola, have also worked their way to
the second team.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks, Toledo will have a better handle on who
should be able to contribute and who will be candidates to
redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they find out more and more who won't play or (who will)
redshirt, it becomes a little bit of a problem, but that's my job
to constantly talk to them,'' Toledo said. ``They're all highly
recruited guys and it's not easy when they come in here and
redshirt or don't play or don't start right away. In turn, it's the
same problem with the guys who are here some of those freshmen are
moving ahead of them. But those are good problems. I can handle
those.''

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ A vast and plodding Hurricane Bonnie rumbled
ashore near the mouth of the Cape Fear River on Wednesday
afternoon, bringing whipping winds and horizontal squalls through a
region that is still recovering, both physically and emotionally,
from the trauma of back-to-back hurricanes in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Wednesday evening, there were no reports of deaths
or serious injuries in the region from the category 3 hurricane,
which carried maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour. But
state officials and weather forecasters worried that the worst
could still be ahead as the slow-moving storm continues its
northerly movement up the North Carolina coast Wednesday night and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern for residents of the Outer Banks, a narrow
and ecologically fragile chain of barrier islands, was that Bonnie
would move straight up Pamlico Sound nd create surging floodwaters
that could cut new inlets and submerge the islands' single highway.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that damage assessments of the Outer
Banks, and of much of the rest of the North Carolina coast, would
not be possible until well into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie finally made land after two days of anxious
anticipation, residents here seemed fatalistic about the weather
currents and rotten luck that have brought three hurricanes to
their quaint, well-mannered town in only two years. In 1996, a mild
hurricane named Bertha struck in July, only to be followed two
months later by a devastating category 3 storm named Fran. That
hurricane resulted in 24 deaths in North Carolina, and 34 total,
and caused an estimated $6 billion in property damage, including
hundreds of downed trees in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Fran's impact was symbolized by the destruction of the
197-foot-tall steeple at the First Baptist Church, a local landmark
that is still being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when we heard about this one was that it
couldn't happen again, that you just can't have three in a row,''
said C. Bruce Williams III, a spokesman for New Hanover County's
emergency management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just one of those things,'' said Gary Green, a
37-year-old cook who was waiting out the storm at a shelter at MCS
Noble Middle School here. Green said he liked the area enough to
put up with the enduring threat of wicked weather. ``Where are you
going to run on this planet?'' he asked. ``If you go to the Midwest
you put up with tornadoes. You go to the west coast and you put up
with earthquakes. You choose your poison as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Miami said that Bonnie's speed
had decreased gradually throughout the day to 8 miles per hour from
nearly double that speed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie will be persisting over eastern North Carolina for at
least another day, creating a serious flood threat from rain,'' the
forecasters said in their 5 p.m. advisory. ``Rainfall totals of 6
to 12 inches are possible. Totals could be much larger, possibly in
excess of 15 or 20 inches if the forward speed of Bonnie decreases
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moore, North Carolina's secretary of Crime Control and
Public Safety, said the storm could churn north toward the Virginia
state line until about 2 a.m. Friday. Moore said there could be as
much as two to three inches of rain per hour almost as far west as
Raleigh. Gale-force winds hit that city Wednesday and flash flood
warnings were issued there.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the deputy director of the hurricane center, said
that the eye of the storm moved lethargically from Cape Fear on
Wednesday afternoon to a point just off Wrightsville Beach at about
8 p.m. Mayfield said the hurricane was expected to move in a north
to northeast direction. But he said the storm's slow speed made it
difficult to predict whether it would hug the coastline or take a
more inland path.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the storm should move out to sea near the
border between North Carolina and Virginia. A hurricane warning
remained in effect Wednesday night from Cape Romain, S.C., to the
North Carolina-Virginia border, while a tropical storm warning was
in effect from Chincoteague, Va., to Cape Henlopen, Del.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million residents and tourists evacuated
coastal areas of North Carolina and South Carolina on Tuesday and
Wednesday morning, filling makeshift emergency shelters in schools
and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews were declared across the region and most bridges from
the mainland to barrier islands were blocked by police cars. An
estimated 97,500 households were without electricity along North
Carolina's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Supply, about 30 miles south of Wilmington, Bonnie's winds
destroyed a portion of the roof at Brunswick Hospital, forcing
officials to move 34 patients to another unit. Here in Wilmington,
a gust blew out a 40-foot section of windows at New Hanover High
School.
</P>
<P>
   On Bald Head Island, near the point of the hurricane's landfall,
47 people were stranded after missing the last ferry Tuesday night
and some took shelter in the island's lighthouse after breaking its
lock. ``It certainly would be better than even the more modern
houses,'' said Andy James, a spokesman for the state's emergency
management team. ``It's been there a long time and weathered a lot
of storms.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse squatters were not the only ones trapped by the
storm. On North Topsail Beach on Wednesday afternoon, two young men
stranded on the island ran through the blinding rain when they saw
a sheriff's car stopped on a road. Mitch Fowler, of Burlington, and
Dennis Poythress of Sneads Ferry, had spent the day trying to
repair Fowler's car.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting the car going, it became buried in the sand
and was eventually flooded by rising sea water, Poythress said. ''I
didn't care if it was the pope,'' said a soaking Poythress as he
crawled into the sheriff's car. ``I was ready to get off the
island. I'm about to starve. I want some dry clothes and a dry
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wilmington, the storm splintered a number of the oak
trees that give this city of 60,000 its elegant grace. Power lines
all across town drooped limply from poles and debris-littered
streets became obstacle courses for the few drivers braving the
roads. The almost universal outages forced the daily newspaper
here, the Morning Star, to send its eight-page Thursday edition to
Fayetteville to be printed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although local officials warned that it was early to make broad
assessments, the damage to trees and property here seemed far
milder than that caused two years ago by Hurricane Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some air views of damage and some scouting around by
people,'' David Paynter, a spokesman here for the New Hanover
County Emergency Management Agency, said late Wednesday afternoon.
``It seems the hurricane has not created that much damage, but
we've got at least seven more hours before the main part of the
storm leaves this area.''
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of people along the coast fled the hurricane, at
least one family drove here deliberately to witness it. Doug Shales
and his 21-year-old daughter, Sarah, detoured to Wilmington while
returning from Tampa, Fla., to their home in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to experience a hurricane for a long time,''
Shales said. ``We just came on the spur of the moment. It's very
special for us to happen to land somewhere where you're going to be
in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shaleses spent the day watching the hurricane through the
picture windows in their room at a Holiday Inn. Shales noted that
his family spent time in 1993 in an historic blizzard atop Beech
Mountain. ``We just kind of really enjoy weather extremes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here remained exasperated that they had been
struck by another hurricane before finishing repairs from the last
one. Kathy Rackley, a 39-year-old housewife from Wilmington, said
she still has trees in her yard that were felled by Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of depressing,'' she said. ``You want to see
everything done before something else comes along and blows it all
down.'' Jack Goodhue, who fled a barrier island to take shelter in
a Wilmington motel, summed up the mood of many. ``What's happened
here?'' he asked. ``Have they pinned a target on Wilmington?''

COETZER LIVES UP TO HER REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ When she beat Steffi Graf for the first of
three times last year in the Round of 16 in the Australian Open,
the 5-foot-2-inch Amanda Coetzer was dubbed the Little Assassin, an
appellation attributable to her stalking, tenacious, never-give-up
style of play.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname stuck, and Coetzer more than lived up to that
reputation Wednesday in the second round of the inaugural Pilot Pen
Women's Championships.
</P>
<P>
   With 17-year-old Anna Kournikova serving for their match at 5-3
in the third set, Coetzer ran off the last four games and
prevailed, 1-6, 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   That hardly came as good news to Graf, who, although she has
beaten Coetzer 10 times in 14 meetings, lost to the 26-year-old
South African in three of four matches last year and must face her
in the quarterfinals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Graf is playing in only her ninth tournament of
the year after spending eight months recuperating from knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The German accepted a late wild card into this event, and on
Tuesday night she routed 19-year-old Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova has had a better year than Coetzer this season,
beating 33 of 45 opponents, including Martina Hingis, Lindsay
Davenport, Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. Kournikova is,
however, ranked two notches lower, at No. 14, than Coetzer, who has
a 21-14 record against lesser opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Coetzer has been ranked as high as third in the world, and
eventually was named the most improved player on the Women's Tennis
Association Tour in 1997. Wednesday afternoon, at the Connecticut
Tennis Center, she demonstrated once again why she is known as one
of the most resolute players on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the last six games of the opening set to the
aggressive, hard-hitting Kournikova, Coetzer struggled to take the
second set and then mounted her late comeback to close out the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been looking for this kind of match to set me up for my
next matches and the U.S. Open,'' Coetzer said. ``I feel I was
lacking a little bit of that tenacity and self-encouragement to
pull out of a tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Coetzer, essentially a baseliner whose temper sometimes has got
the best of her, was nothing if not tenacious in breaking
Kournikova at love when the Russian teen-ager was serving for the
match. Having dodged that bullet, Coetzer then won the next three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, who is seeded 15th in the U.S. Open, which begins
Monday, cited Coetzer's determination as the key factor in the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was just hanging in the match and just trying to
get all the balls back and not try to make mistakes, which she
didn't,'' Kournikova said. ``She was just being tough out there and
she kept on going. And I started staying back, which I shouldn't
have been doing.''

AS SHOW, THE INTERNATIONAL WAS MERELY A SHORT DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE STACHURA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ It seems almost a city ordinance here that all
things, regardless of their substance or worth, must be grotesquely
large. Whether it's hotel casinos, neon signs or breakfast buffets,
nothing can get away with being low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite having the largest number of exhibitors in show
history, low profile is precisely what this year's PGA
International Golf Show here last week turned out to be. Whether
you were talking about the popular new style of fairway woods or
the sentiment that kept some major manufacturers from exhibiting at
this show at all, almost everything about golf's trip to the Strip
this year was decidedly low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment giants like Titleist, FootJoy, Cobra, Spalding and
Etonic opted out of exhibiting at the industry's semiannual
show-and-tell expo, as did several mid-range companies like Ben
Hogan Golf, Bridgestone and PowerBilt. Some had new products they
introduced this summer anyway, like Titleist's new irons and
PowerBilt's affordably priced line of fairway woods, but most did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show, which occupied some 775,000 square feet (or
about 13 football fields) inside the Las Vegas Convention Center
once again provided no shortage of curiosities. The equipment buzz
ran the gamut from ``multimetal'' clubhead materials like those in
the new Liquidmetal driver to the ``biomagnetic'' innersoles in
Florsheim's new Magneforce spikeless golf shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ely Callaway, the patriarchical wizard behind Callaway Golf,
once again could smile at the frenzied activity around his
company's mammoth booth in the center of the show floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Callaway excitement centered on its new Steelhead metal wood
line, designed with a lower center of gravity to help players
launch their shots on the proper trajectory. The line replaces the
company's wildly popular War Birdline of stainless steel woods, as
well as combats the recent success that many smaller companies have
had with low-profile fairway woods.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway was happy his company was here, almost as happy as he
was that some of his competitors were not. ``We like for our
competitors to make mistakes in judgment,'' he said. ``Of course,
any well-developed product can exist without a show, but I feel a
new product does better with one than without.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the competition surely agreed in their own low-profile
ways. The booth at Orlimar, a small Northern California-based club
maker that struck gold this summer with its infomercial sensation
Tri-Metal line of fairway woods, was busy as the company unveiled a
new similarly constructed driver, as well as new low-slung
Tri-Metal irons. And Nike reintroduced its modified Air Zoom TW
(Tiger Woods) shoe, dropping the retail price from $225 to $160.
</P>
<P>
   Most new iron introductions reflected a return to simpler looks
with a high-tech twist. Maxfli offered two blade-like irons,
including the sharp-looking ``tour cavity'' Revolution iron, which
has been seen in Fred Couples' bag of late. Mizuno, the leading
iron company among PGA Tour players, also introduced the Comp EZ,
an oversized forged iron.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much of the talk centered on what wasn't unveiled here.
Adams Golf, whose success story has inspired many imitators,
extended its fairway wood line, but there were rumors that a new
driver is in the works for January's PGA Merchandise Show in
Orlando, Fla. Callaway Golf, which has spent $130 million in
developing a ball product line, could be ready for a debut in
January, too. Also lurking in the ball game for an Orlando rollout
is Nike, which has been showing off its prototypes to selected
parties for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a curiously low profile in Las Vegas was Taylor Made,
which had the good fortune to have its products in the bags of the
winners of three of the four majors this year, and as a result is
selling the most drivers in stores this summer, according to some
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Made's president, George Montgomery, suggested that
titanium's popularity may be coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``By my count, there have been about six million titanium
drivers sold and that's very close to the number of avid core
golfers out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the startup company, Liquidmetal Golf, think they
have just that product. Their line of drivers, irons and putters is
constructed of a special multimaterial metal alloy that is touted
as being twice as strong as titanium. Liquidmetal's waterfall booth
was anything but low profile, and so are its economics. The putters
will retail for $400, the drivers for $595 and the set of eight
irons will cost at least $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But company president John Hoefflich doesn't see anything out of
touch about the price. ``We don't sense any resistance to this
price because this is a unique product,'' he said. ``I think what's
happening is golfers have decided not to buy anything until
something better comes along. Maybe what they've been waiting for
is our product.''

HARD WORK KEEPS McEWAN AT NO. 3

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; There was no siren, no flashing red light. But Bruins
coach Bob Toledo seemed to be placing redshirt freshman quarterback
Scott McEwan, a Thousand Oaks native, on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's No. 3, but he'll get a lot of push from (true freshmen)
Ryan McCann and Cory Paus,'' Toledo said. ``They have the ability.
Now it's a matter of us coaching them. We're pleased with both of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: If McEwan did not improve quickly and
decisively, he could plummet on the depth chart _ behind not only
Cade McNown and backup Drew Bennett but also Paus and McCann, a
Westlake Village native.
</P>
<P>
   Well, McEwan has improved. He's more confident and more poised.
His passes are crisp, tight spirals, not the floating, wobbly balls
he launched in spring practice. A week into training camp, he
stands as one of UCLA's most improved players. And has established
himself as the No. 3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not doing bad,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``He still could have better accuracy. But he understands the
offense better. His fundamentals have improved. He's progressing
steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan credits his improvement to familiarity with the offense.
Last season, he was preoccupied with the passing game nuances and
abandoned his mechanics. After an offseason of studying film and
the playbook, he instinctively knows the pass patterns and can
concentrate on his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more relaxed,'' McEwan said. ``I just have to keep
improving. That can never stop, so that next year Drew and I are
fighting it out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No offense taken: Asked if he took the recruitment of Paus
and McCann as a no-confidence vote in his future, McEwan went the
diplomatic route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the competition,'' he said. ``To get pushed from behind
helps to keep you from settling. Besides, when I came in, there
were two quarterbacks (McEwan and Ed Stansbury, who has moved to
linebacker). I could have taken the whole thing personally, but
that would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!How they stand:!off! Borges on the performances of
quarterbacks not named McNown or McEwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett: ``Until (Monday) he was struggling, but he picked it
up. He's got a better spiral. He's starting to get back. Early on,
he was shaking off the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus: ``He's got a really good arm and natural leadership skills
that will manifest themselves as he gains experience.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann: ``He's exactly what we thought. He has a quick release
and a good arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a spate of injuries, McCann and Paus will redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going fast: UCLA expects a crowd of at least 70,000 for the
Sept. 12 home opener against Texas. That figure is closer to a
sellout that it would have been in the past, since offseason
renovations have reduced the Rose Bowl's seating capacity from
100,000 to 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: The Bruins experienced their first significant
injuries on the first day of full-contact workouts. Third-string
center Tony Ippolito fractured his right ankle and is out 6-8
weeks. Freshman cornerback Joe Hunter, who was expected to
redshirt, sprained his left knee and will miss 4-6 weeks. Nose
guard Ken Kocher, one of the most impressive freshmen, was carted
off the field Wednesday afternoon. The preliminary report was a
bruised right ankle.

NO MAJORS FOR TIGER, BUT SEASON IS HARDLY OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Golf's four majors are over this year, and Tiger
Woods did not win any of them.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods chose to dwell on that, he might have trouble dealing
with the rest of his year. Instead, he is focusing on the positive.
As he prepares for the NEC World Series of Golf, which begins
Thursday at Firestone Country Club, he still has a chance to put
together a splendid year, even by his lofty standards. He remains
the world's top-ranked player, leads the PGA Tour in scoring
average (69.17), leads in top 10 finishes (11) and is third on the
money list with more than $1.6 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the money title and the Vardon trophy for lowest scoring
average would put a different perspective on Woods' year. And while
he is disappointed that he has not won a major since last year's
Masters, Woods insists his season has been more encouraging than
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, I've accomplished a lot of goals,'' said Woods, who
has one victory on the PGA Tour this year (the Bell South Classic)
and one in Thailand (the Johnnie Walker Classic). ``I haven't had
as many in the win column as I would like. But I'm very excited
about the improvements I've made in my game. For this guy who is
supposedly in a slump, I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning this week, however, would be an impressive way for Woods
to reclaim golf's spotlight. The World Series features an elite
field of 44, limited to players who have won at least one
tournament during the past 12 months. Eight of the world's top 10
players are competing _ Woods, Ernie Els, Mark O'Meara, Davis Love
III, David Duval, Nick Price, Vijay Singh and Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   Singh is the hottest player in golf right now with two
consecutive victories _ the PGA Championship and the Sprint
International last weekend. By winning $360,000 on Sunday, he
became the leading money-winner on tour ($1,694,253). If he wins
this weekend, he will match the three consecutive victories Duval
finished last season with, when he won the Michelob Championship at
Kingsmill, the Walt Disney World Golf Classic and The Tour
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I'm doing right now is good, especially my
putting,'' Singh said. ``Even when I'm in trouble, I'm thinking
positive. This is the most comfortable I've ever felt.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Singh has enjoyed the recent attention that comes with
success, the media frenzy surrounding Woods has subsided since last
year, when he won four tournaments, including the Masters by a
record-setting 12 strokes. Woods' pretournament news conference
Wednesday was an example, with about 30 members of the news media
on hand and some empty chairs in every row. Last year, many of
Woods' news conferences drew at least three times that many
reporters, and Woods said he may end his policy of holding weekly
news media sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense for me to do this every single week when I'm
not the defending champion, and I've already been to this site
before,'' Woods said at Wednesday's news conference. ``If I'm
defending champion, or if I haven't been to a site before, then
yeah, I don't mind doing it. But every week, to be obligated to do
it, where some other top pros don't have to do it every week? I
think that's a problem we're going to have to try and address.''
</P>
<P>
   As for golf, Woods has improved his short game, patience and
course management, but inconsistent putting has kept him from
winning more often. Last year, Woods ranked 60th on tour in
putting. This year, he ranks 128th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods admitted he has not putted as well as a professional as he
did as an amateur. ``It's more difficult getting your speed,
because you're at different venues and on different grasses week in
and week out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between winning the money title or finishing with
the lowest scoring average, Woods said he would chose lowest
scoring average. ``It shows consistency over the entire year,''
said Woods, who has made 15 consecutive cuts, the longest current
streak on tour.
</P>
<P>
   So while Woods would like to have a few more victories this
year, he is hardly feeling a sense of urgency at 22. ``I'm maturing
as a player, and that's going to happen for a number of years,'' he
said. ``Hopefully until the day I quit playing, I'll keep
learning.''

TRAVERS COULD BE VICTORY GALLOP'S `SUMMERTIME DERBY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Victory Gallop, the only veteran of the
Kentucky Derby who will run in the Travers Stakes, lay quietly in
his stall Wednesday morning after an easy jog around the track at
Saratoga Race Course. His trainer, Elliott Walden, considered the
shifting fortunes of life in the big leagues of racing and said:
``You hate to be overconfident, but I like where we are coming into
the Travers.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Walden is: His star colt, second in the Derby in
May to Real Quiet and second in the Haskell in July to Coronado's
Quest, will run in ``the summertime Derby'' on Saturday with a new
jockey and one old and dangerous rival. The jockey is Alex Solis,
who replaces the injured Gary Stevens; the old rival is Coronado's
Quest, the dynamite horse of the season's second half, who will
fight Victory Gallop for the leadership of the 3-year-old division.
</P>
<P>
   Seven colts were poised to enter the Travers Stakes when post
positions are drawn on Thursday, but Victory Gallop, who won the
Belmont Stakes, remained the only one with Triple Crown
credentials. Still, he was in the position of a baseball team that
has a scrapbook but not yet a championship, with half the season to
play. And Coronado's Quest was alive, with four victories in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Walden said that he was not perturbed by the change in jockeys.
Stevens, the regular rider on Victory Gallop, tore ligaments in his
knee at Del Mar last weekend. But Solis was the rider when Victory
Gallop won the Arkansas Derby in April and ran second in the
Kentucky Derby one month later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly don't like to make changes at this stage,'' the
trainer said, ``but it won't affect Victory Gallop. Alex has ridden
him before, and won on him before, so that won't make any
difference. And remember, this horse is used to adversity. We had
to deal with a skin rash and a broken ankle before the Belmont
Stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The skin rash bedeviled Victory Gallop for a couple of weeks,
making it uncomfortable for him to be saddled; the broken ankle
bedeviled Walden, who broke it while playing in a pickup basketball
game. But they both endured, and Victory Gallop indeed defeated
Real Quiet by a nose in the Belmont and ruined his shot at sweeping
the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But Coronado's Quest had his own problems: His springtime was
spoiled by violent behavior before races and later by a foot
injury. He has emerged to become the monster of the second half of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very much on the same schedule as Seeking the Gold was
for his Travers,'' said Shug McGaughey, who trained both horses.
``They both ran in the Dwyer and the Haskell.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the Gold lost the Haskell in 1988 and then the Travers
to Forty Niner, who is the sire of Coronado's Quest. McGaughey did
win the Travers twice, with Easy Goer in 1989 and Rhythm in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest did some galloping Wednesday morning, then was
led to the paddock before noon. It was his first visit to the
Saratoga paddock and he became ornery, but McGaughey accepted his
behavior with the assurance of a man who has been there before.
</P>
<P>
   The two big horses expect to be confronted in the Travers by
Raffie's Majesty, Grand Slam, Archers Bay, Dice Dancer and Deputy
Diamond. Those choosing other races included Thomas Jo, Limit Out
and Tomorrow's Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zuckerman, the owner of Tomorrow's Cat, agonized over the
decision, saying at one point: ``What if the hurricane hits?'' To
which his trainer, Mark Hennig, replied: ``Don, I'm not even sure a
hurricane would help us.'' &QL;

HUIZENGA ON ANDRO-GATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dr. Robert Huizenga probably has as much insight
into the power and destructiveness of performance-enhancing drugs
than any doctor working in sports medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga was a team doctor for the Los Angeles Raiders, a period
of his medical career that was a fertile clinic into the medical
and drug abuses in professional sports, by the athletes themselves
as well as their alleged medical caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   As the personal physician for Lyle Alzado, he had a
heartbreaking ringside seat for the former Raiders' tortured death
due to cancer after years of steroid use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyle denied using steroids viciously until he developed a
life-threatening cancer as a result of them,'' Huizenga said. ``He
spent the rest of his life telling people how dangerous steroids
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, messages like those are rarely long-lasting and
do not always get to the right people. That's exactly where
Huizenga separates himself from the tumult of the Mark McGwire
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who is challenging baseball's home run record, last
week acknowledged that he is taking androstenedione, a product the
body turns into testosterone. It is not banned by baseball, but it
is banned in the NFL, NCAA and Olympic community. Those on the
extreme edges of the controversy have been quick to either admonish
or exonerate McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga sees a lot of gray area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern about this issue and Andro concerns all of
the Little Leaguers and kids who want to emulate their heroes,'' he
said. ``That's more worrisome to me than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know kids are looking for ways to get bigger. At the time
Lyle died, the estimates said 5-to-10 percent of high school-age
kids had used anabolic steroids, and a third of those weren't even
in sports. Medically, the consensus is that adolescents who use any
form of testosterone are more susceptible to side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have the desire to attain adult stature, become more
aggressive, get the girls. There are as many social issues involved
as there are sports issues.''
</P>
<P>
   When Huizenga looks at McGwire, he understands fully why the
Cardinals' first baseman chose to take andro, and that he is hardly
the only baseball player doing it, and that there are no studies
which confirm any long term dangers.
</P>
<P>
   But kids don't make those kind of distinctions, and andro does
not offer the black-and-white simplicity of anabolic steroids.
Huizenga can tell a college freshman that steroids killed his
friend Alzado.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a poor doctor to do about education when a drug, which
seems to augment performance, offers no evidence of long-term side
effect because there are no decent long-term studies?'' Huizenga
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, honest education can encourage young athletes to
use a certain drug. They see McGwire as a role model and they
decide to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The andro issue is reminiscent of another sports medicine
situation from our past.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, at the height of rampant steroid use and abuse in
track and field, especially in East Germany and the Soviet Union, a
San Gabriel-based doctor, Dr. Robert Kerr, felt that limited
steroid use, under a doctor's careful guidance, could be beneficial
without any long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr eventually gave up the fight not because he changed his
mind on steroids, but because he could not control human nature.
His athlete patients succumbed to peer pressure and exceeded his
modest, monitored dosage behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Andro, in at least one sense, is a victim of guilt by
association. The leagues and organizations that test for steroids
and testosterone levels the NFL, NCAA and Olympics found andro
while they were looking for steroids or high testosterone levels.
</P>
<P>
   As a synthetic form of testosterone, those organizations put
andro on the list of banned substance simply because they knew it
had muscle-building properties. It was a buckshot approach to
shooting down use of any kind of performance-enhancing product.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic groups have known about it since the '60s. The NFL
didn't add it to its list until 1996. ``The NFL does random testing
for elevated test levels, and andro can certainly alter that,''
Huizenga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we don't have all of the answers. There are no
long-term studies because the product is relatively new.''
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga said a lot of natural substances are sold over the
counter. But just because they're natural does not mean they are
necessarily safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) doesn't regulate it,
we have no way of knowing (if it is safe),'' he said. ``It wasn't
that long ago where tryptophan was sold as a sleep aid. All it took
was one bad batch to kill a few people and take the product off the
shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga would hate to see a drug witch hunt, or as he put it,
``reefer madness.'' Ironically, he noted that the World Health
Organization recently declared that testosterone can be used safely
as a male contraceptive, ``so there's a little bit of a double
standard here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question comes to where we draw the line?''
</P>
<P>
   And who is doing the drawing.

AREA CLASS DOWN FROM LAST YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Dick Lascola, who operates the
Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Service, says that this year's
crop of Southern California prep football talent is not as good as
last season.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, may not be as bad as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought last year was one of the best we've had in a long
time,'' said Lascola, in his 22nd year scouting prep talent.
</P>
<P>
   Lascola did add that this year's crop is ``better than
average.'' But one area of concern is the lack of quarterback
depth.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Southern California quarterbacks whom Lascola does
like are Poly's Chris Lewis (6-foot-4, 200) and Venice's J.P.
Losman (6-3, 180).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lewis) is a big-time player,'' Lascola said. ``(Losman) had a
good year on a terrible team. I was impressed watching him and he
figures to get even better.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other pure quarterback Lascola lists as a preseason top
prospect is Moreno Valley's Kevin Jackson (6-4, 200).
</P>
<P>
   We'll now lead you through his views of some other top Southern
California talent in the world according to Lascola:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Poly has an awesome team this year,'' Lascola said. He
mentioned Lewis, running back Larry Croom (5-9, 185), receiver
Kareem Kelly
</P>
<P>
   (6-1, 185) and cornerback Darrell Rideaux (5-9, 175) as
Jackrabbits to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Amat safety-receiver Dennis Wyrick (6-1, 205) and running
back Mike Wagner (5-9, 180) should draw plenty of attention.
Wagner, though, is coming off a junior season-ending hip injury and
Wyrick may choose a future as a baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   The best Southern California running back could be bruising 6-1,
225-pound Joe Weber of Pacific. ``He's a kid who it seems has been
around forever,'' Lascola said. ``He has to be one of the top kids
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Westchester offensive linemen Courtney Morgan (6-2, 315)
``passes the look test. Now we'll see if he can play.'' Morgan will
block for Charles Drake, one of the region's best running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar has a pair of the top prospects in running back-safety
Corey Neal
</P>
<P>
   (5-11, 175) and tight end George Wrigster (6-4, 225).
</P>
<P>
   A trio of running back-defensive back types to watch are
Monrovia's Akil Harris (6-0, 195), Highland's Brandon McElvaine
</P>
<P>
   (6-1, 218) and Fontana's Cameron Spence (6-0, 180).
</P>
<P>
   Riverside North's Cory Kipp is ``a guy we like a lot,'' Lascola
said. The 6-5, 246-pound Kipp, by the way, visited USC's practice
last week and spent some time with defensive line coach Ed Orgeron
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top prospects in Northern California are Concord De
La Salle back Atari Callen (5-10, 185), Oakland Skyline linebacker
Omar Nazel (6-4, 215), Fresno Edison athlete Ricky Manning (5-10,
160) and Sacramento Grant running back Onterrio Smith (5-11, 200).
A trio of linemen to watch are Hanford's Chris Murphy (6-7, 280),
Stockton St. Mary's Joe Blunt (6-5, 280) and Hughson's Luke Mackay
(6-5, 250).
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``very average year'' for San Diego area prospects.
``There are only about eight (big-time) kids, other than that,
nobody stands out,'' Lascola said. Offensive linemen Mike Sullivan
</P>
<P>
   (6-7, 305) of Vista and linebacker Ammon Mauga (6-0, 210) of
Oceanside stand out as much as anybody. Running back Rashaan
Sanders (6-0, 185) and quarterback Detroci Watts (6-0, 175) of tiny
San Diego Horizon could be big-time players. Offensive lineman
Gerald Sykes (6-4, 290) of San Diego Kearney is another guy to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's very early in the evaluation. ``It's a
wait-and-see-type situation,'' Lascola said.

   Is Randall going to Texas?
</P>
<P>
   As we've said before, early commitments aren't written in stone.
Texas supposedly landed its 14th prospect with the announcement by
Houston Yates offensive lineman Alfio Randall (6-5, 265) after an
unofficial visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I committed to the coaches,'' Randall was quoted as
saying. ``My family and I really loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, though, had a different view: ``Alfio is not
committed to any school. We did visit Austin and loved it. We were
very impressed.''

   Get a head start in Nevada
</P>
<P>
   The first Friday for high school football in Southern California
is Sept.11, but if you want to get a head start, venture to Nevada.
The Nevada season actually opens up this weekend, but perhaps the
most interesting matchup in the first two weeks comes on Sept. 5.
On that day, traditional power and perennially national-ranked St.
Louis of Honolulu comes to Las Vegas to play Green Valley of nearby
Henderson in the Silver Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has a big-time prospect in linebacker Joe Siofele
</P>
<P>
   (6-2, 230) and a several others who could be playing in college
real soon. Defensive lineman Junior Tagoai (6-3, 290) and running
back Noah Campbell
</P>
<P>
   (6-0, 215) are drawing interest. Offensive lineman Shayne
Kajioika (6-4, 340) and receiver Kanale George (5-11, 160) are also
worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   Green Valley knocked off Poly in the 1996 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   BYU's receiving corps took a major hit when Jonathan Pittman and
Eugene Childs both failed to qualify. Pittman is a former St. John
Bosco and Long Beach City College receiver and Childs is a recent
graduate of Westchester.
