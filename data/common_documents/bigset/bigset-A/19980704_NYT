WONDER NO MORE  
 ATRODOME LOSES MUST-SEE STATUS

   HOUSTON - Buck Showalter lifted his right sneaker and stamped it
on the carpet of the tiny office where he sat. ``I've killed eight
roaches,'' the Diamondbacks manager announced.
</P>
<P>
   It once was the Taj Mahal of sports. When the stadium, like no
other, opened in 1965 it was billed as the Eighth Wonder of the
World.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sadly, at 34 the Astrodome is old, outdated, unwanted,
considered as obsolete as Bank One Ballpark and all the other new
sports palaces may be someday.
</P>
<P>
   A $265 million stadium is under construction in downtown
Houston. In the year 2000 the Astros will vacate this place, an
architectural triumph so futuristic and grand that when Joe
Garagiola saw the first major league game played beneath its domed
roof, he marveled at the structure's majesty and size.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put a cemetery behind home plate,'' he joked, ``you'd
never have to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Astros can't wait to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sports stadiums are like athletes. They experience a birth, a
flowering, an aging, eventually a death. The Astrodome reminds us
that the only things in life that last forever are our memories.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle hit the first Astrodome home run in an exhibition
game. Garagiola, then a New York Yankees broadcaster, still can see
the ball, jumping off Mick's bat, as all eyes followed its historic
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit right up there,'' Garagiola recalled, pointing to a
frozen lemonade sign beyond the wall in left centerfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dome's first year the Astros put together a 10-game win
streak. Suspicious, the Mets accused the home team of manipulating
the air-conditioning system so that the currents helped the Astros
long balls and hindered those hit by the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   A home run, or Domer, was cause for joyous celebration. The $2
million scoreboard featured a 45-second ``home-run extravaganza.''
Whenever a Houston player hit one out the giant board exploded.
Well, it didn't actually ``explode,'' but came to life like a
pyrotechnic mural of Texana. Six-guns fired. Bullets richocheted
with a spark and a whine. Nostrils flaring, a bull that viewed
opponents' home runs with bovine indifference, breathed fire after
an Astro parked an offering. In approval, the animal emitted a long
slaughterhouse bellow.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the scoreboard was dismantled several years ago in the
name of progress. ``I miss it,'' Houston Manager and former Astros
pitcher Larry Dierker said. ``It gave this place its personality.
Other than the scoreboard,'' said Dierker, whose team beat the
Diamondbacks, 6-5, Friday night, ``I don't have have a lot of
strong feelings of nostalgia. I'd like to win a World Series here
before we leave. We've never done that.'' Dierker smiled. ``We're
on a fairly tight schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bank One Ballpark, the Astrodome originally had a grass
field. But the experiment was shortlived. Outfielders discovered
that in daytime fly balls were uncatchable when the sun glared
through the ceiling tiles. When the skylights were painted, the
grass died. AstroTurf was born.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome became home for a team that never achieved greatness,
although some of the critters living here did. As Showalter warily
eyed the carpet around him, I told him of the time years ago I saw
a very large rodent scurrying around a corner in the darkened
bowels of the Astrodome. Its pink tail was thick as a telephone
cord. Its beady eyes gleamed. I'll swear, the thing was big as a
muskrat.
</P>
<P>
   Blank-faced, Buck listened to the story without comment.
Obviously, he was less concerned with giant rats than he was the
Astros' red-hot bats.
</P>
<P>
   The world celebrated the birth of indoor, all- weather baseball
here in 1965. ``I never saw anything so gaudy in my life as this
place when it was brand new,'' Garagiola recalled. ``I remember
thinking `I can't believe we're playing inside.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola remembered the time Lindsey Nelson broadcast an
Astros-Mets game from a gondola suspended from the apex of the
Dome. Before the game, the gondola, which looked like the basket of
a hot-air balloon, was lowered and the announcer, and an assistant,
climbed aboard. Then cables slowly hoisted them toward the roof.
Eyes upturned, fans waved and cheered. It looked like a scene from
the movie, ``Around The World in 80 Days''.
</P>
<P>
   Now? ``Now,'' Garagiola said, shaking his head, ``they refer to
this place as a penitentiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter must have been reading my mind. ``I wonder,'' the
skipper said, thinking of the new Taj Mahal in downtown Phoenix,
``if they'll be talking about our place like that someday?'' &QL;

SMITH ADDS LUMME TO COYOTES DE FENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - At last, the defense rests.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith, who has been hellbent in
his two-plus seasons in Phoenix trying to bolster the team's
sagging defensive corps, made perhaps his most expensive purchase
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning transaction, he managed to land possibly the best
unrestricted free-agent defenseman available on the open market,
luring veteran Jyrki Lumme of the Vancouver Canucks with a
five-year, $17 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lumme, 31, who was rumored to be heading to Toronto, Calgary,
Edmonton or Chicago, agreed to terms after three days of intense,
behind-the-scenes negotiations between Smith and agent Don Baizley.
</P>
<P>
   He will earn $2.8 million next season, $2.9 million the next and
$3.1 million and $3.2 million in the third and fourth years. Lumme,
who also will receive a $2 million signing bonus payable over years
two through four, holds the option on the fifth year of the deal at
$3 million. He made $1.7 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the Winnipeg Jets has always been that the team
was weak on defense,'' Smith said. ``Well, this is now the best
defense this franchise has ever had. I've made a very concentrated
effort to improve our defense, and now, by adding a player of Jyrki
Lumme's quality, I can proudly say, `Mission accomplished.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since the franchise relocated from Winnipeg in 1996-97 and
became the Coyotes, Smith has brought in a handful of other quality
defensemen, including Keith Carney, Gerald Diduck and Murray Baron.
Late in 1995-96, the club also obtained promising young defenseman
Oleg Tverdovsky from Anaheim as part of the Teemu Selanne trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fairly easy decision to sign with Phoenix,'' Lumme
said from his home in Vancouver. ``The last three days, I spent
most of my time walking around the house and talking on the phone.
At times, I was pretty confused and didn't know what the hell was
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of teams talking to us, but every time my
wife (Minna) and I talked about it, it always came back to Phoenix.
In the end, it was Phoenix all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith made trade overtures to Vancouver for Lumme last season
but backed away because he was set to become an unrestricted free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1, 215-pound Lumme, a native of Tampere, Finland, has
scored 85 goals and 345 points in his 10-year NHL career. Known
primarily as a cunning, stay-at-home defenseman, Lumme has led the
Canucks' blue-liners in scoring each of the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, playing for last-place Vancouver, he scored nine
goals and added 21 assists for 30 points _ the seventh time he's
had at least that many. His best year came in 1993-94, when he
tallied 13 goals and 32 assists (55 points) and helped the Canucks
into the Stanley Cup Finals against the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a minus-25 rating last season, however, but that was
of no concern to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played with Jyrki (in Montreal), I've watched him play,
and he's an excellent defenseman,'' Smith said. ``His plus-minus
rating just shows how much he was on the ice for a very bad team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumme, who played for Finland's bronze-medal winning team at the
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, probably will be paired on the
Coyotes' No. 1 defensive unit with countryman and Olympic teammate
Teppo Numminen, whom he has known for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of quality players in Phoenix,'' Lumme said.
``They've got guys who can score, good goaltending, and a great mix
on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Smith said he had little interest in pursuing any
pricey free agents. But Smith said he began negotiations with
Baizley, who also represents Numminen, at 5 a.m. Wednesday, when
the free-agent signing period began. Lumme was said to be close to
signing with several teams, but the Coyotes were always in the
picture, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Baizley does a good job of keeping business to himself,
and I made sure I didn't speak to the media about this because I
thought it enhanced our chances by not having rumors all over the
place,'' Smith said. ``This signing should really underscore
ownership's commitment to bringing a winner to this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smith and owner Richard Burke need to decide what they will
do about captain Keith Tkachuk. The team's leading scorer each of
the past three seasons, Tkachuk may hold out if his contract is not
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who has two years left on his current deal at $2.8
million and $3 million, rejected a three-year extension that would
have paid him a total of $33 million. He is seeking a deal worth
almost $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smith pulled the offer off the table and said negotiation are
finished at this point. NHL sources said that unless Tkachuk comes
down on his demands, the Coyotes won't attempt to bargain and will
expect Tkachuk to honor the final two years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined to discuss Tkachuk's situation Friday and would
not say if the $17 million being thrown at Lumme was money the team
had earmarked for Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a subject for a different day,'' Smith said. &QL;

MAYFIELD'S CAREER ACCELERATES  
 YOUNG DRIVER A SURPRISE AT SEASON'S HALFWAY POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that time again.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Winston Cup Series has reached its midway juncture,
and all the familiar faces and names again are congregating atop
the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   All except one: Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Although he possesses a hearty right foot and the undeniable
talent to transform an ordinary career into a blessed one, few, if
any, preseason prognosticators believed Mayfield would be more than
a bit player this season.
</P>
<P>
   But there Mayfield is, right smack in the middle of a tightly
contested points race involving most of stock-car racing's
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   In first place is two-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who
leads Mayfield by 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   In third place is Mark Martin, who trails Mayfield by only 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   And in fourth is Dale Jarrett, who is so close to Martin in the
driver's standings, he could reach out and tap him on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubted Gordon, Martin and Jarrett would wage a Star Wars
battle for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayfield?
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield entered the season with 110 career starts, no wins,
five top-five finishes and no finish higher than 13th in the final
driver's standings.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   But in 16 of 33 starts this season, Mayfield has been absolutely
Gordon-like, scoring eight top-five finishes, including his first
trip into victory lane two weeks ago at Pocono (Pa.) International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield actually led the standings as late as last Sunday at
Sears Point (Calif.) Raceway. But a poor 18th-place finish dropped
him one spot behind Gordon, whose fourth win of the year catapulted
him into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Why the drastic Mayfield turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mayfield, 29, and Rusty Wallace were one-car
entities in a series seemingly favoring the popular multicar
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   But car owner Michael Kranefuss, who owned Mayfield's machine,
and Roger Penske, who mostly owned Wallace's team, decided to merge
their operations during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Presto.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield and Wallace both have spent many Sundays this season
swapping the points lead, and both still are threats to capture the
driving title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working toward winning the championship,'' Mayfield
said. ``That's not a prediction or a guarantee, just what we're
trying to do. I can't imagine doing anything and not trying to be
the very best you can be at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was racing go-carts as a kid, I wanted to be the best
go-cart racer out there. I wanted to be the best at street stocks
or late models and now at Winston Cup. I can't imagine being in
anything, much less something as intense and competitive as Winston
Cup racing, and not doing everything you can do to win races and
win championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a taste of it. We got a taste of winning at
Pocono, and believe me, I can't think of anything that could be
more addictive. We've gotten a taste of leading the points, and
there is a pretty good taste there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the last time Mayfield savors it, according to
three-time champion Darrell Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy is such a good guy,'' said Waltrip, who, like Mayfield,
hails from Owensboro, Ky. ``I've known his family for years. I
remember seeing Jeremy at the racetrack when he was a little old
snotty 12-year-old kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shown he has the maturity to lead the points and get good
finishes. Now he's shown he knows how to win races. I feel
confident he'll be a Winston Cup champion.''
</P>
<P>
   If not this season, surely not too far down the road, Mayfield
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season has a long way to go,'' said Mayfield, who finished
third in the season-opening Daytona 500. ``There are a lot of great
chances for us to win more races, and there are a lot of great
chances to pick up a lot more points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were in this for the long haul from the beginning.
We knew it was a long way to go and there would be ups and downs
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And what Mayfield wants to do now is do what so many others
before him have done. He wants to be fitted with a Winston Cup
crown. &QL;

MERCURY ADOPTS RUN GAME  
 SUBBING KEEPS STARTERS FRESH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The difference in Mercury point guard Michelle
Timms between this season and last season has not shown up yet.
</P>
<P>
   And it won't happen today either when Phoenix (7-2) plays at
Eastern Conference leader Charlotte (7-2). Check back in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch run and playoff time are when the Mercury hopes that
Timms, who needed an Energizer for all her court time last year,
will look as fresh as a rookie in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the arrival of fellow Aussie point guard Kristi
Harrower, Timms' minutes per game have been slashed from 35.8 last
season to 29.7 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was playing 38 minutes a game at some points,''
Timms said. ``That's crazy in this league. I can't play 38-40
minutes a game and play quality minutes. It's nice to have Kristi
come in and have nothing lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury philosophy does not stop at point guard. No Phoenix
player ranks in the WNBA top 20 for minutes played. That's all the
more amazing considering there are only 10 teams, and every other
squad has a player in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jennifer Gillom leads the minutes column with 30.6 a
game, down slightly from last year. She played 34 minutes in
Thursday's 76-61 victory at Cleveland, but she was in a 29-point
zone that Coach Cheryl Miller did not want to derail.
</P>
<P>
   Every other starter averages less than 30 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to introduce a running game, and you can't run
for 38-40 minutes,'' said forward Michelle Griffiths, who is
averaging 9.1 points in 24.6 minutes per contest. ``This year's
team has a lot more depth. We need our big girls to run. It'll make
the difference for us reaching the championship. If we can run the
whole game, what sort of defense is going to stop us for 40
minutes?''
</P>
<P>
   Harrower, who made the team on a one-day tryout, may be the
bench's biggest blessing despite having the lowest scoring average
(1.8). She has become a player Miller trusts to run the point in
some of this season's most crucial game moments.
</P>
<P>
   Harrower's assist-to-turnover ratio of 1.9 to 1 rivals Timms'
2.2 to 1, and she get assists more frequently in her 11.8 minutes a
game. They are the team's two least-accurate shooters with Timms at
32.1 percent and Harrower at 30.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All 11 active players and the two on the injured list have seen
important minutes. It's part of the Miller game plan to force the
tempo, wearing down opponents with pressure defense and the
transition game.
</P>
<P>
   It just won't work with a seven- or eight-player rotation,
especially by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the telling factor,'' Timms said. ``We can
go about 25 or 30 minutes a game, so we're going to be a lot
fresher than the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix will see a team today that is about as fresh as can be.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte has been off for the past four days, stewing over a
horrid 60-49 loss Monday at Detroit that ended the Sting's
five-game win streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury also were lamenting after blowing that June 21 home
game against Charlotte, which won, 72-71, on a last-second Tracy
Reid jumper. &QL;

COYOTES LOSE JANSSENS; BARON PROBABLY LEAVING SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes lost free-agent center Mark Janssens to
the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday, and defenseman Murray Baron might
not be too far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Janssens, acquired late last season from the New York Islanders
for a ninth-round draft pick, signed a one-year deal with the
Blackhawks. The 30-year-old scored one goal and added two assists
in seven games with the Coyotes, but he was the fifth-best faceoff
man in the NHL in 74 games, split between Anaheim, New York and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's biggest catch of the day was free-agent center Doug
Gilmour, 35, who agreed to a three-year contract worth $18 million
after efforts to land free-agent right wing Brett Hull failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who has spent nearly 11 seasons with the St. Louis Blues,
signed with the Dallas Stars instead. The Coyotes, who will move
into the Pacific Division along with Dallas next season, will meet
Hull and the Stars six times in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Baron, 31, who became an unrestricted free agent Wednesday, is
being courted by several teams, including the Coyotes. Baron
rejected a three-year, $5.1 million offer from the club early last
season. He made $875,000 last season and seeks a deal worth nearly
$2 million a season, according to his agent, Steve Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain said Baron had been considering accepting a lesser
offer to remain a Coyote. Phoenix, however, probably no longer is
interested after signing Jyrki Lumme on Friday. Tampa Bay, Toronto,
Vancouver and Chicago have expressed interest in signing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really called just to find out what the ballpark figure was
that he's been looking at,'' Lightning Coach Jacques Demers said.
``We haven't made him an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron, acquired from Montreal two years ago in the Dave Manson
trade, is no longer considered a top-four defenseman by the
Coyotes. They have Teppo Numminen, Keith Carney, Gerald Diduck and
Oleg Tverdovsky rated ahead of him. They also want to give more
playing time to youngsters Deron Quint and Jason Doig, which would
seem to preclude them from attempting to re-sign Baron.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith, who suggested he probably will pass
on signing any big names on the free-agent list this summer, has
made qualifying offers to restricted free agents Shane Doan, Dallas
Drake, Bob Corkum, Carney, Doig and Quint. All of them, with the
possible exception of Corkum, are expected to re-sign with the club
within the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, who also is represented by Mountain, reportedly seeks a
multiyear deal worth at least $1.2 million. That might be too much
for the Coyotes, who paid the third-line checking center about
$500,000 last season. &QL;

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mike James will have season-ending arm surgery
sometime next week, but the loss of the hard-throwing set-up man
hardly affects the Anaheim Angels' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   James hasn't pitched since May 4 when he suffered a partially
torn flexor muscle in his right forearm. Angels manager Terry
Collins has used a variety of pitchers to fill James' roll, and for
now is splitting the duty between Rich DeLucia and Shigetoshi
Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa's success might be considered a surprise after his
season last year (3-7, 3.93 ERA in 50 games), but last year was an
adjustment year coming from Japan, where he was a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa (3-1, 3.48 ERA in 1998) lifted weights during the
offseason and improved the velocity on his fastball from the high
80s to low 90s. Hasegawa also has benefited from the pitchers'
program in the majors as opposed to the program in Japan. In Japan,
pitchers routinely throw every day, even on days after making
100-plus pitches in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great discipline,'' Collins said. ``The weights
obviously helped and the program's different. He doesn't throw
every single day, so his arm has time to build up.''
</P>
<P>
   James had a 1.93 ERA in 11 games this year before sustaining the
injury. The surgery he'll have will be exploratory. His rehab time
could take anywhere from six months to a year, depending on what
problems doctors find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, of course (it's frustrating),'' James said. ``I'm not
here to sit around. But I really don't have a choice. I was waiting
around and it wasn't getting any better.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he has had elbow problems all his career and is
hoping the surgery will take care of it once and for all. The
difficult part will be watching the Angels move on without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard,'' he said. ``I'm glad they're doing good. But it
makes it hard because I've got to sit back and I can't contribute,
I can't help.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Who's available:!off! The Angels are continuing in their
quest to trade for a starting pitcher. There will be many available
between now and the July 31 trading deadline, but one they've had a
close eye on for a while now is Kansas City's Tim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is 7-7 with a 3.93 ERA for the Royals this season.
</P>
<P>
   Who would the Angels have to give up? Teams are interested in
pitcher Scott Schoeneweis (6-5, 4.57 ERA in 16 starts at Triple-A
Vancouver), but the Angels are reluctant to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Another sought-after Angels prospect is outfielder Norm
Hutchins, who is hitting .305 with six homers, 27 RBI and 23 stolen
bases at Double-A Midland.

ODDS AND ENDS OF NASCAR AT THE MID POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; RUMOR MILL &QL; 
This is what they're whispering along pit road and in garages all
along the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit about what may happen during
the second half of the season. &QL; 
Scheduling &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the 1999 schedule is released later this year, don't be
surprised if it includes a race at the Homestead (Fla.) Motorsports
Complex. That's almost a certainty. If no current facility loses an
event, the schedule will increase to 34 races. Darlington (S.C.)
Raceway had been rumored as a racetrack that might lose one of its
two races, but Darlington President and General Manager Jim Hunter
has been lobbying vociferously against such a move. Hunter's
actions may have spared the ax for at least one more season. In the
future, if not next year, second-race dates will be given to
California Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway. Phoenix International
Raceway also could get a second race, perhaps as early as 2001.
Kansas City likely will get a race in 2000. &QL; 
Crew changes? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although crew chief Larry McReynolds is wrenching for Mike
Skinner, it may not be long before both are gone. Skinner has only
one top-10 finish, and McReynolds makes too much money to be second
string. There's been talk that Joe Gibbs may hire McReynolds to be
Tony Stewart's crew chief next year. That might be a long shot. If
Skinner gets the pink slip, car owner Richard Childress would love
to hire Dale Earnhardt Jr., which would form a father-son team. But
the elder Earnhardt wants his son to remain in the NASCAR Busch
Series for another year or two of seasoning. Besides, when the
younger Earnhardt graduates to the Winston Cup level, the elder
Earnhardt wants him to drive on his Cup team. &QL; 
Lepage makes move &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lepage will join the mix at Roush Racing next season,
which makes for speculation that Ted Musgrave will be the odd man
out. Although Musgrave is winless in 232 career starts, he's too
good not to be picked up by someone.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Series leader Matt Kenseth likely will join Michael
Waltrip next season at Wood Brothers Racing. Car owner Jack Roush
will form an alliance with Eddie and Len Wood, in effect making for
a seven-car operation. Beep beep.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Craven, who has missed several races due to injury, may
have to finish strong to protect his ride at Hendrick Motorsports. &QL; 
Gordon plotting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham may form a Busch Series
team next season. If so, they likely will attempt to qualify for
only about five races.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine is in trouble. He was asked to sit out tonight's
Pepsi 400 and was replaced by Loy Allen Jr. Bodine, however, hasn't
officially lost the ride. Too bad. Bodine is a good driver. Maybe
the team needs overhauling. &QL; 
Sponsor blues &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Bill Davis has lost the team's major sponsor, which
may mean Ward Burton will be job hunting in the off-season. He
won't have to wait long by the telephone. Like Todd Bodine, he's
too talented.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Series driver Buckshot Jones will be a Winston Cup regular
next season, either with his own team or possibly with the Stavola
Brothers. &QL; 
It's time to wave bye-bye to the first half of the season. But not
without one last look over the shoulder: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; REARVIEW MIRROR &QL; 
By the numbers &QL; 
Next weekend's Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire International
Speedway in Loudon, N.H., will be the 17th of 33 races this season
and will mark the year's halfway point. It also is the 1,830th race
since the series was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Eight drivers have won the 16 races in 1998 _ Jeff Gordon
(Rockingham, Bristol, Charlotte, Sears Point), Mark Martin (Las
Vegas, Texas, California, Michigan), Dale Jarrett (Darlington,
Dover), Bobby Labonte (Atlanta, Talladega), Jeremy Mayfield
(Pocono), Terry Labonte (Richmond), Dale Earnhardt (Daytona) and
Bobby Hamilton (Martinsville).
</P>
<P>
   Only 74 points separates the top four drivers. The top five are
separated by 210 points, which is 77 points less than what
separated them in 1997. Two years ago, the top five were separated
by 362 points.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 314 lead changes in 16 races, an average of 19.6
per race.
</P>
<P>
   It's not how many miles a driver completes, but how miles he
leads. Brett Bodine has completed 6,601 miles of a possible 6,649
(99.2 percent), but ranks 21st in the driver standings. Bodine has
led twice, one of which lasted only one lap.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon has led 1,167 miles, the most of any driver. Mark
Martin is next at 1,028.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also has led more laps (864), 180 more than Martin (684).
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, has pocketed more money than anyone with
$1,823,630 in winnings. Dale Earnhardt ($1,749,255) is next, thanks
to his Daytona 500 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet and Ford are running neck-and-neck. Each manufacturer
has had wins, and they are tied in points with 113. Pontiac has two
wins and 78 points.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford has led 2,611 of the 4,962 laps raced (52.6 percent).
Chevy has led 1,791 laps (39.7 percent) and Pontiac has led 380
laps (7.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A Ford has claimed 50 of the 80 top-five finishing positions
(62.5 percent). Chevy has 23 top fives (28.75 percent) and Pontiac
has seven (8.75 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Lap-leader bonus points go a long way in helping a driver
capture the Winston Cup crown. Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin each
have scored 75 extra points. Dale Jarrett has accumulated 70, 30
more than Jeremy Mayfield. &QL; 
Fast track &QL; 
Ten different drivers have posted top qualifying times. Jeff Gordon
(five), Bobby Labonte (two) and Rusty Wallace (two) are the only
repeat winners.
</P>
<P>
   Pole sitters have gone on to win four races, three by Gordon. &QL; 
First-year blues &QL; 
Four first timers are vying for Rookie of the Year. Kenny Irwin
leads with 176 points and is 26th overall in the driver standings.
Kevin Lepage is 36th overall and has 141 rookie points. Jerry
Nadeau (38th, 137 points) and Steve Park (55th, 25) are next. Only
Irwin has recorded a top-10 finish (fifth at Atlanta). Park is
injured and has made only two starts. &QL; 
KO'd in Atlanta &QL; 
Park also receives the hard-knock award, which, appropriately,
occurred in Atlanta, the home of heavyweight boxing champion
Evander Holyfield. Park suffered a broken right femur, a broken
left collarbone, a broken right shoulder blade and two chipped
teeth in a nasty crash at Atlanta Motor Speedway on March 6. Park
won't return until the Brickyard 400 on Aug. 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mast nearly was knocked for a loop during his flight to
Atlanta from San Francisco following last Sunday's race. Mast
experienced chills, and the plane made an emergency landing at
Denver, where it was thought the driver was experiencing
dehydration. Mast, however, instead was treated for carbon monoxide
poisoning, which apparently stemmed from the race. &QL; 
Tidbits &QL; 
Dave Marcis leads all active drivers with 839 career starts, five
this season. Richard Petty leads with 1,177 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   With 33 career wins, Jeff Gordon has moved past Fireball Roberts
into sole possession of 16th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine cars were on the lead lap at the end of last
Sunday's race at Sears Point (Calif.) Raceway, tying a modern-era
(since 1971) record. The record was established three years ago,
also at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett has led more races (13) than any driver this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield (second) and Jimmy Spencer (ninth) are the only
drivers among the current top 10 who were not in that group in the
final 1997 standings. Missing are Bill Elliott (11th) and Ken
Schrader (12th).
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five (81 percent) of the 80 top-five finishes have been
recorded by multicar teams. Roush Racing, which employs five
drivers, leads with 19. Penske Racing (two drivers) has 16, and
Hendrick Motorsports (three) has 15. Robert Yates Racing (two) has
11.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven drivers that comprise Team Sabco, Elliott Racing
and Petty Enterprises, only Joe Nemechek and John Andretti (one
each) have posted a top-five finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WHO'S HOT, WHO'S NOT &QL; 
HOT &QL; 
 &QL; Some days
are diamonds and some days are coal. The following are recent
examples of the good, the bad and the ugly:
</P>
<P>
   1. Jeremy Mayfield has only one win, but he is the only driver
on the circuit to post a top-25 finish in all 16 races. He also has
finished 15th or better in 13 races.
</P>
<P>
   2. After consecutive finishes of 29th and 23rd, Mark Martin has
reeled off seven straight finishes of seventh or better, including
two victories.
</P>
<P>
   3. In the season's first four races, Jeff Gordon finished 16th
or worse three times. But over the past 12 races, Gordon has nine
top-five finishes, including two wins.
</P>
<P>
   4. It's almost been feast or famine for Dale Jarrett. He
finished 34th and 40th in two of the first three races but has
finished first, second or third in nine of past 13. Jarrett also
has five top-five finishes in past six starts, including one win.
</P>
<P>
   5. Jeff Burton and Bobby Labonte are beginning to show signs of
life. Burton has six top-10 finishes over the past seven races, and
Labonte has five top-10 finishes in past six races. &QL; 
NOT &QL; 
1. Where have all the flowers gone? Geoff Bodine, who has 18 career
wins, has recorded only two top-10 finishes this season and has
finished 23rd or worse in the last six races. Yuck!
</P>
<P>
   2. Where have all the flowers gone II? Ricky Rudd, remember him?
Rudd has won a race in 15 consecutive seasons and has only three
finishes outside the top 10 in the final standings since 1977. But
Rudd hasn't come close to victory lane this year, posting only one
top-10 finish and 11 finishes of 23rd or worse.
</P>
<P>
   3. After posting seven top-10 finishes in the season's first 10
races, Johnny Benson has dropped nearly out of sight, finishing
18th or worse in the past five races.
</P>
<P>
   4. What's in a name? Kyle Petty has 14 finishes of 22nd or
worse. His top finish is 11th. Petty had nine top-10 finishes in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   5. Derrike Cope won the 1990 Daytona 500 but has only six
top-five finishes in the past eight seasons, none this season.
Cope's best finish in 1998 is 15th. &QL;

BOY RECOVERING AFTER DOCTORS REATTACH ARM TORN OFF BY CAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN and YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An 8-year-old boy was recovering after a team of
doctors meticulously worked into the morning hours to reattach his
arm, which was torn from his body during an accident in front of
his home.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for a holiday camping trip, Anthony Tirado sat in a car
Thursday with his mother and coiled around his right arm a
half-inch-thick plastic rope, which dangled outside the car and
somehow became entangled with one of the wheels, fire officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the car accelerated, the rope tightened around the boy's arm,
which was severed about 3 inches below his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Though the boy was listed in critical condition at UCLA Medical
Center on Friday, fire officials and doctors attributed the
successful reattachment procedure to his young age, emergency
crews' quick response and the surgery team.
</P>
<P>
   The arm was quickly preserved in a towel and put on ice before
being rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where a team of hand surgeons
and microsurgeons reattached it in a 6{-hour procedure, said Simi
Singer, a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery went well. They successfully reattached the arm,''
Singer said. ``The arm is pink, with circulation reaching to his
fingers and hand. He is in critical condition but awake and
comfortable. Also, nerves have been restored and successfully
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery ended about 12:30 a.m. Friday, Singer said, adding
that doctors will continue to monitor the boy before making a more
definitive condition report by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time, for healing. . . . It's a major trauma,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's family stayed by his side Friday, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a neighbor recounted the traumatic scene before
paramedics arrived at the home in suburban Panorama City about 4:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As the screams of Anthony's mother -- whom a friend identified
as Rocio Ruvalcaba de Tirado -- filled the neighborhood, Mirna Ruiz
watched as Anthony's father rushed his son from the car into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just going crazy; (the mother) kept on fainting,''
said Ruiz, 18, whose friend helped by holding a towel on Anthony's
wound.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to retrieve his son's severed arm off the
street, Anthony's father placed the limb on a table inside the
home, Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole arm was cut off,'' she added. ``I was scared. I was
nervous. I've never seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his parents were frantic, Anthony was calm and coherent,
Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept saying that he wanted to go camping and that he
couldn't feel his arm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gabriel Rubanenko of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who has
performed similar replantations but did not assist with Anthony's
surgery, said the boy's chances for recovery should be heightened
because of his age and the fact that the operation was performed
within four hours -- the deadline before muscles can begin dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was rushed immediately to a capable facility,'' the doctor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated surgery, Rubanenko said, involves using
microscopic magnification to reconstruct or repair the vessels and
restore the blood supply to the severed parts, which include
tendons, vessels, nerves and bone.
</P>
<P>
   He labeled this type of surgery complicated in that the
amputation occurred above the elbow, where there are more vessels
and nerves. This kind of injury occurs only about 10 times a year
in Los Angeles County, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``To replant the finger is not unusual. To replant the arm is
quite rare,'' Rubanenko said. ``The speed of repair is very slow
because the hands have to be so steady.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said the recuperation period can last months or even
a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerve grows 1 millimeter a day,'' he said. ``If the
laceration was below the shoulder, then it takes so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the injury was a clean cut helps the boy, the
doctor said. Most arms are amputated in car and train crashes in
which heavy objects have fallen and crushed them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the family home, the only signs of the previous
afternoon's tragedy were the bloodstains on the street.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend said the child's parents were encouraged that
the surgery was successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents are (despairing) about his condition, but they
were relieved that his arm was reattached,'' Henry Walker said.

ENTREPRENEURS CAN FIND VACATION IMPOSSIBLE WITH GROWING BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer are here
again -- days when most kids close their books and head for the
beach and employees at big companies flee their cubbyholes for some
extended rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's vacation time for some people, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ask some local owners of small, growing companies about their
vacation plans and you're likely to get a response much like the
one from Sandra Yates-Thompson, president of New Millennium
Computer Services in suburban Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a vacation?'' she asked with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent study showing that the number of entrepreneurs
who will take vacations this year has risen by 20 percent over last
year, some self-employed people like Yates-Thompson say they don't
have time to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, not until the business is further along, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to maybe take a couple of days off -- like a
weekend -- but I'm not really looking at taking a vacation now,''
she said. ``Actually, I haven't had a vacation for a while -- it's
been two years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by American Express, 74 percent of the
nation's independent business owners plan to take vacations this
year, up from 63 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rise? The robust economy, said Alice Bredin,
a small-business adviser in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, they have the means to take the trip they
were not able to afford in prior years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many business owners who have been in business five or
more years and were waiting for a more opportune time for a
vacation have realized that time is as elusive as tomorrow -- it's
always in the future. So they might as well take some time off to
recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more the aging baby boomers, realizing they'd actually
like to enjoy their lives rather than working all the time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bredin suggested that all entrepreneurs make time for
some downtime, saying business owners need the chance to recharge
their batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise you'll see dwindled problem-solving,'' she said.
``That's what being an entrepreneur is all about --
problem-solving.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommended that business owners do one of three things when
they go on vacation: Have a competent and trustworthy staff member
run the business, shut the business down or refer clients to
similar firms while they're gone -- which many small-business
owners are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Bredin said a business owner who is serving a client well
shouldn't worry that the customer will defect. ``Your relationship
with the customer is based on much more than if they don't have
your competitor's number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Janet Barnett, owners of Woodland Hills-based Rock'n
Motion Image Design, said they have always made it a point to take
time off -- usually a weekend here or there -- from their
8-year-old graphic design firm.
</P>
<P>
   But not in the summer, Janet Barnett noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave around the (winter) holiday season because things are
kind of shut down anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They sometimes are able to barter with clients. For example, one
time they accepted a cruise from a client in lieu of payment for a
project. And this time they're talking about trading for a trip to
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Barnett added that they work vacations around their
clients' demands and give those customers plenty of notice when
they do plan to take time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been able to get away,'' he said. ``As the
company grows, it gets easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yates-Thompson will continue doing what she's done
since starting the company two years ago: working 12- to 14-hour
days six days a week. (She gives herself a break on Sundays, when
she works three or four hours.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, oh, you must love having your own business -- you
can take off whenever you want,'' she said. ``I just laugh. One of
these days it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that day comes, just try to find her. ``I'd like to
take a vacation someplace where there are no people and no
telephones -- somewhere where there's no people but my husband and
I.
</P>
<P>
   ``And silence.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO BEFORE TAKING OFF
</P>
<P>
   American Express recommends that small-business owners take the
following steps to ensure that their vacations are as worry-free as
possible:
</P>
<P>
   --Make a list of completed projects, current work and coming
assignments. Then make a list of all possible issues that could
arise for each item and devise ways to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   --Do worst-case planning for things that will undoubtedly go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   --Tell key clients and customers about your vacation two to
three weeks in advance, and add who to contact while you're gone
and how this person can help them.
</P>
<P>
   --Plan for incoming messages. For example, leave phone numbers
for whoever is covering for you on your voice mail's outgoing
message, arrange with someone to read your faxes so that issues are
addressed, or forward your faxes to another number where you will
receive them.

RANGERS LOSE 6TH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Thank goodness for the Seattle bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The motley Mariners relievers gave the diehard fans who stuck
around until the bitter end something to cheer about last night
when the Rangers scored two runs in the ninth inning against
Heathcliff Slocumb and Bobby Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Seattle's beleaguered bullpen could blow this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' offense had done enough against Texas starter John
Burkett, and the Rangers' offense had done so little against
Seattle starter Jeff Fassero that the two runs were little more
than an insignificant consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost again, this time 8-2, to the Mariners at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It was their sixth consecutive defeat, and it followed a
familiar story line. Starting pitcher puts team in an early hole.
Anemic offense can't dig out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``When it happens
every night, it makes it tough.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the early deficit was 4-0, as the Mariners scored two
runs in the first and two in the third off Burkett (4-9).
</P>
<P>
   ``I \Rstunk\S,'' said Burkett, who surrendered six hits in the
first three innings. ``I was throwing balls right down the middle.
I think I could have gotten six or seven hits off myself tonight.
I've \Rstunk\S a lot this year. It's pretty hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The outing was especially galling for Burkett, who knew the team
needed a spark to break out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to do something,'' said Burkett, who allowed
seven runs in 6 1/3 innings. ``I went out there with the attitude
that I was going to be that guy, and it didn't work out. It's
frustrating. I would like to be the guy they can depend on to keep
us in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett doesn't deserve all the blame. Although he gave up the
early runs, there was a time this season when that meant nothing to
the high-octane offense. Four runs? Hah. A couple of singles here,
a double there, a homer there, and it would be erased.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, four runs is the Grand Canyon of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who threw 6 1/3 shutout innings before leaving the game
with cramps in his left calf, is a quality pitcher. The left-hander
improved to 7-5 and lowered his earned-run average to 3.96.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Rangers are swinging the bat these days, the
quality of the guy on the mound is almost irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have scored two or fewer runs in five of the past 11
games. They are batting .188 with nine runs in the past eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort's there,'' Oates said. ``In fact, maybe there's too
much effort. These guys want to do so well they might be trying too
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates suggested the batters are thinking too much instead of
following the old hitter's credo of see ball, hit ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our third baseman,'' Oates said of Fernando Tatis.
``He didn't think. He went up there whaling. What did he do?
Four-for-four.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis tied a career high with four hits. That was half of the
team's output for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   One of Tatis' hits, as well as one by Kevin Elster and walks to
Luis Alicea, Tom Goodwin and Mark McLemore, came when the Rangers
avoided their third shutout in 11 games by scoring twice against
the Mariners' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Those two runs, meaningless as they were in this game, gave
Oates reason to hope that there are better days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some character-building tonight, and hopefully
tomorrow the drought ends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Can the late runs be the start of something good?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' Juan Gonzalez said. ``Well, maybe. Maybe not. It's
a bad time for all of us. Terrible, terrible time for us.''

Astros give Reynolds 10th victory
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Bill Spiers had three hits and a walk and accounted for more than
half of the Astros' runs against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers went 3-for-4, scored three runs and drove in another as
the Astros held off a ninth-inning comeback by the expansion
Diamondbacks for a 6-5 victory at the Astrodome in the first
meeting between the two clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a game of statistics,'' Spiers said. ``You can't
get caught up in them, because if you do, it starts playing with
your mind. You start thinking about things like that, and you
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and seven
solid innings by righthander Shane Reynolds set the tone as the
Astros built a five-run lead before escaping with the victory.
Arizona rallied for two runs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox and Devon White began the rally with consecutive
singles off Astros closer Billy Wagner before Travis Lee grounded
into a double play. On the next pitch, Tony Batista sent a two-run
shot to right-center field off Wagner to cut the Astros' lead to
6-5. Wagner got David Dellucci to ground out to end the game for
his 19th save, keeping the Astros six games ahead of Chicago in the
National League Central Division with two games remaining before
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (the bullpen) came in and our worst problem was we
actually threw too many strikes,'' said Wagner, who combined with
reliever Doug Henry to allow three runs and four hits in the final
two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Friday night, Wagner had allowed just two earned runs
in 15 home appearances. He subscribes to the same theory as Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all jinxed me so bad,'' Wagner said. ``I was reading that
I hadn't given up any runs in such-and-such innings, and every time
I've given up runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, a Killer B's sting proved much worse than any
snakebite as Bell staked the Astros to a 2-0 first-inning lead with
his 12th home run of the season off Diamondbacks starter Andy Benes
(6-9). Craig Biggio ignited a three-run third inning with a leadoff
double.
</P>
<P>
   That was just enough for Reynolds (10-5), who despite scattering
nearly a dozen hits over seven innings reached double figures in
victories for the third time in his career and the most since going
16-10 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds retired nine of the first 12 batters he faced before
allowing a pair of fourth-inning runs. Since beginning the season
2-3, Reynolds has gone 8-2 with a 3.04 ERA over his past 11 starts.
He struck out eight Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of in a groove early, then I had to kick myself to
get back in it,'' said Reynolds, who became the National League's
fifth 10-game winner. ``They have some young, good ballplayers.
They go up and swing the bat. Add in the veteran players, and you
have to be on top of your game to beat these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we took them light, but going up there pitching
against them it seemed their young guys had some experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung in. Seven innings and two runs _ we'll take that any
night,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``I don't know why they got so
many hits off him. Maybe he made some pitches over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the game, Arizona played like an expansion club
_ couldn't catch, couldn't score and couldn't win _ in losing for
the seventh time in the past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   With nine more strikeouts Friday, the Diamondbacks have fanned
46 times in the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring two runs in the first, the Astros tagged Benes for
three in the third. Biggio led off with a double into the
left-field corner, and Spiers followed with an RBI single. Bell
grounded out before Jeff Bagwell hit a run-scoring double for his
30th RBI since June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks contributed to their problems two batters later
when second baseman Fox couldn't handle a routine grounder by Carl
Everett that bounced into shallow left field and allowed Bagwell to
score from second to put the Astros ahead 5-0. It was the 11th
error in the past 10 games by the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers' three hits were one shy of his season- and career-high
four, last accomplished June 14 at Cincinnati. During the Astros'
current homestand, the third-base platoon of Spiers and Sean Berry
has gone 9-for-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be that way. I think we knew going into the season
it would have to be that way,'' Dierker said of the Astros'
offensive depth. ``We have enough depth that probably during the
course of any game somebody is going to have a good game. It's
probably going to be more than one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams, who went to the hospital following the game after
injuring himself while fouling a pitch off his foot in the first
inning, doubled to lead off the fourth inning and scored one batter
later on Jay Bell's triple. Jorge Fabregas added an RBI groundout
to pull Arizona within 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona loaded the bases in the fifth on a pair of singles by
Fox and Lee and a ground-rule double to left by Williams, who went
2-for-4. But the Diamondbacks couldn't push across any runs as
Reynolds got Dellucci to fly out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are 13th out of 16 NL clubs in runs scored, and
their .246 batting average ranks next-to-last in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, who has lost four of his past six outings, supplied the
Astros with another run in the fifth when he surrendered a leadoff
single to Spiers and later threw a wild pitch that allowed him to
score from third. Benes allowed six runs (five earned), six hits
and three walks, made two wild pitches and struck out seven in five
innings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Another night, another 15 runs, another shame-faced opponent,
and another three hits by Nomar Garciaparra, whose hitting streak
is now 24 games and counting.
</P>
<P>
   The pickings can't come any easier for the Red Sox, who Friday
night scored in each of the first seven innings and pinned a 15-2
loss on the Chicago White Sox, 24 hours after beating the Montreal
Expos by a 15-0 score.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the fourth in a row and seventh in the last eight
games for the Red Sox, who have gone 16-6 in their last 22 games
and now stand 19 games over .500, establishing a high-water mark in
1998. And all of this with Mo Vaughn missing his sixth straight
game with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that good, with Damon Buford batting fourth and Darren
Lewis going deep?'' said John Valentin, whose first-inning double
was the first of 17 hits by the Red Sox, a night after they had 20
hits against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it?'' said Valentin, who could just as easily
have mentioned Billy Ashley's first big-league grand slam, Donnie
Sadler's first big-league hit (a triple), and six straight hits
over two nights by Mike Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is, when you're playing well and you're getting
good pitching, it's really contagious. A lot of guys are hitting
the ball well, and we're playing good defense. You can't tell me
we're not playing good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin widened his eyes in exaggerated fashion and leaned
over. ``You never know,'' he said in a stage whisper. ``Maybe this
is the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the midseason All-Star break, the Sons of Jimy
Williams, who scored seven unearned runs on three White Sox errors,
are on a pace to win 99 games. That would be their best record
since the Sons of Don Zimmer won 99 in 1978 but lost the one game
that counted most, the playoff against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about the Yankees,'' says general manager Dan
Duquette, advice Sox fans may want to take to heart given the
first-place New Yorkers' refusal to cede any ground to the Sox, who
remain 10 games behind in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have outscored the opposition, 43-7, in the
last four games and 53-16 in the six games Vaughn has missed, once
again eliminated any need to review how their runs were scored last
night, choosing instead to present a smorgasbord of individual
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   _Garciaparra extended his hitting streak to a big-league best 24
games with an infield single in the second, followed that with his
13th home run in the fourth, and delivered a two-run single in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked out in Hermosa Beach with Nomar a couple of winters
ago _ me, Mike Piazza, Eric Karros, Jason Kendall,'' said Ashley,
who shares southern California roots with Garciaparra. ``I didn't
know too much about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know when last season started that was the same
guy I'd been working out with. Now? I don't know how he's not on
the All-Star team. He can flat-out play.''
</P>
<P>
   _Ashley, booed back to Malibu after striking out four times in
his first Fenway start Tuesday night, basked in the cheers of the
crowd of 32,467 with a grand slam over the left-field screen in the
fifth, his first American League home run. Ashley also walked,
singled, and doubled and could have Little Leaguers reaching for
the peroxide with more nights like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangest thing ever _ a funny game,'' Ashley said of his
72-hour turnaround. ``You just can't take this game for granted. It
can take a turn in any direction in a heartbeat. You just don't
want to be left out, left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Benjamin, pressed into emergency duty as first baseman
because Reggie Jefferson scratched with a sore back, singled in his
first two at-bats, giving him six straight hits over two nights,
and also delivered a sacrifice fly. He's rapidly establishing
himself as a '90s version of Jerry Adair, the unsung hero of the
'67 Impossible Dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for Benji,'' manager Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Lewis, buried last summer on the White Sox bench, singled
twice, hit his first home run in a month (June 4) and scored three
runs, while Mike Cameron, the kid who replaced him in center field
for the White Sox, dropped a fly ball hit by Lewis in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Buford had three singles, giving him six hits in two nights
as Vaughn's stand-in, not bad for a guy described by lefty Steve
Avery as a ``skinny little dude.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Buford ever see himself as a cleanup man? ``In this career?
No,'' Buford said. ``Maybe after I'm done playing, in a slow-pitch
softball league. we're still begging for Mo to get healthy and come
back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield joined Pedro Martinez (11-2) and
Bret Saberhagen (10-5) as the third Red Sox pitcher to have at
least 10 wins. Unbeaten in his last five decisions, Wakefield held
the White Sox to five hits and two runs before letting Carlos Reyes
mop up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Saberhagen and Pedro and I are all feeding off each
other,'' said Wakefield (10-3). ``I don't think it's a competitive
thing, but when one guy goes out and does it, the other guys want
to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   On deck to pitch Saturday: Jin Ho Cho, Korean-born rookie. Don't
expect Williams to try to tell him it's not like this every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak only two languages,'' Williams said. ``English and
profanity.''

MARINERS ROLL TO THIRD VICTORY IN ROW

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Almost every batting average on the stat
sheet Mariner manager Lou Piniella looked at late Friday afternoon
started with a three, and he wasn't perusing an All-Star Game
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore, .380. Will Clark, .375. Roberto Kelly, .350. Mike
Simms, .345. Ivan Rodriguez, .338.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 Texas Rangers listed, all but three had batting
averages of .300 or higher against left-handed pitchers this
season. The team average: .335.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's happy-go-lucky demeanor suddenly turned more serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I've got,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one more thing: Every Mariner starter in this series is a
lefty.
</P>
<P>
   The first one, Jeff Fassero, met the challenge in a big way
Friday night at The Ballpark in Arlington, holding the
powerful-but-struggling Rangers scoreless until cramps forced him
out of the game in the eighth inning. By then, Alex Rodriguez and
Edgar Martinez each had driven in three runs and the M's were
coasting with an eight-run lead en route to an 8-2 victory before
45,233 fans.
</P>
<P>
   It came close to being much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed reliever Heathcliff Slocumb struggled badly in the
ninth inning. Four of the five batters he faced reached base. Bobby
Ayala, Slocumb's seven-something ERA companion, came in and walked
home a run on four pitches before nailing down the final two outs
to prevent a last-inning collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners walked off with a three-game winning streak, the
first time they've won more than two in a row since May 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be a good-luck charm,'' kidded outfielder Ricky Cradle,
promoted from Class AAA Tacoma on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero didn't need a rabbit's foot or four-leaf clover to win.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped the Rangers on six hits in 71/3 innings, didn't walk
anyone and struck out three to improve his record to 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to face a lineup like theirs and to beat
them,'' he said. ``You have to be at your best, and tonight I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who spent most of May and June leading the American
League West, lost their fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not swinging the bats very well right now,''
manager Johnny Oates said. ``The effort is there, maybe too much
effort. You can feel it in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero kept the Ranger hitters on defense, working both sides
of the plate with his fastball, using his slider more often than
some of the starts during his recent seven-start winless drought
and mixing in a few forkballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave a hitter the same pitch two times in a row, and
it helps when you can throw all of your pitches for strikes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two throwing errors by Russ Davis and one by Joey Cora forced
Fassero to throw more pitches than he should have in stifling
weather conditions. It was 96 degrees at game time and still in the
90s when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored twice off John Burkett in the first inning
on a run-scoring single by Martinez and David Segui's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's 15th error of the season put the Rangers' leadoff batter
on base in the bottom of the inning. But Fassero didn't blink,
retiring the next three hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Davis uncorked errant tosses on back-to-back two-out plays in
the fourth inning, but Fassero maintained a five-run lead by
retiring Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big lift to the team when I was able to pitch around
the errors,'' Fassero said. ``It is something I wasn't able to do
when I was in that (bad) streak.''
</P>
<P>
   It finally took cramps to get him out of the game. Fassero, who
lost six pounds, said his left calf began cramping in the fifth
inning. The cramps got worse in the eighth, and he departed with
one out and one on.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin recorded two quick outs, giving way to Slocumb in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make excuses, but I need more work,'' Slocumb
said. ``It's difficult for me to pitch twice in 10 days and stay
sharp. That's just the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocumb said he has talked to pitching coach Stan Williams about
getting as many as four appearances a week, ``but he says he has to
keep everyone pitching and wants to use me in save situations. I
don't care about saves right now. I need innings.''

5-0 HOLE TOO DEEP TO ESCAPE

<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter was scouting
the Houston Astros to prepare for last year's expansion draft, he
said they were one of the most impressive teams he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may seem like a hidden secret to some people, but they're
really not. They've got a very good ballclub. I enjoyed watching
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't particularly enjoy watching them Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros did what most contending teams do _ despite being
outhit, 15-9, and having their top closer give up a two-run homer
in the ninth inning, they still found a way to hold on and defeat
Arizona at the Astrodome, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The National League's Central Division leaders raised their
record to 52-33. Arizona, facing Houston for the first time, lost
its third straight and fell to 29-57. The two teams continue their
three-game series today at 4:05 p.m. Arizona time and wrap things
up on Sunday at 11:35 a.m. before heading into the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Andy Benes (6-9) dug himself an early hole,
giving up a two-run homer to Derek Bell in the first, then
surrendering three more runs (two earned) in the third for a 5-0
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Houston starter Shane Reynolds (10-5) wiggled out of minor jams
in the first three innings and then allowed a pair of runs in the
fourth on a triple by Jay Bell and a groundout by Jorge Fabregas.
The run scored was the 800th of Bell's career run.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 5-2, the Diamondbacks had a chance to cut the deficit
even more in the fifth but couldn't push anything across despite
getting three hits. They left two on.
</P>
<P>
   After a wild pitch by Benes allowed Houston to score its sixth
run in the fifth, Arizona had more chances against Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Fabregas singled with one out, but Reynolds struck
out Karim Garcia and Brent Brede, who was hitting for Benes. In the
seventh, Devon White hit a one-out double and Matt Williams drew a
two-out walk, but Reynolds got David Dellucci on a tapper back to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks cut it to 6-3 in the eighth when Bell led off
with a double down the left-field line, moved to third on a passed
ball and scored on a groundout by Fabregas.
</P>
<P>
   The odds were against the Diamondbacks in the ninth because they
were facing Houston's left-handed closer Billy Wagner, who had 18
saves entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox and White greeted Wagner with singles, but Travis Lee
grounded into a double play. Tony Batista, who entered the game in
the seventh as a pinch-runner when Williams left with a foot
injury, then hit a two-run homer to left field, his third of the
season, to cut the margin to 6-5. Wagner got Dellucci on a grounder
to end the game and pick up a tainted save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances,'' Showalter said. ``If Matty's ball
(ground-rule double in the fifth) doesn't bounce over (the
left-field fence), we get a run (with Lee). And we had that
double-play ball in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were operating against the best-hitting team in the league,
so you know you're going to have to score some runs any time you
play them. We didn't score when we needed to and didn't score
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell said he knew Benes was frustrated ``because the only
real bad pitch he made was the home-run pitch to (Derek) Bell. On
that (run-scoring) double by Jeff Bagwell (in the third), it was a
terrific pitch, up and in. Bagwell just muscled it.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Diamondbacks' 15 hits were concerned, Jay Bell
said, ``we just couldn't bunch them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane is a terrific pitcher. He came in tonight with about 140
hits given up. You know he's going to give up some hits. The
difference is, when he gets in a jam, he finds a way to get out of
it.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS' X RAYS NEGATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If there's any Diamondback who epitomizes playing with
pain, it's veteran third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He has dealt with wrist and hand injuries and a stiff back off
and on through most of the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's opener of a three-game series against the
Houston Astros at the Astrodome, he hit a foul ball off his left
instep, yet continued to play.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to collect a pair of doubles and score a run and draw
a walk in the seventh before being lifted for a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was taken to a nearby hospital for X-rays, but the
results were negative late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Diamondbacks called up infielder  &UR; Danny Klassen
from Triple-A Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen, selected from the Milwaukee Brewers in the expansion
draft, was hitting .297 with 10 home runs and 47 RBIs entering
Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andy Fox likely will move from second base to third, with  &UR; Tony
 &UR; Batista becoming the starter at second and Klassen serving as the
primary backup. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Suppan to Tucson &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks optioned right-hander  &UR; Jeff Suppan to Tucson on
Friday, but he probably won't be there for long.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the upcoming All-Star break and the way that
Arizona's pitching rotation falls, Suppan likely wouldn't start
until July 14 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   So Suppan will get at least one start for Tucson, probably on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Or the starter could be left-hander  &UR; Omar Daal, who is on the
disabled list and in Tucson rehabilitating a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Daal also is supposed to be the Diamondbacks' starter on July
14, but if he is not ready, Suppan will be the man.
</P>
<P>
   In another scenario related to the All-Star break, Diamondbacks
Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said right-hander  &UR; Amaury Telemaco will be
available for bullpen duty during Sunday's game against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco started Wednesday's game against the Chicago Cubs at
Wrigley Field and won't start again until July 12 against
Cincinnati at the earliest. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rodriguez makes progress &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Felix Rodriguez, also on the DL with a strained
right hip flexor, is making progress on his rehabilitation
assignment in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Rodriguez also might work a game or two before
rejoining the big club, perhaps about a week or so after the
All-Star break. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Resilient Fox &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite receiving a charley horse when kneed by the Cubs'  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Blauser on Thursday, Fox was back in the lineup against Houston on
Friday night, starting at second and moving to third when Williams
went out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hurt him,'' Showalter said of Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox did hurt the Diamondbacks, however, by booting a ground ball
that would have been the final out of the third inning and allowing
a run to score. He also collected three hits to put his average at
.275. &QL;

ATHLETICS GET TO OLIVARES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Omar Olivares had been so good, so consistent
this season, one had to wonder how long it could last.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the answer came.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares had his worst outing of the season against the Oakland
A's, who beat the Anaheim Angels 10-6 before 39,636 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' third consecutive loss, their longest losing
streak since losing four in a row May 23-27. But for the third
night in a row, the Texas Rangers failed to pick up ground in the
American League West and still trail the Angels by 3{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, six runs would be plenty for Olivares. But not this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins has called Olivares the biggest
surprise of the year and with good reason. Before Friday's game,
Olivares ranked fifth in the league with a 2.95 ERA. He had allowed
more than three earned runs in a game only once and had pitched
into the seventh inning in nine consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   But after giving up seven runs (six earned) and eight hits in
32/3 innings, Olivares (5-4) proved he was human after all. His ERA
jumped to 3.39.
</P>
<P>
   The A's hit three homers in the game but none of them off
Olivares. Jason Giambi and Miguel Tejada homered off Greg Cadaret
and Rickey Henderson got one off Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Tom Candiotti went into Friday's game 0-6 in his
previous seven starts, his 10 losses tied for the most in the
American League. But the Angels know all too well what a good
knuckleball can do to an offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have a knuckleballer in Steve Sparks, who despite
going 0-8 in the minors this year, is 3-0 for the Angels. But
Sparks would not be able to provide any insight on how to hit a
knuckleball, according to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's got his good one going,'' Collins said of Candiotti
before the game, ``we could have Hoyt Whilhelm sitting over here
and it's not going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti looked tough to hit at times, but the Angels got
enough of the knuckler to knock him out of the game when they cut
the A's lead to 9-5 two hitters into the sixth inning. Still,
Candiotti (5-10) got the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored another run in the sixth inning that was
charged to Candiotti, whose numbers on the night were anything but
stellar: five-plus innings, six runs, 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   There were early signs Friday that Olivares was not on his game.
A sinker-ball pitcher, Olivares needs to keep the ball down, which
results in infield grounders.
</P>
<P>
   But the first four A's batters of the game hit the ball in the
air into the outfield. Three of them were hits, including Matt
Stairs' two-run double. Mike Blowers added an RBI double before
Tejada circled the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada hit a low liner to right field, where Garret Anderson
tried to make a shoe-string catch. Instead, the ball got by him and
went to the fence. Blowers scored easily and Tejada was not far
behind. Initially, it was ruled a four-base error, but later it was
changed to a single and three-base error on Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares gave up five runs in the first inning, after yielding
no more than four runs in any of his previous 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs made it 6-0 in the second inning with an RBI single
before the Angels broke through against Candiotti in the bottom of
the second. Gary DiSarcina had a two-out, two-run single to cut the
Angels' deficit to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares pitched a 1-2-3 third, but after allowing an RBI double
to Ben Grieve in the fourth, Collins replaced Olivares with Greg
Cadaret.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels narrowed their deficit to 7-4 in the bottom of the
fourth on Dave Hollins' two-run single, but the A's got the two
runs back in the top of the fifth on home runs by Giambi and Tejada
for a 9-4 lead.

   FRIEDMAN-COLUMN (Jerusalem) _ COMMENTARY: JERUSALEM AS
LEVITTOWN. By Thomas L. Friedman. (So the Israeli government
announces plans to extend the authority of the Jerusalem
municipality over the hills and towns, primarily to the west and
southwest of the Israeli capital. It says this is to improve city
planning and services. The United States denounces this as a
provocation that could derail peace talks. The Palestinians howl in
protest. The United Nations moves to censure Israel. But behind the
scenes, everyone is still asking: What is this Israeli move really
about? Annexation? Provocation? Better bus service?)

   JULY4-HISTORY (Washington) _ The hottest holiday argument this
weekend may be over whether a day at the beach is worth half a day
spent in traffic. But there were Independence Days two centuries
ago when the consummate celebration of American nationalism decayed
into bitter disputes between rival political parties. At a lecture
this week in the National Archives, historian Len Travers of the
Massachusetts Historical Society described how the day became
ensconced as a central rite of the emerging republic. And in his
book, Celebrating the Fourth (University of Massachusetts Press,
1977), he recollects an era from the ratification of the
Constitution until the War of 1812 when, in some cities, there was
nothing nonpartisan about the Fourth of July. By John H. Cushman

COMMENTARY: PRIME TIME DEAD  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So you want to hear something really cheesy?
</P>
<P>
   David Hasselhoff of ``Baywatch'' sang at a benefit in England
for the late Princess of Wales. The waterlogged mid-life beach hunk
performed a song in honor of Diana called ``A Brand New Angel.''
The song had been specially written for the funeral of a character
on ``Baywatch,'' which made it special.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought ``Candle in the Wind'' was rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Princess of Wales is better box office in death than most
superstars are in life. It's no wonder she won't be allowed to rest
in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline'' and MSNBC have been awash in Diana, celebrating
what would have been her 37th birthday with specials like ``Death
of Diana: Memories and Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   I have seen the footage from Shy Di to Bye Di so often now I can
recite along with Jane Pauley: ``A storybook beginning and a tragic
ending ... No longer a naive teen-ager, she was wise in the ways of
the world ... The Royal Divorce when `Time and Again' continues.''
And with Earl Spencer: ``To sanctify your memory would be to miss
out on the very core of your being.'' (Maybe that's why he didn't
flinch at charging visitors $16 each to see his sister's watery
grave at a distance and her memorial gift shop close up.)
</P>
<P>
   To be obsessed with the lives of celebrities is bad enough. To
be obsessed with the deaths of celebrities is a mass morbid pop
psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, we stopped noticing that we've become
a nation of voyeurs. We don't care how parasitic or ghoulish the
pursuit becomes, as long as we get our fairy dust fix, or our
reassurance that the rich and beautiful suffer too.
</P>
<P>
   The Grim Reaper has brought Big Business to cable news networks.
Emotional, glitzy memorials can double and triple ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packaged death,'' says Robert Fulton of the Center for Death
Education and Research in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   After the prolonged death coverage for Diana, Michael Kennedy,
Sonny Bono and Tammy Wynette boosted the ratings at CNN, MSNBC and
Fox, the networks became vultures, scanning the horizon for the
carrion of celebrities, planning the coverage for the Sinatra
funeral as though it were the Normandy landing.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC got so giddy with Chris Farley's sudden death from a drug
overdose that it made it a ``Saturday Night Live'' death curse
extravaganza, running old interviews with John Belushi and Gilda
Radner, eagerly picking up the theme again when Phil Hartman was
shot to death by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The TV suits cloak their macabre greed in noble terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a way of communal mourning,'' Howard Polskin, the
CNN spokesman, told David Bauder, the Associated Press television
writer, after CNN, MSNBC and Fox all carried live coverage of Barry
Goldwater's funeral. ``It helps with national grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should grieving be personal anymore? In our culture, the
private becomes the public, and the cameras are always at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the communitarianism of the networks is intensified
by deaths that take the form of soap opera: celebrities dying in
horrible accidents or country music stars with talented friends who
want to perform at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   With the famous, a Fox executive explained, you can draw viewers
who loved or hated them. An MSNBC spokesman told The AP that the
memorial service for children shot and killed in May in an Oregon
school cafeteria _ an event that should be a cause for national
grieving _ did not boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   With baby boomers fixating on their mortality, the next step is
inevitable. Taking a page from Court TV, some enterprising soul
will start Death TV. If there are stations devoted to food, sex and
weather, why not one to the way of all flesh?
</P>
<P>
   DTV can cut out the middleman of the family and produce the
funerals, maximizing the pathos and glamour and battening on the
international distribution rights and the residuals for
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral homes, churches and estate planning lawyers will sponsor
the network. It will have Thanatos pundits like Jack Kevorkian,
Sherwin Nuland and Roma Downey, and a regular feature called
``Deathstyles'' by Martha Stewart. (A little gold leaf on a coffin
goes a long way. No fish forks at shiva  &UR; (Eds: traditional Jewish
mourning period.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Live by the ratings, die by the ratings.

COMMENTARY: ENDING A RETAIL DROUGHT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big news: Last Tuesday a supermarket opened at the corner of
Whalley Avenue and Orchard Street in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans take supermarkets for granted. But they are rare
phenomena in the chronically depressed neighborhoods of the inner
cities. If you live in the ghetto and you want to shop for
groceries, you will most likely pay extortionate prices for
super-low quality and hardly any variety at small local stores. Or
you will make your way somehow to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a large family with a small income, no car and little
access to public transportation. I remember watching a woman in a
bodega in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn ask the store owner if
he had any peaches. He was reading a newspaper and never looked up.
``No peach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the 56,000-square-foot Shaw's supermarket that opened in New
Haven was a huge deal. It anchors a shopping center that includes a
bank branch and a video store. And it is the latest step in what
appears to be a halting, tentative, wary but nevertheless very
promising return of serious retail activity to such neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It is not happening in a vacuum. For years small neighborhood
organizations, known as community development corporations, or
CDC's, have been building or renovating housing that can be
afforded by families of very modest means. This new housing has
been a stabilizing influence in inner-city neighborhoods across the
country, a defense against onrushing blight.
</P>
<P>
   As the neighborhoods stabilize, new families are drawn to them,
creating a viable potential market in areas that previously were
economically moribund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious next step is to take a look at where the families
are going to shop,'' said P. Jefferson Armistead, a vice president
with the Local Initiatives Support Corp. (LISC), a national
organization that helps arrange funding and provides expert
assistance to CDC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDC's,'' said Armistead, ``have set the stage for this
additional phase of retail development.''
</P>
<P>
   This entire scenario is being played out with excruciating
slowness. But there is reason to believe not only that it is
working, but that in the current economic atmosphere, it will
accelerate. There is serious money to be made in neighborhoods that
once were viewed only as economic wastelands. As Armistead noted,
the per capita income in such neighborhoods is low, but because of
the population densities the income ``per acre'' can be very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing some recognition on the part of big retail
stores that there are substantial opportunities here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Pathmark supermarket that opened in Newark's Central Ward in
1990 is one of the most successful in the entire Pathmark chain. It
was the first supermarket built in the Central Ward since it was
devastated by rioting in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale retail projects further stabilize a neighborhood,
and they provide substantial employment opportunities. Each new
supermarket represents 250 to 300 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years shopping centers anchored by supermarkets
have been built or are being built in South Central Los Angeles, on
the South Side of Chicago, in Philadelphia and in Harlem. Several
others are planned. In each case the projects have been developed
in partnerships with CDC's.
</P>
<P>
   The New Haven project was a $15 million venture sponsored by the
Greater Dwight Development Corp., which operates in the
neighborhoods of Dwight, Edgewood and West River. An LISC
subsidiary is a supporter of the project, and the GE Capital Corp.
is an investor.
</P>
<P>
   Each attempt to build large-scale retail outlets in inner-city
neighborhoods is a struggle. Private companies are still reluctant
to make the initial investment and security continues to be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the CDC's and intermediary organizations like LISC have
completed several successful projects and many more are planned.
Each successful project is a magnet for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the whole economic answer,'' said Paul Grogan, the
president of LISC. ``But this return of the retail market
represents a reconnection of these communities with the mainstream
economy, and that hasn't been there for a long time. It's a very
hopeful sign. It's something to build on.''  &QL;

<P>
   CANADA-HISTORY-REVIEW (Toronto) _ A new national survey showed
that not only were half of Canadians in the dark about basic facts
of Canadian civics and history _ some thought the singer Gordon
Lightfoot wrote the Canadian national anthem _ but that many
misapprehensions by Canadians were a result of cross-border
cultural seepage. By Anthony dePalma. (Wih graphics.)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-JOKERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why's everybody so down on
the Internet? Sure, it's a refuge for conspiracy theorists, bigots
and perverts, but look at the bright side: It also preoccupies
jokesters and assorted knuckleheads with entirely too much time on
their hands. By Tom Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   INFERTILITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ A 40-year-old woman struggling to
conceive a baby is told by her doctor that the quality of her eggs
is poor and the lining of her uterus doesn't replenish itself well
enough to sustain a pregnancy. Is she fairly average, or is she
disabled? By Esther B. fein.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECONOMY-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Den Fujita, one of Japan's most
successful and iconoclastic businessmen, is reveling in Japan's
economic woes. As the owner of half of McDonald's Japan, Fujita has
so relentlessly slashed prices of burgers, shakes and fries that
it's now cheaper to buy a Big Mac in Tokyo than in New York _ even
without the yen's recent tumble. Profits are soaring, and
Fujita-san is crowing. ``These bad times are a good thing for me,''
he said. ``No problems at all for us, not one.'' Fujita is a rare
bird these days, when most economists and world leaders see nothing
redeeming in Japan's skid into a recession that took hold last
winter and now threatens to undermine the already faltering
economies of the rest of Asia. By Stephanie Strom.

<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Meet Kosovo, the World's Biggest
Little Tinderbox. By Michael T. Kaufman. (With Graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A monopolist is big and bad. He has
the muscle to dictate prices and bully competitors and consumers,
both of whom are powerless to resist the monopolist's will. Enter
the Microsoft Corp., accused by the government of being a
monopolist, and its new computer operating system, Windows 98,
which will play a starring role in the monopoly case that the
Justice Department will present to a federal judge in September. By
Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ By substantial majorities that cut
across the ideological spectrum, the justices in the term that just
ended essentially rewrote the law of sexual harassment in the
workplace, which is governed by, but nowhere described or even
mentioned in, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They
defined the scope of the attorney-client privilege, which Congress
addressed only implicitly in Rule 501 of the federal Rules of
Evidence. And the justices effectively immunized police officers
for the consequences of reckless high-speed chases, in lawsuits
brought for constitutional deprivations under the ancient Civil
Rights Act of 1871. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   TIBET-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1888 an American
diplomat-turned-adventurer named William Woodville Rockhill set out
to explore Tibet, a territory he described in his journal as ``a
very imperfectly known portion of the Chinese Empire.'' It still
is. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ADVERTISING-REVIEW (Seaside Heights, N.J.) _ Eventually,
somebody is going to figure out a way to implant advertising
messages directly into the human cerebral cortex. Meanwhile,
Patrick Dori has come one small step closer to a universe of
ubiquitous advertising. He has invented a device to print ads
directly onto a beach. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   NY-WELFARE-REVIEW (New York) _ With a wave of a wand and a
mayoral proclamation, New York City's welfare system is vanishing.
By Rachel Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-FRIENDSHIP-REVIEW (Washington) _ The ruptured relations
between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, who became acquainted
while both were working at the Pentagon in 1996, is but one of many
friendships blown to smithereens during Kenneth Starr's six months
of digging into allegations of White House sex and cover-up. By
Jill Abramson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Everyone in Zimbabwe knows something has to
give.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Matchaba-Hove, a human rights advocate who is chairman
of the ZimRights National Council, knows it when he says: ``The
president? He's like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mutuare is head of the parliamentary committee trying to
rewrite the constitution of the white supremacist Rhodesian
government, which the current government also uses to suppress
dissent. Mutuare knows it, too. But he prays that change will come
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, the country's most important union leader,
knows it. But he does not expect change to be peaceful. He has been
working behind a thick iron gate since eight thugs walked into his
office after he led a general strike last December. Only his
secretary's screams saved him from being beaten to death with his
own coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   And presumably, President Robert Mugabe knows something has to
give, although he emphatically denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no difficult period now in Zimbabwe,'' he said at an
economic forum in May, ``except for economic problems related to
downward price trends for minerals, and one or two disturbances
because of upward trends in commodity prices. It's a passing phase.
We keep the economy at a level where we know it is stable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Zimbabwe dollar has fallen 70 percent and
inflation is nearing 40 percent. In a country where riots were
rare, police and demonstrators have clashed three times since
December.
</P>
<P>
   In nationwide riots over a 21 percent rise in the price of
cornmeal, eight people were killed. In March, students emboldened
by the overthrow of President Suharto in Indonesia marched on
Parliament chanting, ``Suharto, Mugabe, Indonesia, Zimbabwe.''
Police dispersed them and closed the state university, which had
not happened in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   More trouble is expected. The unions are threatening a five-day
general strike. Food prices are artificially low because the
government has ordered producers not to raise them. They say they
will go bankrupt, causing shortages. Gasoline prices are Africa's
cheapest, but the state, afraid of a 100 percent rise to market
price, is spending millions to buy gas and sell it below cost.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to seize 1,500 white-owned farms have stalled, but so have
efforts to borrow money to buy farms for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of a large bank revealed that its founder had
issued $45 million in unauthorized notes on a government agency,
which the state will probably have to honor. The banker, who is
said to have made big loans to Cabinet officials, was stopped at
the airport as he was going abroad under a false name, but the
police were told to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``black empowerment banks'' related to his are so weak
that government agencies ordered to do business with them are said
by the government press to be withdrawing their money every few
days just to be sure it is still there. Low prices for tobacco and
gold, and a 33 percent drop in the corn crop, are adding to the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's response to the crisis seems to be to treat it with
increasing denial and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the food riots, all 54 members of his Cabinet got
new Mercedes-Benzes to go with the Jeep Cherokees they get for
visiting rural constituents. In the last two years, as president of
the Organization of African Unity, Mugabe made 40 trips abroad, and
now he wants a bigger jet. The best argument for it is that it
might curb his habit of stranding tourists by commandeering Air
Zimbabwe planes. Tourism is the economy's one bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   He flatly denies that corruption is a problem, despite business
people's complaints that anyone wanting a government contract has
to go through his nephew, Leo Mugabe. He stripped one critic of his
party rank and then denounced him as a witch.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming new reserve bank building is now snidely referred
to as Bob's Takeaway. Since January, the government has borrowed
$450 million from it to pay debts _ ``essentially, just printing
money,'' said a University of Zimbabwe economist, Tony Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Real wages are down to 1960s levels. Foreign investment is down;
unemployment is 30 percent. The health budget is shrinking just as
the United Nations has said that 25 percent of the country's adults
are infected with the AIDS virus. Taxes are up, largely to pay off
Mugabe's core constituency, angry veterans of the liberation war,
whose pension fund was looted. Once they were paid, they stopped
demonstrating against Mugabe and threatened to march on the Harare
suburbs to beat up whites, blaming them for the general strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund has forced some budget cuts in
the military, but its specific demands are kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls for his resignation, Mugabe, 74, insists that ``I
am still at the helm,'' and that any suggestion that his party, the
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, is in trouble ``is
absolute nonsense.'' Elections are due in 2002, and although his
party, which holds 147 of Parliament's 150 seats, is split, no real
alternative has emerged yet.
</P>
<P>
   Edison Zvogbo, a party power broker in Masvingo, is described as
a rival. So is Tsvangirai, whose 400,000 unionists are demanding
not just raises but a new constitution, lower taxes and consistent
economic policy. But he deflects any questions about candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Another strike might force the governing party to oust Mugabe,
Tsvangirai says. Otherwise, ``it can only respond with military
force, and the military is still politicized by the liberation
war'' and probably won't shoot unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sanguine about the army, but Mike Auret, of
the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, sees room for hope
in two developments: factions in the government have begun to
negotiate seriously about a new constitution, and on land reform.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because the world has not focused on Zimbabwe as it has on
Indonesia _ and because protesters would hardly accept the 1,000
casualties that Indonesian crowds did _ Mugabe could keep making
concessions and stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Shaw, a longtime Zimbabwe reporter, compared his homeland
to ``a guy with 16 bullets in him, but still alive, still
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zim has this amazing ability to teeter on,'' he said.

 SPORTS COLUMN: HAPPY 90th BIRTHDAY, DON DUNPHY  
 (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's 90 years old Sunday. He'll celebrate in his Manhasset,
N.Y., home with his wife, Muriel, and their family. And for anyone
who ever heard Don Dunphy broadcast a fight, his voice is as
distinctive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear it, you expect the bell to ring.
</P>
<P>
   As a blow-by-blow announcer over four decades from Joe Louis to
Muhammad Ali when boxing was boxing, Don Dunphy worked more than
2,000 fights on radio and television, including some 200 title
bouts, about 50 of them heavyweight title fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want you to get the impression that they were all
great,'' he often said. ``Even apples and eggs have an occasional
stinker.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a fight was good, Don Dunphy made it sound even better.
Quite a career for a youngster who lisped growing up on Manhattan's
West 103rd Street near Central Park until his mother arranged
diction lessons. And of all the announcers before, during and since
he was at ringside, he remains boxing's most identifiable voice.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1941, he did fights on radio for about 20 years,
then made a smooth transition to television for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among his prized possessions is a recording of his network debut
as a blow-by-blow announcer at one of boxing's most memorable
fights: Joe Louis' heavyweight title defense against Billy Conn in
1941 at the Polo Grounds. Near the end of the 12th round, Dunphy's
voice rises:
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis is staggered by a left hook. Louis is reeling around and
holding on. Conn hooks two lefts to the jaw. Another left hook to
the jaw by Conn. Louis is hurt, make no mistake about that. Louis
paws with his left hand. A left hook to the jaw scored by Billy
Conn at the bell.''
</P>
<P>
   One of boxing's myths is that Conn was far ahead on the three
scorecards, that all he had to do to win was survive the 15th
round. But had Louis won each of the last three rounds, he would
have retained the title. Halfway through the 13th round, Dunphy's
voice rises again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conn jabs a left and is staggered by a right cross. Conn is
hurt. Louis comes back with a right and left to the body and Conn
hooks a left to the jaw. Conn every so often is staggered but he
comes fighting back. He's got remarkable recuperative powers. A
right cross to the jaw by Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis takes Conn's head back with a right uppercut, and Conn
goes to close quarters. A left jab to the jaw and a right cross
scored by Joe Louis and Conn is hurt as Louis rips a right to the
jaw. Conn is staggering, but he won't go down. Louis jabs a left
and uppercuts a right to Conn's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conn blocks a left hook. He's reeling around the ring. Louis
hooks a left and a right to the jaw and Conn is down from a right
cross to the jaw. He's taking the count...4...5...6...7...he's on
his back...8...9. He's getting up at the count...no...the referee
says it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years later, Dunphy still considers Louis' knockout of
Conn to be boxing's most dramatic moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, what looked like a great punch by Conn may
possibly have led to his undoing,'' he wrote in his 1988
autobiography, ``Don Dunphy at Ringside,'' alluding to Conn's left
hook in the 12th. ``Up to that time, Conn seemed content to just
win the fight, but when he staggered Louis, it may have given him
the idea to win by a knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy, who broadcast 25 of Ali's fights, chose the first Al-Joe
Frazier fight in 1971 at Madison Square Garden as ``the greatest
individual sports event'' in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the world, it had an audience of some 300 million,'' he
wrote. ``By word of mouth, radio, television, magazines and
newspapers, it dominated the news for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the hundreds of boxers he broadcast, Dunphy rated
Louis as the best of the heavyweight champions _ better than Ali,
better than undefeated Rocky Marciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis, Marciano and Ali were, to me, the best of the
heavyweights,'' he wrote, ``but Robinson was unquestionably the
best of three divisions _ lightweight, welterweight and
middleweight _ and he was winning the light-heavyweight title (from
Joey Maxim at Yankee Stadium) when the 106-degree heat did him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with those who say that Sugar Ray Robinson was the
greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   And anybody who heard Don Dunphy would agree that he was the
greatest.

ALBRIGHT HUGS WARY JAPAN SMARTING FROM CHINA TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright dropped by today
on her way back from China to give Japan a reassuring hug and
emphasize that the United States values its ties with Tokyo as much
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright, in addition to comments about the ``unshakable
friendship'' between Japan and the United States, also prodded
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to take further steps to bolster
the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Japan is so doleful and insecure these days that
many Japanese were hurt by President Clinton's decision to spend
nine days in China without even a brief visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton sent Albright to Tokyo to brief Japanese officials on
the China summit meeting, to reassure Japan of America's continuing
affections and to poke Hashimoto to insure that he fulfills his
promise to tackle Japan's economic mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance between our two nations is the embodiment of an
unshakable friendship,'' Mrs. Albright said at a news conference
this afternoon. ``It is the foundation for stability in the
Asia-Pacific. It is the cornerstone of our strategic policy in
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, standing beside Albright, looked
slightly mollified at those words, even if Albright did omit the
other cliche that used to be commonplace: that the U.S.-Japanese
relationship ``is the most important bilateral relationship in the
world, bar none.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese scholars have often noted that historically the United
States has tilted either toward Japan or toward China but has had
difficulty being friendly simultaneously with both. Thus some have
speculated that Washington's efforts to build ties with Beijing
will now come at the expense of relations with Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Japanese officials who used to complain about
``Japan bashing'' now fret about ``Japan passing'' _ a phrase
referring to the lack of attention paid to Japan at all. The one
thing worse than being insulted, it seems to people in Tokyo, is
being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's most widely read newspaper, noted
in a recent editorial the concerns that the summit meeting ``may
lead to a weakening of U.S. relations with Japan because Clinton
will not be coming here.'' But it added archly that
Washington-Beijing ties and Washington-Tokyo relations ``can hardly
be considered on the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright went out of her way to make a point that some Japanese
officials also make, at least in their more self-confident moments:
that ``the improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations is very much in
Japan's interest as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a `win-win-win' outcome for the people of the United
States, Japan and China,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had earlier invited Hashimoto to Washington
for a state visit this month, as another consolation prize for not
getting a presidential visit. One purpose of the state visit will
be to badger Hashimoto into taking bolder steps to boost Japan's
economy, but Albright took advantage of her Tokyo stop to offer a
nudge of her own.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the United States was encouraged by Hashimoto's
latest plans to deal with bad loans. There has been doubt in the
financial markets about how thoroughly Japan will carry out the new
policy, and so she added, ``We now look forward to Japan's taking
swift, concerted action to implement these measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, asked about similar remarks by Clinton urging Japan to
take firm action, chose to interpret them as a vote of confidence
rather than a kick in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate that President Clinton evinced those invaluable
remarks,'' Obuchi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOCHI, Japan _ All the world seems to be thumping on Japanese
politicians these days, trying to get them to restructure the
economy and reduce the risk of a global downturn. But here on the
campaign trail, the message to the politicians is different.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates for the July 12 parliamentary elections stump in
towns like Kochi, a pretty coastal hub of 320,000 surrounded by
coves of weathered fishing boats, the message that politicians get
_ and the one they echo _ is Japan's need for more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   The issues here have less to do with economic policy than with
pork: the ability of an official to pick the pocket of the central
government and build roads, bridges and dams. When the topic of
economic liberalization comes up, it is often as an evil force to
be constrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Japanese can't eat meat three times a day,'' Hiroyuki
Morishita, the candidate for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in
the Kochi area, told an audience in the Fishermen's Center in the
little town of Nakatosa, in a swipe at the government's willingness
to liberalize meat imports. ``I would like to respect the culture
of fish! I want to protect fishermen!''
</P>
<P>
   Another local politician already serving in Parliament, Yuji
Yamamoto, drew vigorous applause when he denounced the deregulation
of retailing and finance. Most of the world has regarded Japan's
financial liberalization this year as long overdue, but Yamamoto
said that a result has been capital flight from Japan to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock prices have fallen, the yen has fallen, and the dollar
has risen!'' Yamamoto bellowed as the crowd nodded. ``We are not
living to serve the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Japan is suffering its worst recession in the postwar
era, unemployment is at a record and foreign analysts are warning
that Japan could set off a worldwide depression, the issue in the
electoral districts is which candidate can best divert national
funds to build more local dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dams, these little roads and bridges are very important
for the rural areas,'' said Morishita, 56, as he loosened his tie
and sat on the floor of the auditorium for a chat after the
audience had drifted out. ``They help everybody in rural areas make
a living. It's the only way for these areas to get a cash income.''
</P>
<P>
   A genial man with a radiant smile, Morishita said that in half
of the 53 towns in Kochi prefecture, the biggest industry is
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People criticize pork barreling, but Kochi is remote and
doesn't have much industry,'' Morishita noted. ``So for voters in
these areas, this is better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials often complain that Japan's political system is
dysfunctional, unable to cope with the economic crisis. But the
paralysis in Tokyo may have less to do with the system than with
the public mood it reflects, for the excellent prospects of the
governing Liberal Democrats in the current campaign suggest that
many Japanese do not want the fundamental restructuring favored by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese voters basically don't want drastic change,'' said
Hitoshi Toyama, a political columnist for The Kochi Shimbun, a
local daily. That comment is echoed by almost every politician and
voter one speaks to, particularly outside the biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of the Tokyo-based Orix Corp. and
a prominent executive in Japan, says that the essential reason for
the country's crisis is this deep-seated reluctance in the
provinces to embrace a global market economy. Miyauchi refers to
the Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, as the ``Japan country
party'' because of its deep roots in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at most of the LDP representatives, they are
elected from the countryside and they are not connected to the
global economy,'' Miyauchi said. ``The majority of people here are
not willing to be led by economic forces. And so we have very deep
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As in many countries, the electoral system in Japan greatly
amplifies the voices of people in rural areas. This election is for
the upper house of Parliament, and a member can represent as few as
241,000 voters in rural Tottori Prefecture or as many as 1.2
million in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house is less important than the lower house, but the
election could still have important consequences. If the Liberal
Democratic Party ends up with fewer seats than before _ it now
holds 61 of the 126 seats in contention _ then that could force the
resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show the Liberal Democrats likely to gain seats,
however. Indeed, some experts suggest that the Liberal Democrats
could win 69 or more seats, enough to give them a majority of the
upper house to go along with their existing majority in the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gains for the Liberal Democrats is likely to be this
district in Kochi, on the southern island of Shikoku. The seat is
now held by an opposition figure who is not running this time, and
Morishita is in the lead among the five candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition candidates together will almost certainly garner
more votes than Morishita will, and in a two-party system the
Liberal Democrats might well be evicted from power. But Japan is an
oddity, something of a one-party state. The opposition is severely
fragmented with little chance of taking power, at least in the next
couple of years, and a result is a political machine like that of
the American South in the decades when Democrats ran the game.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a credible opposition means that disaffected
Japanese stay away from the polls altogether. Because elections are
not perceived as a viable choice or a mechanism for change, the
voting rates keep dropping _ to 51 percent in the 1992 upper house
election, 44 percent in 1995, and an anticipated record low of less
than 40 percent this time.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer votes benefit the Liberal Democrats, because they are
well-organized and can mobilize supporters more than the opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem remarkable that a ruling party could gain seats as
it presides over the worst economic slump in half a century, as it
is roundly condemned for corruption and cronyism. But the Liberal
Democrats are campaigning on the basis that although they may have
made the economic mess, they are also the best ones to clean it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical thing is to come up with measures to revive the
economy, and only the Liberal Democratic Party can do that,'' said
Hiromitsu Ikeda, a town councilman in Nakatosa. ``That's why it's
very important for the Liberal Democrats to gain a majority in both
houses of Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is widespread public annoyance at politicians, there
is little of the ``throw the bums out'' sentiment that periodically
sweeps the United States. Indeed, Morishita is campaigning in part
on the basis of his long involvement in politics, including 10
years in Tokyo, as evidence that he can turn on the financing
spigots and help his district.
</P>
<P>
   `` Morishita will be more efficient at getting subsidies,'' said
Takao Yorimitsu, a prefectural assemblyman and Morishita's campaign
manager.

GRILLING AND CHILLING, MUSING ON CLINTON'S TRIP

 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. _ Sitting on a bench under a maple tree near
Abraham Lincoln's old law office in this cornfield-hemmed Illinois
capital, Janice Reese, who works on the cleaning staff at a
hospital, confessed that she knew little about U.S. diplomacy in
China.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ms. Reese watched some of the televised images from that
faraway communist-ruled land, whose leaders and people were
greeting President Clinton, she said she saw something more
profound than policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the smiles of the Chinese people,'' said Ms. Reese,
33. ``They were cheering our president, mothers holding up babies.
They don't hate us. It really gives you hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of a scorching Independence Day weekend,
Midwesterners were mostly thinking about parades and cookouts and
fireworks. But the president's foray into China does appear to have
made the radar screen, judging from more than two dozen interviews
in this city of 105,000, with most people giving the trip favorable
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's smart enough to know you can't just ignore a place
as big as China,'' said Ron Sherer, 49, a fire department
dispatcher, as he sat in a booth in the Sunrise Cafe and ate a
breakfast he called the ``cholesterol special'' _ two eggs, a slab
of ham, fried potatoes, biscuits and gravy. ``It's important to
open new markets for American companies.'' He added that he was
impressed with the president for ``talking candidly'' about the
crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some people here denounced the president's decision
to travel to China, criticizing him for a weak defense of the
rights of political dissidents, or scoffing that Clinton was simply
eager to shift the focus from the embarrassing reports spilling out
of investigations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Clarence Gatton, a 60-year-old
retired bus driver, who was trimming his backyard hedge for a
family picnic. ``Clinton had no business going over there in the
first place. And then he treats these dictators like they're so
great.''
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen of her split-level house, Ann Marie Heffernan,
33, said Clinton had squandered a chance to defend political
dissent. ``He was not nearly forceful enough in condemning human
rights abuses,'' said Ms. Heffernan, as she tried to quell the
noisy rebellion of her year-old son, John, who sat in a highchair
with chocolate smeared on his face. ``I understand he wants to
build a relationship. And it's obvious that the Chinese, like the
Americans, are taken with his charm and charisma. But he should
stand up for what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people did not give a hoot about the ballyhooed trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't impact me,'' said Tracey Bohannon, a 31-year-old
secretary, ``so I just skipped right past it.''
</P>
<P>
   And others had not heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be completely honest, I had no clue he'd been to China,''
said Jenny Lang, a 22-year-old lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   For those who were paying attention, the trip revealed the face
of a changing China.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Handley, a 30-year-old bank lobbyist, was impressed by
images of Chinese talking on cell phones as they walked the
streets. ``It certainly didn't fit with the picture of Chinese
people they taught us in the eighth grade,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others talked about seeing an interview with a technological
entrepreneur in China who made his first $1 million before age 30 _
scarcely the embodiment of the revolutionary tenets of Chairman
Mao.
</P>
<P>
   But just about everybody _ people who cheered the China trip and
those who criticized it _ agreed about one thing: the trip was
exquisitely choreographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One gigantic stage performance,'' said Lou Myers, 66, who
works in real estate. ``It really was overdone. Why not just go,
have your talks and come home?''
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the tight control, and the most memorable image
to most people here, was the live broadcast of a news conference
with Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   During that conference, Clinton said Americans disapproved of
the way that Chinese leaders had crushed the pro-democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square at a cost of many civilian
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For China, I thought that was being pretty candid,'' said
Sherer, the fire department worker, even though Jiang defended the
crackdown. ``It says to me that things are changing over there,
starting to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the China trip has been cast through the prism of
the global economy. It is important for American businesses, the
logic goes, to gain access to markets in the world's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it is those economic inroads that make some Americans
uneasy, even some of Clinton's strong supporters, particularly the
blue-collar workers suspicious of free-trade accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the fence on this whole China thing,'' said Ted
Applegate, a 39-year-old union member who works on the boiler at
the coal-fired power plant here.
</P>
<P>
   If more U.S. companies did business in China, Applegate said, it
would probably improve rights conditions there, because it would
give China an incentive to avoid the political wrath of American
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Applegate, a bearded man in a St. Louis Cardinals baseball
cap, frets about making it easier for U.S. companies to take
advantage of cheap, nonunion labor in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to stay here and pay a competitive wage when you
can go to China and pay the workers next to nothing?'' asked
Applegate, who fiercely opposed the free-trade accords favored by
Clinton but voted for him anyway. ``We're seeing a lot of it
already. The companies are making these record profits by exporting
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In this city of Lincoln, images of the stovepipe hat seem as
commonplace as fireflies in July (there are barber shops and
chiropractic offices named for the rail-splitter turned president).
There is also a lot of talk about honesty and politics, and how
frequently the twain meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese can say what they want, but how do we trust
them?'' said Frank Allison, a short-order cook at the Sunrise, a
big man hovering over the grill with a toothpick in his mouth.
``Talk's easy; talk's cheap. Action is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Down by the Old State Capitol building, now a museum, Ms. Reese,
the hospital cleaning worker, said she planned to make a real
celebration of Independence Day this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think Clinton and that Chinese president would
get along, but they seemed to,'' said Ms. Reese, as she rose from
her bench, making her way down a cobblestone walkway to shop for
groceries and maybe a little beer. ``If the leaders don't fight,
you know, then maybe we can stay out of wars.''

SHORT ON OTHER ISSUES, CANDIDATES DEBATE MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mass., Neb., Conn.. Texas, Ga., Ill., Ind.)   (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ As lawmakers in Washington prepare for a
legislative duel over managed care, the issue has begun to shake up
a number of political races across the country, none more so than
the Senate challenge here between a millionaire lawyer and a
conservative incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Back when few candidates were talking about it, John Edwards,
the Democrat who is challenging Sen. Lauch Faircloth in one of the
year's tightest races, noticed that people got sputtering mad
almost every time he mentioned managed care. He hasn't stopped
talking about it since.
</P>
<P>
   The habit seems to be catching. This week, Senator Faircloth, a
Republican not prone to talking about health care issues, is
expected to release a television advertisement that dives right
into the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The issue ``just strikes home,'' Edwards said about managed
care, and he added, ``It's an issue that is close and personal to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any other race in the nation, the matchup between
Edwards and Faircloth, who is best known for his ties to the
business community, has catapulted the debate over managed care
into the same election-year stratosphere as education and Social
Security. It has been the focus of campaign television commercials,
special interest radio advertisements and countless speeches across
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In a year with few zesty causes, overhauling managed care has
become a defining campaign issue for a growing number of
candidates, mostly Democrats. Candidates are talking about it in
Georgia, Illinois and Indiana, among other states.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Senate race here in North Carolina that best
mirrors how the issue has unfolded around the nation and on Capitol
Hill, underscoring the differences between the two candidates, the
two parties, the two major health care proposals in Congress and
the special interest groups on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Edwards campaign is one of the more important ones on
managed care,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who visited here to help
Edwards, a wealthy political novice who trounced his opponents in
the primary election. ``This is one issue where you can very
clearly make your case to a large number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, who have watched tobacco virtually disappear as a
wedge issue and have seen campaign finance lose its footing,
managed care appears to be a pulse-racing cause. But just how much
traction the issue will acquire with voters in the
September-October home stretch remains to be seen. Some of the
Democrats who have used the issue so far, in California and New
Mexico, for example, lost their races.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans are beginning to fight back. In the House,
Speaker Newt Gingrich is pushing patient-protection legislation.
The Senate is pondering its own plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few things that seems to be working this
year,'' said Charles E. Cook Jr., a political analyst for The
Washington Journal. ``But I don't think many people are going to
lie across the railroad tracks. Everyone will be for reform. If you
handle it carefully, incumbents ought to be able to inoculate
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edwards and Faircloth, the issue is on the table already.
</P>
<P>
   At 45, Edwards, a telegenic, spit-polished candidate, ranks
among the best personal injury lawyers in the state, so good he
made millions in the courtroom, some of those fees in medical
malpractice cases. His enemy on the campaign trail (and in the
courtroom) is the insurance industry, which he says fleeces
patients and holds lawmakers hostage with their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as an outsider, Edwards, who so far has put
up at least $2.5 million for his own campaign, has said he will not
accept money from political action committees or from lobbyists. He
has, however, accepted nearly $550,000 as of April 15 in individual
contributions, mostly from lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The principal remedy Edwards seeks for patients mirrors that of
Democrats in Congress: It should be easier for people to sue their
HMOs for the improper denial of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home his point, Edwards made managed care a centerpiece
of two of the television ads that ran before his May primary. ``I
think it just infuriates people that medical decisions, things that
affect their lives and their children's lives, are being made by
some bureaucrat sitting behind some computer screen up in Hartford,
Conn.,'' Edwards intoned to his television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' plan makes Faircloth and the rest of the Republican
Party shudder. Imagine that, they say, a wealthy trial lawyer
advocating lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Faircloth, a millionaire himself, shuffled his feet a
bit over the issue, much like his Republican leaders. But when the
issue touched a populist chord and his opponent turned into a
serious, viable candidate, that changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Faircloth finds himself in a race so close that former
President George Bush and his son George W. Bush, the popular Texas
governor, have made appearances here. And the National Republican
Senatorial Committee is running its first statewide television
commercials this year, touting Faircloth's accomplishments.
Democrats think this is one of their best shots at unseating an
incumbent Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure not to step too harshly on his business
constituency, insurance companies among them, Faircloth, a
70-year-old hog farmer, began to address the issue. In April, he
signed on to a bill that addressed some of the concerns, but
without the liability provision, which he says would lead to
socialized medicine by driving up costs. He helped push legislation
that creates a new stamp to benefit breast cancer research,
something he mentions regularly.
</P>
<P>
   And just before the primary, he weighed in with his own
television advertisement, drawing attention to Edwards' profession,
one that is widely reviled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Edwards is North Carolina's No. 1 personal injury
lawyer,'' the ad said. ``He makes millions suing people _ our
hospitals and family doctors _ so we all pay more for health
insurance and medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing either danger or promise, the special interest groups
also got in the mix and ran radio advertisements. One group, the
Coalition for Health Benefits, made up of business organizations
and HMOs, ran a second commercial last week, excoriating the
Democratic proposal and its sponsor, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts. The Alliance for Good government, a group that
counts trial lawyers and educators as its benefactors, ran an ad
attacking the coalition in late May.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that the issue will fade. With Kerrey and
a couple of doctors by his side last Wednesday, Edwards railed
against insurance lobbyists and Lear jet-riding executives. ``We
need to make this law work for the patient, the people of North
Carolina,'' he said. ``If they have a Senator speaking for them,
and not the health insurance industry and HMOs, this will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Faircloth, surrounded by credit union officials,
challenged his opponent to sign a pledge never to raise taxes. Then
he turned to managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major issue, an important issue, one that we will do
something about,'' the senator told reporters. ``But we can do it
in a proper manner,'' without, he added, ``an inconceivable amount
of lawsuits.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A LONELY FAN CANNOT HELP THE AZZURRI 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: this column will update later)  
 (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ Don't twitch, my wife warned me. Was it that
obvious? My legs were jerking under the table, but I thought I was
controlling my arms and face.
</P>
<P>
   We were sitting in a cafe in Aix-en-Provence on Friday
afternoon, watching the Italy-France game on television. There is
not a team in North America that could cause me to root, but every
four years or so I owe it to myself to feel like a fan.
</P>
<P>
   People care so much at these games, some of them stinkers, some
of them classics. The Brazilians' 3-2 victory over the Danes on
Friday night in Nantes would turn out to be entertaining. Saturday
afternoon's match here between Argentina and the Netherlands
figured to be grueling in the hot Mediterranean afternoon. Then
there would be the Mittle Europa game in Lyon on Saturday night
between Germany and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   I had Friday afternoon off, and I was sitting in the Belle
Epoque cafe in Aix, under the row of trees in that ancient southern
town, surrounded by French people, all rooting for their national
team. The stereotype has been that the French are too blase to care
about the World Cup, but I have seen televisions flickering in
apartments above the silent streets whenever Les Bleus were
playing.
</P>
<P>
   The French soccer fans have decades of disappointment to
exorcise, in relation to the Italians, the Germans, the Brazilians,
the Argentines. Friday was their day to hope. ``Don't root, they'll
kill you,'' my wife whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Kill me? They're already trying to kill me, with all the
cigarettes they smoke in public, including the press rooms of this
World Cup. I will never understand how a people that cares so much
about good food and tasteful clothing will stink up the air _ and
the food, and the clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the brutal pollution was not why my twitching body was
rooting for Italy. It's nothing personal, nothing ethnic, nothing
nationalistic. It's just that all season long for nearly a decade I
have been watching the Italian league on television in New York on
Sunday mornings. These are my ragazzi, my boys.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly Roberto Baggio. I have been following the soap
opera of the introverted little attacker, his great moments and his
slumps, his fans and his critics, his mother's sadness at his
conversion to Buddhism, the ponytail that came and went, the
coaches who benched him in favor of lugs who had nothing going for
them other than size.
</P>
<P>
   I never understand coaches who fight against the concept of
talent. Don't they see what Baggio does with the ball, with his
mind? Fortunately, the Italian coach, Cesare Maldini, is a large,
secure man who had enough courage to call Baggio back to the
national team, and then save him for appropriate moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boissons,'' the waiter in Aix told us. Just to show how
serious they were, they were not serving food during the game.
</P>
<P>
   The fans in the cafe roared as France came out on attack, but it
was clear that these players, who respect each other so much from
the Italian league, that they were afraid to make a mistake. Placid
Cesare sent in Demetrio Albertini. (``I don't like this guy, he's a
soft player,'' I whispered to my wife.) Then Maldini sent in
Baggio. (``Watch the game change,'' I whispered.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time all day, Italy seemed to have a clue _ five
or or six touches in a row, the ball swinging from side to side.
The cafe grew quiet, but the game was scoreless after 90 minutes. I
owed it to my wife to get her out of this smoky pit. We went back
to our lovely hotel room with a view of a church tower, and now I
was able to throw every extremity into motion, personally pushing
the ball forward for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   You could see Baggio's moment coming. On the run down the right
side, he caught a pass on the outside of his right foot, a skill so
exquisite that I pity the Americans who cannot comprehend it.
Turning to his left, in full stride, Baggio unloaded a
moderately-hard shot that whistled just wide to the left. I lay on
the bed and kicked my legs in the air. It was Italy's best and last
shot.
</P>
<P>
   I had no hope for a shootout because it is just a roll of the
dice, the only alternative for superb athletes who have been
running constantly for two hours. I had covered Italy's losses in
shootouts in 1990 in Naples and 1994 in the Rose Bowl, and I never
twitched because I was working, totally neutral. Here, I just
wanted Baggio, who had missed to end the championship game against
Brazil in 1994, to make his penalty kick. He nailed it, put his
index finger to his lips in some obscure little salute, and jogged
off the field. Albertini missed and Luigi DiBiagio missed, and the
World Cup was over for my ragazzi.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the streets of Aix, those dispassionate French fans
were honking horns and cheering, the way Brooklyn had done on that
October afternoon in 1955 when the Dodgers finally won a World
Series. I closed the terrace door and turned up the television and
shook my fists to the heavens and I yelled, ``Aaaaaargh!'' So this
is what it's like to be a fan.

TEACHERS SEE CLOSE BALLOT ON MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Conn., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ If supporters of the proposed merger of the
National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers had any worry Saturday, it was the hundreds of NEA
convention delegates wearing large yellow buttons reading ``UWM.''
</P>
<P>
   Those letters stand for ``Unity Without Merger,'' the rallying
cry of opponents who are urging the 10,000 delegates gathered here
to vote down the merger, which would create the largest labor union
in U.S. history: a colossus of nearly 3.3 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Even the leaders of the 2.3-million-member education
association, who are campaigning feverishly for the merger,
acknowledge that the vote, on Sunday, might be a cliffhanger and
that they might not get the two-thirds required for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, the association's president, argued in Saturday's
debate, as he has for months, that the merger was vital because it
would create a more powerful advocate for teachers at a time in
which public education is under unprecedented assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few years there's been a real close relationship
between the goals of the AFT and the goals of the NEA,'' Chase said
in an interview. ``We're trying to do things that are amazingly
similar to improve schools, improve teaching and make the views of
our members better known. To have two separate rival organizations
out there fighting for the same things doesn't make a whole lot of
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the UWM-button wearers assert that the two unions can speak
with a united voice without carrying out a complicated merger.
Delegations from several states, including Chase's home state,
Connecticut, have opposed the merger.
</P>
<P>
   These opponents contend that the merger will create an
overcentralized, top-heavy, less democratic union. They like the
way the NEA is dominated by the annual 10,000-delegate convention.
In a merged union, a 37-member executive board would hold much of
the power, although a 12,500-delegate assembly would meet every
year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want maximum cooperation between the unions,'' said Gary
Jones, a merger opponent who teaches history in Troy, Ill. ``But I
believe this merger will diminish democracy. We go from a
democratic-based organization to a rule of oligarchy by 37
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents are uneasy about marrying their longtime nemesis,
because teachers' federation officials often used to denounce the
education association as ineffectual when the two unions dueled
repeatedly in trying sign up teachers from the same school
districts. Some also say the federation is too confrontational and
strike-happy, although in many communities the association is no
less militant.
</P>
<P>
   Many members also fret that the merger would make the education
association part of the AFL-CIO, the 13-million-member labor
organization. Many NEA members view their organization as an elite
professional association, not a union, and oppose being lumped into
a federation with millions of blue-collar workers and with
long-corrupt unions like the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Several Illinois delegates said they opposed the merger because
in their state the union has supported Republicans and Democrats
alike. They worry that joining the pro-Democratic Party labor
federation will force them to jettison their bipartisan approach.
</P>
<P>
   The merger's defenders say joining the AFL-CIO will increase the
education association's power _ it would be the biggest member _
because the AFL-CIO lobbyists and millions of members will often
throw their weight behind the NEA's causes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   William Ninness, a gym teacher in Bethlehem, N.Y., insists that
a merger is needed, because he sees the two unions unintentionally
stepping on each other's toes even as they cooperate more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to lobby on some legislation,'' Ninness said. ``the
legislator will often say, `I spoke to the teachers' federation,
and they said your priority No. 1 is their priority No. 4.' So that
legislator doesn't know what to do, because of those mixed
signals.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the struggle is between efficiency and
satisfaction with the status quo, between those who say a merger is
needed to create a more effective, efficient union and those who
say that the NEA is terrific as is and that there is no need to
change it.

RIVER RAFTERS ENJOYING EL NINO-DRIVEN RUNOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KERNVILLE, Calif. _ In a year of torrential snow melt, swollen
rivers and near-record white-water deaths, Betty Galindo resolved
to conquer a lifelong fear of water by plunging into chaos on the
Kern River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that it was going to be more challenging'' than her
previous ventures in Lake Havasu in Arizona and the ocean, said
Galindo, who dared the Kern in Central California on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I took the trip and I could do it, that could help me
overcome what fear I had left.''
</P>
<P>
   Galindo, 25, of Los Angeles is one of an estimated 100,000
rafters braving oversized rapids churning with El Nino-fed snowmelt
on California rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year the water is totally different than what you
normally expect,'' said Jim Bailey, a former rafting guide who is
now a hydrologist with the state Department of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very thrilling and exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The swift water has claimed 13 lives this year, according to the
state Department of Boating and Waterways. Eleven deaths occurred
during one week alone in June.
</P>
<P>
   While the spate of drownings unnerved some prospective rafters,
others raced to the rivers for an adrenaline-pumping ride on the
fastest, wildest waters in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest it's ever been, and I've been coming here 30
years,'' said Steve Givens, 34, of Valencia, northwest of Los
Angeles, who joined the same rafting trip as Galindo with the
commercial outfitter Whitewater Voyages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more adventurous. It's a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafting reservations are up about 50 percent at rivers
throughout the state, said Gaynor Peet, a rafting agent who books
trips from his Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have had a lot more calls,'' said Richard Levy,
president of River Runners, a company that rafts the South Fork of
the American River. ``People are aware of the high water, and a lot
of people want to go rafting.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shady patch of shore on the Lower Kern River, trip leader
Emily Norton ticked off a list of safety measures while 28 rafters
_ about half first-timers _ donned the requisite wetsuits and
flotation vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever find yourself falling out of the boat, we call it
making friends with pandemonium,'' she said. ``If you fall in, you
might get excited. You'll lose your breath a little bit. It's that
mammalian diving reflex.''
</P>
<P>
   The reflex keeps water out of the lungs but can also frighten or
choke the swimmer. Relax and breathe, she advised. Don't head for
the trees, known among rafters as ``strainers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees are like a collander, and we're the pasta,'' said
Norton, 24. ``The water keeps going, and we get stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, a 13-year-old girl from Boise, Idaho, drowned on the
Kern River in such an accident. Traveling with her father on a trip
with Kern River Tours, the girl disappeared after the raft flipped
on a submerged tree. Two days later, crews found her body trapped
beneath a log.
</P>
<P>
   Two other drownings this year occurred with commercial
outfitters on the Tuolumne and Klamath Rivers, the Department of
Boating and Waterways reported.
</P>
<P>
   Seven deaths in one week in June were on private rafting trips _
more than half the annual number of the record year, 1993, when 12
private rafters drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Three other deaths this year were nonboating accidents that
included two people floating on air mattresses down Chico Creek in
Butte County.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Liu, 30, of Los Angeles confessed to being ``freaked out''
by news reports of the deaths before the Whitewater Voyages
excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it seem like, God, you're going to die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lee, 27, of West Los Angeles said the precautions
reassured him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the group tour you're with is safety conscious,
there's really nothing to worry about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting companies say they're managing the heightened risk with
tighter safety measures but worry the bad press could harm
business.
</P>
<P>
   The white-water outfitter Outdoor Adventures sought to dispel
panic with a press release citing safety statistics that place
rafting injuries ``between injury rates for golfing and bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's inherent risk,'' in rafting, said Whitewater
Voyages owner Bill McGinnis. ``But there's benefit in it. ...
There's a feeling of greater oneness with one's comrades, with
oneself, with one's planet.''
</P>
<P>
   As Galindo entered the water, stomach flutters overtook any
sense of harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, here goes the little ants in my tummy!'' she gasped.
``Good way to get over water phobia, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just throw you in the river,'' said her friend Jessica
Schram, 25, of Los Angeles. ``That will get you over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rafters pushed off and floated into the first of eight
rapids they would brave on the Lower Kern, rapids with telling
names like Tombstone and Big Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling swells gave way to choppy white water where the raft
smacked waves and dipped into holes, drenching the bow and bouncing
rear passengers off their seats.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The higher water levels result from a storm-engorged snowpack at
least 150 percent larger than average, which stayed frozen through
a cold, rainy spring, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   When snowmelt began gushing into rivers in mid-June, it pumped
them beyond full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them at their peak were running three, four or five
times their average flow rate for that day on an average year,''
Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the Whitewater Voyages trip, the flow was 5,884
cubic feet per second, nearly double its normal flow of 3,000 cubic
feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   More water remains. The June 28 snowpack for the Kern River
watershed was about three times greater than normal for that time
of year, said Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative
Snow Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Runoff statewide this year is expected to be 195 percent of
average, Gehrke said, meaning rivers started high and should run
long through the summer, extending the rafting season.
</P>
<P>
   But the E-ticket rides are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a wild ride, this is the time to go,'' McGinnis
said. ``It means fast water, giant roller coaster-like waves that
are 10 feet high. It's just a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Galindo, facing the first run of rapids, was surprised by her
lack of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see movies and film on white-water rafting it looks
so scary, but when we were actually on the water it wasn't as
frightening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her traumatic introduction to water, Galindo went in for
a similar dunking in the Kern.
</P>
<P>
   At the Big Daddy rapids, guide Wendy Higa let Galindo and
several others drop in for a trial run. Galindo panicked when the
raft floated over her but then emerged and managed to ``go with the
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better about my insecurity, I'm so pumped up with
the adrenaline,'' she said after the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do it again!''

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (coded `i')
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-TAINO-CULTURE (Punta Alegre, Cuba) _ They were the first
people to welcome Columbus to the New World. Within a
catastrophically brief time, they became the first casualties of
the clash of cultures that followed his arrival. The native people
of Cuba, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands _ known as the
Taino _ disappeared in little more than a generation, leaving
behind no monumental structures or written language. The tropical
climate quickly destroyed most of their everyday belongings. Until
recently, archaeologists in the Americas concentrated on more
complex societies with large physical legacies: the Aztecs, Inca
and Maya. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE (Harare, Zimbabwe) _ Mike Mutuare is head of the
parliamentary committee trying to rewrite the Constitution of the
white supremacist Rhodesian government, which the current
government also uses to suppress dissent. Mutuare knows it, too.
But he prays that change will come peacefully. By Donald G. McNeil
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-REBELS (Oventic, Mexico) _ ``The top commanders are not
here,'' said one rebel, speaking gruffly through the orange bandana
covering his face. ``We don't know where they are. Our orders are
not to talk to anyone.'' The sentinels outside this rebel
stronghold in the mountains of the southern state of Chiapas were
fielding a question that was familiar, since everyone is asking it
these days. Where is Subcommander Marcos, the chief strategist and
spokesman of the Zapatista National Liberation Army?
</P>
<P>
   PERU-JOURNALIST (Lima, Peru) _ Angel Paez, one of Peru's leading
investigative reporters, is no stranger to trouble. He has received
anonymous telephoned death threats for years. Marxist terrorists
have twice tried to kill him. He has been accused at different
points in his career of being a communist and a CIA spy. But just
when he thought he had seen it all, three months ago four
newspapers began subjecting him to a daily barrage of articles
questioning his character and patriotism in a campaign that appears
to be orchestrated by officials in the government's security
apparatus. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-U.S. (New Delhi, India) _ When President Clinton and I.K.
Gujral, who was then India's prime minister, met in New York last
fall, Gujral had a hard-edged discussion about India's policy on
nuclear weapons. Speaking eight months before India stunned the
world in May with its five underground nuclear tests, Gujral had a
word of advice for Clinton. ``Sometimes it helps to look at a
map,'' he said. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ELECT (Kochi, Japan) _ All the world seems to be thumping
on Japanese politicians these days, trying to get them to
restructure the economy and reduce the risk of a global downturn.
But here on the campaign trail, the message to the politicians is
different. When candidates for the July 12 parliamentary elections
stump in towns like Kochi, a pretty coastal hub of 320,000
surrounded by coves of weathered fishing boats, the message that
politicians get _ and the one they echo _ is Japan's need for more
of the same. By Nicholas D. Kristof. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ALBRIGHT (Tokyo) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
dropped by Saturday on her way back from China to give Japan a
reassuring hug and emphasize that the United States values its ties
with Tokyo as much as ever. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>

   NIRELAND-MARCH (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Developments in
advance of a planned Protestant march in a Catholic neighborhood.

and Greek Orthodox control over churches. By Serge Schmemann.

<P>
   CHINA-VOICES (Springfield, Ill.) _ At the start of a scorching
Independence Day weekend, Midwesterners were mostly thinking about
parades and cookouts and fireworks. But the president's foray into
China does appear to have made the radar screen, judging from more
than two dozen interviews in this city of 105,000, with most people
giving the trip favorable reviews. By Dirk Johnson. Moved. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NJ-NEWARK-BOOM (Newark, N.J.) _ Spurred by the success of the
Performing Arts Center and the real estate boom in New York City,
developers are turning to Newark to create new office space. By
Charles Bagli.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ Developments in the
investigation by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr into
allegations of alleged criminal activity by President Clinton. By
Steven Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-POLITICS (Washington) _ Convinced that the president
returns from China strengthened against Republicans and Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, his aides have planned a series of
events to highlight his domestic agenda, even though they are
increasingly pessimistic about major deals with Congress on the
budget and other matters. By James Bennet.
</P>

is playing out as the midterm campaigns begin, using example of

ARAB CHRISTIANS PROTEST SALE OF JERUSALEM LAND TO JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ About 200 Palestinian Orthodox Christians
demonstrated Saturday at the Jaffa Gate to the Old City, and
thereby revealed yet another dimension of the ancient and complex
struggle for the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, and a subsequent news conference in the
Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah, were the first public
manifestation of an ancient dispute between Arab members of the
Orthodox Church, one of the largest Christian communities in the
region, and the Greek church officials who for centuries have
controlled the Jerusalem Orthodox Patriarchate.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 200 participants, most of them Israeli citizens, made
for a modest demonstration by Israeli standards, their challenge
had considerable potential ramifications. They carried posters
reading ``The Lands of the Orthodox Are For Its Real Owners'' and
``Stop the Liquidation of Our Church Property,''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem administers most of the
Holy Sepulchre, the most sacred Christian site in Jerusalem, and
many other monasteries, churches and other properties in Israel,
the West Bank and Jordan. Though no public record of its holdings
is available, it is reputed to be the second-largest property owner
in Israel, after the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Orthodox Christians assert that despite many
approaches to Patriarch Diodoros II and various legal claims from
Ottoman and British Mandate eras, they have been effectively
excluded from any participation in the control or disposition of
the church's vast holdings, and from any share in the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs assert that the patriarch has amassed hundreds of
millions of dollars through the sale or lease of church lands in
Nazareth, Jaffa and Jerusalem to Israelis, including lands in East
Jerusalem that Arabs fiercely oppose handing over to Jews. And they
say none of the proceeds have been used to benefit the church or
its local Arab members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we're fighting is the liquidation of property
by the Patriarch,'' said Fouad Farah, leader of the Orthodox
Palestinians. ``We have many examples of land that has been sold or
leased. Our priority is to defend our land at any cost, and not to
allow any more to be sold. We consider this our most important
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah said the Orthodox Palestinians intended to call a
conference in Jerusalem to address the issue and to prepare a
complete document of what they say the Patriarch had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all done in secret, except for a few things we find out
here and there,'' he said. ``All this money is never put into the
welfare of the church. We've never received anything. We have our
suspicions that all the proceeds of all these deals are put in
private pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Diodoros is in Greece and there was no response from
other members of the Greek hierarchy, but church officials have
denied the accusations in the past.
</P>
<P>
   According to Farah, the Orthodox Patriarchate comprises about
120,000 Arab members in Jordan, about 50,000 in Israel and another
45,000 in the West Bank. At the same time, the Patriarchate is
administered by about 150 Greeks, most of them originally from
Greece and Cyprus, through the Holy Synod, whose members are
bishops and heads of monasteries, and the Brotherhood of the Holy
Sepulchre, an ancient monastic organization consisting mostly of
Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy has long been a source of contention, with
Ottoman, British and Jordanian authorities stepping in at various
stages of history to seek solutions. But the dispute has taken on a
new coloration with the Arab-Israeli dispute and the rise of
Palestinian nationalism.

THREE YEARS AND A LOCKOUT LATER, WILLIAMS IS VINDICATED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buck Williams is neither gloating nor asking for an apology from
his peers. But three years after the former union president helped
negotiate a deal with the owners _ a deal that was widely ridiculed
by National Basketball Association players for being pro-management
_ Williams, the 17-year veteran forward, has finally gained a
measure of vindication.
</P>
<P>
   The league's economic system may be seriously flawed because of
that negotiation, but the pendulum in that deal swung enough toward
the players that the owners declared a lockout last Wednesday until
a new collective bargaining agreement between both sides is signed.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams, Charles Smith and Simon Gourdine, the former
executive director, bargained for the agreement, they were publicly
accused of acquiescing to ownership. The deal helped eradicate the
NBA's middle class. While nearly 40 players make more than $5
million, more than 120 players earn close to the minimum salary of
$272,500.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-year rookie salary scale did not limit the earning
power of young, unproven talents as many players thought it would.
The deal resulted in Kevin Garnett's signing an unprecedented $126
million, six-year contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Rasheed
Wallace, hardly an All-Star, received an $80 million deal in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are beginning to realize that it wasn't such a bad
deal for us,'' Williams said. ``We knew it was a good deal, even
when Patrick thought we were selling the rookies out.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the current union president, helped lead a
decertification movement in 1995 along with Michael Jordan and
their agent, David Falk. The effort failed in a vote of the more
than 400 players and the labor contract was signed in September of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his negotiating team pushed for the annual
exception over the salary cap to be equivalent to the annual
average salary of a player _ currently $2.366 million. But instead,
they settled on $1 million _ hence, the $1 million exception that
teams can use every other year to sign free agents. With a few
players gobbling up the ransom, many solid veterans have had to
sign for the exception. Some have conspired with franchises to cut
under-the-table deals after they become free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the issues can still be argued,'' Williams said.
``But that was a good deal. I don't think anyone can argue on the
merits of that deal today. If management made better business
decisions, the system would work perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams agreed with Ewing's contention last week that
exorbitant deals offered by financially irresponsible owners have
led to the labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay $100 million for potential,'' Williams said. ``It puts
pressure on the rest of the teams and the league in general. You're
setting standards for other players. The large-market teams like
L.A., New York and Chicago can do it. But when the weaker sisters
try to compete, the issues of disparity arise.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Odds Are Against Rival League  &LR;  Imagine a play unfolding in
which Charles Barkley grabs a rebound, throws an outlet pass to Rod
Strickland, who then chooses to give the ball to one of two players
filling the lanes on the fast break: Michael Jordan or Scottie
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   With a renegade league, anything seems possible. Except,
perhaps, the formation of one.
</P>
<P>
   Although CBS and Fox have contacted player agents about playing
in televised exhibition games during the lockout, the chances that
a players league will replace the NBA even on an interim basis seem
very slim.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have their reasons for wanting to start such a
league.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net, Fox's regional cable sports empire, carries 26
NBA teams locally, and would covet a national outlet. CBS lost NBA
rights to NBC in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both CBS and Fox might be eager to align themselves
with a new league because NBA Commissioner David Stern recently
encouraged his owners to be part of a new football league formed by
NBC and Turner.
</P>
<P>
   And with 199 players currently free agents _ including some of
the game's biggest names _ the manpower is there.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other hurdles, including the financial commitment
that would be required of CBS and Fox, both of which recently paid
a bundle to secure the rights to televise National Football League
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way these networks would put up the kind of money
necessary to start a league,'' Neil Pilson, the former CBS Sports
president and current industry consultant, told Bloomberg News
Service last week. ``These two networks are having enough trouble
selling their sports inventory already.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle is the players' potential for injury. If a free
agent were to sustain any injury playing in a rival league or
exhibition game, his value to an NBA team could drop by millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see many players taking that kind of chance with
their bodies,'' said a league official who requested anonymity.
``They are free to pursue other employment, but they do so at their
own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safety Net for Networks  &LR;  Even with a $2.64 billion commitment in
television rights paid to the NBA this past season, NBC and Turner
Sports will not be crying poor soon. If the lockout lasts into the
season, they will pay their full rights fees, but both will recoup
their losses.
</P>
<P>
   NBC would pay less over the next three seasons. Turner, which
carries NBA games on the cable networks TNT and TBS, would add more
games to its combined three-night schedule to make up for missed
telecasts. If the lockout is lengthy, a fourth night can be added.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Malley, the executive vice president of Turner Sports,
said only the loss of an entire season's games would trigger a
renegotiation of rights fees. ``The contract is designed for a
short-term loss of games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is more likely to lose games because its schedule starts
at the beginning of the season while NBC doesn't carry a game until
Christmas, and its regular schedule doesn't begin until
mid-January.

NEWARK, LONG A SYMBOL OF BLIGHT, NOW LURES INVESTORS  
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Real estate investors hungry for new and cheaper
territory have begun placing bets on downtown Newark, buying up a
dozen buildings over the last 18 months in an early sign that the
fortunes of New Jersey's largest city may be reversing after
decades of decline.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which has been a national symbol of urban decay since
the riots in 1967, has benefited from the real estate boom in
Manhattan and its suburbs, where yearly office rents run as high as
$60 a square foot. In Newark, by contrast, office space of good
quality can be found for $12 a square foot. The price is so
attractive that some New York companies have chosen to open offices
in Newark _ about 15 minutes from Manhattan by train _ rather than
in their usual choice on this side of the Hudson River, Jersey
City.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a
handsome $180 million brick building in the heart of the business
district, has been more successful than even its supporters had
hoped. About a half million people have attended events there since
it opened last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newark had a stigma to it for a long time,'' said Christian
Benedetto, who with his partner, Glen Fishman, bought the 21-story
tower at 24 Commerce St., the tallest building in New Jersey during
Newark's heyday in the 1920s. ``Over the years, you've heard about
six different revitalizations. Now you've got a lot of people
putting their money where their mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Witkoff, a New York investor who recently bought the
Woolworth Building in Manhattan, has also jumped into downtown
Newark. He paid $240 million for the four towers at the Gateway
Center last month. Two weeks ago, the Tremont Capital Group, a
Houston real estate investment company, bought the old First Union
bank building at 550 Broad St. Blackacre Capital Group, which owns
about $1 billion in real estate in Manhattan and elsewhere, bought
60 Park Place in March.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that Newark's revival will be immediate or
inevitable. All this activity is taking place in a relatively small
section of the city and will do little to offset the loss of
thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last four decades, or
revive the hardscrabble neighborhoods where schools are substandard
and unemployment high.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the enthusiasm of Newark's new real estate
investors, they still must push hard to fill their newly acquired
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of positive signs on the surface,'' said
Donald Eisen, a broker for Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. ``But I don't see
any real major users coming into the city, as opposed to going to
the waterfront in Jersey City. We really need a new, major
corporate commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, these investors are betting that this commitment is
coming to Newark, which has an international airport and whose
harbor on Newark Bay and network of highways and rail lines made it
a manufacturing center before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many other hopeful signs. The city, state and
federal governments are pouring millions of dollars into plans for
a two-mile esplanade along the Passaic River, a minor-league
baseball stadium and a $49 million law school for Rutgers
University. New Jersey Transit has planned a mile-long trolley line
from Symphony Hall on Chestnut Street to Pennsylvania Station, the
baseball stadium, the arts center and the Broad Street Station,
with connections to Manhattan and the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Prudential Insurance Co., one of the city's
few remaining civic pillars, has moved 3,800 employees into Newark
from suburban locations, increasing its downtown work force to
about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, a group of private investors led by Raymond Chambers
bought a majority interest in the New Jersey Nets, the professional
basketball team, with the intention of building a new arena in
Newark, near Pennsylvania Station, for the Nets and the New Jersey
Devils hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambers and his fellow investors face a difficult task in
persuading Gov. Christine Whitman and Devils owner John McMullen to
support the move. And most economists are skeptical of the economic
value of stadiums and arenas for anyone other than team owners and
players, although the teams could bring an enormous amount of
recognition and prestige to the city.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, a private foundation led by Chambers, a
financier turned philanthropist who has become the unofficial
godfather of Newark, has been acquiring land along Broad Street and
Halsey Street, including the long-vacant S. Klein building. The
goal is to accelerate a downtown revival and link the business
district around Pennsylvania Station, the arts center to the north
and the University Heights neighborhood to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who grew up in Newark but now lives in Morristown, and
the New Newark Foundation hope to lease or sell the properties to
retailers and developers who conform to a design drawn up by Tony
Goldman, who helped redevelop South Miami Beach in the 1980s. Once
a run-down Art Deco district, South Miami Beach is now a bustling
enclave of nightclubs, hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said his plan envisions an urban community of four- and
five-story buildings with larger retailers, restaurants and
nightclubs along Broad Street and smaller storefronts and local
entrepreneurs on Halsey Street. Professional offices and apartments
for students, office workers, artists and others would occupy the
upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the foundation's plans took Mayor Sharpe James by
surprise when they surfaced last month in The Star-Ledger, Goldman
hopes to win the approval of local officials. Profits from the
venture will be reinvested in other Newark neighborhoods, Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a real estate venture,'' Goldman said. ``This
is a social opportunity to get people who used to live in Newark to
come back to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the competition for office development, Jersey City has had
the advantage of being a few minutes closer to Manhattan and
offering views of the New York City skyline that Newark, farther
west, cannot. Many of the investment banks that moved some
operations out of Manhattan landed in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   But a test of the relative merits of Newark and Jersey City is
in the works. In the words of one real estate broker, Merrill Lynch
has ``proposals out all over the place'' for a million square feet
of office space.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Faiella, Newark's deputy mayor for economic development,
said he had been negotiating with state officials and
representatives of a company interested in building a
million-square-foot tower in New Jersey. Faiella said he did not
know whether the company was Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to take a New York company away from the Jersey City
waterfront,'' Faiella said, ``but we've put together a major
package of incentives, everything from tax rebates to low-interest
loans.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that Newark still faced an uphill climb. He said he
wanted to revive downtown and build housing in the neighborhoods,
while continuing to use tax breaks and other incentives to
encourage business development.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have shown a willingness to consider Newark. The
LZA Group, a large engineering and architectural firm based in
Manhattan, recently leased a floor for 30 employees at 24 Commerce
St. Jay Prasad, executive vice president of LZA, said he found that
rents in Newark were about one-third of those in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked around and we found that Newark is very
cost-effective compared with New York and Jersey City,'' Prasad
said. ``It's only 15 minutes away from Manhattan by New Jersey
Transit. And by opening an office in Newark, we've been able to
attract personnel who don't want to commute into New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom, the giant communications company, recently leased
65,000 square feet in the old Macy's building on Market Street,
once the home of Bamberger's department store, for a telephone
switching station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newark is the best value in the tristate area,'' said Arthur
Stern, chairman of Cogswell Realty Group, which bought two of
Newark's largest buildings. ``Occupancy costs are one-third cheaper
than in Jersey City, and it's got the best transportation in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's company is spending $45 million to renovate the National
Newark Building at 744 Broad St., once the city's most prestigious
office tower. Stern bought the Art Deco tower for about $11 a
square foot, a far cry from the $500 a square foot that Donald
Trump paid for the General Motors Building in Manhattan. Cogswell
plans to convert another nearby building, at 1180 Raymond
Boulevard, into a dormitory for students at the five colleges and
universities in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround here has come suddenly. In late 1996, for
example, Townsend Capital, an investment company based in Maryland,
bought the Gateway II office building near Penn Station for $35
million. ``It was a tough sale,'' said Daniel Cramer, a vice
president with Townsend. ``Our lender turned it down twice because
it was Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   But in May, Townsend sold Gateway II to Witkoff for $78 million,
more than twice what it paid 18 months earlier. More recently,
Townsend paid $12 million for the former Blue Cross and Blue Shield
headquarters at 33 Washington St. and is spending millions to
renovate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Performing Arts Center has been a huge plus,'' Cramer
said. ``But Prudential's decision to consolidate its operations has
been an incredible shot in the arm. We think that'll spawn other
companies to consider the same move. I don't believe this will be a
revolutionary change. It's going to take time to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Witkoff, who was an aggressive real estate buyer in Manhattan in
the mid-1990s, when many investors feared that the market would
never recover from the recession, went on to buy the other three
buildings in the Gateway Complex.
</P>
<P>
   All these developments have thrilled Miles Berger, who bought
the Holiday Inn at 430 Broad St. in 1976 for $500,000. Renamed the
Lincoln Motel, the property began a downward spiral as Berger
housed the homeless under contracts with the states of New York and
New Jersey. Berger also bought the Robert Treat Hotel, once the
city's best, and later, the old Hahne's Department Store on Broad
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that the arts center had improved business at the
Robert Treat and that he was leasing the Hahne's building to the
New Newark Foundation. Last week, he said, he talked to Holiday Inn
about returning to the Lincoln Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come full circle,'' Berger said. He added, ``For 17
years there was nothing going on here. People ran from Newark.''

HARD TIMES FOR EMU PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
 EMU-FARMING-BLUES-NYT   (jw)  
 By SARA RIMER   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTON, Texas _ The way Don and Sandy Housh see it, a few
bad emus have spoiled it for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who put their savings into an emu ranch here, are
tired of the emu jokes. They are tired of the freezer full of emu
meat, and jars of emu jerky and emu oil that no one wants. They are
tired of people asking them if they still have ``those emus.''
</P>
<P>
   They are tired of the negative media coverage: There are some
100,000 emus in Texas that no one ever hears about, but let one
kick a sheriff's deputy (in self defense, of course) and it's
instant headlines. They are tired of getting called whenever
someone sees an emu on the loose _ an escapee from a ranch, or one
abandoned by its owner _ within a 30-mile radius of Pleasanton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call and say, `Your emu is in our yard,' '' Mrs. Housh
said. ``I tell them, `That's not our emu.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No, their emus, all 18 of them, down from the 250 that they
started with in the heady days when emus were going to be the next
big thing and they were selling for as much as $50,000 a pair, were
pacing peaceably in the dirt in their pens here today, like they do
every day. The Houshes are sticking by the ostrich-like birds with
the small brains and the long blue necks, hoping that the industry
will recover, and that one day soon the market for emu oil, emu
leather and emu burgers (98 percent fat free, and with a taste just
like beef if cooked by someone who knows what he's doing, like
Sandy Housh) will take off.
</P>
<P>
   These are hard times for emu people in Texas, the emu capital of
America, where a few years ago speculators drove the price of the
birds to dizzying heights. It was an emu house of cards: Producers
were raising birds to sell to other producers to raise yet more
birds. At the same time, the industry had not put into place the
facilities to turn emus into affordable burgers and steaks.
Consumers, meanwhile, were not exactly rushing to gobble up emu
meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good idea, but it was sort of the blind leading the
blind,'' Mrs. Housh said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom fell out of the market around 1994, and with emus in
Texas suddenly worth next to nothing, a few disreputable owners
turned their birds loose rather than bear the high cost of feeding
them. Others simply looked the other way as their emus wandered
off.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Thomason, president of the Texas Emu Association, was
summoned to Parker County a few months ago to help round up some
400 emus that had escaped from a poorly fenced pasture. One
sharp-clawed emu kicked a deputy, but Thomason knows who was to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it happened is the individual got in front of the
bird,'' he said. ``You never handle an emu from the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, reports in the media created the impression that
gangs of emus were roaming the state. The reality, law enforcement
authorities say, is otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have some loose emus in the state,'' said John Herron,
director of the nongame and urban wildlife program for the Texas
Department of Parks and Wildlife. ``We'll get reports here and
there. But so far we don't see emus causing a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houshes were called recently to catch a stray emu in
Pleasanton. Mrs. Housh, whose father worked in the rodeo and taught
her how to rope horses, got out her lasso. Though they can't fly,
the 5{-foot tall, 100-pound birds do run, at speeds up to 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chasing after this emu with a rope in my hand, and I
thought, `I can't believe this is happening,' '' said Mrs. Housh,
who misses the highly civilized life she and her husband led in
England, pre-emu, when he worked for an oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The emu outran Mrs. Housh.
</P>
<P>
   The Houshes are looking forward to the annual American Emu
Association convention July 17-20 in San Antonio. One of the top
items on the agenda will be what everyone agrees is an urgent need:
to hire a public relations person to restore the emu's good name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, processing facilities are continuing to be built, and
interest in emu products is slowly building, said Jeanne Summerour,
an emu rancher in Georgia and a regional director of the
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when people did not embrace turkey,'' Mrs.
Summerour said. ``It was eaten once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the history of the kiwi,'' she added. ``It used to be
the Chinese gooseberry. It was nothing. Look at mahi-mahi. When it
was dolphin, it was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasanton, meanwhile, Don and Sandy Housh are a two-person
emu-promotion team. ``We're still excited about emus,'' said Housh,
who was talking over a dinner of emu burgers fried to moist
perfection by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife bottle their own oil, which they recommend for
burns, dry skin and fire ant bites. They also sell emu jerky, and
emu eggs that Housh carves and paints.
</P>
<P>
   Every August, they donate emu breakfast burritos for the
Pleasanton cowboy celebration. Emu eggs are six inches long and
weigh more than a pound. ``You can make one breakfast burrito with
one egg,'' Mrs. Housh said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year she prepared a huge deviled emu egg for her daughter,
Jennifer, to bring to an annual breakfast near her home in Summit,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Don't tell those people it's an emu egg,' '' Mrs.
Housh said. `` `Tell them it's a Texas egg.' She said everybody was
quite impressed.''

   PUNTA ALEGRE, Cuba _ They were the first people to welcome
Columbus to the New World. Within a catastrophically brief time,
they became the first casualties of the clash of cultures that
followed his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The native people of Cuba, Puerto Rico and some other Caribbean
islands _ known as the Taino _ disappeared in little more than a
generation, leaving behind no monumental structures or written
language. The tropical climate quickly destroyed most of their
everyday belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, archeologists in the Americas concentrated on
more complex societies with large physical legacies: the Aztecs,
Inca and Maya. Work in the Taino culture did not really begin until
the 1950's, and just as it was getting under way, Cuba, the largest
island in the Caribbean, was jolted by revolution. Money for
fieldwork became scarce and the embargo by the United States kept
most American archeologists away.
</P>
<P>
   But Canada kept close contact with Cuba and that sustained
interchange eventually brought a leading Canadian archeologist to a
remote site in Cuba that is now significantly expanding what is
known about the mysterious Taino (pronounced TIE-no).
</P>
<P>
   Digging at a remarkable underwater site in the small coastal
town of Punta Alegre, David M. Pendergast, a vice president of the
Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and Cuban specialists have
uncovered what may be the first nearly complete piece of Taino
architecture. It is a community building of wood and thatch, more
than 60 feet in diameter, that stood on the northern coast of
Cuba's central Ciego de Avila province 500 to 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two-mile-long archeological site, the largest in Cuba, may
also hold the preserved remains of as many as 25 other Taino
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``After another season's work we'll have about as complete a
body of data on these perishable constructions as you could imagine
having anywhere in the world,'' said Pendergast, who has worked in
Belize uncovering Maya ruins for over 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts include everything from two mighty endposts, each
more than 20 feet long and thick as a tree trunk, to smaller
rafters and even sections of the thatch roof as well as some bowls
and household goods. They were found not far from shore in about 2{
feet of water, buried in a sulphur-rich layer of muck and mud that
is so renowned locally for its restorative powers that there once
was a small government-run mud therapy clinic on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a similar discovery in the Dominican Republic _ a
deep sinkhole called La Aleta, where fragile Taino baskets and
gourds have been found preserved in an oxygen-free environment _
the Punta Alegre dig is providing extremely rare organic material
that greatly advances the understanding of a people who left little
lasting evidence about the 1,000 years they inhabited the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This site and La Aleta vastly expand our knowledge of everyday
life and will ultimately tell us a lot more about community
organization,'' said Dicey Taylor, one of the principal curators of
a recent Taino exhibit at the Museo del Barrio in New York. ``This
is the first real evidence of what Taino houses looked like, other
than post holes in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Punta Alegre, more than 200 miles east of Havana, started
revealing its secrets long before the archeologists arrived. Over
the last decade, two local fishermen have recovered almost 200
artifacts, including many rare wooden objects, and countless stone
and ceramic pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen, Pedro Guerra and Nelson Torna, found the pieces
in a lagoon near the sea or washed up along the beach not far from
their homes. Many are already on display at the Municipal Museum of
Chambas in central Cuba. They include several rare duhos, the
hammock-shaped wooden stools that Taino shamans squatted on.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen also found idols carved out of a black, heavy wood
that are in such good condition that it is possible to see minute
detail, like the vertebrae carved along the spine of a male figure.
Also on display at the museum are an axe with the stone head still
attached and several elaborately carved flat sticks that the Taino
used to induce vomiting during purification ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Rouse, an emeritus professor of archeology at Yale
University who is widely recognized as an expert on the Taino, said
that although he had not yet heard much about the recent find at
Punta Alegre he thought it could be significant because ``the
amount of perishable material from the Taino that has been found
elsewhere is relatively small.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse worked in Cuba in 1945 but has not been back since. He
said that household objects and houses ``tell us what the living
conditions were like,'' unlike ceremonial objects from caves that
provide an idea of Taino funeral customs.
</P>
<P>
   Punta Alegre is a small coastal village where fishermen chase
after tuna and baseball is played even under a scorching midday
sun. The first archeological excavations in the area took place
about 50 years ago. Using local volunteers, archeologists dug at a
few upland mounds but found little.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Torna's father was one of the local men who worked on
that earlier dig. After listening to his father's account of
searching for the ancient people who once lived there, Torna took
to walking the beach looking for artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   He found small pieces of ceramic but little else. Then one day,
a northerly storm hit. ``After a few days I came by to check what
the sea had done,'' Torna said. There, lying on the beach, was a
small carved stick, which he took home.
</P>
<P>
   He does not remember what that first piece was because within a
few days of being out of the water it had decomposed almost
completely. But the thrill of finding the piece stuck with him, and
he returned to the beach and a nearby lagoon day after day. Soon he
found another wooden piece. This time he took off his shirt, soaked
it in the sea and used it to wrap the artifact while he carried it
home.
</P>
<P>
   Torna's friend, Guerra, started to accompany him, and they
quickly amassed an enormous quantity of artifacts, including the
eight-inch-tall idols and the duhos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt very excited and satisfied,'' Torna said. ``Imagine,
they were pieces made long ago right here and the mud under the
water preserved them in a way that made it seem like they were made
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, a Canadian fly fishing group came through
the area on a tour. One of the organizers heard about the fishermen
and came to see their collection of artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   When the group returned to Canada a member told Pendergast about
the unusual collection. The following year he had to see for
himself. No stranger to the region, Pendergast had never worked in
Cuba, and found the chance to do so irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Jorge R. Calvera of Cuba's Ministry of Science,
Technology and the Environment, Pendergast got official permission
to excavate. He agreed to raise the money needed to begin a modest
dig, about $10,000 so far. Calvera serves as co-director of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergast believes the seabed off Punta Alegre was once dry
land but was submerged by the rising water level in the Caribbean.
Storms washed sand and shell debris over the settlement, but the
removal of protective mangroves decades ago has allowed the sea to
eat away at the site.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the excavation, Pendergast had to devise a way of
working on the sea bottom. He needed an enclosure but felt he could
not drive caissons into the mud without risking damage to unseen
artifacts. So he used plastic sheets and hundreds of sandbags to
block off a small area. Two pumps ran continuously to empty water
that seeped in.
</P>
<P>
   During the first excavation, in 1997, the professional
archeologists did not come up with anything to rival the
fishermen's spectacular finds. But they did flag the location of
more than 300 posts still rising out of the mud close to shore.
</P>
<P>
   This year's dig focused on one set of posts that appeared to be
arranged in the circular design of Taino houses as recorded by
Spanish chroniclers.
</P>
<P>
   Not far below the surface, the archeologists found the two
massive notched endposts. They lay side by side as if they had
gently fallen there long ago. Nearby they found rafters and pieces
of thatch from the roof. They also uncovered charcoal from a hearth
along with animal bones and fruit pits.
</P>
<P>
   The clues were tantalizing, especially when combined with the
fishermen's artifacts. The archeologists' first thesis _ that the
village had been surprised by a monster hurricane _ seemed to be
disproved by the orderly arrangement of the wooden pieces and the
lack of skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of valued artifacts like the duhos and the idols
suggested the people had abruptly been forced to leave. The thesis
Pendergast is considering now is that, perhaps because of the
isolation of the Punta Alegre site, the Taino may have been able to
survive unnoticed long after the Spaniards arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis is supported by the mixture of common and ceremonial
artifacts, and two unusual pieces. One is a small shard of European
ceramic that had been ground into a triangle, a shape the Taino
valued highly. The other is part of a clay mug found by Guerra that
suggests the Taino may have tried to copy the Spanish style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see a little accumulation of evidence which
suggests that this community may have survived much later than
most,'' Pendergast said. The community could have gone undiscovered
until the early 17th century, ``and then the Spaniards found it and
herded the people up and took them off somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The team has taken back wood samples for carbon-14 dating at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this season's dig, Pendergast used the sand in the
1,000 sandbags to rebury the great house until he can return next
winter or spring. To get to the bottom layer of material he
believes he will have to use caissons but he is less concerned
about damaging hidden artifacts now that he knows the rough
dimensions of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other archeologists forced to leave an active dig,
Pendergast does not worry about vandalism or looting. Torna and
Guerra will continue to watch the site, and comb the beach for new
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest happiness that we have is the training we get and
the curiosity that is satisfied by being here in this place,''
Guerra said. He would like to see a museum built on the beach, he
said, where the pieces he and Torna find could be permanently
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very proud to have been part of it,'' he said,
``because this is our history.''

TROOPS SWARM IN ULSTER TOWN, A TINDERBOX SET FOR SPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ In an effort to prevent sectarian
violence on Sunday, hundreds of British soldiers ringed the small
Portadown neighborhood called Drumcree on Saturday and installed
thousands of yards of four-foot-high barbed wire in the surrounding
fields.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, armed with automatic rifles and in full combat
uniform, seemed to be everywhere for several miles around.
</P>
<P>
   They and hundreds of armed police officers blocked roads with
huge slabs of cement and forced residents of this town 35 miles
west of Belfast to show identification as they neared the small
steepled Church of Ireland Protestant church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more Brits at Drumcree than there were at Dunkirk,'' a
taxi dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive year, Drumcree is the focal point of
anger, and some hatred, between Roman Catholics and the Protestants
of the Orange Order. The order holds 3,000 parades each summer to
celebrate the victory at the 1690 Battle of the Boyne by the
Protestant William of Orange over his Catholic father-in-law, King
James II.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years the parade has provoked violence over
the Protestants' demand that they be allowed to march past a short
strip of Catholic homes on the Garvaghy Road, on the edge of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   This year a British government commission ruled that the
Protestants may not march through the Catholic area, about
one-quarter-mile long, but must detour around it. The decision
pleased the Catholics when issued last Monday. But the Orange Order
has insisted that it will confront the security forces and try to
march down the road anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This has angered many of the area's 6,000 Catholics, led by
Brendan MacCionnaith, a former Irish Republican Army operative who
served time in a British prison for taking part in the bombing of a
Protestant meeting hall in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   MacCionnaith, whose surname is the Gaelic form of McKenna, has
proposed a compromise _ that if the Orangemen agree voluntarily,
without reference to the government ban, not to march down the
Garvaghy Road on Sunday, then the Catholics will allow them do so
without hindrance next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because violence could spread throughout the province, as it has
in recent years, threatening the new peace agreement, officials,
both Catholic and Protestant, are trying to work out a compromise.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair spent Thursday in Belfast trying
unsuccessfully to arrange one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orangemen have rejected the Catholics' offer and insist
they must march along the same route they have taken since 1807.
</P>
<P>
   For Protestants, the march is a confirmation of their political
and religious heritage. They don black suits, bowler hats and
orange sashes, while their drums and fifes and bugles play military
airs.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestants say freedom of assembly is a basic democratic
right. Catholics say that the parades are triumphalist and that
allowing the Orangemen to march through Catholic neighborhoods is
comparable to allowing the Ku Klux Klan to march through Harlem.
Some cite what they call the right to freedom from sectarianism.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, no compromise was in sight, but officials
continued to try. MacCionnaith, in an interview on the Garvaghy
Road on Saturday morning, said the British government had to ``take
the high moral ground and make a stand'' to enforce the ban on the
march through his area. He said he had made a ``very generous
offer'' to the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, and many Protestant officials, refuse to talk to
him because of his IRA background. Any politician here who does so
opens himself to charges that he is legitimizing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, said in a speech Friday, ``This is an issue of rights, an
issue of equality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small nationalist community,'' he said. ``The Orange
march on the Garvaghy Road is not about religious tolerance, but
about intolerance. The standoff by the Garvaghy Road residents is
not a threat to the Orange Order. If the Orange order wishes to
march along this route, it needs to talk directly to the
coalition,'' that is, to MacCionnaith.
</P>
<P>
   At a checkpoint along the Drumcree Road, by the Catholic enclave
of Ballyoran Park, a man in a red car upbraided a policeman for
barring his way. ``If this happens to you someday, you'll bloody
know what it's like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir, thank you, sir,'' the policeman replied.
</P>
<P>
   A small boy fingered the muzzle of a policeman's rifle and
looked through the ring-sight, then reached his finger toward the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands off!'' snapped the officer, pushing the boy's finger
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk to him like that,'' said a blond girl on a
small bicycle who was pedaling closer and closer to the police
armored Land Rover blocking the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my brother,'' she said. ``And I can ride in this road as
long as I like.''

AFTER TRIP TO CHINA, CLINTON SHIFTS GEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long trip to China that his aides believe
strengthened the president against the Republican Congress and
Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, President Clinton
returned home this weekend and immediately took to the air waves on
a domestic issue, his high hopes for improving ... fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday morning, Clinton did not
mention human rights or economic growth in China, or the future of
U.S.-China relations. Instead, he announced new regulations to
increase the safety of fruit and vegetable juices.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a favorite formula for this White House,
Clinton dropped his foreign trip cold when he touched American soil
and instantly turned to domestic policy. His aides planned events
on health care, drugs and juvenile crime to remind voters of the
president's devotion to fixing problems that might seem more
pressing than Chinese rights or rockets.
</P>
<P>
   With some of his closest advisers deeply pessimistic about the
chances of getting major legislation passed during the rest of the
year, Clinton plans to issue a series of executive orders to
demonstrate that he can still be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stroke of the pen,'' said Paul Begala, an aide to Clinton,
summarizing the approach. ``Law of the land. Kinda cool.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, with an eye to the brewing budget fight and
the congressional elections this fall, he is expected to step up
his criticism of the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's closest advisers have concluded that
there will be no budget deal this year, unlike the bipartisan,
balanced-budget agreement struck amid much fanfare a year ago.
Having already failed at one of Clinton's top domestic priorities _
sweeping tobacco legislation _ they hope to exact a political toll
from the Republicans for Beltway gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton intends to hold a ceremony to issue an
executive order to promote greater access to health care for
federal employees, aides said. He will couple that move with a plea
to Congress to pass his ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' legislation
to set standards for managed care.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all this domestic politicking, the China trip is
likely to slip off Washington's radar screen very fast. In the same
manner, when Clinton returned in early April from a lengthy trip to
Africa, he immediately held a Rose Garden ceremony to boast about
the U.S. economy and to describe his legislative agenda on
education, highways and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend not to spend a lot of time talking about what we've
just done,'' said Ann Lewis, the White House communications
director. ``Or, to put it differently, we could talk about it, but
you wouldn't write about it, so that wouldn't make much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's advisers are banking on political momentum from
his trip to China. They hope that the success of the trip will
blunt congressional hearings into decisions by the Clinton
administration to permit U.S. companies to launch satellites on
Chinese rockets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis sorted through a stack of photocopied editorials from
Pittsburgh and Fort Worth and Abilene, Texas, arguing that Clinton
had received strong reviews nationwide, including in such
editorially chilly pages as those of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Africa trip, Clinton is returning home having just
received an unexpected lift from the courts. While the president
was in Senegal in April, a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark.,
dismissed Paula Corbin Jones' sexual misconduct case against him;
this time, while the president was in China, a federal judge here
rebuked Starr and dismissed the tax-evasion indictment he had won
against Webster Hubbell, Clinton's old friend and former Justice
Department appointee.
</P>
<P>
   One senior adviser said the trip, which resulted in a flood of
favorable news articles, showed Clinton attending to the substance
of his job. As a result, he contended, Starr's decision last week
to call a high-profile witness, Linda Tripp, heightened the
contrast between the investigation at home and Clinton's work
abroad, making the former seem ``small and petty.''
</P>
<P>
   But any such impression could quickly fade, because this White
House has a sorrowful history of seeing its well-laid plans
vaporized by unpleasant surprises. After all, it was barely two
days after Clinton returned from Africa that the first news report
appeared detailing his administration's decisions to permit
satellite launchings in China.

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: HITTING TRUE TO FORM

<P>
   It happened as it should have. National League pitchers outhit
their American League counterparts in interleague games played in
NL parks, and AL designated hitters outhit their NL colleagues in
interleague games played in AL parks.
</P>
<P>
   NL pitchers hit .152 and drove in 19 runs; AL pitchers batted
.126 with 8 RBIs. AL d.h.'s hit a lusty .300 to the NL's .221, but
the National d.h.'s made much more efficient use of their hits,
driving in 58 runs to the American's 57.
</P>
<P>
   Despite huge crowds for some of the more attractive matchups,
interleague attendance was down from last year. After averaging
33,407 in the first year of interleague play, the AL-NL games
averaged 31,447 this season. Last season the interleague average
was 21 percent higher than the average for intraleague games; this
year the figure was 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vincent on Selig  &LR;  Fay Vincent, as always, reacted with class upon
learning that Bud Selig would be elected commissioner Thursday at
an owners meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate him on being elected the ninth commissioner,''
Vincent said of the man who helped end prematurely his tenure as
the eighth commissioner in September 1992. ``While we've had our
differences in the past, he deserves my support and he will have it
as he leads baseball into the next century. The problems he faces
are obvious to most of us, and I hope he's successful in dealing
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; History in Their Favor  &LR;  The six teams that are in first place have
to like their chances of being there when the season ends Sept. 27.
Of the 34 teams that have won division championships in the 90s,
26, or 76 percent, led their divisions after games of July 4. The
Astros were the only one of six 1997 champions who were not in
first this day a year ago. They were a game behind Pittsburgh and
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Rare Day  &LR;  When Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Sammy Sosa
failed to hit a home run Friday night, it marked the first day of
games in 10 days in which none of them hit a home run. There have
been only four such days since May 28, a span of 36 days.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez of Texas played six successive games without
adding to his bulky RBI total of 96. For projectionists, that
drought meant he went from a pace that would produce a record 197
to a pace that would leave him short of Hack Wilson's 190 at 183.
 &UR; No Panic (in Public)  &LR;  Publicly at least, Peter Angelos is taking
his team's expensive failure philosophically and calmly, not
accusingly and angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much money you spend,'' said the man who pays
the Baltimore Orioles' $69.2 million payroll, ``if the players
can't play because of injuries, you have to accept that and go on
to the future. It's disappointing, but that's baseball. I can find
no one to place blame on. No one expected this. No one is
responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelos singled out injuries to three starting pitchers as the
primary reason for the Orioles' remarkably poor season. Jimmy Key
and Scott Kamieniecki are on the disabled list, and Mike Mussina,
the team's No. 1 pitcher, was on it twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose three-fifths of your starting rotation, you don't
have much control over that,'' the owner said. ``Once you lose the
top guy, the pressure is multiplied _ on other pitchers and on the
whole club.''
</P>
<P>
   Where would the Yankees be, Angelos asked, if they lost David
Cone, David Wells and Andy Pettitte? But he quickly diffused his
own argument by noting that the Yankees have so many starters they
had to put one in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't speak with acrimony,'' Angelos said. ``I speak with
envy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles' pitching injuries don't explain how the
highest-paid team of all time could lose five consecutive games
last week to the poorly paid Montreal Expos and Florida Marlins.
Mussina, Doug Drabek and Scott Erickson, three members of the
team's original starting rotation, were the losing pitchers in
three of the games, one after another.

   WIMBLEDON, England _ The man serves up aces and epithets by the
bushel, tunes in to Croatian folk music every morning in hopes of
mellowing his mood, and selected the unlikely combination of cross,
rose and shark for the tattoo that decorates his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Goran Ivanisevic is an unlikely kind of character to
intrude on the modern-day tennis scene where, according to the

than rabid, more sulky than superstitious.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Here at Wimbledon, where he has risen from the rubble of a lost
career by reaching his third final, Ivanisevic has ``talked to
God'' during his matches and honed in on the luckiest shower in the
locker room by testing them all. He has now purposefully adopted a
bearded, biblical look.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cross is a cross, a rose is, like love, and a shark, it's a
pretty tough animal,'' Ivanisevic said when asked to explain the
new tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the four-time Wimbledon champion, Pete Sampras, who
will attempt to decipher Ivanisevic's serve and sensibility in
Sunday's high-octane men's final on Center Court, a stage where
they last met in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When he knew that it would be Ivanisevic, the kinetic Croat with
the warp speed serve and the mind that sometimes self destructs at
warp speed, even the prosaic Sampras, this Grand Slam's defending
champion, launched into metaphorical reverie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he's going to hit his aces, he's going to hit his
double faults and you're going to have to ride the wave with
Goran,'' said Sampras, who successfully surfed it in 1994 and again
in the 1995 semifinals after drowning in it during their 1992
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding a roller coaster,'' added Sampras, who holds
a 10-6 record against Ivanisevic, who likes to think of his matches
as ``horror thrillers'' and last year set Wimbledon's ace record in
the second round with 46. And he lost that match.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two 26-year-olds are the antithesis of one another in
the personality parade, this Wimbledon has been an experiment in
career rehabilitation for them both: Sampras had not won a Grand
Slam in a year, a slump by his standards, and Ivanisevic had not
passed the first round of a Grand Slam since last year, a slump by
anyone's standard. But they own the best Wimbledon records of
anyone who entered the tournament. Sampras is the leader at 44-5,
Ivanisevic is a not-too-distant second at 37-10.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras will try to equal Bjorn Borg's modern men's record with
his fifth Wimbledon title, in addition to winning his 11th career
slam. Ivanisevic's goal is slightly less historic. He simply wants
to win his first slam and shed his sorry sobriquet as the best man
never to win a slam.
</P>
<P>
   This year Ivanisevic dropped out of the top 20 and, with
first-round losses at the Australian and French Opens that brought
his streak of slam futility to four first round defeats in his last
five slams, came into Wimbledon with a ranking of 24th. Even though
he disappointed Wimbledon's selective seeding committee with his
second round crash-and-burn last year despite his honorary seeding
of 2nd, they again granted him immunity from his present funk: The
Croat received a ten spot upgrade and was seeded 14th. And this
time, he's lived up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot, because a lot of people said, `He's gone, he's
never going to be back,' and you know, you have two ears, and you
have to listen to that all the time,'' said Ivanisevic, who called
the first six months of 1998 the worst six months of his career.
``Wimbledon came at the right time: Now I need that people start
not to believe in me, because I like it when I have to prove to
somebody that I can be good again, be in the top five where I
belong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether Ivanisevic can win on Sunday depends, he said, on
keeping his mind on his business and avoiding the little lapses he
calls ``blackouts,'' the flights of fancy that produce broken
racquets and doublefaults like the one that spoiled his
second-round match point in his semifinal against Richard Krajicek:
Instead of handling Wimbledon's 1996 champion in four sets,
Ivanisevic had to endure a 15-13 fifth set marathon where the
Dutchman spun out 23 of his 42 aces. Out-aced 42-28, Ivanisevic won
the match anyway, which he took as a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play good, I can beat anybody,'' he said. ``But then I
can lose to some bad guys because my matches are like horror
thrillers: It's like a movie, and I made the movie, but I don't
know the end.''

   EXP-CUBA-TAINO-CULTURE (Punta Alegre, Cuba) _ They were the
first people to welcome Columbus to the New World. Within a
catastrophically brief time, they became the first casualties of
the clash of cultures that followed his arrival. The native people
of Cuba, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands _ known as the
Taino _ disappeared in little more than a generation, leaving
behind no monumental structures or written language. The tropical
climate quickly destroyed most of their everyday belongings. Until
recently, archaeologists in the Americas concentrated on more
complex societies with large physical legacies: the Aztecs, Inca
and Maya. By Anthony DePalma.

   EXP-AIDS-REALITY (Geneva) _ The 12th World AIDS Conference ended
here Friday in a somber mood. A series of reports about new
problems with anti-AIDS drugs and setbacks in vaccine trials left
many participants thinking that their best hope against the
epidemic is the strategy they have had since it began _ prevention.
It was a sharp contrast to the mood of the last AIDS meeting, in
Vancouver two years ago. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>
   EXP-CHINA-VOICES (Springfield, Ill.) _ At the start of a
scorching Independence Day weekend, Midwesterners were mostly
thinking about parades and cookouts and fireworks. But the
president's foray into China does appear to have made the radar
screen, judging from more than two dozen interviews in this city of
105,000, with most people giving the trip favorable reviews. By

FOR NOVOTNA, A ROYAL PREDICTION COMES TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Five years ago she lent a devastated Jana
Novotna a shoulder to cry on, and last year, after Novotna again
came away distraught from her attempt to make her first career
Grand Slam title a Wimbledon title, the duchess of York,
Wimbledon's most loyal and royal hostess, gave the Czech veteran
some sterling advice. Three's a charm, the duchess assured her, and
on Saturday at Wimbledon that prediction came true.
</P>
<P>
   Turning a royal wish into a royal command, Jana Novotna, whose
painstaking quest to win this Wimbledon title had begun to be the
stuff of legends, provided the answer to her own prayers with a
6-4, 7-6(7-2) defeat of 16th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France,
like Novotna a serve-and-volley throwback to times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   The instant her match-winning forehand return coasted straight
down the sideline the way she'd hoped it would, the 29-year-old
Novotna fell to her much-used knees and burst into tears. For a
change, on finals day at Wimbledon, Novotna's tears were tears of
joy.
</P>
<P>
   After embracing the 30-year-old Tauziat, the first French woman
to reach this final since Suzanne Lenglen won in 1925 and the
lowest-ranked Wimbledon finalist in the Open era, Novotna scampered
into the stands to hug her longtime coach, Hana Madlikova, and her
mother, Liba.
</P>
<P>
   Then she hustled back to Centre Court for an emotional reunion
with the royal benefactor who had predicted she would win this
championship if she found the will to reach its final round a third
time. The duchess clasped both of Novotna's hands in hers, told her
she was proud of her, and then gave her the silver trophy that had
eluded her in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, who was 0-for-3 in Grand Slam finals until Saturday,
said she was so dazed by the time she struck the final winner of
the tiebreaker that she didn't even know what shot she'd hit: All
that mattered was that her last shot was an unreturnable shot.
</P>
<P>
   As she had in her semifinal against top-ranked Martina Hingis,
the teenager who defeated her in Wimbledon's 1997 final, Novotna
got off to a tremulous beginning: She failed to convert a break
point against Tauziat in the opening game of the first set and,
handicapped by a pair of double faults, promptly lost her own serve
to trail 2-0 after the French underdog skimmed a backhand volley
across the net at break point.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna broke straight back courtesy of a pair of backhand
errors by Tauziat, who tended to let out a piercing shriek with
every mistake, high-decibel behavior for the same player who blew
the whistle and called out the grunt police on Monica Seles here in
1992. Novotna held for 2-2, and the set unfolded on serve until the
seventh game, where the Czech veteran finally converted her seventh
break point with an overhead just after Tauziat had saved the sixth
break point with an overhead reply to a limp lob from Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna started the next game with a double fault, but she
regrouped, took herself to game point by following her second serve
with a bold half volley, and achieved a 5-3 advantage that, after
Tauziat held for 4-5, put her in prime position to serve for the
opening set.
</P>
<P>
   With more and better acrobatics at the net, including a high
backhand volley that took her to 30-15 and a lunging forehand
volley that gave her a double set point, Novotna earned the set
when Tauziat, who began to unravel once Novotna's aggressive shots
began zeroing in on their targets, pumped a forehand return into
the net, her 16th unforced error of the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' hissed Novotna, who then expanded her hold on the match
by breaking Tauziat in the first game of the second set.
Consolidation of that break wasn't a given: An out-of-control
double fault put Novotna 0-30 in arrears, but her resolve, and
Tauziat's lack of it, soon put her back in front 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   When Novotna managed to swoop down and scoop up a backhand half
volley that soared past the French challenger and kept her ahead,
3-1, she looked up at the leaden sky and screamed, ``Thank God!''
Nervousness played a definite role in this final, but the good news
for Novotna was that, for a change, the opponent's nerves were just
as frayed as hers.
</P>
<P>
   But the opponent's serves weren't as disobedient as hers, and
when Novotna, just after using an ace to save face at triple break
point of the fourth game, unfurled her seventh double fault, the
second set was level at 3-3. The break didn't rattle Novotna for
long and, just as she had done in the first set, she immediately
repaired it, this time with a backhand volley winner after another
head-on exchange of volleys at the net with Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna then held for a 5-3 lead that, had it not been for her
history of folding in the home stretch, might have looked
commanding. After Tauziat held for 4-5, it was up to Novotna, who
pronounced herself a different player from the bundle of anxiety
that frittered away a 4-1 third-set lead over Steffi Graf here in
the 1993 final, to serve for the title.
</P>
<P>
   On first try, she buckled: She pushed a forehand volley into the
net to put herself behind 15-40, netted a forehand on Tauziat's
third break opportunity, and the set suddenly became anybody's set
at 5-5. Tauziat held for a 6-5 lead, and then it was Novotna's turn
to try and stay in the set and force a tiebreaker: This time, she
didn't compromise herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiebreaker, Novotna rededicated herself to ending the
match and Tauziat again disintegrated: A stream of errors from the
French player and a magnificent lunging backhand volley gave
Novotna her first match point and, fortuitously, she didn't have to
serve for it. That task went to Tauziat, and a forehand return
ended not just the match but 13 years of Wimbledon futility for
Novotna.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here at her favorite slam, Novotna had been careful to take a
page from the sentimental diary of Martina Navratilova, a nine-time
Wimbledon champion, and made sure to reaffirm her rapport with the
Centre Court even before the tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   While Navratilova always liked to pocket a few blades of grass
to keep as a lucky talisman, Novotna simply chose to have a brief
conversation with the grass on Wimbledon's center stage. So she
slipped unnoticed into the empty stadium on the eve of opening day
and, according to her, ``said hello to him and asked how he was
doing.'' The grass, the first new crop on Centre Court in 30 years,
did not respond in kind, but apparently appreciated the veteran's
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Like the grass, this was a new version of the nearly 30-year-old
Novotna who came into this year's event: ``A couple of years ago, I
was perhaps a little too serious, and I thought that's all it takes
to become the No. 1 player in the world, but I think I've found a
happy medium, and I know I can still work hard and be a
professional, but I can have fun and be a little more relaxed about
it,'' said Novotna, who didn't win a grass court singles event
until this year's Wimbledon warm-up at Eastbourne. ``I mean, it's
something that definitely comes with age, and I wish I would have
felt like this seven or eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it took her until 1998, on her 13th visit to Wimbledon
and her third trek to its finale, to relax and celebrate a first
slam championship that was, said Novotna, entirely worth the wait.

ASTROS GET LOTS OF WINS BUT LITTLE RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston Astros, the defending division champions who have
been in first place since May 2, reach the midseason interlude as
perhaps the least heralded and most ignored of the six first-place
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker, in his third year as the Astros' general
manager, doesn't appreciate the oversight or the slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Houston is an overlooked market in general,'' he said.
``People don't seem to care what's going on here and don't take
time to analyze what's going on. Other teams seem to get a lot more
recognition and credit when they do positive things. It seems every
time something happens here people are shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, who seems to take it personally as well as generally,
suggested that when other general managers, such as Jim Bowden of
Cincinnati and Brian Sabean of San Francisco, make moves, they are
saluted as near geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here,'' he added, ``you make moves and it's `I can't
believe they're doing it.' I'm a little frustrated the way things
are viewed here. It's a little more than luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou and Carl Everett, for example. Hunsicker acquired
Alou from the Florida Marlins last Nov. 11 in the first step of
their plan to dismantle the World Series champions. He took Everett
off the Mets' hands six weeks later. They are part of the reason
the Astros entered Saturday's games as the top-hitting team in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the starting pitching rotation? The Astros lost
three-fifths of their 1997 rotation when Darryl Kile went to
Colorado as a free agent and Chris Holt and Ramon Garcia went on
the disabled list for the season. Replacing the missing with Sean
Bergman (obtained from San Diego in January), Pete Schourek (signed
as a free agent in January) and Jose Lima, the Astros have the
league's fourth-lowest earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Hunsicker's moves: The Astros and the manager,
Larry Dierker, whose appointment last year raised skepticism about
his ability to do the job, are headed toward another division
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest satisfaction I have,'' Hunsicker said, ``is we
have the fourth-or fifth-best record in baseball, and the teams
ahead of us have payrolls 15 to 20 million more than ours. Heck,
I'd like to have 10 million more to spend on a couple players. I'd
go to war with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker picked up a pair of well-armed soldiers in Alou and
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people might have felt last year was a career year
for Alou and he would fall off this year,'' Hunsicker said.
``Instead he's on track to have a bigger year than he had last
year, especially in power and run production.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou entered Saturday night's game hitting .317 with 19 home
runs (four short of last year's career high) and a team-leading 71
runs batted in. Everett, who became the everyday center fielder
when Richard Hidalgo, an impressive rookie, separated his shoulder,
was hitting .328.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Alou and Everett, who's having a career year, we're not
so dependent on Jeff Bagwell,'' Hunsicker said. ``In the past, when
Bagwell wasn't hitting, the club usually struggled. It's taken
pressure off Bagwell. It's given our offense a chance to be more
consistent and resistent to slumps.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hunsicker was the Mets' assistant general manager in the first
of three seasons Everett spent with the Mets. Hunsicker didn't name
Dallas Green, but he alluded to the problems Everett had with Green
when he was the Mets' manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dismayed at some of the things that happened,''
Hunsicker said. ``The manager has to be behind him if you're going
to get the most out of him. That didn't always happen. Bobby
Valentine took him under his wing and was more supportive of him
than the people before him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros acquired Everett, Hunsicker said, to have a veteran
on hand in case Hidalgo proved to be less than ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to win pennants with rookies,'' he said. ``Everett
is a guy I thought in my heart would wind up as our regular center
fielder. But I had to lobby a little in spring training to make
sure he at least platooned.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Everett, who went to Houston with a .245 career
batting average, has flourished there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's comfortable here,'' Hunsicker said. ``He knows
I'm in his corner. Tom McCraw'' _ the hitting coach _ ``has been a
good asset for him. Larry's a manager who's hard not to like. The
city has embraced him. He hasn't been under a microscope like he
was in New York. The combination has created the environment to
allow him to play up to his capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their improvement in hitting, the Astros have exhibited
a tighter defense, and that effort has made the pitching staff
better, the staff with the new starters.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and Lima were failed starters who became relievers, but
the Astros switched them back. Lima has struggled recently, failing
to gain victory No. 8 in his last five starts, but Bergman has won
three and the Astros five of his last six starts. Hunsicker
credited Dierker and his pitching coach, Vern Ruhle, with
transforming Bergman from a hard thrower but ineffective pitcher to
a pitcher who throws with less velocity but more control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sat down with him in spring training, like they did with
Mike Hampton a year ago, and said it doesn't matter how fast you
can throw if you can't control the batters' bat speed,'' Hunsicker
said. ``Instead of 92-93 he's throwing 88-89 but has great movement
and has had much better location.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker acknowledged that pitching remains the team's biggest
question mark, but for now the Astros like their location.

RIDDICK BOWE WON CHAMPIONSHIPS, BUT LOST HIS FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Md., Va., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As the Lincoln Navigator sped along Interstate
85 north toward Maryland, Judy Bowe tried to reason with her
estranged husband. But Riddick Bowe, the former heavyweight
champion of the world, drove on, she said, not listening, beyond
being reached.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-month separation, during which he had been living
in his mother's basement, Riddick Bowe had set about reuniting his
family in his own way. Armed with a buck knife, pepper spray, a
flashlight and duct tape, Bowe and his brother, Aaron Wright, drove
six hours from his home in Fort Washington, Md., to his wife's new
home in Cornelius, N.C., a suburb of Charlotte, where, the
authorities say, Bowe abducted Judy Bowe and their five children
during the early morning hours of Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in fear for my life the whole time,'' Judy Bowe said in
an interview. ``He showed me the knife and the other stuff, and he
said he came ready. He said if I didn't do what he said, he'd use
the knife and the things that he had. All the way on the drive he
kept saying that we'd go back and be a happy family and things
would be normal. I kept thinking, how can anything be normal if he
is kidnapping us to take us back home with him? That never dawned
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, Judy Bowe, using a cellular telephone in the
bathroom of a fast-food restaurant, called her cousin, who
eventually alerted police. The incident was soon defused, and
Riddick Bowe, the 30-year-old boxer who had twice beaten Evander
Holyfield during a career in which he earned more than $80 million
in purses, was taken to the psychiatric ward of a hospital and
later arrested. A federal grand jury indicted Bowe on charges of
domestic violence, and on June 4 Bowe pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bowe is awaiting sentencing, ordered to remain in his
Fort Washington house, an electronic bracelet strapped to his
ankle. Bowe, who could be sentenced to up to two years in prison,
has also been ordered to undergo psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to take responsibility for his actions,'' Mark
Calloway, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North
Carolina, said of Bowe. ``The fact that he pleaded guilty means he
has started to do that. But he also has to be punished for what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of boxing's disgraced or damaged champions is long and
inglorious, and Bowe has now taken his place on it, his story both
familiarly violent and sadly perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   It is the tale of a Brooklyn youth _ the 12th of 13 children
raised by a single mother in the impoverished and often deadly
Brownsville section _ who earned Olympic glory and great wealth,
only to wind up facing imprisonment for trying to collect the
pieces of his prized family, the one he alone had shattered.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the complex narrative of a boxer with an arrested
emotional development, who, according to family, friends, advisers
and adversaries, always struggled to reconcile his talent for
fighting with a basic lack of discipline and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Often portrayed favorably in the news media, where he was
eagerly contrasted with his Brownsville contemporary, Mike Tyson,
Bowe was ostensibly a true family man. Yet according to his wife,
even though Bowe used his wealth to get relatives off welfare and
buy them expensive homes and cars, he turned those gifts into tools
of control.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Bowe was managed by Eugene Roderick (Rock) Newman,
the iconoclastic, politically connected promoter who not only
generated multimillion-dollar purses for Bowe, but also arranged
trips to see the pope in Rome and Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
Along the way, Newman, while a lucratively effective negotiator,
may have alienated the boxer from the power brokers in the sport
and thus hastened his decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Riddick Bowe had constructed and inhabited a fairy
tale existence and all of a sudden real life has intruded,'' said
Seth Abraham, the president of Time-Warner Sports/HBO, who once
signed Bowe to serve as a worldwide ambassador for the sport and
the cable television company. ``It is very difficult for him to
confront the things he's faced with, considering the kind of life
he has led.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowe, through Newman, declined repeated requests to be
interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Talent for Boxing, If Not the Temperament
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Atlas, the veteran trainer, had a chance to work with Bowe
when the boxer was just starting out as a professional in late
1988. Intrigued by Bowe's obvious talent, Atlas nonetheless
suspected Bowe lacked something, some mix of dedication and natural
appetite for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always got the impression that he didn't like fighting, but
because it was something he was good at, he just kept doing it,''
Atlas said. ``He just got dragged along the more successful he
became, but he never really wanted it the way most guys at the top
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The life and environment that produced Bowe and his blend of
artistry and apathy were not unusual for a boxer. Bowe has said he
saw his father, Jake, perhaps six times during his childhood. And
the single-parent household encountered its share of hurt: one of
Bowe's sisters was murdered for her welfare check; a brother died
of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Bowe's mother, Dorothy Bowe, pampered Riddick, her youngest son,
and the reluctant boxer developed an ability to laugh through his
training and troubles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He always liked to joke and play,'' said Moe Sims, a family
friend who was a father figure to the young Bowe. ``It was real
tough to get him to be serious. In a funny sort of way, he used
playing and joking to boost his confidence. He always felt it made
him a better fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowe was good from the beginning, winning three Golden Gloves
titles as a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he won the Golden Gloves championship and he
was getting the award, he got his first suit,'' Sims said. ``He
couldn't tie the tie. I helped him tie it. He said, `I've never had
anyone to do that for me.' I always tried to make him feel proud of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone could be charmed by Bowe, who used to
protectively walk his mother to and from the factory where she
worked. Eddie Futch, the legendary trainer who eventually worked
Bowe's corner, said he had heard of Bowe's care for his mother and
concluded, ``This is a guy with a lot of character.'' Indeed, Judy
Bowe, then 15, fell in love with a boy she described as
distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't appear to be like the other guys in the
neighborhood, the drug dealers and fast talkers with girls all over
the place,'' said Judy, who married Bowe on April 27, 1988, when
she was 21. ``He was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowe became only the second child in his family to graduate from
high school when he got his diploma from Thomas Jefferson High
School. And he won a silver medal at the Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea, in October 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The news media embraced Bowe, perhaps in part because reporters
and broadcasters had wearied of the unabashedly violent Tyson, who
as a youth had mugged people like Dorothy Bowe. Bowe's tales of
guarding his mother, his knack for doing impressions and eliciting
laughs, were played prominently in profiles of the boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the accomplishments and accolades, Bowe was an
exasperating project. Sims had to wake an oversleeping Bowe so that
he did not miss his flight to Seoul in 1988. And Bowe, he said,
never trained particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the baby boy,'' Sims said. ``He was the only one in his
family to have any success. He was the only one to ever work for a
living. There could have been a discipline problem there, because
he was always used to getting his way.''
</P>
<P>
   And Futch, once he met Bowe, had his own immediate questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him, I saw what the problem was,'' said
Futch, who wound up training Bowe for eight years. ``He was 21
years old, but he was just a big kid. Everybody thought he was a
man, but he was a boy. He had the mental maturity of a
16-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a great jab, though, and enough toughness, or pure
talent, to succeed in the ring. Four years after turning pro, he
was a champion, winning a 12-round decision over Holyfield in
November 1992. Newman produced a lucrative HBO contract and a
multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Fila, an athletic apparel
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Loving Persona, But Private Demons
</P>
<P>
   The image is still locked in Judy Bowe's mind: her husband,
while in training for a fight three years ago, disciplining their
oldest son, J.R., who was 8 years old at the time. She said the
fighter ripped the cord from the television in his hotel suite,
and, using duct tape, bound J.R.'s hands and feet, eventually
whipping him with the cord.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it is an image that runs counter to Bowe's public
persona, that of the loving man who married his high school
sweetheart and who often said he could not train seriously because
he missed his children.
</P>
<P>
   But for Judy Bowe, it was consistent with the darker side of
Bowe that she knew well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riddick knocked me out in front of my 3-year-old last April,''
she said. ``I was out cold for several minutes. It never fazed
Riddick. He thought nothing of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, Bowe's manager, declined to talk in detail about Judy
Bowe's portrait of her husband. He said he believed that Judy Bowe
and her lawyer, Barbara Gorinson, were eager to disparage Bowe in
order to exact a better financial settlement in the couple's
divorce proceeding. But Newman did not deny that Bowe had been
physically abusive to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riddick, if he had his way right now, would erase whatever
pain that he has caused his wife and family and they'd be together
as they have been in the best of times, as a big happy family,''
Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Bowe's depiction of her husband is grim. She said that
over the years, with his extended family and millions of dollars in
purses, Bowe had become obsessed with issues of control. He used
the financial resources to manipulate those around him and resorted
to violence when people did not do as he wished.
</P>
<P>
   As the sole source of income for his family, Bowe moved everyone
to Fort Washington, Md., a Washington suburb, in 1990, in part to
be near his manager, Newman. Judy Bowe said her husband bought
houses on his street for his mother, her mother, three of his
sisters and a niece and gave them stipends of $1,000 a month to get
them off welfare. But, said the boxer's wife, Bowe ``punishes them
by withholding money from them whenever they do something he
doesn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Bowe said that when a Rolex watch Bowe had bought for his
mother was stolen Bowe lined up all the relatives who lived on the
street and told them he would deduct the cost of the watch from
their stipends unless it was returned.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, before they separated last September, a
suspicious Bowe had begun to follow her everywhere, even when she
merely went to buy groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a rough marriage,'' Judy Bowe said. ``But the
last few years things have got worse. In a marriage there are
always things that happen, but because you love someone you stick
with them and hope things will get better. Things were not getting
any better. I didn't see them ever getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Bowe filed for divorce this past May, alleging physical
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the kind of person who is able to deal with life,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight champion, spoke with Bowe at
an awards banquet in April. Bowe, he said, was a ghost of the man
who had joked with Holyfield outside of the ring and given
Holyfield as much as he could handle inside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of sad,'' Holyfield said. ``He was slurring his
speech. His demeanor was quite different. A guy as young as him,
you kind of wonder what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bowe,'' Holyfield added. ``Bowe was my sparring
partner. He's a funny guy. All of us tend to have that same
upbringing. Single-parent homes. We struggle and we tend to trust
people more than we should. We really didn't talk at length. I
didn't know if I would embarrass him by asking him the things I
wanted to ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Holyfield wanted to ask was what had gone so
completely wrong for Bowe so quickly. Bowe, after all, had twice
beaten Holyfield and remains the only fighter to have knocked
Holyfield out. His record as a professional was 40-1-1. Futch had
come to so marvel at Bowe's boxing gifts that he thought he could
overcome his personality defects.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, Bowe abdicated the World Boxing Council title when
he refused to fight Lennox Lewis. In a staged event, he dumped the
belt in a garbage can. Then, on Nov. 6, 1993, Bowe lost the World
Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation
championships to Holyfield in a 12-round decision. He was then
frozen out of the heavyweight title picture. In fact, he never got
another shot at the title.
</P>
<P>
   The Boxer's Life And Career Unravel
</P>
<P>
   Many people in boxing believe that Bowe was ostracized as
payback against Newman, who was regarded as an outsider whose
notoriety stemmed chiefly from his work as a radio broadcaster and
efforts for the political campaigns of the Washington Mayor Marion
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Newman closely controlled every aspect of Bowe's professional
career, acting as both his manager and promoter, even though that
practice is prohibited in most states. Newman had formed a
promotional company, Spencer Promotions Inc., that was run by his
brother, John, but was directed by Newman. In complete control,
Newman bargained hard with most of the big players in the sport,
orchestrating $80 million in purses. But those tactics might have
come back to haunt Bowe once he lost his world titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock did an absolutely magnificent job for Riddick,'' said
Milton Chwasky, a lawyer who helped negotiate many of Bowe's
contracts. ``Sure he alienated people. Who doesn't in this
business? Some came back on board. Some didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Futch was more emphatically astonished at what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' Futch said. ``He wasn't
even ranked in the top 10 by any of the three main boxing
organizations and he had just lost the title. It made no sense. It
was like they were punishing him for the way Rock had been
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowe's career dissolved in 1996 in two brutal bouts with Andrew
Golota, who was disqualified in both for low blows. Futch, who had
grown weary of Bowe's lack of discipline, his unruly entourage and
Bowe's unwillingness to remain in shape, resigned as his trainer
after the first Golota fight.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, Bowe's personal life began unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, 1997, Bowe and a friend, Deion Jordan, joined the
Marine Corps. Bowe called it a lifelong dream. He lasted 11 days,
washing out on the third day of basic training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a 29-year-old millionaire,'' said Maj. Rick Long, the
Marine Corps public affairs officer at Parris Island. ``Going from
that life style to being a Marine recruit, where the average age is
19, was quite a transition. Just being told what to do, when to do
it and how fast to do it was very difficult for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, one of his older sisters, Velma Melton, accused
Bowe of punching her in the mouth, although she refused to press
charges. Three months after that, Bowe was charged with assaulting
his wife, punching her in the face and back and shoving her across
the room, according to her criminal complaint. The second-degree
assault charge is pending. A month later, in September, Judy Bowe
packed the five children and moved to Cornelius, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the police in Prince George's County, Md., charged
Bowe with assaulting his nephew Horace Bowe. Bowe claimed his
nephew had threatened his mother with a knife. Those charges are
pending, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then last February, Bowe decided to try to reclaim his family.
Edward Hinson Jr., one of Bowe's lawyers, said he had been
encouraged to bring back his wife and children by Judy Bowe's
mother, Mildren Gordon. Judy Bowe disputes that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said Riddick Bowe was having trouble processing
information and forming rational decisions when he decided to go
get his family. Bowe had, for example, sold most of his cars one
week only to buy new ones the next week, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   But early on Feb. 25, Bowe circled Wave Street in Cornelius in
the Lincoln Navigator that he had borrowed from a friend, Bernard
Brooks Jr. According to prosecutors, when two of Bowe's children
went to the school bus stop, Bowe picked them up and drove them
back to his wife's house. He left his brother in the car with the
two children and the engine running. After pushing his way through
the door, Bowe went to his wife's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he came at me and the tone of his voice,'' Judy Bowe
said, ``made me do what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode ended in South Hill, Va., and Bowe, after Newman's
intervention, wound up in the psychiatric ward of Howard University
Medical Center in Washington. Neurological tests done there, Newman
said, showed no signs of damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was misguided,'' Hinson said, insisting again that
Bowe had taken his family at the urging of Judy Bowe's mother. ``He
grew up in a broken home in Brooklyn. He doesn't want the same
thing to happen to his children. He was just trying to get his
family back together.'' &QL;

   EAGAR, Ariz. _ Down a dusty, rocky trail and through a knot of
pine trees, past a naked guy chewing leaves, a fully clothed
Christian choir and a retired Jewish pie thrower, is the meadow
where the Rainbow Family is holding its 27th annual gathering to
party and pray for peace.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 14,000 members of this family of old hippies and
young converts, of blacks and whites, of American Indians and
recent immigrants, of babies and grandparents, have come from
across the country to the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, just
west of this two-stoplight town near the New Mexico border, for an
annual gathering that lasts for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They gather to tune in love and to tune out what some Rainbow
members call Babylon, the outside world of stock markets, guns,
wars and drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our children to see guns,'' said Barry Adams,
one of the founders of the family. ``We want our children to see
tools and paint brushes and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old woman whom everyone calls Maddog said: ``Coming
here is like medicine for my spirit. This is like my family
reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the site of the gathering, which is held in a
different national park or forest each year, was spread by word of
month. Now, word is largely spread through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't stuck in the '60s,'' Adams said with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   By the Fourth of July, the peak of the Rainbow reunion, as many
as 20,000 men, women and children may be camping out in tents,
tepees or under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service has dispatched a National Incident Team
and a contingent of at least 40 officers and other staff members to
keep an eye on the Rainbows, who have been known to fill their
peace pipes with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache County sheriff, the Arizona Public Safety Department
and four towns, including Eagar, have sent in officers to patrol
the edges of the sprawling encampment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the extra law enforcement in town is causing more tension
than the Rainbows,'' said Francies Leyba, 40, a night manager at
the Best Western motel in Eagar. ``The police are stopping
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leyba, who has not been to the camp and has no intention of
going, said she was stopped by police the other day for making a
turn without signaling. That has never happened before, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what all the fuss is about,'' she added. ``It's
just a bunch of hippies playing music and drinking beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbows are also using water that the Forest Service and
another nearby town, Springerville, insist they are not entitled
to. The Rainbows have set up a series of pipes leading from a
nearby spring to their makeshift kitchens on the edge of the
meadow.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service says the water belongs to Springerville and
two private owners. The Rainbows say the water is in a national
forest and therefore, at least some of it belongs to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Citing their First Amendment rights of peaceable assembly and
free speech, the Rainbows have also refused, as they usually do, to
seek or sign a permit to use the park for gatherings of more than
75 people. Two of their members volunteered to receive Forest
Service citations; if convicted, they could be jailed for six
months for not having a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Duncan, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said dealing
with the Rainbows is often a challenge. ``Tempers can flare,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen people, primarily Rainbows, have been arrested
or have been given citations, mostly for possessing marijuana or
for minor traffic violations. But Ms. Duncan said the main concern
of the Forest Service is that the park not be damaged by the
hundreds of cars and vans and the thousands of people converging on
it at one time.
</P>
<P>
   This year there is an added concern: fire. The forest is dry and
a campfire restriction is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbows say they are being exceedingly careful. They also
say they have been holding so many rain dances that their feet are
sore. Drake Beacon, a family member from New York City who has
attended the gatherings for 20 years, patrols the camp site every
night with a group of volunteers, putting out any camp fires. Other
groups are assigned to clean up and stay for weeks after every
gathering to restore whatever park or forest they use.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour walk through the camp Wednesday, past some
jugglers under a tree and an Indian on horseback, only a few people
were seen smoking cigarettes and even fewer were smoking marijuana,
although one man walked through the crowd pleading for some
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's just like New York City around here,'' said a
man called Peace Eagle. ``You've got a few con men on the fringes
and the cops running around making everyone nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp is divided into more than a dozen smaller camps,
including Carnivore Cafi, Musical Veggie Cafi, Height Street Camp,
Hobo Hilton and Little Rascals Hideaway. There also is Anonymous
Camp, which is for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a camp for children called Kiddie Village, where a
woman from Tucson who calls herself Bird Song was helping to cook a
meal. Bird Song had brought two of her three children to the
gathering, including her 15-year-old son, who was helping care for
the smaller children in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no single parents here,'' Bird Song said. ``They say
it takes a village to raise a child. This is a village.''
</P>
<P>
   The campers in Kiddie Village are an eclectic group that
includes people who cannot remember the last time they had a job as
well as people like Lynne Reister, a 56-year-old marine surveyor
from Seattle who says she cannot remember the last time she did not
have a job.
</P>
<P>
   The village is also home to Aaron Kay, one of several Jews in
the camp who have set up a kosher kitchen. Kay is from New York
City, where he was known as the Pie Man because of his propensity
for throwing pies into the faces of public figures and politicians,
including former California Gov. Jerry Brown. ``He's the only one I
ever apologized to,'' Kay said, ``because he went in a more
progressive direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kay, 48, said he had not thrown a pie at anyone since 1992.
``I've retired,'' he said. ``I can't run anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   People greet each other with hugs, smiles and the Rainbow
Family's motto, ``Welcome Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was Cora Lee's first Rainbow reunion. When she made
the trip from her home in Amherst, Mass., she did not know what to
expect from so many hippies gathered in one place this side of
1969. But after a few days, she said, she felt comfortable walking
through the woods with nothing on but her smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt any danger,'' she said. ``I never felt I had to
be afraid of men. This is a place of love.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Baca, who has been attending Rainbow reunions for
several years, said there are some people who bring their racist
and sexist attitudes with them. He also complained that some of the
younger Rainbows do not seem as willing to help with chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family has a few problems,'' he said. ``That doesn't
mean you stop being a family.''

PREVENTION REMAINS THE BEST HOPE IN FIGHT AGAINST AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The 12th World AIDS Conference ended here Friday in a
somber mood.
</P>
<P>
   A series of reports about new problems with anti-AIDS drugs and
setbacks in vaccine trials left many participants thinking that
their best hope against the epidemic is the strategy they have had
since it began _ prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But many of them said this last hope was not being pursued as
aggressively as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was a sharp contrast to the euphoria at the last AIDS
meeting, in Vancouver, British Columbia, two years ago. There,
scientists reported that combinations of new drugs, called protease
inhibitors, had allowed many people infected with HIV, the AIDS
virus, to leave their deathbeds, even to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the talk was of problems. Vaccine researchers
gave the disheartening news that a promising candidate vaccine,
tested in monkeys, caused the disease rather than prevented it.
Doctors told of patients who failed in spite of the new drugs, or
who developed side effects while taking them.
</P>
<P>
   And even when the drugs offered hope, still other speakers said,
it is hope beyond the reach of the vast majority of the 34 million
people now infected with the AIDS virus. Those patients cannot
afford the treatment. It can cost about $15,000 to provide the
drugs to one person a year, a sum greater than the entire health
budget of many a Third World village.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Hoosen Coovadia, of Durban, South Africa, explained it,
AIDS affects 40 percent of the children he treats in a large black
hospital there. Yet, Coovadia, who is chairman of the next World
AIDS Conference in 2000 in Durban, said that he had never used any
anti-HIV drugs. His hospital cannot afford them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports like these lead inexorably to the conclusion that the
best hope for easing the epidemic is still prevention, speakers
said. Yet ``over 100 times more money is being spent on
therapeutics now than on the development of prevention
technologies,'' said Dr. Catherine Hankins, an epidemiologist at
Montreal General Hospital in Canada. Among them are chemicals that
could be inserted into the vagina before sexual intercourse to kill
HIV. Hankins left the meeting saying she did not feel ``terribly
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex education, needle-exchange programs, condom distribution,
among other preventions, could save millions of people from AIDS,
speaker after speaker told those gathered at the meeting. At the
same time, though, many of the 13,775 participants from 177
countries concluded that people and their government leaders were
not paying enough attention to those relatively simple steps, and
that industry was doing too little to develop more effective
prevention methods.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers urged that health workers combine preventions as they
had drugs and adopt a community-based approach to promote them.
They called for more programs to treat sexually transmitted
diseases because those diseases can increase the risk of spreading
HIV, in part by creating open sores.
</P>
<P>
   Programs to promote sex education, use of male and female
condoms, and needle exchanges worked well and did not promote
promiscuity or drug use, a number of health workers said. Yet, they
added, government and community leaders often become near
hysterical when such programs are broached, often because they fear
criticism from the clergy or political opponents. In the United
States, there has been widespread opposition to condom-distribution
programs, and the Clinton administration announced recently that it
would not support needle-exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what prevention works, but we don't do enough of it,''
said Dr. Werasit Sittitrai of Thailand. He cited several effective
measures, including counseling about sexual health, education from
peers who had been trained to advise in prevention, and access to
friendly and confidential clinics that treat sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But older people often stand in the way because they forget what
it was like to be young, Sittitrai said. ``We forget the fear, the
laughter, the craziness, the boredom, and all those bubbling,
boiling hormones,'' he said, and ``how much sex occupied our
thoughts.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Speakers called on conference participants to return to their
homes and rally others to become more involved in the political
process to promote HIV-prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's theme was ``bridging the gap'' between what is
available to HIV-infected people in developed and developing
countries, where, said Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the
United Nations AIDS program, the virus is causing ``a runaway
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The enormous complexity of dealing with a raging epidemic in a
poor country was underscored by a report from Dr. Alan Smith, a
virologist at the University of Natal in South Africa, who
discussed blood tests for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The standard HIV test detects proteins known as antibodies that
are usually formed about six weeks after the virus enters the body.
A more precise test, which detects a portion of the AIDS virus
known as P24, appears to be far better, but most developing
countries cannot afford it, said Smith, who studied the problem in
a prenatal clinic. Accurate testing during pregnancy is
particularly crucial to enable doctors to try to prevent
transmission of the virus from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies showed that giving pregnant women the anti-viral
drug AZT and delivering their babies by planned Caesarean section
could reduce the risk of a baby's contracting the virus from its
mother to about 1 percent. The drug and surgery therapies are
widespread in developed countries, said Dr. Augusto Semprini of the
San Paolo Biomedical Institute in Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that many obstetricians in developing countries do
not perform Caesarean sections because of the increased risks of
the surgery and inadequate infection-control measures in their
hospitals. And many developing countries can not afford AZT.
</P>
<P>
   But some gaps that need to be bridged lie nearer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harrington of Treatment Action Group, an AIDS advocacy
group in New York City, said gaps in care existed in the United
States as well as the Third World. ``When we talk about the
North-South gap, we must remember that the South includes
Mississippi, and it includes the South Bronx,'' where the
prevalence of HIV is high, Harrington told participants at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He called for pressure on politicians to get prevention methods
and treatment to more people.
</P>
<P>
   The mood shift seen between the Vancouver and Geneva meetings is
not unusual in research and public health because progress often
resembles a roller-coaster ride, particularly in the first years
after scientists confront a new disease.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS was recognized in 1981 as an immunological disorder several
years before HIV was identified several years later. But thereafter
immunologists and virologists often worked apart. Now scientists in
both fields are beginning to bridge that gap in seeking ways to
bring the immune system into play during antiviral therapy, said
Dr. Jay Levy of the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be difficult to put any new findings into clinical
practice. For example, the effectiveness of combination anti-HIV
therapy has been documented in clinical trials. As valuable as the
trials are, most last little longer than four or six months, and
drug companies are generally reluctant to compare new drugs in
head-to-head trials because the trials are costly and might show
that a competitor's drug is more effective.
</P>
<P>
   That often leaves many doctors and their patients in a quandary
over how aggressive they should be in starting new anti-HIV drugs
and answering a number of other questions, said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr,
who treats many HIV-infected people at Harlem Hospital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   El-Sadr described a patient, Lester, who has stopped injecting
illegal drugs and has read extensively about HIV. ``He reads and
asks the toughest questions,'' El-Sadr said, such as: ```I have
done so well till now on no treatment; have they looked at these
cocktails in people like me? Are you sure I am better off to start
now?'''
</P>
<P>
   El-Sadr said she could not answer those questions in Lester's
case and many others for additional patients because the clinical
trials did not provide the crucial information. To help get it,
El-Sadr called on Federal health officials to start a program to
monitor anti-HIV treatment in practice.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs in the pipeline are expected to simplify treatment
regimens by decreasing the number of times pills must be taken each
day. There are now 11 anti-HIV drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration and marketed in the United States, and the number
may soon reach 15.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are generally given in combinations of three and
sometimes four. That will leave 204 possible combinations of three
drugs, and 1,028 possible combinations of four drugs, said Dr.
Richard Horton, the editor of The Lancet, an international medical
journal published in London.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julio Montaner, who heads the AIDS program at the University
of British Columbia in Vancouver, said that HIV therapy was so
complex that even experts like him had difficulty keeping track of
therapeutic advances. But many doctors who are inadequately
informed about the disease prescribe drugs for HIV patients, and
``there is a lot of suffering among infected people because they
were given suboptimal treatment,'' Montaner said.
</P>
<P>
   If doctors do not know how to use the new drug cocktails
appropriately, or if patients abandon precautions in intercourse,
the results can be disastrous for them and eventually for society.
If doctors do not prescribe the drugs correctly or if patients do
not use them correctly, the virus can mutate into drug-resistant
strains.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors from the University of California at San Francisco
reported about a man who became infected with a strain resistant to
six of the 11 anti-HIV drugs now in use.
</P>
<P>
   Additional cases of multiple drug-resistant strains of HIV were
reported by doctors in Geneva, raising warnings of a potentially
even more serious public health problem.

LEWINSKY'S LAWYERS AND STARR STALL OVER IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: 2 p.m. ET embargo)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One month after Monica Lewinsky replaced her legal
team, negotiations on a deal with the independent counsel to avoid
possible prosecution of the former White House intern have stalled,
lawyers on both sides of the talks report.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Ms. Lewinsky had not reached
agreement on any of the central issues. They also said that the
talks were not likely to be completed until prosecutors set a
formal deadline for an end of negotiations, probably as the grand
jury nears completion of its work later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Ms. Lewinsky replaced her previous lawyer, who
was from California, with two experienced Washington lawyers in the
hope of averting prosecution and reaching an immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers emphasized that the talks had not been abandoned,
they said that there had been no movement in days on two central
issues and that the two sides remained far apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main sticking points have not changed,'' one of the
lawyers said. ``Absent some precipitating event, like the setting
of a deadline, it's difficult to see anything further happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legal team and the prosecutors have been unable to agree
on a procedure to take Ms. Lewinsky's testimony in advance of any
final deal. And they have failed to agree on what testimony she
could offer in exchange for either a reduced criminal charge or no
charge at all.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and others involved in the inquiry have said that tape
recordings made by the FBI and by Linda Tripp capture Ms. Lewinsky
talking at length about how President Clinton and one of his
closest friends, Vernon Jordan, took steps to discourage her from
being truthful about her relationship with Clinton in the sexual
harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Both the president and Jordan have said that they never asked
Ms. Lewinsky to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has been unwilling in her proposed testimony to go
as far as her reported statements on the tapes in implicating
Clinton and Jordan, the lawyers said. She has been willing to say
that she had sex with Clinton, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed in the Jones lawsuit, Ms. Lewinsky said
she never had a sexual relationship with the president and that he
``did not offer me employment or other benefits in exchange for a
sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers have not offered to provide details of a
three-page list of ``talking points'' handed to Mrs. Tripp by Ms.
Lewinsky in an apparent effort to coach Mrs. Tripp about what she
should say in the Jones lawsuit. One of the central mysteries in
the inquiry has been whether anyone assisted Ms. Lewinsky in
preparing the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has insisted from the outset of the case that he would not
accept any deal until investigators had a chance to interrogate Ms.
Lewinsky to test her credibility. But her lawyers have opposed the
idea, fearful that the prosecutors would use what was said in a
possible case against her if they were unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, Ms. Lewinsky's new lawyers, have
proposed a conditional agreement. Under its terms, investigators
would interview Ms. Lewinsky and would have the right to reject the
deal if she failed to satisfy its terms. But prosecutors have been
reluctant to accept that proposal, concerned that Cacheris and
Stein would seek to have the deal enforced by a judge even if the
prosecutors decided Ms. Lewinsky's interview was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the reluctance by the prosecutors to accept the
conditional agreement reflects their experience with Ms. Lewinsky's
previous lawyer, William Ginsburg. Ginsburg sought to have a
federal judge enforce an immunity agreement that he said the
prosecutors had made. But the prosecutors convinced the judge,
Norma Holloway Johnson, that no agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, some advisers to Ms. Lewinsky have also
cautioned her against moving too quickly in embracing any kind of
deal, particularly in light of a recent decision in the tax evasion
case that Starr had tried to make against Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday a federal judge threw out the tax indictment,
ruling that Starr had both exceeded his jurisdiction and reneged on
a promise to grant Hubbell immunity. The advisers to Ms. Lewinsky
have cautioned that the decision reflects a view that Starr does
not abide by the immunity grants he confers on potential
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said that the district court in the Hubbell case erred
and has vowed to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is expected to continue hearing testimony for
several more weeks. In addition to hearing more from Mrs. Tripp,
the jurors are expected to hear again from Betty Currie, the
president's personal secretary, who has told investigators that she
retrieved from Ms. Lewinsky gifts that had been given to the former
intern by Clinton. The gifts were returned by Ms. Lewinsky after
Ms. Jones' lawyers issued a subpoena for them.

CLINTON'S CHINA VISIT WAS A SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
   A news analysis  
 (For use by New York Times Nedws Servi ed Nx3000r a
 By ORVILLE SCHELL  
 C.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Now that President Clinton has finished his nine-day
grand tour of China, we are left to pose a question: Is it possible
for the leaders of two major powers that are divided by numerous
seemingly insoluble issues to complete a state visit that produces
no substantive new agreements and yet is still considered a
success?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Probably.
</P>
<P>
   After getting off to a rocky start with his Tiananmen Square
welcome as goose-stepping People's Liberation Army soldiers went on
review and a 21-gun salute filled the square with the first sounds
of gunfire since 1989, Clinton ended up accomplishing a triumph of
atmospherics that could, paradoxically, have as salubrious a
long-term effect on Sino-U.S. relations as any raft of formal
bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
   China's President Jiang Zemin also managed a significant
victory. In the latest chapter of the Chinese Communist Party's
serial re-invention of itself in the image of its former
adversaries, Jiang, who is also the party chief, ended up looking
more like a normal capitalist president than any of the pantheon of
socialist ``big leaders'' who have preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, in its new relaxed and open guise, China seemed
less in need of maintaining a contrived proletarian pose and more
comfortable with itself than at any time during the last
half-century. It was almost as if the notions of ``bourgeois
liberalization'' and ``peaceful evolution,'' which party leaders
only recently were reviling as hostile foreign plots designed to
subvert the Communist Party, had become officially enthroned as the
new ``correct line.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's new born-again persona of self-confidence allowed him to
hold his own against Clinton at their joint press conference in the
Great Hall of the People, despite the fact that his counterpart
raised issues about human rights, Tibet, the arrest of dissidents
and the 1989 massacre that previously had been too sensitive even
to mention in public. This unlikely pair was so well-matched that
their performance seemed like an opera duet with its stars singing
off of the same score rather than a Leninist and a democrat making
arguments from completely different political canons.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Clinton continued his offensive of candor and
charm by addressing a crowd at Peking University and first quoting
Benjamin Franklin _ ``Our critics are our friends, for they show us
our faults'' _ and then declaring that ``stability in the 21st
century will require high levels of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his straightforwardness, Clinton bent over backward not
to give an air of condescension. His efforts were sometimes so
studied that they made his disagreements with the Chinese Communist
Party seem temporarily of no more moral significance than a
personal preference for a different color. In discussing the recent
arrest of some dissidents, for instance, he ingratiatingly allowed
during his joint press conference with Jiang that ``there are
legitimate and honest differences in the way we look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   On such occasions, it was too easy to forget that what was
really at issue were such matters as the Chinese government's
penchant for arresting its citizens for the peaceful expression of
their political or religious views, or its habit of sending them
abroad into forced exile because it disagreed with what they wrote
or said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's caution did help facilitate what ended up being an
unprecedented Sino-U.S. public dialogue. And the whole event
suggested that the People's Republic might be edging up to an
important new milestone in its post-Mao development.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, attempts to discuss sensitive issues had provoked
indignant counter-allegations from China that the United States was
``interfering in China's internal affairs'' or ``hurting the
feelings of the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders, who view their country as having been
ruthlessly preyed upon by the West and Japan, have had a
predictably knee-jerk reaction whenever they have been criticized.
They have dragged up everything from the Opium Wars to
most-favored-nation trade status to highlight the unfair way they
have been hectored and humiliated by the West.
</P>
<P>
   But now, they seem on the verge of relieving themselves of some
of this burdensome historical baggage. For the moment, at least, a
new sense of leadership parity seems to have replaced this old
syndrome in which China has so readily cast itself as the victim of
history in response to Western criticisms of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's willingness to allow public expression of American views
on sensitive Chinese issues, without immediately retaliating in
this predictable but unproductive way, gives hope that he will win
his struggle to break through the gravity that has kept so many of
his comrades earthbound in confrontation with the West. It also
encourages us to hope that he _ and future leaders _ will find a
more confident state of equipoise in their relations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Jiang seemed to be proclaiming figuratively that it
was time not only for China to insist on its right to be treated as
a great and cosmopolitan power, but for its own leaders to start
deporting themselves in a manner becoming such status.
</P>
<P>
   China continues to be beset by daunting economic problems that,
if exacerbated by the larger Asian melt-down, could easily balloon
into political upheaval and jeopardize Jiang's new air of
confidence. Yet the Beijing summit managed to build a foundation of
personal relationships and respect upon which a much more open and
productive dialogue with the United States may yet be able to
arise.
</P>
<P>
   What has long been missing in the relations between our two
countries is precisely this kind of climate _ one in which the
United States can raise troublesome but real problems without
having to fear causing China such a ``loss of face'' that the whole
relationship will be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton's odyssey accomplished no immediate
breakthroughs and led to no major new agreements, those who have
observed China over the last several decades could not fail but
appreciate it as an occasion of real significance. Whether this
change in atmospherics will usher Sino-U.S. relations into a new
era of ``constructive engagement'' still remains uncertain. After
all, a single robin does not necessarily herald springtime.
</P>
<P>
   And we will forget at our peril that even in an autocratic
country like the People's Republic of China, ``big leaders'' are
not as all-powerful as we sometimes like to imagine. Jiang may have
a new relationship with Clinton, but it is still far from sure that
he will be able to keep the support of the rest of his own
country's convoluted, conflicted and often refractory leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The pugnacious, even aggressive, questions with which students
barraged Clinton after his well-mannered and thoughtful speech at
Peking University were reminders that one does not have to scratch
China very deeply to uncover its muscular nationalism and its
lingering sensitivities to even the appearance of foreign
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing is sure. Even in the most optimistic of
scenarios, democracy is not about to spring forth full-blown in
China any time soon. The traditions of authoritarianism both in the
Communist Party and in China's Confucian past are far too deep and
abiding for that.
</P>
<P>
   But if he prevails, it may be that Jiang Zemin's new infatuation
with playing the role of a more open and cosmopolitan leader will,
in fact, help lead China into a new state of mind. If he succeeds,
not only might the once-reviled notion of ``peaceful evolution''
become the best scenario for better Sino-U.S. relations, but
``bourgeois liberalization'' might also become the watchword for
greater openness and tolerance at home.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rain will once again dampen sections of northeastern New England
as low pressure moves slowly into the Maritimes. A cold front
attending the disturbance will move off the North Atlantic coast by
early afternoon taking the clouds and scattered showers out to sea.
Drier and slightly cooler air will flow into the Northeast on
gentle breezes. Sunshine will return to most sections from southern
New England to the Great Lakes by afternoon. High pressure crested
over northern Michigan will promote pleasant conditions in the Ohio
valley.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of cooler, less humid air will stretch from
southern Virginia to the central Plains. A few thundershowers are
expected to form east of the Appalachians, but most of the
thunderstorms will erupt in the central Mississippi Valley. Strong
to locally severe storms may develop in northern Texas along the
boundary between hot, dry air and residual tropical moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon thunderstorms will become more frequent near the Gulf
Coast and northern Florida as a weak jet-stream disturbance settles
over the region. Record heat is still expected along Florida's east
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening low pressure near Rapid City will direct rather
hot air toward the northeast Plains. A cluster of thunderstorms
will develop in the eastern Dakotas producing flooding rain,
damaging winds and hail. More thundershowers are anticipated in the
eastern and northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will remain cool and dull at the coast, but the
Southwest will stay torrid with ample sunshine inland.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Reversed Seasons
</P>
<P>
   There has been a nearly complete reversal of the typical
rainfall pattern in Florida so far this year. The winter, which is
usually a dry season, produced 31.03 inches of rain at Tampa,
compared with an average of 7.22 inches from December through
February. June, which marks the start of the wet season, was the
driest on record from Orlando to Cape Canaveral. Only .16 inch fell
on Melbourne compared with the normal amount of 6.13 inches. The
lack of rain clouds promoted the hottest month ever recorded in
east central Florida as most locations exceeded their previous
record by 2 degrees.

COMMENTARY: STATE SELLS PIPE DREAMS TO THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Jayanti and Bharti Patel's shop on Main
Street looks like just another cluttered candy store. But don't be
fooled by the stocks of candy and stationery. What it mostly sells
are illusions.
</P>
<P>
   Customers come in to buy the stuff dreams are made of, lottery
tickets they hope will rid them of debts and stale jobs or help buy
that elusive condo or car. There must be lots of such pipe dreams
in the Patels' corner of this suburban city. The Patels sell more
than $1 million in lottery tickets a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Patels, Indian immigrants whose long days leave them looking
as shopworn as their older goods, punch away at two screeching
machines while players standing in a line, most of them low-wage
office workers and the neighborhood's have-nots and elderly, call
off their charmed numbers from weathered slips of paper. Except for
a visit when the Lotto jackpot hits a phenomenal level, prospering
professionals rarely drop in. They seem to know that it's a
sucker's bet, that even at casinos and race tracks the odds are
better.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, in leafy counties like Westchester, it required some
intrigue to find a numbers front. But now, Westchester has 835
lawful locations selling tickets for Lotto and the addictive daily
and instant games. Every hamlet has one, and, by one local
newspaper's analysis, 15 of the 25 most lucrative outposts are in
poorer neighborhoods. With this reach, the state has turned people
who seldom gambled into devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the long odds on winning, many players have
concluded that much of life is a gamble, that hard work rarely gets
you beyond a pinched sustenance, that fortune plays painful tricks.
Taking a chance with hard-won earnings or even a welfare check is
simply obeying the fickle rules of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like you walking out here, and then you're on the
sidewalk in a safe place and a car come up and hit you and kill
you,'' Errol W., a night security guard, said in a lilting Jamaican
accent. ``Everything is gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   He never bet until he came to New York 18 years ago. But now he
bets more than $30 a week. ``You don't make enough money to work
and save anything,'' he said, ``so you got to try something.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxine Young comes to the Patels' store and puts down $2 on
number 1886, hoping success will finance a condo down payment and
reveling in the thrill of a risk. Her terminally ill mother dreamed
up the number she plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mommy.' She said, `1886.' I said, `What's that?' She
said, `A number, a number!' I said, `Where did you get that number
from?' She got a little annoyed and said, `I got it out of the
air.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the store seems surprised that the wealthy are less
likely to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealthy people have what we want, what we're striving for
every day,'' said Shawn Lawrence, a single mother of a 14-year-old
boy, who bets about 10 percent of her income as a Federal Express
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Haughton, a construction worker who spends 20 percent of his
$580 paycheck on lotteries, concluded long ago that prudent
investments can turn as sour as a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invested my money in an old Mercedes-Benz,'' he said.
``Somebody hit it and the estimator comes and offers me $540. That
damage should have been $2,600. So it's like playing Lotto. With
Lotto you may be more lucky, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Patel bets $10 a week. He can afford it. He keeps 6 percent
of his store's lottery take, about $65,000 a year _ most of his
income. ``If I didn't have the lottery, right away I'd close up the
store and go home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some players describe the lottery as a bad habit, but they
justify playing by telling themselves that the state's $1.5 billion
profit goes to education. This, too, is something of a delusion.
Lottery officials acknowledge that lawmakers can take tax revenue
that might have once gone to education and spend it on other
things.
</P>
<P>
   The great work about pipe dreams is Eugene O'Neill's ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' where misbegotten drunks talk endlessly of how
their ships will come in _ tomorrow. There ``the booze'' is
supplied by a saloonkeeper named Harry Hope. Here it seems to be
furnished by New York state.

EDITORIAL: BROOKLYN'S UNDERUSED WATERFRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers' understandable thirst for greenswards along the
city's 578-mile waterfront has coaxed a series of administrations
in City Hall and Albany to begin building the 65-acre Hudson River
esplanade and to mull the open-space potential of the 173-acre
Governors Island. Yet even as the city embarks on its most
ambitious round of park development since Olmsted and Vaux built
Central Park, a breathtaking opportunity on Brooklyn's East River
waterfront has languished. More than 60 acres of piers, just south
of the Brooklyn Bridge, could be transformed into a harborfront
park whose vistas alone would make it a required destination for
residents and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's 2.3 million inhabitants, like Manhattanites, are
starving for open space. With only 1.87 acres of greensward for
every 1,000 residents, Brooklynites have much less space for active
and passive recreation than New Yorkers in the Bronx (5.65 acres
per 1,000), Queens (3.64 acres) and Staten Island (16.77 acres).
Equally important, the four huge piers _ much like Battery Park and
Governors Island _ offer a panoramic view of the harbor and a
window on the city's Revolutionary and Civil War history.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, officials in City Hall and Albany have conducted
many studies and drawn up contracts for shifting ownership of the
site from the Port Authority to private builders. Nothing much
happened. Now, however, there seems to be a shared vision among
Brooklyn's neighborhoods and politicians. A new local development
entity under the aegis of Borough President Howard Golden is set to
draft a plan using $1 million in state money appropriated by
Brooklyn's state legislators. That plan should enable the Port
Authority to solicit developers' proposals for commercial uses that
would be compatible with a park but able to cover its annual
maintenance costs. A similar financing scheme is contemplated for
the Hudson River Park.
</P>
<P>
   With Brooklyn's neighborhoods and political stars in alignment,
Gov. George Pataki, the Port Authority and the city, which owns a
small slice of the site, should quickly settle some nettlesome
issues. The multimillion-dollar cost of stabilizing the piers can
be borne by the Port Authority or spread among several agencies. So
that the selling price does not become a sticking point, the Port
Authority, which has many revenue streams, should be willing to
take less than the fair market value, estimated several years ago
at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Albany should place this project on its priority
list for open-space projects, making it eligible for money from the
environmental bond act fund and other sources. Finally, Albany
might think about setting up a public corporation or similar entity
to take title to the site, with oversight authority to insure that
the redevelopment creates a park with unobtrusive commercial uses
and as much open space as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In weather fair or foul, tourists stroll across that
19th-century wonder known as the Brooklyn Bridge. A waterfront park
would offer them another world-class destination in Brooklyn.

DESPITE FRIEND'S DEATH AT SEA, SAILOR RETURNS TO RACING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An accident at sea has placed a melancholy grip on Giovanni
Soldini, the Italian solo sailor whose close friend and racing
partner died three months ago. But anyone who knows Soldini, an
otherwise spirited competitor, expects him to return with gusto to
ocean racing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last few months have been the worst of my life,'' the
32-year-old Soldini said in a recent telephone interview from La
Rochelle, France. ``For sure I worry about what is to come. But
these things can happen. I knew it before I left the last time. But
it is the same in all life. These things happen in cars, in boats,
or perhaps when your heart just stops one day.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Soldini is ready to set sail in the Atlantic Alone, a
3,200-mile feeder race from Falmouth, England, to Charleston, S.C.
The voyage counts as a yacht delivery and sailboat qualifier all in
one. Five solo sailors are competing in the trans-Atlantic
competition, which precedes the Around Alone, a much longer
27,000-mile competition beginning Sept. 26 from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Atlantic fleet reaches landfall in the United States _
after possibly a three-week trip _ the solo skippers will have the
remainder of the summer to prepare for their autumn start around
the world. Far more demanding than their relative hop across the
Atlantic, the Around Alone race will encompass three stopovers
before the full fleet of about 25 boats returns to Charleston next
May.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as the BOC Challenge, the single-handed race is
retaining much of the old BOC format. The rules restrict racers to
monohull sailboats in two classes: 40 to 50 feet, and 50 to 60
feet. For Soldini, who was runner-up in Class II in the 1994-95 BOC
competition with a 50-footer, racing in a 60-footer this time is
the only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his new boat, the 60-foot Fila, with saving his life
last April. During a trans-Atlantic crossing, he and four teammates
were well on their way to breaking the 11-day, 13-hour record from
New York to England. But a vicious storm slammed their sailboat
less than 400 miles from the finish. Eighty-mile-an-hour winds and
50-foot seas turned their high-tech yacht into an embattled
lifeboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to capsize,'' Soldini said. ``We had built the
boat with a sealed door to go in and out. We had another door put
in the stern to escape if we turned upside down. And the
electronics were made so that if the boat filled with water, you
could still phone. But two of our team were in the cockpit when we
turned over 180 degrees. The boat was on their head in the water,
so they needed to take off their safety harnesses to swim back to
the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldini's friend, Andrea Romanelli, never made it. The boat
limped to port, damaged but repairable. Now Soldini tries to think
about what went right or wrong that day. When Fila went upside down
_ albeit in extreme conditions not often seen in the Atlantic _ the
boat's canted keel enabled Soldini to release a lever from inside
the boat that allowed the keel to swing free. Its weighted bulb
swung around and pulled Soldini's 60-foot sailboat upright in the
water again after being capsized for six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fila's recovery still sends chills down the spine
of other single-handers, most notably Jean-Pierre Mouligne, the
French sailor from Newport, R.I., who is the favorite to win Class
II of the Around Alone race. But instead of a canting keel in his
50-foot design, Cray Valley, Mouligne is experimenting with water
ballast. He and Groupe Finot, the boat's French design team, are
trying to figure out a simple way to open a gate valve if the boat
capsizes so that water would rush in one side and flip it upright
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep my boat simple,'' the 42-year-old Mouligne
said. ``And water ballast seemed simpler. It is the difference
between bringing the boat back upright or not. It has to be a
foolproof system, because if you have an accident, you are probably
going to be freaked out at having turned over. If I am really
tired, or I can't see straight, I want to know that I can easily
operate a pump that will work.''

TRIAL OF 2 CHARGED IN BOMB PLOT SET TO START 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One picture of Lafi Khalil and Ghazi Ibrahim Abu
Maizar is of two young Palestinian men who were drifters in
Brooklyn, living hand-to-mouth on short-term jobs and ogling women
on the street, but hardly terrorists ready to kill for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Another picture is of two men who were hours or days away from
exploding a powerful pipe bomb in New York City's subway, intending
to inflict mass death and mayhem, because of hatred of Israel and
opposition to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, arguments and
testimony are scheduled to begin in the trial of the two men, a
case that began when Khalil and Abu Maizar were arrested in a
dramatic predawn raid on a squalid apartment in Brooklyn 11 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The raid, in which police have said they found a pipe bomb
``fully rigged and ready to be detonated,'' came hours after
another man from the Middle East, who had been living with the
defendants, flagged down police officers in the street and told
them about the plot, federal and city law-enforcement authorities
said. Khalil, 23, and Abu Maizar, 24, were shot and wounded in the
raid, police said, because officers opened fire when they feared
that one of the men was trying to set off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Also found in the July 31 raid, police said, was a rambling note
that threatened a series of attacks against American and Jewish
interests and demanded the release of jailed Islamic militants,
including Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who is serving a life sentence for
masterminding the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the pipe bomb and the threatening message
had been found raised the specter of another terrorist effort to
wreak bloody havoc on New Yorkers, this time in the packed confines
of a subway car or station.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, as a jury was chosen for the trial, investigators
said they had found no evidence linking Abu Maizar and Khalil to
any known terrorist group. And shortly after their arrests, Israeli
officials had said that neither of the men, both natives of that
country's West Bank, was known to have ties to militant groups,
although Abu Maizar was arrested in 1990 during a Palestinian
uprising for throwing stones at Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators said the men apparently had met after
they came to the United States separately several months before
their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have pleaded not guilty. Their lawyers, Bruce McIntyre
for Khalil and Jan Rostal and Michael Padden for Abu Maizar,
declined to say last week how they planned to defend against the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   A court document, however, says that while Abu Maizar was at
Kings County Hospital Center recuperating from the wounds he
suffered in the police raid, he told a nurse that although he had
been involved in ``various criminal activities, including credit
card scams, drugs and stolen cars,'' he was ``not going to blow up
the train but was just going to blackmail $10 million from the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The document did not indicate how Abu Maizar had planned to
carry out the blackmail, but in the days after the men were
arrested, investigators said that a copy of the note found during
the raid had been mailed two days earlier to a federal program that
offers rewards for information on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the FBI say that Khalil told agents and police
detectives that he had not known there was a bomb in the apartment
_ in which, he insisted, he had not lived with Abu Maizar and other
recent arrivals from the Middle East but had been staying for the
first time the morning of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement authorities have said evidence indicated
that Khalil had been living in the apartment at the time of the
raid. He has been charged as being a full participant with Abu
Maizar in what their indictment calls a conspiracy ``to use a
weapon of mass destruction,'' a charge punishable by up to life in
prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prosecutors, Bernadette Miragliotta and John Curran,
assistant U.S. attorneys in Brooklyn, declined last week to discuss
the government's evidence. But an FBI affidavit submitted shortly
after the raid said that Abu Maizar, when questioned by a federal
agent and a city police detective, ``indicated that he was involved
in making the bombs and provided information on how they could be
detonated or disarmed,'' and that he also ``indicated that the
bombs were targeted for detonation on the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   After jury selection was completed last week, the prosecutors
told Judge Reena Raggi that their early witnesses in the trial,
which is expected to last up to a month, would include police bomb
experts and the man who told police about the plot, Abdel Rahman
Mosabbah, who was a recent immigrant from Egypt also living in the
Park Slope apartment. Based on his information, police originally
said that the defendants were planning to blow up the busy Atlantic
Avenue subway station in downtown Brooklyn, but more recently
investigators have suggested that other locations were possible
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Another prosecution document says that other witnesses are
expected to testify that ``the political views expressed by the
defendants'' in the weeks before they were arrested included
``opposition to the peace process'' between the Palestinians and
Israel, ``a belief in an independent Palestinian state and a hatred
of Israelis and other Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people who knew the defendants in Park Slope have
described two young men who, rather than being ardently involved
with such issues, seemed to spend much of their time hanging out in
and around local stores, complaining about how poor they were,
looking at the women passing by on the street and picking up odd
jobs or short-term work in groceries.

EDITORIAL: THE BATTLE TO WIRE AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of competition may finally be on the horizon for
most Americans in the area of communications that has been most
resistant to it: local telephone service. That should mean better
service and lower prices for consumers, but it is far from clear
which of the companies vying for a piece of the business will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' effort to open up the local telephone business, in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, relied in part on allowing
competitors to buy local service on a wholesale basis from the
existing local company and then resell it to consumers. But that
approach has floundered because of squabbles over what the would-be
competitors should pay the existing local company.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to bring competition _ and the possibility of real
improvements in service _ is through the other wire that passes
most American homes, the cable-television hookup. The likelihood
that this will happen on a large scale was increased last month
when AT&AMP;T agreed to take over Tele-Communications, a cable company
that serves nearly a third of America.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T hopes to provide a lot more than local telephone service.
It envisions combining cable service and Internet access with local
and long-distance telephone service, and becoming the dominant
supplier of communications technology to American homes.
</P>
<P>
   That is an attractive franchise, but an expensive one. Beyond
the billions in stock that AT&AMP;T is paying for TCI, it will have to
invest billions more to improve the system. C. Michael Armstrong,
AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief executive, estimates it will cost up to
$500 a line to wire a home with the technology that he expects to
be available in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's investment is a gamble. It will reduce profits in the
short run with no guarantee of long-term success in a fight that is
likely to feature numerous players and competing technological
solutions. That is one reason AT&AMP;T's stock price has fallen 16
percent since the deal was announced. Many companies now suspect
that controlling the gateway to the Internet, as AT&AMP;T hopes to do,
will be essential to making money as more and more types of service
are provided, from interactive television to long-distance calling.
That is why Disney and General Electric, the parents of the ABC and
NBC networks, have made Internet investments. Some companies will
end up backing a technology that does not prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet scramble among big companies reflects a fear that
many industries might go the way of the railroads, which did not
adapt to new technologies _ cars, trucks and planes _ and so lost
their position as the dominant transportation companies in America.
</P>
<P>
   As in any fight for customers, consumers are likely to benefit
from this battle. But there will be exceptions. Existing phone
companies have been forced by regulators to offer basic service to
low-income consumers at discounted prices, with those costs
effectively subsidized by other customers. As new entrants go after
the better _ i.e., richer _ customers, new ways must be found to
assure that all have access to basic services, with subsidies no
longer hidden but applied fairly.

EDITORIAL: WHEN CHILDREN ARE SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   Last month guerrilla soldiers kidnapped 19 grade-school children
from the northern Uganda city of Gulu to join the Lord's Resistance
Army. Most have since escaped. But the army, which is waging a
campaign against Uganda with the backing of Sudan, has already
abducted more than 8,000 children to use as soldiers, most under
16. Children who have escaped say they were forced to torture and
kill one another. Once psychologically broken, they are used as sex
slaves for other soldiers or become vicious fighters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These children are part of what researchers now estimate to be
300,000 child soldiers in militaries and guerrilla armies around
the world. Most are close to 18, but tens of thousands of them are
not yet teen-agers. The United Nations and a new coalition of
private groups are trying to focus attention on the issue of child
soldiers and reduce their numbers. Success will depend on shaming
the governments and expatriate communities that raise money and buy
weapons for guerrilla movements.
</P>
<P>
   Young people have been used as soldiers throughout history, but
recent years have seen a large increase, due to the changing nature
of war. Since the end of the Cold War, conflicts between countries
fought by armies have been rare. Wars today are nationalist, ethnic
and religious, fought by warlords who have little interest in the
Geneva Conventions and may view even infants as enemies. According
to a 1996 Unicef study, civilians represented 5 percent of war
casualties at the beginning of the century, but 90 percent in wars
today. Children are more easily taken as soldiers in these wars,
fought in populated areas where the dislocations of combat erode
traditional taboos. Child soldiers are most common today in
Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of automatic weapons has also helped make children
into desirable soldiers. In the past, weapons were too heavy or
complex for children to handle. But a 10-year-old can use an AK-47
almost as effectively as an adult. Children, moreover, do not
demand payment and are more easily indoctrinated and controlled
than adults.
</P>
<P>
   Although the blight is worst in the most lawless and chaotic
conflicts, it is possible to save some children. Breaking the
world's silence can help stigmatize groups that use children in
war, some of whom crave international legitimacy. Last week the
U.N. Security Council had its first debate on the issue. Olara
Otunnu, the U.N. special representative on children and armed
conflict, has received a pledge from Sri Lanka's major Tamil
guerrilla group, one of the most egregious offenders, to stop using
children and to set up ways to monitor its compliance with that
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing such pledges depends on the force of public opinion.
The world needs a clear international statement that child soldiers
are unacceptable. A proposed protocol to the 1989 U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child would raise the minimum acceptable age
to 18, from 15. Consensus on this issue is important because in
areas of poor record-keeping, armies often lie about children's
ages. A 12-year-old can be passed off as 15, but 18 is more
difficult. The United States is working against raising the age,
for the shortsighted reason that 17-year-olds can legally join the
American armed forces. They represent a tiny percentage of the
military, however.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates in Rome negotiating rules for an international
criminal court should classify the recruitment of children under 15
as a war crime. Nations should increase their efforts to curb the
illicit trade in firearms. Finally, more money must go to programs
that provide psychological and physical treatment for former child
soldiers. The new spotlight on the horrors of turning children into
warriors is a good start.

IN PADS OR ON PAR, FOLEY A FAN FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few thousand people got a recent preview of what life on the
Jets could be like under Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't happen in an exhibition game or on the practice
field. Instead, the scenario played out over the rolling Upper
Montclair Country Club layout last week in Clifton, N.J., where
Foley attacked the greens playing in the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic.
</P>
<P>
   After double-bogeying No. 12, Foley was livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attacked the course like I play quarterback,'' he said,
``and on the next hole I got a birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did mirrored his go-for-it style, which has endeared him
to fans on the football field. On the dogleg-left 355-yard hole at
Montclair, he cut the corner _ he drove the ball so that he would
have a direct shot at the green. He took the chance and it worked,
rather than play safe.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, tightly coiled, was still winding down half an hour after
the tournament. He walked the floor of the clubhouse, alternately
sitting and standing. His face was burnt from the sun, nearly
disguising his freckles. He would stop for a moment, talk about his
play and then get up and walk some more.
</P>
<P>
   Just days earlier, Coach Bill Parcells had virtually announced
that Foley was the Jets' new No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said Foley has ``the benefit of the doubt.'' In other
words, it is his job over the newly hired Vinny Testaverde until
proven otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was mobbed at the golf tournament. After every hole,
people crowded around him as he walked to the next tee. He stopped
for dozens of autographs. He enjoyed giving them, and he bantered
with the crowd. This was not Neil O'Donnell's forte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you've got the wrong green 4,'' Foley said to one
youngster, who was wearing a Green Bay Packers jersey with Brett
Favre's name and number on it.
</P>
<P>
   When he sliced a shot to the right that landed in a patch of
grass a dozen yards off the fairway, someone shouted, ``Heck of a
touchdown pass, Glenn!'' The crowd was joking with him all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn, you're going to lead us out, aren't you?'' pleaded a
fan, perhaps conscious that this is the 30th anniversary of the
Jets' Super Bowl moment.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is a 3-handicap golfer and he did well in this event. His
79 had him only three strokes behind the winner, the Tampa Bay
quarterback Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer said: ``John Elway and I are the two best golfers among
the quarterbacks. Glenn? He's coming along. He'll be good in
another year or two.''
 &UR; Following Rice's Lead  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Keyshawn Johnson was a senior at the University of Southern
California, he made a list of what the great receivers had done in
their first years in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders was the 49ers' Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's a good idea,'' said Rice, when told of Johnson's
ledger. ``Every young player should have a standard he aspires
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he first met Johnson at USC. ``I remember him being a
talky kid, very confident,'' Rice said. ``That's good. Everyone
should have confidence. But I think he's calmed down a little
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first two seasons have been close to Rice's, in one
respect: number of receptions. Johnson has a total of 133; Rice had
135. Rice produced 18 touchdowns to Johnson's 15, and a gaudy 2,497
yards to Johnson's 1,479.
 &UR; `Hey, Yearbooks Here!'  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When fans buy yearbooks at Jets games, they will find their
newest heroes looking like those larger-than-life football players
of the 1950s and 60s. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Super
Bowl III, the publicity staff posed the players in those hokey
stances _ a runner using a straight arm, and a defensive lineman
poised to pounce at the camera.

WATSON'S FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER RUNAWAY YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Watson does not sound like the exiled baseball figure that
he is in this most unforgettable of Yankee seasons. There was verve
in Watson's voice as he admitted that he has not even watched one
Yankee game since bolting as general manager five months ago.
Watson laughed while revealing that the only game he has attended
recently _ and he stayed only more than one inning _ was a Little
League contest he wandered upon in Denver. It was boisterous
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Watson did not laugh too often when he was the general manager,
and he would not be laughing today if still employed by George
Steinbrenner. The executive who helped create baseball's premier
1998 team does not scan the box scores or search the sports shows
for updates. That is why he can laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've totally unplugged,'' Watson said. ``It was a conscious
decision. I had to do it for my health and for the well being of my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that Watson left Steinbrenner because he
wanted to control his high blood pressure and wanted to
re-introduce himself to his wife, Carol. It makes no sense that
Watson had to leave his dream job because of an unbearable
environment. Now he is excluded from this dream season.
</P>
<P>
   Watson knew the Yankees would be awesome. He knew there was an
opportunity to win a second World Series ring in three seasons. He
knew all of this, but the 100-hour weeks and the badgering from
Steinbrenner finally made him charge for the door, leaving behind a
possible championship club for Brian Cashman, his capable
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is designed that way,'' the 52-year-old Watson said
last week during a telephone interview. ``You do your thing for the
organization and then you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Watson moved on. Just like that, one of the
architects drifted away from one of the snazziest structures,
baseball-wise, ever built.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Watson received more than $400,000 as a settlement, so he
is essentially making twice as much as Cashman this season, but
money does not buy the feeling of experiencing the extraordinary.
This special season should have included Watson. Instead, it is
lost to him forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very tough job,'' Watson said. ``Do I miss it?
No. I'm probably more relieved than anything else. The thing that I
miss is the camaraderie with the staff and the baseball things. I
don't miss the grind and putting out brush fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Study these Yankees and understand how Watson's fingerprints are
all over the roster, or as much as any general manager can be under
Steinbrenner. Watson was involved in some fashion in helping the
Yankees obtain Chuck Knoblauch from Minnesota, Scott Brosius from
Oakland, Tino Martinez and Jeff Nelson from Seattle, Chad Curtis
from Cleveland, Graeme Lloyd from Milwaukee and Joe Girardi from
Colorado. He also made sure that the team would not deal prospects
recklessly. Remember that Watson also lobbied for Manager Joe Torre
as Buck Showalter's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sprinkled all over this club, from the players to the
general manager to the coaches to the manager,'' Cashman said.
``His influence is all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre quickly reminisced about the World Series when he was
asked if he missed Watson: ``We felt like we accomplished something
together in 1996, against all odds. We held on to each other during
that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Torre was fortunate enough to hold on to Watson's
coattails while the g.m. deflected or accepted Steinbrenner's
verbal bombs. Torre often said the Yankee g.m. had the most
difficult job in baseball. One team official speculated that
Watson's absence has made life more complicated for Torre, even
with the record-setting first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to tell me, but I can sense that it's been
tougher for Joe,'' Watson said. ``He's not enjoying it as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre disagreed about no longer having a buffer. ``Brian's still
there,'' Torre said. ``He's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who has not spoken to Steinbrenner since he left, said
the owner told him to call this summer and discuss the possibility
of doing some television commentary work for the MSG Network. But
Watson, who will probably broadcast for ESPN during the
post-season, has not dialed the Tampa, Fla., number. It remains
alarming that he was never personally congratulated for the
championship the Yankees won in his first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the attitude Steinbrenner believes in,'' Watson said.
``I pay you, you work for me, you're supposed to do a good job. I
didn't get any congratulations for what I did. I'm not sure there's
anything wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is. Handshakes are free. Steinbrenner, who did
not return phone messages, could partly erase this omission. If the
Yankees win the title, as Watson feels they will, the owner should
present Watson with a '98 World Series ring. Although Watson is not
here, his influence is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left knowing if this team stayed healthy and we got a second
baseman, we had a chance to win,'' Watson said. ``I knew it when I
walked away. I don't deserve a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he does. Watson should not be the Yankee in exile forever.

ARAM GLORIG, 92, AUTHORITY ON EAR DISORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Texas)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aram Glorig, a leading expert on the effects of noise in the
workplace, whose work helped untold numbers of people with deafness
or hearing loss, died on June 22 at the South Coast Medical Center
in San Clemente, Calif. He was 92 and lived in San Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   Glorig's career as a forensic and industrial ear specialist
spanned nearly 60 years. He helped develop smaller and more
efficient hearing aids and set standards for noise levels on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped apply accreditation standards for the National
Association of Hearing and Speech Agencies and helped develop
international standards for calibrating hearing-testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Glorig founded the American Auditory Society, which
represents thousands of professionals working for better
understanding of the ear, hearing and balance, ear disorders and
ways to remedy them.
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring from full-time work a few months ago, Glorig was
affiliated with the House Ear Clinic in Los Angeles for 20 years as
a consultant in forensic otology, the legal aspect of medicine
dealing with the ear and its disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Aram Glorig, who was born in Manchester, England, graduated from
Atlantic Union College in Massachusetts in 1931. He received his
medical degree in 1938 at Loma Linda University in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In his residency in pediatrics, Glorig came into contact with
many children who had bad hearing, prompting him to specialize in
otolaryngology, which deals with disorders of the ear, nose and
throat. After completing his second residency in 1941, he joined
the Army and, while stationed in England, observed cases of severe
hearing impairment from bomb and shell blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Glorig, as an assistant professor at the Yale University
medical school, was asked by the surgeon general to set up a
hearing-disorders center at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Glorig later
became director of the Audiology and Speech Correction Center for
the Veterans Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s he also directed the federal research on
job-related noise that formed the basis for noise standards set by
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He left the
Veterans Administration in 1953 to become an associate professor of
otolaryngology at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he became a clinical professor of otolaryngology at the
University of Texas Medical School and founding director of the
Callier Center in Dallas, serving in both jobs until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Glorig is survived by his wife, Bobbi Barras-Glorig; two
daughters, Patricia Schiff of Dallas, and Deborah DeVeccia of
Argyle, Texas; and four grandchildren.

<P>
   Dr. Vernon F. Snow, a foundation executive and retired professor
of English history and Western civilization at Syracuse University,
died June 24 at his home in Jamesville, N.Y. He was 73 and also had
a home in Marco Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, Syracuse University officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Snow retired in 1994 after 20 years as president of the John Ben
Snow Foundation of Syracuse. At his death he remained a trustee of
the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust, founded in 1975 to support higher
education, the humanities, cultural education and minority
students.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Foundation, established in 1948, also has provided
millions of dollars for college scholarships and for cultural and
community activities across the country. It was founded by Snow's
cousin, who made his fortune operating hundreds of F.W. Woolworth
stores in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Snow was a native of Milwaukee and a 1948 graduate of
Wheaton College. He also earned master's and doctorate degrees in
history at the University of Chicago in 1949 and the University of
Wisconsin in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Before he joined the Syracuse faculty in 1974, he taught at the
Universities of Oregon, Wisconsin, Montana and Nebraska. His work
in philanthropy led him to start a course on the subject at
Syracuse in 1988. He retired from teaching in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author or editor of several books and many articles
on English history. He was a fellow of the Royal Historical
Society, a consultant to the World Book Encyclopedia and past
curator of the Yale Center for Parliamentary History.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Jonathan L., of
Grand Blanc, Mich.; a brother, Howard, of Spooner, Wis., and two
grandchildren.  &QL;

LIVING WITH VULTURES ON THE ROOF IN SUBURBAN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDINER, N.Y. _ Dan and Carol Ann O'Byrne sit in their
breakfast nook each morning, look out at their horse paddock and
the woods beyond and face mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of vultures line up on their backyard fence, darken their
barn doorway, gather like doom in the trees. Just waiting.
</P>
<P>
   When the family dachshund goes out to stretch in the sun, a
half-dozen birds swoop down and circle him, their backs hunched and
featherless necks and heads stretched forward quizzically, as if to
say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Though commonly associated with the South and Southwest, turkey
vultures and their smaller but more aggressive relatives, black
vultures, are expanding their range to the north and east, and into
New York state, wildlife experts say. Perhaps a hundred black and
turkey vultures have chosen to settle on the O'Byrnes' two-acre
property here in this farm town on the outskirts of New Paltz,
about 65 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The birds have not harmed the O'Byrnes' three horses, four dogs,
several cats or their goat, but their constant presence means the
family cannot keep furniture on the lawn or screens in the windows.
The birds tear the screens apart, shred the vinyl caulking from
window and door frames, peck at the house siding and pull at the
roof shingles with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes complain that they cannot have lunch on their back
deck or sunbathe in their yard, and they spend a good deal of time
scraping bird droppings and sweeping regurgitated scraps off their
porch. If they feel like grilling a steak, they set up a barbecue
in their garage.
</P>
<P>
   And there's not much the O'Byrnes can do about it. Vultures,
like most indigenous species of migratory birds, are federally
protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, an international treaty
adopted in 1918, said Richard Chipman, the state director of the
U.S. Agriculture Department. In order to trap, kill, relocate or
handle a vulture or its eggs, a permit is required from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. Such ``depredation permits,'' as they
are called, are not readily granted.
</P>
<P>
   Bird count surveys have shown that the national population of
vultures more than doubled in the thirty years from 1966 to 1996,
though no exact population statistics are available, Chipman said.
The increased numbers have forced the birds to expand their range
and to vary their eating patterns by occasionally attacking living
animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes are the first to report a vulture problem in New
York, said Diane Pence, a wildlife biologist for the wildlife
service, which issued 27 depredation permits in the mid-Atlantic
region last year. ``This is my house and I'm not giving it up to
them,'' said Mr. O'Byrne, 47, a recreation counselor for troubled
children. ``We absolutely love our home.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the O'Byrnes have tried shiny mylar tape and balloons
that a visiting biologist said would scare the birds away. They
ripped the tape and popped the balloons. The O'Byrnes tried playing
a recording of the sound of shotguns blasting every 15 seconds. It
scared the birds for a few minutes, but they grew accustomed to the
sound even before their neighbors called the police 15 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes put a bucket of mothballs out, thinking the
vultures would be repelled by the smell, but the birds just pecked
at them. The most effective technique so far, said O'Byrne, an avid
golfer, has been to whack golf balls at them. The birds fly off
but, of course, they return.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes are now waiting for an application to request a
depredation permit that would allow them to shoot a few birds while
setting off a host of pyrotechnics, on the assumption that the
birds will associate the sound with the death and fly off for good.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes' trouble began about three years ago, when the
one-story schoolhouse they had lived in since 1980 burned down.
Then they built a two-story colonial. At the same time, they
decided to clear some of the dead maple trees in their backyard and
create a paddock and barn to board their horses.
</P>
<P>
   Once the old trees were gone, their new house, at 38 feet tall,
became the tallest and most alluring roost around, O'Byrne said.
Soon the two-foot-tall black vultures, which have a wingspan of
about four feet, were spending hours just standing on the pitched
roof of the new gray house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were there, but they were never a problem,''
O'Byrne said. He said biologists from the State University of New
York at New Paltz came to study the birds and decided that they
probably nested in the sheer cliffs of the Shawangunk Mountains
which lie just behind the O'Byrnes' yard.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes acknowledge their own part in creating their
problem, but are more interested in finding a solution than
affixing blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbor says, `Oh, you created the problem yourself,'''
Mr. O'Byrne said. ``But, you know what, that's easy to say. I have
to live with it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The O'Byrnes say they may never be able to sell their house.
They applied for a reduction in tax assessment and got their town
taxes cut by 20 percent. ``We're going for 100 percent,'' said Mrs.
O'Byrne, a fifth-grade teacher. ``Who would buy this house?''
</P>
<P>
   To convince the tax authorities of the severity of their
problem, the O'Byrnes made a videotape of their year-round
troubles. The tape shows about 100 vultures gathered in the horse
paddock on Halloween. A segment of the tape dated Dec. 25, 1997,
shows a few vultures on a snow-covered roof next to Christmas
decorations. Though many of the birds leave for warmer climates in
the fall, Mr. O'Byrne said some of the black vultures stayed
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an animal lover,'' Mrs. O'Byrne said. ``I don't want to
hurt them. But it was the scariest thing, one day I was coming home
and they were all flying above my house. It was like the movie `The
Birds.' I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. Then I
remembered I had an automatic garage opener and I could get in the
house through the garage. Otherwise, I don't know what I would have
done.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillel Bodek hurtled through the interstices of 100
Centre St., the voluminous state Supreme Court building in
Manhattan where criminal cases are heard, muttering to himself his
signature refrains, ``It is what it is'' and ``What can I tell
you.'' Even at his fleet pace, he never gets far before someone
flags him down.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hynes, a lawyer with a client facing drug charges,
buttonholed him. ``Hillel, I want my client to wear a sweater in
court instead of a leather jacket,'' he said. ``How do I do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Bodek gave his standard response: ``I'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting things accomplished in the criminal justice system _
really getting them accomplished _ requires a certain
felicitousness. It requires a certain sagacity. It requires an
acute knowledge of how creaking bureaucracies work. To some extent,
it requires an obnoxiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Often when things, both big and little, need to get done, judges
and lawyers in New York turn to one particular individual. He is a
loquacious, unkempt, quirky man of 45 who proudly wears a pocket
protector for his pens. He wears a windbreaker and keeps a black
nylon backpack strapped to his back. He looks like someone you
might meet at the bowling alley, or who would show up to repair the
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hillel Bodek.
</P>
<P>
   New York is full of people who operate in the shadows to make
those in the limelight look better. These are people who get things
done. In the maddening world of criminal justice, Hillel Bodek gets
things done. He makes the slow wheels of justice turn just a little
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Bodek is a freelance clinical social worker, who
spends most of his time evaluating the mental state of and
recommending the appropriate care for indigent mentally and
physically impaired defendants. But he is also something of a
judicial handyman who is appointed by judges to do almost anything
that needs doing to hasten the process of justice and see that the
system works as it is intended to.
</P>
<P>
   He will accelerate the transfer of documents and help assure the
protection of witnesses. He will check that a defendant gets
dutiful care in jail. Recently, a man named Tirso Salcedo, on trial
on drug charges, complained that he couldn't hear the proceedings,
and asked that the trial be stopped. Bodek helped get him treated
for an ear infection and fitted with a hearing aid. The jury was
deadlocked, and Salcedo was retried. At the second trial, he said
he couldn't hear, he needed a new battery, the jail wouldn't give
him one, stop the trial. The judge handed him a fresh battery from
the two-month supply that Bodek had provided her. Salcedo was
convicted of conspiracy to sell drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges say, get Bodek, because Bodek knows how to get things
done,'' Bodek said, intending not so much to be immodest as to be
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In carrying out his functions, Bodek routinely works 60 to 70
hours a week. He produces evaluation reports commonly 10 times as
long as those of fellow experts.
</P>
<P>
   His compensation easily qualifies him as one of the highest-paid
social workers in America. Last year, he earned $314,000 (about
$60,000 of which went to expenses), grudgingly paid by the city,
which has long lamented that he charges way too much. His earnings
well eclipse those of the judges and many of the lawyers he works
with, not to mention those of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, whose
office processes Bodek's fees, calls the situation ``absolutely
crazy,'' but must pay what the trial judges approve.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one quite like Bodek in the system, and he elicits
wide-ranging emotions. The dozen or so criminal court judges who
regularly use him find him indispensable. Some lawyers, though,
grumble that he is pro-defense. Far more rant that he is
pro-prosecution. Then again, many people familiar with him would
agree with Gerald Labush, a defense lawyer and former prosecutor,
who sums up his posture as ``Bodek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just takes a Bodek stance on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, in particular, often thrive on the
inefficiencies of the system, and look on an expediter like Bodek
as a threat. In some instances, he is hired by a prosecutor or
defense lawyer to deliver an expert opinion. They take their
chances, because, as defense lawyer Larry Goldman put it, ``He's
disgustingly honest.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bodek will say the exact opposite of what the lawyer
paying him hoped he would say, and then the lawyer will petition
the court to have Bodek's conclusions tossed out. Such a turn of
events is known to lawyers as getting Bodeked.
</P>
<P>
   Bodek likes to start his days early, and allocates little time
for interruptions. At 6:30 a.m., he has an oat bran muffin coated
with peanut butter and a glass of chocolate milk. He generally
skips lunch; he knows the midday hours are when lawyers are in
their offices and he can pick up paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Bodek's principal habitats are 100 Centre St. and the companion
building at 111 Centre St., the 19th-floor psychiatric prison ward
at Bellevue Hospital and the Manhattan Detention Center. In these
places, he is well known. Most mornings, he is at the courthouse.
He gallops from courtroom to courtroom, frequently announcing,
``OK, next mess.''
</P>
<P>
   He bounded in to see Justice Budd Goodman, who remarked, ``Our
court system would not function half as well without Hillel.''
Goodman had asked Bodek to straighten out a foul-up in which a
marijuana misdemeanor was put on a defendant's arrest record rather
than the robbery charge he was indicted on. The police could not
unravel it. Bodek found out that, through a police clerical error,
the robbery charge was listed on the record of another man who had
been arrested on the same day for the marijuana offense. (Bodek
loves to tell of the bungle in which an arrested man identified
himself to the police officer as Donald Duck. The officer duly
processed him as Mr. Duck.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bodek's cases reflect the constellation of broken lives that
course through the courts _ a young man who killed his mother with
an ax, four Turkish men selling heroin here to support a small army
in eastern Turkey, a man who snatched a woman's purse because he
thought she was a CIA agent and had a gun in it.
</P>
<P>
   He was heavily involved in the case of John Royster, the man
recently convicted of a string of violent attacks on women, as well
as the trial of the Wild Cowboys drug gang.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Bodek was among those who examined Alfonse
Amodio, known as C.A.T., who threatened to kill President Ronald
Reagan, and he evaluated Mark Chapman, the murderer of John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   He gets things done because he knows the city's unfathomable
systems so well, _ the prison system, the court system, the health
and mental health systems _ but often, it seems, people do what he
wants simply to get rid of him. ``Follow-up prevents foul-up'' is
one of his maxims, and does he follow up. Dealing with him is like
being assaulted by a sandblaster. ``I don't take anything from
bureaucrats,'' Bodek said. ``I insist that things be done the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Any number of court workers describe him as one of the most
difficult men on earth. He combines tenacity with a glaring absence
of social niceties. ``He's very condescending and domineering,''
said Bruce Thurston, the mental health attorney in the criminal
defense division of the Legal Aid Society. ``He doesn't seem to
appreciate that spatial need that many of us have not to be talked
to too closely. He really gets in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers can identify with Thurston when he speaks of how
years ago his agitation with Mr. Bodek practically ruined his life.
He told a psychiatrist friend, who counseled him to relax, because
the man was not going to go away. Only then did he arrive at a more
peaceful coexistence with Bodek. Knowing that Thurston collects
small boats, Mr. Bodek always greets him now as Admiral Thurston.
</P>
<P>
   Bodek was born in Providence, R.I., on April 21, 1953. (``A
great day in American history,'' is how he characterizes it. ``A
very famous day.'') His father was a grade-school teacher, and his
mother was a homemaker. When Bodek was 7, the family moved to
Cedarhurst, on Long Island. Bodek was always interested in helping
people, which steered him to social work. He got his college degree
as expeditiously as he could, graduating from Queens College in
three years, and then acquired a master's degree from Adelphi.
</P>
<P>
   He briefly worked at a small agency that advocated for the
developmentally disabled. In 1980, he conceived a program that he
ran in the prison ward of Bellevue Hospital in which he evaluated
and helped find treatment for criminal offenders with disabilities.
His abrasive personality irritated some Bellevue doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bodek began complaining to city investigators about
inappropriate behavior and mismanagement in the prison ward,
alleging that some of his colleagues were shirking their duties. In
1983, he found himself out of a job when New York University
decided not to continue his program. Judges, however, continued to
hire him to do the same things on a freelance basis.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1984, a city report largely confirmed his allegations of
mismanagement at Bellevue, though it also cited complaints that
Bodek's behavior was disruptive and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   His prodigious compensation has always been a point of dispute
with the city. The suggested fee for a court-appointed social
worker is $45 an hour, and state law limits the maximum outlay in a
case to $300, although it gives judges latitude to approve higher
sums if there are ``extraordinary circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodek, who maintains that the mental health cases he specializes
in are by their nature extraordinary, bills at $125 an hour and
averages about $8,000 per case. In the Royster case _ in which he
conducted several evaluations, monitored Mr. Royster's mental state
and arranged for a witness to come here from Japan _ he was paid
$49,888.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does not fault Bodek's competence, Fishner, the
criminal justice coordinator, said that many things he does can be
done by paralegals and are hardly worth $125 an hour. ``There is
absolutely no doubt he is overcompensated,'' he said. ``No private
client would sign off on these numbers of hours for these tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the city asked the district attorney to investigate
Bodek's billing. It essentially concluded that he worked inhuman
hours _ days, nights, weekends _ and cleared him. In 1993, the city
refused to pay Bodek his entire fee, and spent years battling him
in the courts. In December 1995, the Court of Appeals ruled that he
had to be paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   Bodek lives in a two-bedroom co-op in Brooklyn Heights with his
wife, Seok-Hoon, who is a social science assistant with the
Security Council of the United Nations. He keeps an office on East
50th Street, where he sees clients in the evenings, many of them
referred by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all these years, he still longs for his old Bellevue
job, or some position that puts him in the system rather than
outside it, an official sanction. ``I'm sick and tired of who's the
next person who's going to take a potshot at me,'' he said. ``Who's
going to investigate me next? It takes its toll. I don't know what
I did to these people other than open up my big mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is seriously pondering giving up his work next year,
if he can find an acceptable health care position. At the same
time, he knows that his nettlesome manner and his whistleblower
history make him difficult to employ.
</P>
<P>
   He went to retrieve some documents from one of the assistant
district attorneys. Looking Bodek over, the prosecutor said: ``The
pocket protector is a big part of Hillel. He wears a heavy coat
when it's 85 degrees out. We tried to have a personal shopper take
him around and show him what to wear. No luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodek said, ``I am what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   An investigator gave him a fortune cookie. It said, ``Success is
the result of preparation, hard work and learning from mistakes.''

<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ An obvious head-butt by Argentina, a
red-card expulsion from the referee and a winning goal by the
Netherlands all took place within one climactic minute Saturday
afternoon, as Dennis Bergkamp struck late for a 2-1 victory that
put the Dutch into the semifinals of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, who have never won the Cup, but were finalists in
1974 and 1978 with their entertaining concept of ``total
football,'' will now play Brazil here on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's stunning chain of events began in the 88th minute,
with Argentina up a player because of an earlier red-card
expulsion. Ariel Ortega, who had been flopping and flailing all
afternoon, penetrated the Dutch penalty area, and hooked his foot
onto the leg of Jaap Stam, the Dutch defender, obviously hoping for
a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   As Ortega once again writhed on the ground, Edwin Van Der Sar,
the towering Dutch goalie, ran over and stood over Ortega's
quivering body. Ortega jumped up and the top of his head clearly
struck the underside of Van Der Sar's jaw. Needless to say, Van Der
Sar went sprawling. What soccer player would not, given a free and
open shot like that?
</P>
<P>
   The referee, Arturo Brizio Carter from Mexico, intervened,
brandishing a red card at Ortega, sending him out of the game and
equalizing the troops at nine field players apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch had already shown themselves as masters of using the
entire field with expert passing. Now the field was even bigger,
and the Dutch used every yard of it. Not waiting for the Argentines
to catch their wits, Frank DeBoer lofted a long pass to Bergkamp,
15 yards from the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The blond 29-year-old Bergkamp, who plays for Arsenal in
England, controlled the ball on the right side, faked right and
dribbled to his left, leaving Roberto Ayala leaning the wrong way.
Bergkamp flicked a shot with his right foot into the left corner,
past Carlos Roa.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch held on during five more minutes of extra time, and
then staged a raucous celebration on the field while the stunned
Argentine players trudged off. Most of the Dutch players greeted
the huge orange-clad swatch of fans at the far end, accepting
orange wigs, orange scarves, orange shirts, and wearing them on a
tour of the field, far longer than the four minutes mandated by the
stopwatch-wielding officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, often wracked by internal dissension and
inconsistencies, had their act together Saturday. In the 12th
minute, Ronald DeBoer, the brother of Frank, dribbled artfully
through three Argentine defenders and then dished the ball off to
his left. Bergkamp calmly headed the ball toward the goal mouth,
where it was put in by Patrick Kluivert, the rangy forward who has
failed to live up to his early promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very intelligent pass from Bergkamp,'' said Guus
Hiddink, the Dutch coach.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Lopez tied the game in the 17th minute, bursting past
Stam and receiving an artful long ball from Juan Veron and putting
the ball past Van Der Sar from in close.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina missed two close calls, once in the first half when
Ortega hit a goal post, and once at 63 minutes when Gabriel
Batistuta hit the left post. Batistuta, a high scorer in the
Italian league, was otherwise mostly invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands dominated the second half, moving the ball from
side to side and running crisp patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very tired after our long game the other night,'' said
Daniel Passarella, the Argentine coach, ``and our opponents had an
extra day for recuperation.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the rugged 120-minute match on Wednesday
night in St-Etienne, when Argentina beat England in a tie-breaking
shootout. That game was marked by an expulsion of David Beckman,
the British player, who lashed a kick at Diego Simeone, the
Argentine captain, who had landed heavily on Beckham.
</P>
<P>
   Simeone drew another expulsion Saturday when he and Arthur Numan
had a collision at midfield in the 72nd minute. Brizio Carter chose
Numan as the main culprit, showing a yellow card, which followed an
earlier caution (for a foul on the frequently-earthbound Ortega),
producing an automatic expulsion for Numan. This forced the Dutch
to play a man down for 15 minutes, until Ortega's head-butt, caught
clearly on television replays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it,'' said Passarella, who had been on the
sidelines, not far from the infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Hiddink said, ``We were in trouble after Numan was sent off, but
we were equalized in the number of players. All of a sudden, we got
a tremendous play from Bergkamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Hiddink believe the extra day made a difference? He said,
``We are physically very strong, but it is also good to have
players who are rested.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it is worth, Passarella said he thought the ultimate
winner of the World Cup would be produced from the Tuesday night
game here, ``because they will have an extra day of rest, and that
is very important at this stage.'' Any team that avoids
head-butting in the open will also have an advantage.

REVITALIZING THE RIVERFRONT IN WILMINGTON, DEL. 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Michael Purzycki's mandate is to focus on the
future of this city's long-neglected Christina River waterfront.
Yet the 52-year-old lawyer can't stop thinking about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 11,000 people building ships on the river at the
height of World War II, and for some reason we've let that history
evaporate,'' said Purzycki as he thumbed through 1943 employee
newsletters from Dravo Corp.'s Wilmington shipyard. ``There's not a
lot of people around here anymore who could tell that story.''
</P>
<P>
   That slighting of the past is about to change. As head of the
Riverfront Development Corp. _ a state-created organization charged
with revitalizing the city's waterfront _ Purzycki intends to
capitalize on the Christina's shipbuilding past.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the area's industrial history will provide the
kind of identity that will attract tourists to an exhibition hall,
a catalog-company outlet center, nightclubs, a riverfront promenade
and restaurants now under development just south of the central
business district.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the roughly 100 acres controlled by the
development agency consisted largely of a smokestack graveyard
filled with strange-looking vegetation and the ghosts of anonymous
blue-collar workers whose pay records have turned up during
building renovations.
</P>
<P>
   But Purzycki believes that for a place to succeed it has to have
a soul. ``We don't want people to have that same empty feeling they
have after a visit to a shopping mall,'' said Purzycki, whose
agency has in two years spent more than $10 million in state money
on the project.
</P>
<P>
   He is keeping the six 50-foot cranes used in the construction of
some 400 landing craft from 1941 to 1945. He also plans murals and
monuments to commemorate famous ships built on the site and is
considering using a film of the riverfront's war effort now in the
Hagley Museum and Library here.
</P>
<P>
   The cranes will loom over the 400,000-square-foot Ship Yard
Shops outlet center, whose only announced participants so far are
L.L. Bean and Coldwater Creek. The $36 million complex is a joint
venture of the development agency, Ruth and Bill Wizner of Tri-W
Corp. in Nashville and Verino Pettinaro, a local developer who owns
much of the undeveloped land along the river.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizners were among the pioneers in the factory outlet
concept, building centers in Hilton Head, S.C., and Nashville in
the '70s. Work is now under way on the first phase of the center
here _ about 20 shops in 100,000 square feet of space, which is
expected to be completed by next March.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the waterfront revival is the First USA
Riverfront Arts Center, a 120,000-square-foot hall designed to hold
so-called ``blockbuster exhibits'' _ shows with objects from the
era depicted, but with an emphasis on storytelling. These shows are
often snubbed by the traditional arts community.
</P>
<P>
   Just months ago, the arts center was a dilapidated hulk that
still held the gantry and rail tracks from its days as a
landing-craft assembly plant. Now, the cavernous space has been
carved into a hall designed to accommodate up to 1,000 people an
hour when exhibits are being staged.
</P>
<P>
   I T includes 25,000 square feet of galleries, a
6,000-square-foot gift shop and a 13,000-square-foot lobby. About
$1 million was spent on finishing the lobby with such touches as a
terrazzo floor featuring a compass rose design 40 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the cost of the $10 million conversion, First USA Bank,
a leading credit-card bank based here, pledged $2.5 million over 10
years. The development corporation chipped in another $2.5 million,
while the balance will be financed by Pettinaro Construction and
the development agency.
</P>
<P>
   To produce the shows, the development corporation signed a
five-year contract with Broughton International Inc. of St.
Petersburg, Fla., which describes itself as a full-service
exhibition company that conceptualizes the show, does the research,
secures the art objects, hires the employees, installs the exhibit
and runs the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton's first exhibit, called ``Nicholas and Alexandra: The
Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia,'' will open Aug. 1 with
roughly 700 objects from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the State
Archives of the Russian Federation and the State Palace Museum in
Tsarskoe Selo. The development agency expects it to draw at least
500,000 people from the region over its five-month run.
</P>
<P>
   Because blockbuster exhibits can cost $5 million to $8 million
to mount, the corporation has lent Broughton $2 million to cover
initial costs. Recently, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &AMP; Co., the state's
largest private employer, agreed to become the show's primary
sponsor with a $200,000 grant.
</P>
<P>
   The development agency's loan to Broughton is to be repaid
through ticket sales and gift-shop revenues. The deal was
structured that way because Broughton was embroiled in controversy
at its last job with the Florida International Museum in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The museum held three blockbuster shows _ including the one on
Russian tsarist treasures that brought in more than 600,000 people
_ but lost $11 million over three years. Some of the Florida
community's officials were upset that the museum was losing money,
while closely held Broughton appeared to be making money on the
gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   James Broughton, head of Broughton International and former
creator of Memphis Wonders exhibit series, maintains that the huge
losses resulted from the debt the museum incurred when it converted
a department store for its arts center, not from its handling of
the exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Purzycki said he had crafted a contract to avoid such problems,
but he conceded that the development corporation could still end up
losing money on the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to whine if we lose a couple hundred thousand
dollars,'' Purzycki said. ``I see it as an investment in making
this place flourish. We need a unique attraction to bring in people
from the region. We can't just rely on locals to make this work,''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only difficulty Purzycki has had to overcome in
carrying out his vision for the waterfront. Individual landowners
on the river have driven hard bargains as the development agency
has attempted to assemble land.
</P>
<P>
   `` We didn't steal anything,'' he said. ``There's not a seller
on the river that needs the money.'' What's more, some members of
the City Council and Mayor James Sills grew critical of what has
been perceived as the state's heavy hand in developing the
waterfront, which is within the city limits. Sills charged that
Gov. Thomas Carper was treating the riverfront as a personal
fiefdom by not including city officials and residents as partners.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sills vetoed a bill in February that would have
required waterfront business to hire a percentage of city
residents, saying that its passage would most likely result in a
lengthy legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the development agency found itself in an
embarrassing situation when Pettinaro Construction was accused of
violating federal environmental laws for illegally disposing of
ignitable and toxic material near a riverfront park scheduled to be
completed in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's been easy,'' said Purzycki. ``But we can't stop. We
have to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   That means pressing on with the development of a roughly
20,000-square-foot nightclub and the construction of a river walk
extending 1.5 miles from just above the historic Amtrak passenger
station to the retail complex. In next two years, construction will
begin on boardwalks through a wildlife refuge south of the outlet
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got at least five years' worth of work to do,''
Purzycki said.

 REITs PLACE THEIR BETS IN NEW YORK AREA  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As real estate investment trusts flourished around
the country in recent years, the New York City area was a
comparative exception. But activity by REITs in the area, each with
a distinctive investment strategy, has picked up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In a little over a year real estate investment trusts have gone
from being conspicuously absent from New York City to becoming a
major force in the commercial property market. The publicly traded,
tax-sheltered companies have bought property valued at $2.8 billion
in Manhattan in the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest splash has been made by Vornado Realty Trust,
based in Saddle Brook, N.J., but looming increasingly large in
Manhattan. The company has made a huge bet that the area around
Madison Square Garden will be the next Times Square in terms of
economic revival, and is preparing to develop it into the urban
equivalent of an entertainment-oriented shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, it has invested close to $2 billion in
New York City office buildings, including the investments made so
far this year, making it one of the city's larger landlords. It has
said it plans to invest as much as $1 billion more in the city in
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the REITs operating in the region is following its own
investment strategy, ranging from SL Green's exclusive focus on
older Manhattan office buildings to Mack-Cali and Reckson's
policies of completely avoiding the city in favor of suburban
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Vorndo chairman Steven Roth said the company had bought most of
the office, hotel and retail properties on both sides of Seventh
Avenue from 34th to 31st Streets ``because there is a lot you can
do when ownership is concentrated in one strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought the properties because we think we think we can
redevelop them and improve them,'' he said. He noted that the
Macy's Herald Square store was like one of the anchor stores of a
suburban mall, and that the front door to Madison Square Garden is
in 2 Penn Plaza, which the company owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets are teeming with people day and night,'' he said,
which for someone with deep roots in the retail business translates
into potential customers. ``The corner of Seventh Avenue and 34th
Street is the second busiest in the city, which probably means it
is the second busiest in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Vornado was the biggest player among the REITs buying
property in Manhattan and the region, it was not the only one. Two
home-grown real estate companies, SL Green Realty Corp. and Tower
Realty Trust, each formed a REIT (pronounced reet) and sold shares
to the public for the first time last year, and then went on
acquisition sprees.
</P>
<P>
   And two existing suburban trusts, Mack-Cali Realty Corp. of
Cranford, N.J., and Reckson Associates Realty of Melville, N.Y.,
continued their expansion in the region, while avoiding New York
City itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, several prominent companies have taken steps to
convert themselves from private ownership to the REIT form. Two New
York companies, Macklowe Properties and Loeb Realty, have done the
preliminary work necessary for initial public stock offerings, with
Loeb in an arrangement to acquire the properties and management
business of the George Comfort &AMP; Sons investment and management
company. Several other companies, including Steven Witkoff's
Witkoff Group and Larry Silverstein's Silverstein Properties, are
reportedly primed to follow and form REITs.
</P>
<P>
   Another REIT, Boston Properties, is also active in New York and
is buying the rights to develop two Times Square office sites.
</P>
<P>
   The REITs have by no means displaced the traditional
family-owned companies that continue to own and develop large
amounts of property. But as long as they have access to low-cost
public capital, the REITs are capable of fast growth through
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   That access to capital can vary with market patterns, and many
REITs have been trading below their 52-week highs recently.
Vornado, which has ranged from $32.50 to $49.813, closed Wednesday
at $39.438. Reckson's price has ranged from $22 to $29, closing
Wednesday at $24.25. Mack-Cali has fluctuated from $31.375 to $43,
closing Wednesday at $34.125. Tower's price has ranged from $20.75
to $28.50, closing Wednesday at $22.438. SL Green, which closed
Wednesday at $22.25, has moved between $21.063 and $28. Boston
Properties has ranged from $26.25 to $36.063 and closed Wednesday
at $34.313.
</P>
<P>
   Share price is important for REITs that want to expand; since
they must pay out 95 percent of their income in dividends to retain
their tax-exempt status, they have to return to the securities
markets for capital or take on unwanted debt. One attraction of
REITs as investments is that they are typically not as leveraged as
closely-held partnerships and thus are better able to ride out a
decline in property values.
</P>
<P>
   If they are faced with unresponsive investors, high-flying REITs
would have to slow their pace of growth, and some of the planned
initial public offerings might be delayed, or their shares sold at
prices below what their owners had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office REIT sector is down about 10 percent,
year-to-date,'' said Lee Schalop, an analyst with J.P. Morgan
Securities. ``That means that their ability to sell stock to get
money to build is curtailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many REIT executives say that the cycle is nowhere
near the peak and that now is a good time to buy property in New
York, particularly in Manhattan. Some say they will borrow money,
if necessary, to continue investing, although they do not want to
become as highly leveraged as some closely held developers.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives note that Manhattan has built-in
protection against an overload of new supply. ``If all the projects
that are being talked about actually get built, they would add 6
million square feet of office space over a period of about 10
years,'' said Lawrence Feldman, the chairman of Tower Realty Trust.
In the context of the 400 million square feet of existing space, he
said, that amounts to an addition of about 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the market is not likely to be overwhelmed by an
influx of new building _ in contrast to the late 1980s, when 40
million square feet of office space was developed and marketed,
much of it on a speculative basis.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman's point, that Manhattan is an island already almost
fully developed, was echoed by other real estate executives. They
say that New York cannot add to its real estate supply the way that
cities with a lot of nearby vacant land have done. If a REIT wants
to become part of the New York City property market, its path is
much more likely to be acquisition of existing buildings rather
than development.
</P>
<P>
   According to Feldman, whose REIT recently bought the
336,000-square-foot building at 90 Broad St., the numbers are still
favorable for acquisition. At a purchase price of $34.5 million,
the Broad Street building cost slightly over $100 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Rents there average $23 a square foot annually. Subtracting
about $11 a square foot to operate the building produces a 12
percent return on investment, year after year. ``Compare that to
the $400-a-foot replacement cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, who developed projects in the Phoenix and Orlando areas
while building in New York all but ceased in the '90s, says the
city is now the major focus of the company's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of the company is in Manhattan,'' he said, adding
that he expected Tower to make $200 million more in acquisitions in
the city. The company already owns Tower 45 on 45th Street between
Sixth and Seventh Avenues, 100 Wall St. and 810 Seventh Ave., at
53rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the REITs operating in the metropolitan area has
developed its own growth strategy based on its assessment of the
market. For Reckson it has been to expand beyond its roots on Long
Island and acquire properties and companies in New Jersey and in
Westchester and Fairfield counties.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reckler, the president and chief operating officer of
Reckson, said his company had no plans to diversify more broadly
geographically. ``We are very bullish on the New York area,'' he
said. ``There are some unique investment opportunities here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although REITs have been a part of the federal tax code since
1960, they have become more important in the last 10 years as real
estate managers have found public offerings a cheaper source of
capital than more traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional investors, such as life insurance companies, are
selling directly-owned properties and reinvesting the proceeds in
REIT stocks as a more liquid way to own real estate. Indeed, when
Steven Witkoff's Witkoff Group bought three towers, Numbers One,
Three and Four, in Newark's Gateway Center from Prudential
Insurance Co., the announcement said that if the Witkoff Group were
to go public, ``Prudential would have the opportunity to acquire an
equity stake in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind the REITs rushing into New York was a change
in the 10 percent capital gains tax on sales of over $1 million
that had been enacted while Mario Cuomo was governor, said Kevin
Haggarty, the executive managing director of Insignia Capital
Advisors, a unit of Insignia/ESG.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Cuomo tax was in effect, if you transferred your
property to a REIT it was considered a sale that triggered tax
liability,'' he said. Since most REITs in this area were started by
family companies contributing their properties, the tax liability
discouraged their formation. The tax has since been repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Vornado started the REIT wave in the city early last year by
purchasing Mendik Co., which had itself been preparing for an
initial public offering as a REIT. Vornado paid $656 million for 4
million square feet of office space.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases REITs can outbid other investors for closely-held
properties because they can pay with a form of stock known as
operating partnership units, which do not trigger a capital gains
tax the way a cash sale would. The units are usually convertible
into the REITs common stock after a ``lockup period,'' during which
no such exchanges are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The overhang of operating partnership units, which dilute the
value of a REITs earnings by increasing the number of shares when
converted, could be an issue in REIT stock price, some executives
said. The increased number of shares would reduce the reported
earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   REITs do not always win bidding wars for trophy properties, as
the recent contest for the General Motors Building at 58th Street
and Fifth Avenue showed. With a bid of $800 million, Donald Trump,
backed by the Conseco insurance company of Indianapolis, won the
building in a bidding contest that involved several REITs.
</P>
<P>
   Although forming a REIT can give a developer access to low-cost
capital, becoming a public company means complying with complex
securities laws, dealing with Wall Street and revealing information
many businesses prefer to keep private.
</P>
<P>
   ``REITs have to answer to public markets and answer
frequently,'' said Darcy Stacom, an executive director with Cushman
&AMP; Wakefield. ``With a syndication, there is a reckoning once a
year, but with a REIT you are on the phone in a conference call
with analysts every Monday morning.'' This constant attention from
analysts may push REIT managers to press for short-term performance
at the expense of long-term success, some fear.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear that the analytic skills designed to
evaluate industrial and commercial companies can be successfully
applied to real estate, some people in the industry say. ``I don't
think Wall Street and the analysts have the ability to distinguish
between a good deal and a bad deal,'' said James Kuhn, the
president of Newmark &AMP; Company Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   REITs are tending to push up prices as they work to meet
financial goals through growth, and would-be REIT operators are
buying aggressively to build their portfolios in anticipation of
going public, Kuhn said. ``You have people who are poised to do
their initial public offering, and they are buying properties to
bulk up before going public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all real estate operators in New York are lured by the
attractions of public ownership. Members of both the Durst and
Rudin families, both major players in the Manhattan office market,
have said they have no intention of forming REITs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Malkin, the president of W &AMP; M Properties, said his
company operated like a virtual REIT, raising money from a pool of
investors on a project-by-project basis. Malkin said that this form
of financing allowed the company to focus on long-term performance.
``A REIT is accountable on a quarterly basis, and the real estate
operation may end up being secondary to the stock market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is how REITs will act in a market downturn.
REIT executives argue that they will be in a better financial
condition to keep up their properties than are debt-laden private
operators. But some question whether the REITs will have the
management skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are running big companies and they are good at
financial engineering and managing funds from operations,'' said
Robert Ageloff, a senior vice president of Equis, a national
tenants' broker, referring to the REIT equivalent of earnings.
``But will they be as good as New York's family landlords at tenant
retention?''
</P>
<P>
   One limitation on REITs is that they are restricted largely to
income-producing property in the investments they can make;
managers have struggled to develop organizations that meet the
requirements of the tax code while allowing them to do more than
collect rent. One approach was the paired-share REIT, in which a
separate company does the non-REIT work while the two have the same
management and their stock shares trade as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   But paired-share or ``stapled'' REITs are no longer permitted,
although a few, including Starwood and Patriot American, continue
to operate because they were organized before the rules changed. To
cope with the current circumstances the ``paper clip'' REIT has
been developed. Like the paired-share REITs, the two companies
share management, but the shares of the two companies are not
firmly linked and can trade separately.
</P>
<P>
   Reckson has adopted the paper-clip format, with the parallel
Reckson Service Industries able to invest in companies in
developing industries such as the Internet and telecommunications
that a pure REIT could not. Stock in Reckson Service was recently
spun off to shareholders of the REIT.
</P>
<P>
   Reckler said the recent low price of the company's stock would
affect his plans. ``We are long-term players, and adversity can
breed opportunity,'' he said, implying that if planned public stock
offerings cannot go forward, those companies who failed to sell
stock could become acquisition targets by companies like Reckson.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Reckson's strong balance sheet, he said, the company
has no need to return to the equity market any time soon and can
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Reckler has an expansive view of what the future holds for real
estate companies like his. In a recent speech he noted that there
was something on the order of $1 trillion in real estate held by
major corporations, public institutions and municipalities. ``I
believe that in the future all real estate services will be
outsourced to the real estate companies that are best equipped to
provide this service,'' he said. ``These services will include
design, site selection development, management and, ultimately,
ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   While Reckson has confined itself to the New York suburbs, what
was known as Cali Realty has expanded to the Dallas area via a
merger with the Mack Company and has become Mack-Cali. Thomas Rizk,
the president and chief executive of Mack-Cali, said the merger was
an outgrowth of the company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first went public we were basically a New Jersey
story,'' he said. ``We decided our strategy was to acquire the best
management teams in the markets we wanted to be in.'' He said Cali
had acquired the Robert Martin company, a leading Westchester
County office developer, and 4.1 million square feet of office
space as a means of getting into the northern suburbs of New York
and had acquired properties as far south as Philadelphia. He said
Mack-Cali's holdings were now about 75 percent in the Northeast and
25 percent in the southwest as a result of the Mack deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rizk said the company would emphasize establishing a presence in
markets, rather than simply buying widely scattered assets. And
like Reckler, he said that if the stock market remained difficult
he might buy properties from private investors who have purchased a
lot of property in anticipation of going public and now find
themselves saddled with debt.
</P>
<P>
   While some REITs have emphasized geographic diversification,
Stephen Green, the chief executive of SL Green Realty Corp.,
concentrates on concentration. His strategy is to buy older office
buildings in Manhattan, known as B buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Green's argument is that without the lower rental rates of B
buildings (compared to the newer A properties) many tenants would
be forced to move from Manhattan to the other boroughs and the
suburbs. ``New York would not function without B buildings,'' he
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he was following a strategy of buying well-situated B
buildings in need of improvement, such as the properties at 70 W.
32nd St. and 1372 Broadway in the Garment District. ``We are
looking to buy deals that are consistent with our business plan,''
he said. ``They are based on our ability to redevelop buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The current low prices of REIT stocks ``are a little like a
self-inflicted wound,'' said Louis Taylor, a senior real estate
analyst with Prudential Securities, who pointed out that a number
of REITs had brought stock offerings to the market in recent
months. ``There was a strong offerings calendar with equity issues
being forced into a market with weak demand,'' he said. With the
rate of offering slowing, he expects prices to recover in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It not that the REITs have been doing anything wrong,'' said
P. Anthony Brown, head of the REIT team at Arthur Anderson, the
accounting and consulting company. ``In general they have been
hitting their earnings targets. It could be simply that other asset
classes have been attracting more attention in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who recently raised $316 million for his SL Green REIT in
a sale of 13 million shares of common and preferred stock, said he
was not overly concerned about the decline in stock prices. ``I
think it is temporary,'' he said. ``These trends are like the
lengths of women's skirts.''

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE: SIZING UP MANAGING AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Breaking up is hard to do; knowing when to do it is
even harder. Hiring a new managing agent _ a firm that handles the
details of running a co-op, condominium or other multifamily
building _ is similarly dicey; it is essential to gauge with some
skill when the the old one must go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not exactly a refined art,'' said Arthur Davis, a
management consultant in Manhattan. In most cases, he said, the
assessment of a managing agent should at least focus on the
responsiveness of the on-site manager, the efficiency of the
back-office staff and the accessibility of the top management.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things to look for is the time between a request
for something and the time it actually takes for the management
company to respond,'' Davis said. ``One of the first signs of a
deteriorating relationship is that you're not getting the same
responsiveness out of the site manager as you did when the
relationship started.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the boards of buildings must ask themselves
if back-office operations have deteriorated since the managing firm
was first hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that every board member should get a printout of the
financial statement on a monthly basis,'' Davis said, adding that
with a few years' worth of monthly reports in hand, board members
can get a sense of whether the building's finances have been
handled consistently, with no significant deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   And the lines of communication should always remain open between
the building's board and the top officials of the managing firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're coming to a point where the site manager isn't doing
his job,'' Davis said, ``you want to be confident that you can get
the president of the company on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Montayne, a co-op accountant in Roslyn, N.Y., said the
efficiency of a managing agent could also be determined by deducing
what isn't included in monthly financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing reports or documents may be an indication that there
is a problem,'' Montayne said. So, too, would increasing amounts of
overtime for building employees _ a sign that an agent may be
misjudging what is needed for the day-to-day operation of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Shernicoff, a Manhattan co-op accountant, said that in
addition to assessing a managing agent's technical skills and its
relationship with shareholders, a board must strike a balance in
evaluating such criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Some managing agents, he said, excel at building good
relationships with residents but are less effective when it comes
to paying bills. Others may be fiscal wizards with horrible bedside
manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen buildings get rid of excellent managing agents
because they didn't like the personality of the on-site manager,''
Shernicoff said. ``And I've seen buildings stay with managing
agents that are terrible just because they love the on-site guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If a managing agent has a good relationship with residents and
responds quickly to their requests, he said, it may be possible to
overlook minor deficiencies in back-office work.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Shernicoff added, if a managing agent is so
determined to establish a cordial relationship with shareholders
that it becomes sheepish about aggressively collecting maintenance
fees, the board may want to trade in the firm for one that
understands tough love.
</P>
<P>
   But when does a board know that it's time to switch?
</P>
<P>
   ``You often don't know until it's too late,'' said Aaron
Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. Shmulewitz said that some
general strategies for assessing a managing agent's performance
include determining whether it is taking advantage of all available
bulk purchasing agreements, maximizing available discounts,
comparison shopping for supplies that can't be bought in bulk and
making efforts every year to try to keep down property taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You should also determine whether the management firm is
following a tight and defined procedure for collecting maintenance
charges,'' Shmulewitz said. ``Find out when the first reminder gets
mailed to shareholders in arrears. And find out at what point the
managing agent will turn the matter over to the building's
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, boards should determine what criteria are
used when a managing agent puts work out to bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should ask the executives of the management company what
bidding procedure they are using,'' he said. ``Are there a minimum
number of bids required? Are the bids sealed or open? If the bids
are sealed, who unseals them, and where are they unsealed?''
</P>
<P>
   But how does a board determine, say, whether a managing agent is
utilizing a ``tight and defined procedure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy when you have clear financial statements,'' said
Herb Rose, a co-op consultant in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rose said, determining whether the management firm
is efficient in collecting maintenance charges is a matter of
simple math.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the red flag is 5 percent,'' he said, explaining that
if uncollected maintenance charges exceed 5 percent of total, the
managing agent is not doing its job. Similarly, Rose said, if the
total amount of bills not paid within 30 days exceeds 5 percent of
total monthly expenses, that may be a sign that someone somewhere
is dropping the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managing agent should have a hands-on approach to running
the building,'' he said, adding that another significant attribute
is an ability to keep a board focused on a building's economic
health.
</P>
<P>
   This might include prodding the board to increase maintenance
fees in order to keep reserve funds at an adequate level. ``The
bottom-line minimum should be two month's maintenance,'' Rose said.
So, a building that collects $1.2 million in maintenance fees each
year should have a working capital reserve of at least $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   If a building is missing that mark, and the managing agent isn't
urging the board to hit it, Rose said, it is possible that the
agent is more interested in renewing its contract than in doing the
best job possible. Contracts with managing firms generally run year
to year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rose added, there is virtually no income-making or
cost-cutting strategy that a competent, dedicated managing agent
will overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get a discount of 1 percent for paying a bill
within 10 days, doesn't it make sense to pay the bill early and
save the money?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shernicoff, the accountant, offered this advice for boards that
are in the process of deciding whether to replace their current
managing agent:
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to your other professionals,'' he said, explaining that
since lawyers and accountants generally handle multiple clients, it
is likely that they have dealt with a number of different managing
agents and should be able to provide a board with some valuable
insight.
</P>
<P>
   Shernicoff also offered one additional and highly effective
method for determining whether the time has come for a board and
its managing agent to part company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start wondering whether your agent is a clunker,''
Shernicoff said, ``that's probably a good sign that it is.''

PRINCIPALS' UNION STRUGGLES FOR CONTRACT, RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than two years, members of the union
representing New York City's principals and assistant principals
have worked under an expired contract. But getting the attention of
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, let alone winning the sympathy of
anyone outside the school system, has proven no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the union, the Council of Supervisors and
Administrators, has stepped up its campaign for a new contract in
full-page newspaper ads, radio and television spots, demonstrations
in front of the chancellor's Brooklyn office and passionate
speeches to the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The union says that only a new contract _ one that would
guarantee wages consistently higher than the teachers and protect
principals' tenure rights _ would stem a steady exodus by
principals and assistants to suburban school districts. About 80,
or 2 percent, left in the school year just completed, the union
says, and 50 the previous school year. The union has 4,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   But Crew has shown little inclination to bargain, prompting the
union to dash off a news release the other day urging him ``to
treat workers with respect'' _ a line that seemed apt for an
organization that, in one sense, is the Rodney Dangerfield of
municipal unions.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a new contract, union president Donald Singer must
vault any number of hurdles, not the least of which is the
lingering question of why principals need a union at all. Though
Crew must abide by the union's state-protected right to organize
and bargain, he believes that its members should not have tenure _
perhaps the principals' biggest benefit of unionizing _ because he
considers them managers accountable for their schools' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with tenure,'' said Lewis Spence, deputy
chancellor for operations, ``is that it essentially says that you
establish a minimum standard for performance. And when you set a
minimum, you get the minimum, and a school requires more than
minimum performance from the chief educational leader of a school,
for it to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   But Singer argues that if unionized ship captains and airline
pilots enjoy due-process protections like tenure, so should
principals. After all, he said, they must answer to superintendents
appointed by the chancellor and are thus more like employees than
managers, so limited is their discretion within school buildings.
Singer contends that tenure has long insulated principals from the
system's shifting political winds. He said he believed that the
chancellor's ultimate goal was to do an end-run around the union
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chancellor doesn't want to have the union in his face,''
Singer said. ``He wants to have our members, particularly the
principals, be managers, so that he can negotiate directly with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, principals are routinely granted
tenure after a five-year probationary period. And once tenured,
Crew has maintained, a principal can be dismissed only after a
protracted disciplinary proceeding _ one that Crew, like his
predecessors, has largely avoided even though many schools are
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Crew is seeking to replace tenure with contracts of three to
five years. He is also drafting guidelines, now months overdue,
that would define ``persistent educational failure,'' a category
for disciplining principals that the Legislature granted to the
chancellor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the issue of tenure is moot: to dismantle
tenure, the chancellor must secure the permission of the
Legislature. And in the session that concluded last month,
legislators declined to consider the chancellor's request. They
were persuaded, in large part, by the arguments of the far larger
city teachers' union (with nearly 70,000 active members), whose
representatives said that any infringement on tenure rights would
be an affront to the entire labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   While a major victory for the principals' union, the
legislature's inaction has brought the union no closer to achieving
a contract to replace the three-and-a-half year pact that expired
in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That contract, which still remains in place, sets an entry-level
salary for elementary school principals at $69,500 and an
entry-level high school principal's salary at $74,700. Those
salaries increase to $75,140 and $83,900, respectively, after 15
years' service. The union is seeking terms comparable to those
achieved by the teachers' union two years ago: no raises in the
first two years of the new contract (for the principals, that would
be 1996 and 1997, retroactively) and cumulative raises of 11
percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the principals' union have said that the board
has shown little resistance to granting that package.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to those increases, the union is also seeking to
make sure that the salaries of assistant principals are higher than
those of the teachers who work for them _ the entry-level assistant
principal's salary is $61,375, while the top teacher's salary is
$63,037.
</P>
<P>
   With no end in sight, the principals could always strike. But,
under state law, they would lose two days' pay for every day they
were out. And the Board of Education would no longer be require to
collect dues on their behalf, which would could throw the union
into fiscal disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we don't have to reach that point,'' Singer said.
``But strange things happen.''

   FLAFIRE-MAIN _ More than 120,000 people in Flagler, Brevard and
Volusia counties were under evacuation orders, according to the
latest state figures. Some were allowed back in, but many
communities were virtual ghost towns early Saturday. Flagler County
Sheriff Robert McCarthy said Saturday morning that officials were
extending evacuation for another day in Flagler County. By early
Saturday, Flagler County had evacuated 42,000 residents _ 90
percent of the county.(Moffett, Palm Beach Post)

   FLAFIRE-FIGHTERS _ ORMOND BEACH, Fla. _ Somehow through the
smoke, helicopter pilot Ray Speights spots a fluorescent orange
flag tied to a 10-foot pole that firefighter Chris Edwards waves.
He pulls a lever and dumps the water directly on the spot Edwards
marked. ``He used to fly in Vietnam and he says it's just like that
fighting a fire,'' said Edwards's partner Michelle Christiansen, a

   FLAFIRE-SCIENCE _ The answer to why Florida keeps burning is
below our feet and above our heads. Slash pines, with needles that
decompose slowly, longleaf pines and others pack flammable resin
and have air between needles that allow them to burn quick and hot.
Some get so hot neighboring trees ``will just kind of explode. It

   SCHOOLBUS-ADS _ The 12 yellow school buses of the Fabens
Independent School District, one of Texas's poorest, now bear
McDonald's, Coca Cola, American Airlines and other ads. And thanks

stop signs that unfold into traffic when children board or exit.
Some think the ads detract from safety, though. (Austin

an icon of the most ridiculously theatrical ``sport'' in the world,
big-time wrestling. His off-stage altar-ego, Ric Flair, looks like
any well-off suburban dad, in his Ralph Lauren golf clothes, Rolex
and Mercedes sedan. The duality is instructive. Ric Flair, one of
big-time wrestling's most enduring and famous stars for 25 years,
is at the center of a Fulton County Superior Court lawsuit.
Turner-owned World Championship Wrestling says Flair broke their $2

   VA-ASBESTOS _ Members of the U.S. Navy's Armed Guard were
sailors stationed on WWII Liberty ships, tankers and supply vessels
to guard them against attacks by enemy planes and submarines. Some

   GA-PRIVATEPRISONS _ ATLANTA _ The Georgia Department of
Corrections has no reservations or apprehensions as it takes the

   CARSON _ While African-Americans spend an estimated 5 billion a
year on personal care products, companies that focus on these

PEPSICO AND TEXACO RECONFIGURING HEADQUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARY McALEER VIZARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adjusting to market realities, two Westchester
County-based international conglomerates are putting some of their
properties on the market and trying to make better use of their
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico Inc. has been headquartered in Westchester for 28 years
and Texaco Inc. for 21. Within months of each other, they announced
plans to reconfigure their headquarters buildings, move employees
around and sell or lease some of their property.
</P>
<P>
   For Pepsico, that will mean selling its Pepsi-Cola division's
headquarters in Somers, a 522,800-square-foot building on 206
acres, and relocating an undetermined number of employees to its
corporate headquarters in Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to sell the Somers building and lease back some space
for our operations,'' said Elaine Franklin, Pepsico's manager of
corporate information. How much space the company will retain in
Somers is not known at this point, Ms. Franklin said. ``But many of
the Somers employees will be relocating to headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the expected influx, Pepsico is expanding its
418,000-square-foot-headquarters by 10,000 square feet to include a
new conference center and an expanded cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The conference center will be a semicircular amphitheater
seating 160 people. ``There'll also be five break-out rooms, with
television monitors and projection screens,'' Ms. Franklin said.
``We've always been short of classroom areas and conference rooms.
So this is an addition that's been needed for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The cafeteria, on the other hand, is being enlarged specifically
to accommodate employees relocated from Somers, Ms. Franklin said.
``It will be a two-story dining area, with glass walls, skylights
and an outdoor seating area,'' she added. The seating capacity will
double to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's space needs diminished substantially when it spun off
its restaurant division, including Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell, late last year. ``We're now down to our beverage
and snack divisions exclusively,'' Ms. Franklin said. ``Some
functions, such as consumer affairs and some sales units, are
expected to remain in Somers.''
</P>
<P>
   Texaco is taking a different tack in dealing with its excess
office space. The company is completing a study to see how its
707,000-square-foot headquarters in Harrison can be divided to
include another major tenant. ``We plan to lease between 160,000 to
200,000 square feet, and share the building equally,'' said David
DeVito, senior property manager.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are expected to place their properties on the
market officially sometime in the third quarter. ``It's been
expected for some time,'' said Maureen O'Boyle, a director at
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. ``This is the kind of thing we've been seeing
for a while. The market's gotten used to it. I don't think either
property will be a drag on the market since they're both highly
desirable and should find tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   When Texaco built its present headquarters in 1977, it had
70,000 employees worldwide, DeVito said. ``We're down to 20,000
now. There are vast pockets of empty space in the building as a
result of downsizing. To better utilize it, we'll have to move
walls and reconfigure some. But when it's over, we'll be making
much better use of the space we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to Westchester, Texaco was based in the Chrysler
Building in New York City. ``At the time, we still had a Manhattan
mentality as far as space was concerned, and essentially took a
35-story building concept and placed it on its side,'' DeVito said.
</P>
<P>
   The building is 870 feet long (the size of three football
fields) and 300 feet wide. It is built around an interior courtyard
and features a 600-seat terraced cafeteria, a carpeted dining area,
several executive dining rooms and underground parking for 1,400
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco hired Staubach Co. as its broker to find the right tenant
to share their building, which has amenities like a 300-seat
auditorium, a television studio and conference and fitness centers.
</P>
<P>
   Staubach is looking for a tenant of ``similar stature,''
according to Peter Hennessy, a principal of Staubach. ``We envision
a tenant who would use the space as a headquarters-type
operation,'' he added. ``They may wind up coming from New York
City, where available space of this size is in very short supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of these headquarters properties reflect a glided age of
corporate extravagance. Pepsico's was built on land that was
formerly a polo field. Designed by Edward Durell Stone, the
building is made up of seven square blocks that rise from the
ground into low inverted pyramids, linked together at the corners
by towers.
</P>
<P>
   In the center are three interior courtyards and a central
fountain. Surrounding the building is an elaborate sculpture garden
named after the company's former chief executive officer, Donald M.
Kendall. It is open to the public. The earth movers doing the
construction work on the building must, in some cases, snake around
valuable works of art.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the headquarters renovation is to ``consolidate
operations, build a center for meetings and become more focused,''
Ms. Franklin said. ``It's the same process many other companies
have been through.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Since Pepsico and Texaco first moved to Westchester, the office
market has changed considerably, and single-user buildings of this
type are probably a thing of the past, said Frank Tomasulo, a first
vice president at CB Richard Ellis, a commercial brokerage in White
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can't really be another wave of that kind of building,''
Tomasulo said, ``because those properties were built on some of the
most premier land in the county. It's a totally different picture
today. They would be competing with many more projects now,
including residential communities, and there are watershed and
other environmental issues that didn't exist then.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Westchester will continue to be a headquarters
destination, although on a somewhat smaller scale, Ms. O'Boyle
said, adding that Swiss Re, the reinsurance company, was now
building its new 300,000-square-foot headquarters in Armonk. Also
Nine West, a women's shoe company, established a
336,000-square-foot headquarters in the county by moving into
existing space in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester office market continues to rebound, with a
second-quarter vacancy rate of 15.3 percent, down from 16.2 at the
same time last year, according to Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. The vacancy
rate was as high as 25 percent in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The office market got off to one of its best starts in years in
the first quarter, with a 14.2 percent vacancy rate. ``We are
continuing at that same first-quarter pace,'' Ms. O'Boyle said. One
drag on the market in the second quarter was the return to the
market of the former Kraft building in White Plains, representing
600,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen Bros. Realty Corp. of New York City bought the former
headquarters in April. ``And they immediately placed it on the
market for lease,'' Ms. O'Boyle said. ``It affects the numbers, but
doesn't constitute a trend. It's just one building, not nine or 10
buildings.''

NBA-STYLE LABOR PROBLEMS ALSO FACING BASEBALL, FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW ZIMBALIST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins lost more than $30 million last year. Right,
and Dennis Rodman has no tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association contends that more than half
of its teams are losing money. The NBA players association says
that only five teams lost money last year, and four of those are
getting new arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA owners say they need a hard salary cap to stop the
bleeding. The players say it ain't so, and besides, if some teams
on the bottom are really in the red year after year, there are
better ways to deal with it than creating more restrictive labor
markets.
</P>
<P>
   These issues, now extant in the NBA because of the lockout
announced last week, plague labor relations in all the major team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA and the National Football League, where an explicit
salary cap restricts the payroll, the players have every reason to
be concerned that team revenue is correctly identified. When the
cap was first introduced in the NBA in 1983, Larry Fleisher and the
players association were not very sophisticated about the ways
owners could hide or rechannel revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The 1983 cap was defined as 53 percent of defined gross
revenues, which included only television, radio and gate revenues.
Following the 1988 collective bargaining agreement, which defined
those revenues as ones ``derived from, related to or arising out of
the performance of players in NBA basketball games,'' a dispute
arose about what sources of income should be included.
</P>
<P>
   Owners divided luxury box revenue into two parts: the rental
payment for the amenities of the comfort and convenience of the box
and the ticket price for watching the game. The owners contended
that the latter belonged to defined gross revenues and the former
did not. This and similar issues led the players to bring an
arbitration complaint against the owners, which they won in 1992
with a settlement of some $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1995 collective bargaining agreement was signed,
defined gross revenues was changed to basketball-related income,
and the players accepted a lower share in return for a broader
definition of revenues applicable to the salary cap.
Basketball-related income now includes, for instance, 40 percent of
luxury box income, 40 percent of signage (but excludes naming
rights according to a curious arbitrator's decision in 1996), a pro
rata share of permanent seat licenses and certain related party
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The collective bargaining agreement takes 11 pages to define
basketball-related income, and it is still subject to regular
dispute. Suppose you are an owner negotiating an arena lease and
you are given a choice: pay $2 million in rent and receive 50
percent of a projected $4 million in signage income or pay no rent
and receive no money for signage.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that this is a choice between equals, but since
the collective bargaining agreement gives 40 percent of signage
income to the players, the owner would do better with the option of
no rent/no signage. Lease agreements offer manifold opportunities
for such juggling, especially when the arena and team are owned by
the same person or entity.
</P>
<P>
   Related party transactions are a central component of most
teams' finances. For example, if the owner of the team also owns
the arena, the arena management company, the concession rights, a
local television or radio station, Web pages, local real estate,
law or consulting firms that do business with the team, then the
owner has tremendous latitude about where to make his or her
profits appear.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Pollin, for example, owns the new MCI Center, where both his
NBA and NHL teams, the Washington Wizards and the Capitals, play.
He can retain arena revenue from naming rights, premium seats,
signage, catering, theme activities and so on, in his arena
corporation, thereby reducing the revenues earned by his teams by
tens of millions of dollars annually. Owners can also pay
themselves exorbitant salaries and consulting fees, along with
their extensive perks. Thus, Wayne Huizenga, owner of the Marlins,
Dolphins, Panthers, Pro Player Stadium, SportsChannel Florida, and
arena management and concession ventures can rechannel his teams'
revenues to his related businesses, making the world champion
Marlins appear to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   When there is a salary cap, such accounting legerdemain comes in
handy to directly reduce player payrolls. When there is no cap,
owners have still preferred to hide profits to reduce
revenue-sharing payments or to argue for larger public subsidies
for stadiums, collective bargaining concessions or special
treatment under the law.
</P>
<P>
   As the sports industry globalizes, the opportunities for
shuffling new income into different businesses will expand and the
potential for labor conflict will grow with it.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA takes in millions of dollars from European or Asian
advertisers on its Web page, is this, using the language from the
1995 collective bargaining agreement, revenue that is ``derived
from, relating to or arising directly or indirectly out of the
performance of players in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related
activities''?
</P>
<P>
   The trend for media giants to buy up sports franchises so they
can control their programming will further complicate matters. When
Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox, sends signals for Los Angeles Dodgers
games to hundreds of millions of Asian homes and is able to raise
subscription or advertising fees on satellite television service,
how can baseball players lay any claim to this revenue they help to
produce?
</P>
<P>
   How can other team owners include this income in the
revenue-sharing base when there is no direct increase in Dodger
revenues, especially when 24 major league baseball teams are
dependent on Fox-owned stations for their local TV revenue?
</P>
<P>
   These are extraordinarily complex management and organizational
issues. Put them together with the issues of competitive balance,
single-entity vs. monopoly status and idiosyncratic personalities,
and you begin to sense the challenges that lie ahead for the
business of team sports.
</P>
<P>
   Greater labor-management cooperation is imperative to confront
these challenges successfully. Intelligent leadership and sensible
public policy, both scarce commodities, would also help.

SOME FLORIDA FIRES ARE CONTAINED, BUT 87 STILL BURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla. _ For the last three weeks, George Colombis
has left the Volusia County Correctional Facility to work 10-hour
shifts around the perimeter of wildfires. On Saturday, he and a
crew of 20 other inmates raked and shoveled, turning the ground
over in the back woods of an expensive housing complex here to make
sure a forest that steamed like a boiling pot did not erupt in
flames again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hose down, we rake and shovel,'' said Colombis, 43, a
hairdresser who said he was serving a five-month sentence for
violating his probation on a drug-related conviction. ``I go back
to the facility at night and thank God for a good day and that
nobody got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombis was part of the all-fronts attack by more than 5,000
firefighters and others to tame the fires that have ravaged
northeast Florida for weeks. The effort, which has cost more than
$100 million so far, showed some results Saturday, with fires
contained in some areas. But the authorities said there were still
at least 87 fires burning, primarily in five counties along the
northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable winds, high humidity and even some rain combined over
the last 24 hours to calm down the fires ``a little,'' said Greg
Thayer, a spokesman for the Florida emergency operations center in
Tallahassee, although ``the rain didn't contain anything or put
fires out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the forecast called for more thunderstorms and light rain,
officials said shifts in wind also threatened to spread the fires
to populated areas as long as drought conditions remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be foolish to think everything is fine and we're making
headway,'' said Raymond Yeakley, a fire spokesman for Volusia
County, where only 11 active fires remained Saturday of the 69 that
raged a few days ago. ``Any unburned areas have the potential of
burning.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Volusia County evacuees were allowed to return home
Saturday, three fires closed in on Flagler County to the north,
where most of the population of more than 30,000 has been
evacuated. A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained for the 10 percent of the
county's residents who refused to evacuate and who were once again
urged Saturday to pack up and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the fires have consumed more than 460,000 acres, or
about 720 square miles, and destroyed 153 homes, with damage
estimated at $275 million. At least 67 people, most of them
firefighters, have been injured. About 110,000 people are under
evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said at least 35 homes had already been damaged
or destroyed. ``When these fires leap, there's no turning back,''
Flagler County Sheriff Robert McCarthy said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   To fight the fires, officials are using every resource, modern
or antiquated, provided to them by 41 states and federal agencies.
From the air, ``bucket brigades'' of helicopters and tanker planes
capable of holding more than 2,000 gallons of water dump both water
and fire retardant on areas flagged down by spotter planes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire retardant, with a bright red dye so pilots can see
where previous drops have fallen, can slow down the advance of a
fire so that ground crews can get in closer to the flames to lay
fire lines down, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, crews of about 20 firefighters each are going
deep into the woods to cut trees and open a path or fire lines,
breaks where the flames have nothing to burn. The job is
labor-intensive and uses bulldozers and hand tools to circle a
blaze and let it burn itself out. As the fires threatened populated
areas this week, more crews were deployed around structures and
alongside roads to fend off the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Volusia County, where the fires have consumed more than
120,000 acres of pine and wild land and forced the evacuation of
tens of thousands of residents, the Fourth of July passed with none
of the fireworks, concerts and festivals that had been planned
before the skies were covered by smoke. The biggest loss was the
Pepsi 400 race at Daytona International Speedway that was expected
to attract more than 200,000 visitors and has been postponed until
October.
</P>
<P>
   Even Disney World canceled its famed fireworks displays. The
only thing to celebrate on Independence Day, many residents said,
was that the flames have not killed anyone yet.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer of the emergency operations center in Tallahassee said
that the winds, blowing from east to west, were aiding the
firefighting effort by bringing ocean moisture into the fire areas.
If the winds were to shift around and blow from west to east,
``Flagler County would be in trouble,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   The main threat remains to Flagler County, where three large
fires are converging and threatening to become one massive blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Fire on Saturday invaded five blocks into one Flagler County
community, Palm Coast, about 25 miles north of Daytona Beach.
Thayer said that firefighters were able to set up fire breaks
around residences, and only three homes were lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the largely evacuated city of Bunnell, about five miles
inland from Palm Coast, no buildings or homes were lost, but the
fires were still threatening on the outskirts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said that those who refuse to evacuate must remain on
their own property, an order designed to prevent looting, and that
evacuated communities are being patrolled by National Guardsmen and
local police forces. Roadblocks are up at many points to prevent
anyone from going back into the stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they have had three warnings, they're on their own,''
Thayer said, adding that ``if the worst happens they have to take
the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuees take their own transportation, though some buses have
been available for those who need them. The Red Cross has 32
shelters open, and the state is using schools and other public
buildings as shelters for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Ormond Beach Airport is still closed, and Daytona Beach
International Airport is opened only when the smoke is light enough
for pilots to land.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said that firefighters are using trucks and bulldozers to
clear fire breaks around residential areas. The ``chief
firefighting tool in the state of Florida,'' he said, was a tractor
with a plow attached. It is used to create fire breaks where the
flames have nothing to burn.
</P>
<P>
   They are also using planes and helicopters to scout fires'
progress and dump water. The planes do not douse the fires, but are
called in by ground crews to retard fires in hot spots, to cool
them down so the ground crews can get in closer to the flames to
lay fire lines down. Whether the aircraft can be used depends to
some extent on the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Several World War II-vintage bombers, including some B-17s, are
being used to drop 1,000 to 2,000 gallons of water and
fire-retardant chemicals at a pass. They are fitted with tanks in
their bellies, and water is pumped into them. A C-215 tanker
aircraft from North Carolina scoops up 1,400 gallons in 10 seconds
skimming over lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said little use is being made at present of smoke
jumpers, who parachute from planes into a fire and use equipment
dropped after them to build fire breaks or attack fires directly
with pumps strapped to their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters on the ground are using conventional equipment:
hand tools, hoses, and trucks called brush rigs. These are
four-wheel trucks, fitted with water tanks, that can drive off
roads into the bush. Then there are men with shovels ahd
old-fashioned fire hoses. ``We have miles and miles of fire hoses
laid out, with pumps at central water locations,'' Thayer said.
These locations might be ``bladder-bag trucks,'' capable of holding
10,000 gallons of water, or hookups to city water systems.

AIR TRAFFIC AND FARES SET OFF UPSTATE-DOWNSTATE SQUABBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the surface, the two problems seem about as
related as toothaches and hangnails: the budget-busting cost of
flying on business out of New York's upstate cities, and the
nerve-jangling roar of jets using La Guardia and Kennedy Airports
in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But legislation moving briskly through Congress has bound the
two together, by proposing a treatment for the first that many New
York City officials believe will thoroughly aggravate the second.
The result has been a classic bit of regional squabbling within New
York's congressional delegation over whether the city's
quality-of-life concerns are drowning out the economic problems of
smaller communities upstate.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is legislation intended to increase airline competition
in mid-size cities like Albany, Rochester, Syracuse and Buffalo,
where an unrestricted round-trip ticket to Chicago can cost more
than the excursion round-trip fare to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would help start-up and regional airlines by giving
them greater access to major airports, including La Guardia and
Kennedy. Large airlines now control virtually all of the landing
and takeoff slots at those airports.
</P>
<P>
   But increasing competition at La Guardia and Kennedy, two of the
nation's busiest airports, requires increasing air traffic. To New
Yorkers who live along flight corridors in Long Island, Queens and
the Bronx, that can only mean more ear-thumping, window-rattling,
baby-waking noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlivable now,'' said Stephen Hendel, whose home in
Larchmont, in Westchester County, falls under a flight path to La
Guardia on busy days. ``To bring down air fares $20 a ticket
upstate while at the same time burdening people in an area that
can't accommodate the planes it already has makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has caused a regional rift in the state's
congressional delegation, a relatively cohesive group, uniting
upstate Republicans and Democrats against their downstate brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get more complaints about air noise than almost any other
local issue,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat who represents
parts of Westchester, the Bronx and Queens. ``This legislation will
only make the situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But for House members from Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse and
Albany, which have some of the highest air fares in the country,
the issue is a leading business problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this bill will increase traffic,'' said Rep. Louise
Slaughter, a Democrat from Rochester and a leading proponent of the
House bill. ``But if that is the result, they'll just have to
accept it. They have the major airports and get the benefits
related to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Rochester, Buffalo and other upstate cities say air
fares are so exorbitant that many companies have begun requiring
employees to drive rather than fly to places like Boston or
Chicago. Some companies have also raised the specter of moving
marketing personnel or entire divisions to cities that offer
cheaper air transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies evaluate whether to expand in Rochester or
elsewhere, the cost of transportation has become a factor,'' said
Craig Curran, president of a travel agency in Rochester and a
director of the Greater Rochester Visitors Association, a tourism
group.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has created a dilemma for Rep. Charles Schumer, a
Brooklyn Democrat who is seeking his party's endorsement for
Senate. Schumer, who is struggling to gain name recognition outside
New York City, has made reducing air fares one of his top campaign
issues upstate.
</P>
<P>
   But jet noise is also a major issue in his home district, and
Schumer recently signed a letter along with Ms. Lowey and five
other members of Congress from the New York metropolitan area
urging colleagues to reject the airline bill, known as the Airline
Service Improvement Act.
</P>
<P>
   James Kessler, a spokesman for Schumer, said the congressman
might propose an amendment that would allow regional carriers to
increase their flights into La Guardia and Kennedy by giving them
slots now controlled by the big airlines, rather than creating new
slots. Such a plan would avoid increasing overall air traffic at
the two airports, but would also face fierce opposition from major
carriers, which guard their slots jealously.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing anger across the country with high air fares and
government accusations of predatory pricing by the major carriers,
the airline competition legislation has gained widespread support
among legislators from both parties. The Airline Service
Improvement Act was approved overwhelmingly by the House
Transportation Committee last week and is expected to reach the
floor later this summer. Similar legislation is percolating in the
Senate Commerce Committee, and its sponsors expect a floor vote by
August.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a 30-year-old system that sets strict limits on the
number of landing and takeoff slots available at four airports: La
Guardia, Kennedy, O'Hare International in Chicago and Ronald Reagan
National in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1985, the U.S. Department of Transportation allowed
the major airlines to treat their slots like property that could be
sold, traded, leased or even used as collateral for loans. But
rather than sell slots to start-up airlines, the big airlines have
tended to hoard, or ``baby-sit,'' them, or to lease them at high
rents, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That has made it extremely difficult for regional airlines to
establish routes to New York City, Washington and Chicago, all
prime destinations for business travelers. The smaller airlines pay
a premium to lease the few slots available in those cities, which
translates into very high fares. With little competition from
regional airlines, big carriers have been able to charge higher
fares themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Refundable round-trip fares from Rochester to Chicago, the type
of tickets business people traveling on short notice typically must
buy, range from $900 to $1,055. A restricted round-trip fare from
Rochester to Hong Kong can cost $880. Department of Transportation
studies consistently rank Rochester among the nation's five most
expensive cities for air travel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the Airline Service Improvement Act, the Department of
Transportation could grant additional landing slots at the four
restricted airports to airlines that fly to underserved areas. The
rule could add as many as two flights an hour at La Guardia and
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the bill comes at a time when the DOT is preparing
rules intended to stop major airlines from driving out new carriers
with predatory practices, like flooding competitive routes with
cheap seats. The major airlines are lobbying on Capitol Hill to
block or delay those rules, saying they amount to industry
reregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the department has also added 30 new slots
at La Guardia, mainly for regional airlines, under a 1994 provision
allowing such action under ``exceptional circumstances,'' a
department spokesman has said. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and Claire Shulman, the Queens borough president, have filed a
lawsuit seeking to rescind those slots.
</P>
<P>
   For Willard Hunter, president of Amarel, a Rochester company
that makes optical equipment, increased airline competition
couldn't come soon enough. Hunter said he requires employees to
drive 10 hours to Chicago, where they do much of their business,
rather than pay $900 a person to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To send two or three people there would cost $1,800 or $2,700,
which is absolutely ridiculous,'' he said. ``We've always paid a
penalty for living in Rochester.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. A. Allan Greene, a Howard Beach, Queens, podiatrist and
leader of a community group fighting airport noise, said he and his
neighbors could not tolerate even one more flight a day into
Kennedy.

   ``The bipartisan mind-set in Washington is, `More, more, more is
better in the sky,''' he said. ``They have no consideration for the
people down below. You can't hear anything. You can't have a
conversation. I feel like an insect being crop-dusted.''

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: HAWAII DEMOCRATS FACE GOP THREAT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has always carefully cultivated Hawaii's
disparate racial and ethnic groups and, as a result, few states are
more Democratic than the Aloha State. But that Democratic dominance
faces a major test this year because the Hawaiian economy, unlike
those of almost all other states, is in a deep, seven-year slump,
its tourism sector hammered by Asia's financial crisis and unable
to offset steady shrinkage in the agriculture and military sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii could be a state where Democrats lose both a governor and
a member of the House of Representatives this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show the state's top elected Democrat, Gov.
Benjamin J. Cayetano, and one of its two congressional
representatives, Neil Abercrombie, in big trouble with their
probable Republican challengers. Equally serious, the polls
indicate that voters, by 2-to-1, believe that Republicans,
including those in the heavily Democratic state Legislature, could
do a better job of restoring the economy than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, the polls have the expected Republican
nominee, Mayor Linda Lingle of Maui, leading Cayetano by about
5-to-3. Her pitch is that even in the hardest of economic times,
she has managed to keep Maui moving forward, increasing jobs and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   In the congressional race, the polls show that the expected GOP
challenger, state Rep. Quentin Kawananakoa of Honolulu, has pulled
even with Abercrombie. Kawananakoa promises to jump-start the
state's economy with tax cuts, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano and Abercrombie, who both are expected to be
renominated, contend that polls taken five months before the
general election do not mean much. Still, they acknowledge the
state's economic slump has left them with a major political
problem. As the governor put it in a rally a few days ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is going to be one of the great challenges that
we Democrats have faced.''
</P>
<P>
   A Scouting Report On Contest for 2000
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary, the first in every presidential
election year and the one that sometimes gives winners a big
campaign bounce, will not be held for 19 months. But since a score
or so of White House wannabes, both Democrats and Republicans, are
already scouting the state's granite hills and picturesque
``notches,'' herewith an early report _ a very early report _ on
how they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on a poll conducted June 26 through June 28 by RKM
Research and Communications for the television station WMUR. Some
489 registered voters, roughly evenly divided between Republicans
and Democrats, were surveyed and the margin of error was plus or
minus 4.4 percentage points. Following are the percentages of
support given each possible contender:
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS: Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 30; former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, 12; former Vice President Dan Quayle, 8;
publisher Steve Forbes, 8; conservative commentator Pat Buchanan,
6; Ohio Rep. John Kasich, 5; New Hampshire Sen. Robert Smith, 4;
Arizona Sen. John McCain, 4; House Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, 2; Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, 2; Gary Bauer, head of the
Family Research Council, 1, and other/undecided, 20.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS: Vice President Al Gore, 45; Massachusetts Sen. John
Kerry, 15; House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, 13;
Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, 6; Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone, 1, and
other/undecided, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Mail Ballots To the Voter Test
</P>
<P>
   Oregon has long been a leader in simplifying voting procedures,
with local elections conducted entirely by mail ballot and mail
ballots readily available upon request for other elections. In the
May primary, two of every three votes cast were by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of mail balloting contend that not only is it cheaper
and more convenient but that its ease encourages greater voter
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that mail balloting encourages fraud. Some also
say that there are elections in which low turnout can be an
advantage, especially if the candidate or issue on the other side
is not the kind likely to motivate large numbers of voters to
trudge to the polls _ as opposed to filling out a mail ballot at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Oregon Legislature have opposed mail
balloting ever since one of their candidates narrowly lost an
election several years ago in which mail balloting was very heavy.
Now proponents of mail balloting, especially Democrats, think they
have found a way to win approval for having all future elections in
the state conducted exclusively by mail. They aim to put the issue
to a vote on the fall ballot.
</P>
<P>
   To do so requires 73,600 petition signatures. On Tuesday, they
turned in 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans say the measure is likely to win passage and
put Oregon in a class unto itself when it comes to ease in voting.

TORRE'S TROOP HURTING FOR HEALTHY PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tim Raines walked through the Yankees' clubhouse
Saturday morning, taking stock of all of the injuries and personal
travails that have taken their toll on the club's roster this
weekend. ``We ain't got half the team now,'' Raines said in his
distinct high-pitched voice. ``Everyone's broke. We're depleting.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances are actually improving, though Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, is operating at far less than full strength.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, is getting better
after jamming his right knee sliding into second base Thursday
night. But he was not in the starting lineup Saturday against
Baltimore, and it is doubtful he will start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to him,'' said Knoblauch, referring to Torre, ``if he
wants to give me that third day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre has been careful in his handling of players' injuries this
season, taking the latitude afforded him by the Yankees' large lead
in the American League East standing. If a player believes he needs
two days off to heal, Torre will usually give him three, just to be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, out with a sore knee the last few days, said he
could be available Saturday. But again, Torre will probably try to
get through this weekend without using Mendoza, a valuable long
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton began serving his five-game suspension Friday, and
unless Stanton pursues legal action outside baseball, he will
complete the suspension next Friday, when the Yankees are at Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush, the utility infielder, will probably rejoin the team
after the all-star game break. He flew home to East St. Louis,
Ill., following the death of his father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams was expected to take the next step of his
rehabilitation Saturday, with some sliding drills in the morning.
But a minor personal matter kept him from participating in the
pregame workout. He will probably work out Sunday with the Yankees,
then fly to Tampa, Fla., for at least one appearance with the
Yankees' Class A affiliate in the Florida State League. Williams,
coming back from a knee sprain, wants to be activated in time to
play the four games against Tampa Bay beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry was out of the starting lineup Saturday,
unusual when the Yankees were facing a right-handed starting
pitcher. Torre felt Strawberry had tired somewhat and needed a day
off. Raines started as the designated hitter and the rookie Ricky
Ledee started in left field.
</P>
<P>
   No Bullpen Needed
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte knew that going into Friday's game, he would need
to pitch into the late innings to preserve the bullpen. In fact,
Joe Torre said Saturday, the bullpen situation was as dire as it
has ever been since he became manager of the team in 1996. Ramiro
Mendoza was unavailable, Mike Stanton had been suspended and Mike
Buddie and Darren Holmes had pitched extensively in relief
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera and Graeme Lloyd were the only available and
rested relievers, but they were not needed. Pettitte pitched a
complete game, to become the Yankees' third pitcher with at least
10 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a tremendous performance from Andy,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Close to the Best
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are the most storied franchise in professional
sports, with an extraordinary history of success. But the 1998
Yankees, with a 59-20 mark, had the best regular-season record
posted by any Yankees team. That's two games better than the 1928
Yankees (57-22), and three games better than the 1927 Yankees and
the 1939 Yankees (both 56-23).
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees sweep this weekend's series, they will match
baseball's best 81-game record in the 20th century, tying the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates and the 1907 Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius Talks Begin
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, has begun
negotiating in earnest with the agent for third baseman Scott
Brosius, who could become a free agent after this season. Brosius,
named to the American League all-star team last week, could be in
line for a three-year deal and has said he would like to stay with
the Yankees. Cashman confirmed that he traded possible parameters
on the terms of a deal in speaking with Tony Attanasio, Brosius'
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzling Over Irabu
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, helped Hideki
Irabu with his curveball this year, with his command, with his
conditioning. But Stottlemyre has a different sort of challenge now
with Irabu, who must make midseason adjustments to reverse his
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing batters have an .894 slugging percentage against Irabu
over the pitcher's last three starts, increasing his earned run
average to 2.91 from 1.68. Stottlemyre spoke at length with Irabu
on Friday, talking about the pitcher's approach, his method of
attacking opposing hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman doesn't seem to believe that Irabu's physical
condition is an issue, noting that before his start Thursday, Irabu
weighed less than at any time since reporting to spring training.
Joe Torre has said that Irabu told them his arm is fine, and that
in bullpen sessions, he has thrown thunder, to use Torre's word.
</P>
<P>
   In games, however, Irabu's velocity has been diminished, to
86-88 miles an hour from 91-92, and Torre thinks his confidence may
be shaken a bit by his last three outings, in which he has allowed
eight home runs in 11 2/3 innings. ``It may be he's just at a
crossroads,'' Torre said.

 &HT;    CHINA TRIUMPH BEHIND HIM, CLINTON FACES TOUGHER FIGHTS AT HOME
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 5
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Still dealing with jet lag after a nine-day China
tour, President Clinton returns to the Oval Office on Monday to
face partisan squabbles and policy headaches that may well leave
him nostalgic for the Middle Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Awed by ancient wonders, inspired by the promise of change and
buoyed by having carried a message of freedom and hope to 1.2
billion Chinese, Clinton would like to use the momentum of his
historic state visit to help reinvigorate a troubled domestic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But as he tries to advance a slate of bread-and-butter issues
ranging from child care tax credits to a minimum wage increase,
Clinton returns to a White House under siege by influences largely
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress is spoiling for showdowns over tax
cuts, education spending and health care to help highlight their
political differences with Democrats before November, when all 435
members of the House and a third of the Senate will be up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a long list of foreign policy matters demands
Clinton's attention. They include ethnic fighting in the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, the continuing economic crisis in
Asia and the growing risk of instability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's inquiry, now in
its sixth month, into whether Clinton had an affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky then later urged her to lie
about it under oath, allegations the president has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all that the coming dog days of August _when Congress
will be in recess for almost the entire month _ and it's clear it
won't be easy for Clinton to translate his China successes into
political victories at home. He could be hard-pressed to simply
keep his domestic objectives alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll come back reinvigorated,'' said analyst Erwin Hargrove,
who teaches political science at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, but in trying to score points domestically, ''foreign
trips don't help much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly lifted by his China tour, which gave him
unexpected opportunities to showcase his rhetorical gifts before
the largest audience in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So remarkable were Clinton's performances during a
nationally-televised press conference from Beijing with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, a televised give-and-take with students at
Beijing University and a live radio call-in show in Shanghai that
even some of his harshest critics were forced to acknowledge his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if you reach out to a billion people and talk about
open markets and expand the zone of freedom on the planet, that's a
pretty good investment for the world,'' House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., said Wednesday at a Republican Party fund-raising
event in San Antonio. As an advocate for increased liberties for
the repressed Chinese, Gingrich said, Clinton did a ''good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Praising Clinton, however, seems an easy habit to break in this
town, particularly for Republicans fighting to maintain control of
both houses of Congress come Nov. 3. Many will try to do so largely
by differentiating themselves from Clinton's priorities, beginning
as soon as the Senate returns from its mid-summer break on Monday,
and the House on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to cooperate (with Clinton) on anything,''
predicted Hargrove, author of the just-published book ''The
President as Leader: Appealing to the Better Angels of our
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the political firmament, at least, it's a season when halos
are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists, as well as many Republicans, were
stunned last month when Senate Republicans killed an omnibus
tobacco bill that would have raised cigarette taxes by some $60
billion a year and hit the industry with comprehensive regulations
aimed at ending marketing efforts that target teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was counting on the increased revenues to fund at least
a third of his proposals for beefing up Head Start preschool
programs for poor children, increasing child care subsidies for
low-income families and expanding medical research, among other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to use the cash to finance a new cut in
the capital gains tax on profits from the sale of property, stocks
or other investments, as well as tax-free savings accounts of up to
$2,000 a year to fund a child's education.
</P>
<P>
   With or without a tobacco bill _ the House is working on a
stripped-down version _ Clinton still wants his spending increases,
and Republicans still want their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has opposed both the proposed tax cuts _ he could be
forced into a veto showdown as early as this week over the
education savings accounts, proposed by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
_ saying the breaks favor wealthy Americans over low-income and
middle-class workers and threaten efforts to keep the federal
budget in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years into the greatest U.S. economic expansion in
history, the federal government is only now beginning to balance
its budget, after three decades of deficit spending that has left
the country $5.5 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Before rushing to cut taxes, Clinton insists, any surplus
revenues _ projected to top $40 billion this year _ should be set
aside to help shore up Social Security. The national retirement
insurance program will begin paying out more than it takes in when
Baby Boomers begin leaving the workforce in the year 2010, and its
reserves could be depleted by 2032 under current projections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to avoid politicizing the explosive issue between
now and Election Day, and has proposed taking it up as a national
priority early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, have asked him to
name a bipartisan commission to make recommendations much sooner, a
plan Clinton has thus far resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Even without control of Congress, Clinton is hardly without
resources on Capitol Hill. Much as he went around China's
repressive leadership in Beijing to take his message directly to
the people of China, he's been formidably effective at taking his
campaign directly to the American people, 61 percent of whom still
regard him favorably, according to a June 7 Gallup/CNN/USA Today
poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the best features of the presidency is the bully
pulpit,'' White House political counselor Paul Begala said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this year will be either progress or
partisanship, and that really is up to the Republican leadership,''
said Begala. ''I think they're going to either move on the
president's agenda or wish to goodness they had, come November.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Political equations aside, Clinton also faces the prospect of a
deepening security crisis in Kosovo, a province of what's left of
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, whose troops have waged a months-long
campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians, who make up 95
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts, yet to bear
fruit, to negotiate peace, even as NATO members move forward with
contingency plans to use military force if necessary to prevent the
conflict from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces other international challenges, including trying
to prevent the troubles in Asia from dragging down the global
economy, struggling to breathe life into the staggering Middle East
peace process and helping to prevent the Russian economy from going
down the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional challenges and international ills are not unique
to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidents are never in control of their own agenda,'' said
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center. ''Seldom in American
history have presidents dominated the Congress and, especially in
periods of divided government, it's always a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has to deal with that others haven't, though, is
the daily deluge of proceedings and pronouncements from Starr's
investigation, which has generated thousands of hours of television
commentary, acres of newsprint and a sprawling scandal that has
distanced Clinton from the news media, throttling one engine of
influence he had formerly used to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question but that his position is dramatically
weaker now than it was at the beginning of January,'' said Mann.
''This whole Lewinsky-Starr matter has certainly hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's own image took a hit last week, when U.S. District Judge
James Robertson threw out tax evasion charges Starr had filed
against longtime Clinton friend and former Associate Attorney
General Webster Hubbell, claiming that Starr had exceeded his
authority and violated previous immunity guarantees granted to
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a Clinton appointee, railed at Starr, accusing him of
using his subpoena power to pry documents from Hubbell as part of
''a quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling gave teeth to the claims of Clinton defenders such as
Begala, who have long maintained that Starr's investigation is less
about justice than about derailing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the goal, maybe the entire goal, is to distract him,''
said Begala, who insisted that he and his White House colleagues
have been ''roped off'' from the Lewinsky matter and are focused on
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm not going to lie to you, it certainly can be
distracting,'' Begala said. ''It's maybe a sad commentary, but one
thing we've become quite good at is this phrase,
'compartmentalizing, carry on regardless.' We've got vast
experience with that.''

CHANGES DON'T CATCH CALIPARI BY SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Calipari returned from a vacation with his family late
Thursday night, finding the Nets' world far different from when he
left.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he went to the Nets' practice facility and
found the place deserted. The players were locked out, unable to
use anything owned by the team.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices, he found new faces. The owners-to-be were
completing the details for a friendly takeover.
</P>
<P>
   And the newspapers were filled with stories of the new owners'
plans to move to a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were not a surprise to Calipari, who had sat down to
breakfast with the new owners, Stan Gale and Finn Wentworth, before
he left. And none of the changes seem likely to change Calipari's
statement that he will not exercise an escape clause after the
coming season, as long as the organization is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was them letting me know they want me here,''
Calipari said. ``What the out in the contract does _ it's good I
have it, isn't it? If the things weren't right, it's a nice thing
to have sitting there. But they have given me every indication that
they want me to run the basketball operations, make the draft
picks, decide on trades and tell them who I want on my team. It'll
be the same, but these guys want to do things in a big way, which
excites me.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari believes that the deeper pockets of the new ownership
group will help the team, not only by putting the team in a new
arena _ their preference is in Newark _ but also by being able to
pay the salaries that will be due the Nets' growing talent. Jayson
Williams and Sherman Douglas are free agents now, and in the next
two years, Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn will need new deals,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be true of Calipari, who, one Nets official
predicted, will use his escape clause to at least push for a
contract extension that will raise the salary on his five-year, $15
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been this way,'' Calipari said. ``When I was at
UMass, people would call me about jobs. I would say, `If you can
make the job you're in the next job, why leave?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In my career in the National Basketball Association, I want to
coach a championship team. You say, `Can I do it here or do I have
to go somewhere else?' But all of a sudden things have changed here
in New Jersey. Can this be the next job? Yes, it can.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari said he expects to sit down again with the owners now
that the sale has been agreed to. His wish list includes a team
plane, a raise in salary for the assistant coach Don Casey _ to
whom the Detroit Pistons have offered a two-year contract to become
the top assistant to Alvin Gentry _ and the ability to pay for the
players he needs.
</P>
<P>
   It pained him to see the Nets lose out on Marcus Camby when
Toronto sent him to New York, but the Raptors, aware of Calipari's
fondness for Camby from their days together at UMass, tried to hold
the Nets up, asking for Sam Cassell in return.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari may still make some moves, but since none are permitted
during the lockout, he will have to settle for planning a new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big project,'' Calipari said. ``It's a lot for people
to swallow. But the Performing Arts Center in Newark was too much
for most people, and look at it. If this can be done in Cleveland,
why not New Jersey?''

 &HT;    CHINA TRIUMPH BEHIND HIM, CLINTON FACES TOUGHER FIGHTS AT HOME
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 5
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Still dealing with jet lag after a nine-day China
tour, President Clinton returns to the Oval Office on Monday to
face partisan squabbles and policy headaches that may well leave
him nostalgic for the Middle Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Awed by ancient wonders, inspired by the promise of change and
buoyed by having carried a message of freedom and hope to 1.2
billion Chinese, Clinton would like to use the momentum of his
historic state visit to help reinvigorate a troubled domestic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But as he tries to advance a slate of bread-and-butter issues
ranging from child care tax credits to a minimum wage increase,
Clinton returns to a White House under siege by influences largely
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress is spoiling for showdowns over tax
cuts, education spending and health care to help highlight their
political differences with Democrats before November, when all 435
members of the House and a third of the Senate will be up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a long list of foreign policy matters demands
Clinton's attention. They include ethnic fighting in the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, the continuing economic crisis in
Asia and the growing risk of instability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's inquiry, now in
its sixth month, into whether Clinton had an affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky then later urged her to lie
about it under oath, allegations the president has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all that the coming dog days of August _when Congress
will be in recess for almost the entire month _ and it's clear it
won't be easy for Clinton to translate his China successes into
political victories at home. He could be hard-pressed to simply
keep his domestic objectives alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll come back reinvigorated,'' said analyst Erwin Hargrove,
who teaches political science at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, but in trying to score points domestically, ''foreign
trips don't help much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly lifted by his China tour, which gave him
unexpected opportunities to showcase his rhetorical gifts before
the largest audience in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So remarkable were Clinton's performances during a
nationally-televised press conference from Beijing with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, a televised give-and-take with students at
Beijing University and a live radio call-in show in Shanghai that
even some of his harshest critics were forced to acknowledge his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if you reach out to a billion people and talk about
open markets and expand the zone of freedom on the planet, that's a
pretty good investment for the world,'' House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., said Wednesday at a Republican Party fund-raising
event in San Antonio. As an advocate for increased liberties for
the repressed Chinese, Gingrich said, Clinton did a ''good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Praising Clinton, however, seems an easy habit to break in this
town, particularly for Republicans fighting to maintain control of
both houses of Congress come Nov. 3. Many will try to do so largely
by differentiating themselves from Clinton's priorities, beginning
as soon as the Senate returns from its mid-summer break on Monday,
and the House on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to cooperate (with Clinton) on anything,''
predicted Hargrove, author of the just-published book ''The
President as Leader: Appealing to the Better Angels of our
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the political firmament, at least, it's a season when halos
are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists, as well as many Republicans, were
stunned last month when Senate Republicans killed an omnibus
tobacco bill that would have raised cigarette taxes by some $60
billion a year and hit the industry with comprehensive regulations
aimed at ending marketing efforts that target teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was counting on the increased revenues to fund at least
a third of his proposals for beefing up Head Start preschool
programs for poor children, increasing child care subsidies for
low-income families and expanding medical research, among other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to use the cash to finance a new cut in
the capital gains tax on profits from the sale of property, stocks
or other investments, as well as tax-free savings accounts of up to
$2,000 a year to fund a child's education.
</P>
<P>
   With or without a tobacco bill _ the House is working on a
stripped-down version _ Clinton still wants his spending increases,
and Republicans still want their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has opposed both the proposed tax cuts _ he could be
forced into a veto showdown as early as this week over the
education savings accounts, proposed by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
_ saying the breaks favor wealthy Americans over low-income and
middle-class workers and threaten efforts to keep the federal
budget in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years into the greatest U.S. economic expansion in
history, the federal government is only now beginning to balance
its budget, after three decades of deficit spending that has left
the country $5.5 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Before rushing to cut taxes, Clinton insists, any surplus
revenues _ projected to top $40 billion this year _ should be set
aside to help shore up Social Security. The national retirement
insurance program will begin paying out more than it takes in when
Baby Boomers begin leaving the workforce in the year 2010, and its
reserves could be depleted by 2032 under current projections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to avoid politicizing the explosive issue between
now and Election Day, and has proposed taking it up as a national
priority early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, have asked him to
name a bipartisan commission to make recommendations much sooner, a
plan Clinton has thus far resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Even without control of Congress, Clinton is hardly without
resources on Capitol Hill. Much as he went around China's
repressive leadership in Beijing to take his message directly to
the people of China, he's been formidably effective at taking his
campaign directly to the American people, 61 percent of whom still
regard him favorably, according to a June 7 Gallup/CNN/USA Today
poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the best features of the presidency is the bully
pulpit,'' White House political counselor Paul Begala said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this year will be either progress or
partisanship, and that really is up to the Republican leadership,''
said Begala. ''I think they're going to either move on the
president's agenda or wish to goodness they had, come November.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Political equations aside, Clinton also faces the prospect of a
deepening security crisis in Kosovo, a province of what's left of
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, whose troops have waged a months-long
campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians, who make up 95
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts, yet to bear
fruit, to negotiate peace, even as NATO members move forward with
contingency plans to use military force if necessary to prevent the
conflict from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces other international challenges, including trying
to prevent the troubles in Asia from dragging down the global
economy, struggling to breathe life into the staggering Middle East
peace process and helping to prevent the Russian economy from going
down the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional challenges and international ills are not unique
to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidents are never in control of their own agenda,'' said
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center. ''Seldom in American
history have presidents dominated the Congress and, especially in
periods of divided government, it's always a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has to deal with that others haven't, though, is
the daily deluge of proceedings and pronouncements from Starr's
investigation, which has generated thousands of hours of television
commentary, acres of newsprint and a sprawling scandal that has
distanced Clinton from the news media, throttling one engine of
influence he had formerly used to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question but that his position is dramatically
weaker now than it was at the beginning of January,'' said Mann.
''This whole Lewinsky-Starr matter has certainly hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's own image took a hit last week, when U.S. District Judge
James Robertson threw out tax evasion charges Starr had filed
against longtime Clinton friend and former Associate Attorney
General Webster Hubbell, claiming that Starr had exceeded his
authority and violated previous immunity guarantees granted to
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a Clinton appointee, railed at Starr, accusing him of
using his subpoena power to pry documents from Hubbell as part of
''a quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling gave teeth to the claims of Clinton defenders such as
Begala, who have long maintained that Starr's investigation is less
about justice than about derailing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the goal, maybe the entire goal, is to distract him,''
said Begala, who insisted that he and his White House colleagues
have been ''roped off'' from the Lewinsky matter and are focused on
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm not going to lie to you, it certainly can be
distracting,'' Begala said. ''It's maybe a sad commentary, but one
thing we've become quite good at is this phrase,
'compartmentalizing, carry on regardless.' We've got vast
experience with that.''

 AMERICAN SINGLE SCULLER HOPES TO ROW TO GOLD  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamie Koven rows alone. He is the world champion single sculler
who cherishes his independence, raises his own sponsorship money
and plans his sporting destiny. He hopes the quest will end with a
gold medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Like the heavyweight boxing champion, the No. 1 tennis player or
the top golfer, the world champion sculler is isolated at the
pinnacle of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Not many of the champions have been Americans. The first was
Jack Kelly Sr., a Philadelphia bricklayer and the father of actress
Grace Kelly, in 1920, and the next was Don Spero, a graduate of
Cornell, in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Koven. He is 25, from Green Village, N.J., stands 6
feet 4 inches tall and weighs 205 pounds. He is a Brown University
graduate with a clear head and a quiet determination. He is what
his college coach calls a natural, an athlete who made the
difficult switch from rowing in four-oared and eight-oared crews to
single sculls in a little more than one season.
</P>
<P>
   The singles event is a 2,000-meter sprint that takes about seven
grueling minutes. The sculler faces backward as he propels a
28-pound shell down a straight buoyed lane along with five
competitors whose positions in the other lanes he had best track.
The lead can change several times during the sprint, especially
when rowing into a head wind or a crosswind. Stamina and strength
count, and so does strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Koven won the world championship at Aiguebelette, France, last
year in his first full season as a sculler. He now is competing in
the Henley Royal Regatta in England, where he won his semifinal
round Saturday, beating Ireland's Albert Maher. Koven will face
defending champion Greg Searle of England in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, Koven will race in the third leg of the three-race
Krombacher World Cup circuit in Europe in Lucerne, Switzerland. He
placed first in the initial regatta in Munich, Germany, on May 31,
but then finished ninth in the second event against stronger
competition at Hazewinkel, Belgium, on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Koven no longer is sneaking up on people, as he did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just seemed to come together,'' Koven said of his
world championship season. ``I wasn't pushing for anything. I was
going for the year 2000. My goals were first to try to win the
trials in the U.S. and then maybe make the finals of the worlds. I
train pretty hard. But it was a big surprise to me to win the
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a big surprise all over the sport as Koven came from
behind in most of his major races, rowing against far more
experienced competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jamie accomplished in a single year is really
remarkable,'' said Spero, still a competitive rower in masters
events at 57. ``We've talked on the telephone, mostly about the
transition from sweeps to sculling.''
</P>
<P>
   Koven, like Spero, rowed on four-man and eight-man crews in
school and college. In these events, two hands and arms pull one
oar, and there are teammates to count upon. In sculling, each hand
controls an oar with more sophisticated technique. Thus, sweep
rowing is to sculling what wielding an ax might be to playing a
violin.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Roop, who had been Koven's coach in eight-oared shells at
Brown and remains his coach, said Koven became a sculler almost
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition was nothing to him,'' Roop said. ``He's such a
natural. In other cases, it's not so easy. There are a lot of
people who don't like to row alone. They prefer the dependence upon
others in the boat. They're team players. In singles, there's no
team, just you.''
</P>
<P>
   Roop was the freshman coach at Brown when Koven and several
other talented oarsmen enrolled in 1991. One was Zeno Muller, who
five years later won the gold medal in sculling at the 1996 Summer
Olympics. They were together in Roop's unbeaten freshman eight and
next in the varsity eight in the 1993 season, along with Jamie's
older brother, Gus. That Brown crew won everything it went after
including the intercollegiate championship and the Ladies Plate at
Henley.
</P>
<P>
   In Koven's four seasons at Brown, the boats in which he rowed
lost only twice. He also rowed in the U.S. national eights that won
a bronze in the 1993 world championships; a gold the next year and
then finished a disappointing fifth in the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Muller took a season off from rowing so he was not around to see
Koven's spectacular rise to the top last year. Although he lives in
France and holds Swiss citizenship, Muller remains close friends
with Koven, who is now a rival. They rowed against each another for
the first time in the second World Cup event on June 21, and it was
Muller who finished in first. Muller will also be challenging Koven
at the defense of his crown at the world championships in Cologne,
Germany, Sept. 6-13.
</P>
<P>
   A season of World Cup campaigning costs about $60,000 and Koven
has the help of three sponsors, Beneficial Finance, Crowley
Maritime and Princeton Financial Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley was founded by his grandfather, who was from San
Francisco. He would row out alone from San Francisco Bay to meet
the ships coming into port.
</P>
<P>
   And so there is more to Koven's success than just hard training.
There is inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said.

`FILLER' PLAYER FINDS SPOT IN METS' PEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was a little gallows humor going round the
bullpen at Class AAA Norfolk earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the extra man the Mets had in their bullpen, we felt this
might be the year no one was called up out of our pen,'' said the
right-hander Jeff Tam, of his diminishing dreams of displacing the
12th pitcher the Mets had carried for most of this season. ``Coming
out of spring training, it was supposed to be the best bullpen in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   That has obviously not been the case. The Mets' bullpen, with
the exception of closer John Franco and set-up man Dennis Cook,
both left-handers, has struggled more often than not. And not only
was Tam's contract purchased from Norfolk on June 27, when Al
Leiter was placed on the disabled list, but the 27-year-old Tam
currently has the lowest earned run average on the team: 0.00.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the former replacement player has only pitched four
innings. But Tam, who signed out of Florida State as a nondrafted
free agent in 1993, has yet to allow a run in his first stint as a
major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a self-described ``filler,'' someone who fills out a
minor league roster with more highly regarded players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee I was a filler for the longest time,'' said Tam,
who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during his
senior season at Florida State. Then, after saving 34 games in
Class A ball in 1994, Tam blew out the anterior cruciate ligament
in his right knee during the first week of the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tam had moderate success at Norfolk, going 7-5 with a
4.67 earned run average and six saves in 40 appearances, 11 of
which were starts. Over the winter in Venezuela, he refined a
split-finger fastball to add to his sinking fastball and slider.
And at Norfolk this season, Tam was 2-2 with five saves and a 1.82
ERA in 32 appearances, all in relief, with just four walks in 49
1/3 innings as Derek Wallace's set-up man.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Tam tossed two scoreless innings of relief in a
3-2 loss to the Braves. His streak of scoreless innings in the
majors is now four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could change tomorrow, it could change tonight,'' said Tam.
But right now, he is the most effective right-hander in the Mets'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Longest Fourth of July
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets were in Atlanta on the Fourth of July,
there were a lot of angry residents in Fulton County, who were
awakened from their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1985. Seven hours, 46 hits, 29 runs, 19 innings _
and one memorable home run by Atlanta's Rick Camp in the bottom of
the 18th inning _ ended an improbable 16-13 Mets victory. The first
pitch was thrown on a Thursday night, Independence Day, and the
Braves finally succumbed at 3:55 a.m. on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   The game actually took 6 hours 10 minutes to complete. There was
also a 41-minute rain delay during the game and a 1-hour-24-minute
delay before it even began. Tom Gorman was the winning pitcher,
despite allowing a two-strike home run to Camp, a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied for five runs in the top of the 19th, before
Ron Darling, who was making his first appearance in relief since
his freshman year at Yale, picked up the save by striking out Camp
with two men on base after the Braves had rallied for two more runs
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the greatest game ever played,'' Mets' third baseman
Howard Johnson said afterward. ``Ever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The current Mets first-base coach, Mookie Wilson, missed it. He
was back in New York, recuperating from a shoulder injury. Randy
Niemann, now the Mets' bullpen coach, had pitched at Class AAA
Tidewater that night, worked out after the game, went out after his
workout, arrived back home at around 3:30 a.m. _ and put the game
on television, thinking it was a replay.
</P>
<P>
   And then, at 4:01 a.m., the fireworks came. There were about
8,000 people in the stands at the time. The game had been sold out,
with 44,947 in the stands at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium when it
began. By midnight, however, people began filing out while some
other spectators filed in for free in the late, late innings when
they heard the game was still going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough thing about it,'' Bruce Benedict, then the Braves'
catcher, now the catching coach of the Mets, said at the time, ``is
that there were a lot of lifetime memories in this game and we lost
it. It's hard to put those things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clemente-Like Throw
</P>
<P>
   When Carlos Baerga emerged from the trainer's room late Friday
night, a crowd of reporters huddled around his locker. The Mets'
second baseman immediately knew what they all wanted to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go outside to home plate,'' Baerga said. He wanted to
show the writers what he felt was the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga had been thrown out from left-center field by Andruw
Jones as he tried to score the tying run from second base on a
two-out Brian McRae hit in the top of the eighth inning of what
would become a frustrating 3-2 loss to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' manager Bobby Valentine later said, ``one of the
greatest throws I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' throw _ on the fly _ beat Baerga's head-first slide to
the plate. Baerga did not feel Eddie Perez's tag to his back beat
Baerga's hands to the plate. That is why Baerga argued vehemently
with umpire Greg Bonin.
</P>
<P>
   But Baerga did offer Jones the quintessential compliment that a
ballplayer from Puerto Rico can about a throw from the outfield:
``That was a Roberto Clemente throw.''

REACHING NEW HEIGHTS IN PARENTING ACTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)  
 By KEVIN McMURRAY    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents feel a mixture of awe and pride watching their offspring
progress from a crawl to a walk. It is one of those priceless
charms of parenthood. Imagine then what I felt, tethered by a rope
to my 10-year-old daughter, as I watched her meticulously advance
up a near-vertical slab of granite several hundred feet above the
ground. So it goes, rock climbing in New Hampshire, family style.
</P>
<P>
   Rock climbing is what brought us to North Conway, a New England
hamlet tucked away in the White Mountains of northern New
Hampshire. On Main Street in the heart of the village, the Eastern
Mountain Sport Climbing School faces two towering peaks, called
White Horse and Cathedral, which have been drawing climbers to the
area for decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to Joe Lentini, the school's director, White Horse and
Cathedral are popular not only because of their lofty heights _ 900
and 500 feet respectively _ but also because of the quality of the
rock that was scrubbed clean when a glacier bulldozed its way
through here carving out the Saco River Valley about 12,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing, a fringe sport just a few short years ago, is
experiencing a boom in America and Europe. Children are nagging
their parents to take them climbing. Lentini says his school has
taken children as young as 5, accompanied by a parent.
</P>
<P>
   After a short drive to the foot of White Horse, my daughter
Kelly and I found ourselves craning our necks up at the precipitous
incline of stone. At 10 a.m., White Horse already had dozens of
climbers clinging to its face, including a detachment of Marines on
a training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Lentini, our climbing instructor for the next two days, had us
lace up our climbing shoes and hike up 80 feet to a perch near the
base of the mountain. It was there that we got our introduction to
rock climbing _ learning about the knots, ropes, anchors, harnesses
and techniques we would need to know to climb this imposing peak.
</P>
<P>
   Joe patiently explained to a noticeably anxious Kelly how all
the equipment worked and how safe the climbing would be. It helps
for children to experience firsthand the safety elements, such as
taking a short fall and being stopped by an anchor point and a few
feet of rope.
</P>
<P>
   We were to climb four pitches, or lengths, of the 229.5-foot
ropes up the mountain and rappel back down. A pretty tall order for
a 10-year-old, but Kelly was itching to make a go of it. Joe led
while I had him on belay, braking and feeding him rope while he
climbed; Kelly followed second. Joe would set anchor points using
various specialized pieces of equipment to hold the rope in the
rock while we made our way up the mountain. Although scratches and
bruises are common with beginners, broken bones are extremely rare,
and fatalities _ at least with reputable climbing schools _ are
unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had no problem with the first two pitches, but with the
incline slowly approaching sharper angles, she began to hug the
rock and cling to it with her hands. As Joe told her it is OK to be
scared and gently urged her to trust herself and the equipment, she
slowly began to rely on her legs to support her in her toe holds. I
dutifully followed, retrieving the anchors and hooking them to my
climbing harness.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later we were sitting on a ledge 370 feet above
where we had started (we passed the Marines along the way). Kelly
beamed with pride as she surveyed the lush mountain panorama,
perched high enough to see soaring hawks in search of prey below
us.
</P>
<P>
   The rappel down frightened Kelly at first. Going backward down a
sheer drop several hundred feet high will do that to you. Joe held
her hand and rappelled down with her. Within seconds, smiles and
laughs replaced worried looks. Rappelling down the mountain
reinforced the safety and reliability of the ropes and hardware
better than any detailed explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Cathedral, although smaller than White Horse, posed
some different challenges. We drove on a park road to the top of
the mountain, then walked to the edge and rappelled down to a ledge
70 feet below. We then traversed to a popular climbing route that
would lead us back to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral is steeper than White Horse, but it has more toe holds
and crevices to use. Kelly found the sharper incline more
intimidating and froze on more than one occasion during the
four-pitch route and the 2{-hour climb to the top. But the previous
day's success on White Horse had instilled the confidence in her
climbing abilities.
</P>
<P>
   I could say a lot about all the obvious _ the bonding of father
and daughter in a shared challenge, witnessing a dramatic step in
the maturity of one's offspring, and enjoying nature's wonders
together. But I think it was the sheer fun of it all and the simple
pleasure of making it to the summit of a mountain with someone you
love that I cherish most.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: The village of North Conway, N.H., is a 2{-hour
drive north of Boston. Take Interstate 95 north to Portsmouth,
N.H., then exit onto the Spaulding Turnpike. The Spaulding Turnpike
eventually becomes Route 4 and then Route 16. Continue on Route 16
to North Conway. Accommodations include: the Cranmore Mountain
Lodge, (800) 356-3596; White Mountain Hotel, (603) 356-7100; the
Nereledge Inn (bed and breakfast), (603) 356-2831; the Farm (B&AMP;B),
(603) 356-2694; White Mountain Hostel, (603) 447-1001.
</P>
<P>
   The EMS Climbing School, (603) 356-5433, offers semiprivate
lessons, Monday through Friday, at $145 a day per person; lessons
on Saturday, Sunday and holidays cost $160 a day per person.
One-on-one private lessons are $180 per day.

NEW METROCARD PASSES AN EARLY HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The line at the Third Street entrance to the West
Fourth Street subway station at 12:01 a.m. Saturday was not as long
as it might have been if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
were selling, say, Spice Girls tickets. In fact, it consisted of
exactly one person, Tony Triche.
</P>
<P>
   But Triche, who had been waiting off to the side for an eternity
of several minutes, was as impatient and devoted as any fan could
be. Finally he approached the token booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I get it now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get it,'' the clerk replied, taking $17 from Triche
and sliding him a pass allowing him to ride the subways and buses
as much as he wanted for the next seven days. ``Congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, thousands of riders had joined Triche in
celebrating the advent of the Metrocard passes, which went on sale
at midnight and offer unlimited rides for $17 for seven days or $63
for 30 days. Christopher Boylan, a deputy executive director of the
authority, said he was pleasantly surprised at the demand,
especially given that it was the middle of a holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Junette Solomon, the token booth clerk at the
Flatbush Avenue station on the No. 2 and 5 line, was ready to
declare the new passes a success by 9:30 a.m. ``I've sold more than
a hundred already,'' she said, adding that the seven-day cards were
selling particularly quickly. At the West 72nd Street station, the
majority of mid-morning customers Saturday were buying the passes.
</P>
<P>
   The passes, which will save money for anyone who makes an
average of at least one round trip per day, had riders dreaming up
reasons to take the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moore, 41, off to his job as a cosmetologist after
buying a weekly pass at West 72nd Street, said he would get his
money's worth from the pass almost immediately: After work, he
planned to head off to a barbecue, return home later in the day and
head out again in the evening, a day of travel that would cost at
least $7.50 if he bought his rides one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   At Times Square, Christopher Edwards, 28, a cameraman for ESPN,
said the pass would open up the city for him. He said he was
contemplating excursions to exotic and unfamiliar places like the
Bronx and Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jacobus, 39, a social worker and full-time student, said as
she bought a monthly pass at the 36th Street Station in Sunset
Park, ``I think it will change my life in a profound way.''
</P>
<P>
   Triche, who is 40 and also lives in Sunset Park, said that the
pass would probably enhance his social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My girlfriend lives in Williamsburg,'' he said, ``so there
won't be a second thought on going over there, because I won't have
to worry about how many times I swipe my card.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuju Yen said that she, too, welcomed the end of having to think
about where she was going and how she would get there. Ms. Yen, 26,
a computer programmer who lives in midtown Manhattan, said that
ever since free bus-to-subway transfers started last year, she had
carefully engineered her trips so that she could take the bus up
and the subway back. Because the transfers were only good for two
hours, she sometimes had to rush to get things done. Those days
were gone, she said as she swiped her new monthly pass through the
Times Square turnstile and whisked her parents off to the Statue of
Liberty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even some people who weren't buying the passes were excited
about them. ``This is great for me,'' said Amy Ridings, 31, as she
watched her husband, John, test out his new pass at West 72nd
Street. ``On the weekends, he usually uses my card. I have to pass
it back to him. I'll have to fill up less now that he has his own
card.''
</P>
<P>
   Day One of the new passes was not without its frustrations. Some
riders were chagrined to learn that unlimited-ride passes were not
truly unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Acosta, 36, of the Tremont section of the Bronx,
chivalrously swiped his girlfriend through with his newly purchased
pass at West Fourth Street, then passed the card through the
scanner again to let himself in, only to find the turnstile would
not budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait 18 minutes,'' another customer informed him _
a feature built into the passes specifically to prevent people from
swiping through several people at once. ``They should have
explained it more clearly,'' Acosta said as he headed back to the
booth to buy a token.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the passes likely to have anything approaching universal
appeal, even among riders who use the system frequently enough to
benefit from them. The same people who have resisted the
electronically encoded Metrocard, even though it already offered an
11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 discount, said they had no plans to
switch now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still going to buy tokens,'' Kristine Olsen declared at
the 36th Street station in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. Ms.
Olsen, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 60 years,
ticked off the situations in which she said a Metrocard would not
work _ power outages, bomb scares. ``There are lots of complaints
with them and little good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some riders who have lived in other big cities _ New York is
the last major city in the country to begin offering transit passes
_ said they wondered what had taken so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes me feel like I'm living in a world-class city,''
Amala Lane, a 40-year-old filmmaker, said at the 125th Street
station along Broadway in Harlem. ``I've been in Berlin, Frankfurt,
Hong Kong and Prague. Hong Kong had these kinds of cards 10 years
ago. Now they're using E-Z Pass. Hello, New York, join the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And while officials are unsure how popular the passes will
eventually become _ the official estimate of 100 million new rides
a year is a very rough guess _ Jill Friedman offered a glimpse into
a possible future. Ms. Friedman, 47, of Park Slope in Brooklyn, is
a token clerk at the Times Square station, and as an employee of
New York City Transit, the MTA subsidiary that runs the buses and
subways, she rides free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I started working for Transit, I drove everywhere,''
she said. ``Now it's like I've forgotten how to drive.''

CIVIL LIBERTARIANS PROTEST CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Using Independence Day to symbolically mark its
continuing battles with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the New York Civil
Liberties Union and other critics who say his administration has
curbed First Amendment rights blocked the steps of City Hall on
Saturday with police-blue barricades saying ``Civil Liberties Line:
Do Not Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is emerging a new New York that is increasingly
authoritarian and repressive,'' said the union's executive
director, Norman Siegel. ``Today we declare our independence from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people showed up for the rally, at which the civil
liberties group spelled out 14 battles it had fought with the
administration on First Amendment issues. Ten of those resulted in
court action, and an organizer said the tally did not include the
many Freedom of Information challenges to the administration by
other public officials and news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the demonstrators were cabdrivers, who had
gone to court in an effort to win the right to demonstrate against
new policies proposed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Birthday, America,'' said Vijay Bali, an organizer of
the United Yellow Cab Drivers Association who emigrated from India
12 years ago. ``This mayor is trying to rob us of our First
Amendment rights. Is that what should be done in this great city?''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, smiling and tieless, ignored the crowd as he left City
Hall on his way to a holiday parade on Staten Island, but waved at
tourists gawking from the adjoining park.
</P>
<P>
   The police and aides to the mayor reacted with restraint. Just a
few officers were on hand, and only one wore a riot helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's communications director, said
Siegel's assertions about the administration's tactics were ``just
an opinion, not based on fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is a better city than it was five years ago, and that
fact stands,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The demonstration was also intended in part to test access to
the steps of City Hall. Giuliani has limited events there to 25
participants. But architecture students working for the
civil-liberties group measured the steps and calculated that they
could hold 432 ``Norman-Siegel-sized people.'' (That would be 5
feet 11, 180 pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a June 19 letter from the New York Civil Liberties
Union to the Police Department, Leonard Koerner, the city's chief
assistant corporation counsel, wrote back four days later saying,
``Since the conference is on a national holiday and a weekend and
will not disrupt a normal workday at City Hall, the city will
authorize between 35 and 50 speakers to participate on July 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining to take ``yes'' for an answer, Siegel's group wrote
back the next day to say that it had not requested permission but
was merely informing the police as a courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that individuals wishing to hold press
conferences on the steps of City Hall need not seek nor obtain the
permission of the city,'' the group wrote.

   FLAFIRE-MAIN _ More than 120,000 people in Flagler, Brevard and

latest state figures. Some were allowed back in, but many
communities were virtual ghost towns early Saturday. Flagler County
Sheriff Robert McCarthy said Saturday morning that officials were

percent of the county.(Moffett, Palm Beach Post)

   FLAFIRE-FIGHTERS _ ORMOND BEACH, Fla. _ Somehow through the
smoke, helicopter pilot Ray Speights spots a fluorescent orange
flag tied to a 10-foot pole that firefighter Chris Edwards waves.
He pulls a lever and dumps the water directly on the spot Edwards
marked. ``He used to fly in Vietnam and he says it's just like that
fighting a fire,'' said Edwards's partner Michelle Christiansen, a

   FLAFIRE-SCIENCE _ The answer to why Florida keeps burning is
below our feet and above our heads. Slash pines, with needles that
decompose slowly, longleaf pines and others pack flammable resin
and have air between needles that allow them to burn quick and hot.
Some get so hot neighboring trees ``will just kind of explode. It
will turn red and blow up into flames,'' said Greg Thayer, fire
information officer for the Florida Unified Command. Below, brush
is even more volatile. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post)

   SCHOOLBUS-ADS _ The 12 yellow school buses of the Fabens
Independent School District, one of Texas's poorest, now bear
McDonald's, Coca Cola, American Airlines and other ads. And thanks
to the ad revenue, the buses carry two-way radios and flashing red
stop signs that unfold into traffic when children board or exit.
Some think the ads detract from safety, though. (Austin

   RICFLAIR-LAWSUIT _ Nature Boy is big and brash, rude and crude,
an icon of the most ridiculously theatrical ``sport'' in the world,
big-time wrestling. His off-stage altar-ego, Ric Flair, looks like
any well-off suburban dad, in his Ralph Lauren golf clothes, Rolex
and Mercedes sedan. The duality is instructive. Ric Flair, one of
big-time wrestling's most enduring and famous stars for 25 years,
is at the center of a Fulton County Superior Court lawsuit.
Turner-owned World Championship Wrestling says Flair broke their $2
million, three-year contract by refusing to appear at events this
year. Flair says he's not been treated with the respect he deserves
as the ``Babe Ruth'' of wrestling. (Croft, Atlanta

got while constantly working around pipes and boilers coated with

YANKEES ROLL ON, 4-3 OVER ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On his first Fourth of July since defecting from
Cuba, Orlando Hernandez celebrated his own independence by pitching
eight innings and beating the Baltimore Orioles, 4-3, and
propelling the seemingly unbeatable Yankees into the record books.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees became only the third team in the 20th century _ and
the first American League team _ to win 60 of their first 80 games
in a season, joining the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates and the 1907
Chicago Cubs. The Yankees have won five in a row, while the
Orioles, baseball's most shocking disappointment, have lost 10 of
their last 11.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (3-1) finished strongly, after struggling in the early
innings, facing the minimum three hitters in the sixth, seventh and
eighth innings; opposing teams are batting just .217 in innings
five to eight since he joined the Yankees. He walked two, struck
out six and gave up only six hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees survived a scare in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera relieved Hernandez for the ninth inning, and
after Cal Ripken fell behind no balls and two strikes, he bounced a
single through the middle; Jeff Reboulet pinch-ran for Ripken, as
the potential tying run. When Brady Anderson smashed a single past
second baseman Luis Sojo, to right field, Reboulet got a poor jump
and had to stop at second, rather than advance to third.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hoiles, in an attempt to bunt the runners along, hit the
ball to the third base side, where Rivera fielded it and threw to
third. Scott Brosius dropped the throw _ but Marty Foster, the
third base umpire, called out Reboulet, saying Brosius had merely
fumbled the ball trying to lift the ball out of his glove. The
Orioles argued, and both third base coach Sam Perlozzo and manager
Ray Miller were ejected. Eddie Murray, the Baltimore coach, and
Ripken both implored other umpires to overrule the call.
</P>
<P>
   But the play stood and after play resumed, Rich Becker hit into
a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Drabek carried an earned run average of 7.12 into
Saturday's game, but he nonetheless shackled the Yankees early,
pitching out of trouble, and he was in a position to win after
Baltimore scored a run in the fifth and moved ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Tino Martinez, his six-week slump becoming a memory instead
of an albatross, banged a double against the wall in center field,
and when Tim Raines singled to left, Martinez stopped at third.
Alan Mills relieved Rhodes; after Jorge Posada walked to load the
bases, Chad Curtis bounced a hit past the lunge of Baltimore
shortstop Mike Bordick, and both Martinez and Raines scored.
Yankees 4, Orioles 3.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last Sunday evening, Greg Maddux and a friend watched Hernandez
pitch against the Mets on television, at Maddux's home. This guy
really knows what he's doing, Maddux told his friend, describing
how Hernandez possesses a terrific feel for pitching, for
identifying a hitter's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Before each of Hernandez's next 10 pitches, Atlanta's four-time
Cy Young Award winner said aloud what he would throw and where he
would throw it, and Hernandez threw exactly what Maddux said he
would've thrown. See, Maddux said wryly, the guy really knows what
he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez stubbornly insists on pitching the way he wants to
pitch, controlling everything that goes on when he's on the mound.
He and Jorge Posada, who has been his catcher, have disagreed
several times on what pitch to throw to a certain batter, and El
Duque, as Hernandez is known, has even demanded that Posada use
certain fingers to indicate certain pitches _ a trivial matter to
most, a matter of extraordinary importance to Hernandez, so long as
it involves any aspect of his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   His stubborn refusal to give in to hitters got him into trouble
in the early innings Saturday. Posada has implored him to be more
aggressive, to throw more fastballs and throw them over the plate.
But Hernandez would rather work on the fringes, nibbling, taking a
little off, never really challenging hitters. The Orioles patiently
waited him out: Of the first eight batters he faced, he threw a
first-pitch ball to seven, and went to two-ball counts with nine of
the first 14 hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar pulled a double down the right field line to lead
off, and B.J. Surhoff walked, after getting ahead in the count 3-0,
and both runners advanced, to third and second, respectively, on a
passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   In trouble, Hernandez bore down _ something he does very well _
and struck out Eric Davis on four pitches. El Duque intentionally
walked Rafael Palmeiro, loading the bases, so he could face the
right-handed hitting Cal Ripken. Hernandez went to a 2-2 count
before spinning a slider away, out of the strike zone, that Ripken
chased unsuccessfully; strike three.
</P>
<P>
   But Brady Anderson slapped a curveball over shortstop for a
two-run single, salvaging the inning for the Orioles. It was only
the sixth hit against Hernandez in 35 attempts with runners in
scoring position since he ascended to the big leagues. Hernandez
threw a whopping 33 pitches in the first inning, and had 66 after
just four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took advantage of the weak throwing arm of Baltimore
catcher Chris Hoiles in the first inning, and would keep
challenging him all day. Derek Jeter opened the first with a
single, stole second and eventually scored on a line single by Tino
Martinez. The Yankees tied the score at two-all in the second
inning, Ricky Ledee smashing a double off the center field wall,
then scoring on Jeter's second hit of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore snapped the tie in the fifth, with Davis slapping a
run-scoring single through the left side of the infield. These
days, however, the Orioles probably believe everything is going to
go wrong, the Yankees assume everything will go right. Both sides
turned out to be right.

CLINTON'S VISIT TO CHINA TIES PROSPERITY TO PERSONAL FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: This Independence Day is particularly significant in
light of how President Clinton's historic trip to China has
re-emphasized the symbiosis of political freedom and economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible reason for the president's China expedition was
to exert moral suasion to encourage a kinder and gentler approach
to governance and international relations. Clinton's strategic
approach, however, focused on the economic rewards China could
expect to reap by liberalizing the way it conducts its political
business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton never would have risked so much of his own
political capital by visiting China unless he was convinced that
overwhelming U.S. economic self-interest also was at stake. Thus,
the subliminal theme of the exercise seemed to be that political
and economic freedom go hand in hand and prosperity isn't possible
without personal liberty.
</P>
<P>
   This is the great universal truism of humankind's existence. The
best recent example of why the impoverishing nature of
authoritarian government cannot endure was the disintegration of
the former Soviet Union and its communist-style socialism. As
Soviet citizens came to learn how much better relatively free
people lived, it was only a matter of time until the system's
political center collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As an essay in Investor's Business Daily pointed out recently,
the purpose of economic activity is to provide opportunities for
exchange in pursuit of material well-being. Such activity is by its
nature individualistic and its success depends on personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with authoritarian and totalitarian governments is
that they deprive individuals of the freedom to pursue their
self-interest by making spontaneous economic exchanges at will.
Instead, a relatively few powerful bureaucrats assume the power to
make generalized economic decisions for the many. Those decisions
always are made to serve the interests of the powerful few and
their power is the coin of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   The authoritarian can't abide economic freedom because it
invariably leads to political freedom. This is why impoverished
totalitarian regimes such as North Korea and Cuba must go to
excruciating lengths to keep outside reality from making itself
known.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders seem to understand that such isolation is
possible only with small areas and populations and that Beijing
can't duplicate it without risking the same fate that befell the
Soviet Union. Thus, China's search now is for a middle ground that
will allow retention of as much authoritarian power as possible
while advancing economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   China's invitation to Clinton was a risk for its leaders, too,
but one they had to take. China can't prosper without expanding its
global economic options, and its leaders probably can't retain
power without achieving prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel laureate Milton Friedman understands the interdependence
of political and economic freedom better than most economists.
Friedman and his wife, Rose, have just completed their memoirs, Two
Lucky People, in which they reaffirm their lifelong commitment to
``the promotion of human freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to predict how much the president's visit will
advance the cause of political and economic freedom in China. It
did make an important contribution, though, because it set the
stage for a new era in political and economic relations between the
two countries.

PRIVATE'S POETRY REVEALS EMOTIONS AND IMAGES OF WORLD WAR I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HOLLINGSWORTH  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The verse, scratched in pencil 80 years ago,
has faded, but the images that rise from the words are still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Back with the teams, back to the rear,
</P>
<P>
   Driver and horse, not wanted here...
</P>
<P>
   Soon a shell bursts, two drivers reel,
</P>
<P>
   Two saddles bar, swing and wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Written amid the mud and mayhem of World War I, the words George
Hamby stored in a little green journal are a mix of the high-minded
patriotism of the day and the gripes of a 20-year private about
army life.
</P>
<P>
   Hamby didn't have a high school diploma, and some of his lines
don't rhyme, but he clearly had the heart of a poet. He filled page
after page of grid paper with the emotions and images of the
conflict around him.
</P>
<P>
   All that might have died with him two years ago, but his
companion, Bessie Hines, decided to show the journal to The Kansas
City Star. It might make a good Fourth of July item, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamby returned from France, she said, settled in Independence
and became a welder. There is no evidence that he ever wrote
another lyric in his life.
</P>
<P>
   His six long poems described the ``hell'' of war, the German
shells and fronts he fought on. He wrote proudly of his ``brave
comrades'' of E Battery, part of the 35th Division, the same
division in which a future president named Harry Truman served.
</P>
<P>
   A soldier's gripes also came through in the poetry _ too many
bugs and too little good food, such as when he complains about the
``belly rubbers convention.''
</P>
<P>
   It's composed of a mess sergeant and a cook or two,
</P>
<P>
   Who could stand a few lessons about making a stew,
</P>
<P>
   They draw butter and jam, which they put on the shelve,
</P>
<P>
   They don't put it out for they eat it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, soldiers commonly wrote letters or poetry, as
Hamby did, to reflect on the pains and more amusing points of Army
life, said Doran Cart, director and curator of the Liberty Memorial
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these fellows, especially the Americans, had never
left home before, and they were in France in the World War,'' Cart
said. ``They were seeking some way of expressing what they were
going through, what they were thinking and hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other 27,500 soldiers from Missouri and Kansas
who went to France with the 35th Division, Hamby risked his life
before he had much of a chance to live it.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he had said goodbye to family, friends and a fiancee and
joined up for the ``war to end all wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Slip of a boy, little but true,
</P>
<P>
   Trained half a year, fighting for you,
</P>
<P>
   Light as a twig, not twenty-one,
</P>
<P>
   But fitted to drive in the lead of the gun.
</P>
<P>
   He turned 20 a month before his first battle. In late September
1918, his division, as part of the American First Army, headed into
battle between the Meuse River and Argonne Forest in France. A
victory would take away the Germans' control of a railroad line on
which they received vital supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the 26th,
</P>
<P>
   About four twenty-five,
</P>
<P>
   Hell broke loose up in the hills,
</P>
<P>
   Then they began the drive.
</P>
<P>
   For three long hours we shelled them,
</P>
<P>
   Without a single stop,
</P>
<P>
   Our dough boys awaited a given hour,
</P>
<P>
   And poured out over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamby later would talk about pushing the artillery pieces into
firing position, Hines said. He also recalled delivering messages
between outfits, including one trip when a shell killed the horse
he was riding but left him uninjured. Another time, he recounted:
</P>
<P>
   At two we were silently eating,
</P>
<P>
   Out there in the slimy mud,
</P>
<P>
   When the silence was suddenly broken,
</P>
<P>
   By the falling of a dud,
</P>
<P>
   For the benefit of the ignorant,
</P>
<P>
   I'll try and explain a bit,
</P>
<P>
   A dud is only a german shell,
</P>
<P>
   With the hell taken out of it.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 1918, the 35th Division was relieved and placed in
reserve because of casualties of up to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The division re-entered the front line weeks later, not far from
the bloody fields of Verdun, ``on the front that was known to be
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Our next advance was the same as usual,
</P>
<P>
   We had them on the run,
</P>
<P>
   What else was there for them to do,
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hell had come,
</P>
<P>
   On November the 10th it wasn't so bad,
</P>
<P>
   And not so good at that,
</P>
<P>
   But for every one the Huns sent over,
</P>
<P>
   We sent them eleven back.
</P>
<P>
   The next day was the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming home to Independence, Hamby collected the names
and addresses of soldiers who lived in the Midwest, especially in
the Kansas City area. He listed them at the end of his journal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamby never married the girl he left when he went to war. She
died of influenza while he was away.
</P>
<P>
   A steelworker and welder for 35 years, he outlived two wives and
never had children. Hamby died in 1995 at age 97 and was buried
with a military funeral at Green Lawn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, his companion until his death, said Hamby would captivate
people, especially younger generations, with his stories of how he
shook hands with the Germans at the end of the war and how deep he
would sink into the shell-churned mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could really tell those tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines, 82, said Hamby came across his poems one day and gave
them to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was funny that he could sit in that foxhole and
write those poems about the war,'' she said. ``When I read it, I
said, `How could you write that sitting in a foxhole, men dying all
around you?' And he said, `Well, I did it.'''

sunbathing in the yard, no more lunch on the back deck, and moving
the barbecue to the garage. While the birds have not harmed the
O'Byrnes' three horses, four dogs, several cats or their goat,
their constant presence means the family spends a good deal of time
scraping bird droppings and sweeping regurgitated scraps off their
porch. (Richard Harbus/New York Times Photo)

Carol Ann and Dan O'Byrne, with some of the turkey vultures and
black vultures that have settled on their two acres in Gardiner.
Unable to scare the birds off, the O'Byrne's are now waiting for an
application to request a depredation permit that would allow them
to shoot a few birds while setting off a host of pyrotechnics, on
the assumption that the birds will associate the sound with the
death and fly off for good. (Richard Harbus/New York Times Photo)

parades and cookouts and fireworks, some had opinions to share
about Clinton's trip to China. Allison had doubts about Beijing's
leaders. ``The Chinese can say what they want,''he says, ``but how
do we trust them?'' (Randy Squires/New York Times Photo)

Midwesterners were mostly thinking about parades and cookouts and
fireworks. But the president's foray into China does appear to have
made the radar screen, though Ted Applegate, a local power plant
employee, says he's ``on the fence on this whole China thing.''

Hillel Bodek commands high fees and works long hours evaluating
defendants. But he is also something of a judicial handyman who is
appointed by judges to do almost anything that needs doing to
hasten the process of justice and see that the system works as it
is intended to. Bodek's compensation easily qualifies him as one of
the highest-paid social workers in America. Last year, he earned
$314,000 (about $60,000 of which went to expenses), grudgingly paid
by the city. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)

view down Broad Street in Newark, which has been a national symbol
of urban decay since the riots in 1967. The city has benefited from
the real estate boom in Manhattan and its suburbs, where yearly
office rents run as high as $60 a square foot. ``Newark is the best
value in the tristate area,''says Arthur Stern, chairman of
Cogswell Realty Group. ``Occupancy costs are one-third cheaper than
in Jersey City, and it's got the best transportation in the
region.'' (Richard Harbus/New York Times Photo)

reunion, as many as 20,000 men, women and children may be camping
out in tents, tepees or under the stars. They gather in the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, just west of this two-stoplight
town near the New Mexico border, to tune in love and to tune out
what some Rainbow members call Babylon, the outside world of stock
markets, guns, wars and drug tests. (Monica Almeida/New York Times

PATRIOTS SEEKING CAMP FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 FBN-NFLNOTES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Nick Cafardo 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's little football activity at Foxboro Stadium these summer
days, except for Patriots vice president of business operations
Andy Wasynczuk trying to sign the team's draft picks prior to the
start of training camp at Smithfield, R.I., July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have already devised their schedules for the camp, which
will be run similar to last year. Players will go through a morning
workout and then a less intense afternoon practice without pads.
There may be more times this year than last when players will wear
pads during both sessions, because Pete Carroll and the assistant
coaches want to get a better reading on key unproven players such
as Robert Edwards, the running back-elect; highly touted Tebucky
Jones, who is supposed to be an aggressive bump-and-run corner, and
Tony Gaiter, the young potential kick and punt returner who looks
great in the no-pad minicamps, but has to prove he can play when
the going gets tougher.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus of the camp will be on four areas: finding a
No. 1 running back; watching Terry Glenn's attempt to replicate his
rookie season of 1996; Jones's attempt to make the conversion to
corner after one year of playing strong safety at Syracuse, and
finding a big-play replacement for Dave Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   It is these questions that have some prognosticators already
predicting the Patriots to finish as low as third in the AFC East,
behind Miami and New York.
</P>
<P>
   They see that the team lost Curtis Martin to the Jets and are
now in the process of having to rely on Edwards, their No. 1 pick
from the University of Georgia, or second-year player Sedrick Shaw,
a third-rounder from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' brass liked what they saw of Edwards at the
minicamps, but all agreed that the assessment was hollow
considering Edwards wasn't in pads, and no 260-pound middle
linebacker was hitting him head-on or attempting to strip the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The knock on Edwards is that he is fumble-prone and a bit
injury-prone. Those were the same two knocks on third-round pick
Martin, when he came out of the University of Pittsburgh four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are realistic about what Edwards can give them.
They don't expect a 1,400-yard season, but they do expect enough
production to give them at least the threat of a running game to
take some of the pressure off Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to get it from two or three guys, we'll do it that
way,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Does he really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   He'd love for Edwards to take the job, become the AFC's rookie
of the year, and make everyone forget Martin. While the experts and
Patriots fans fret about the loss of Martin, it's these same fans
that often lamented that the Patriots didn't have an effective
running game with Martin. On third and short, the Patriots often
had to put the football in the air because Martin, who preferred
the East-West style, was stuffed at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Now they hope they can run the ball in third-and-2 situations.
</P>
<P>
   One positive about Edwards, who is more of a downfield runner
than Martin, is that the offensive line may improve its
run-blocking simply because they know where Edwards is going. The
line took a major rap last season because it wasn't opening the
holes for Martin. But the blockers quietly asked, ``Where was
Curtis going?''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Paul Boudreau, who coached the Detroit
Lions' offensive line in the Barry Sanders era, understood this
type of running, but he was never able to institute a proper
blocking scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an East-West runner, it's very difficult,'' said
Boudreau. ``You have to block as you normally would and hope the
runner is given enough space to make something happen. We're going
to do things the same way this year. We really don't know who the
runner is going to be _ and it may be more than one _ so instead of
playing a guessing game, we're just going to do what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Glenn, the receiver said he has made more of a commitment
to conditioning this offseason, which hopefully can help him avoid
the multiple injuries he suffered in '97 that drastically reduced
his playing time and cut his productivity from 90 receptions his
rookie year to 27 last year.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he was committed enough is the question. Reading
between the lines on comments by both strength coach Johnny Parker
and Carroll, it appears they weren't completely convinced of the
receiver's new-found dedication.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of lamenting his loss, Carroll isn't using Glenn as
an excuse anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to Terry,'' said Carroll. ``It's whatever Terry can
give us. I think he knows how we feel about what he means to this
team, and now he has to show what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With Glenn's status up in the air, the Patriots are having a
renewed fondness for Vincent Brisby. Once a favorite target of
Bledsoe, Brisby's injury problems and a seeming lack of interest in
playing had the team thinking of releasing him and his $1.2 million
contract. Brisby even demanded a trade this offseason, but the
Patriots were asking for a second-round draft pick in return and
nothing transpired.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-3-inch Brisby is the big receiver that new
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese likes in his system. Brisby
reminds him of Michael Irvin. And so with Glenn, Shawn Jefferson,
Brisby, Troy Brown, and Brian Stablein, as well as second-round
pick Tony Simmons, a speedster from Wisconsin, the Patriots feel
they have enough depth at the receiver position.
</P>
<P>
   The right corner position is the only spot on the defensive side
of the ball in question, and that's where Jones comes in. Carroll,
whose expertise is the secondary, likes his defensive backs big and
physical, and at 6-2, 220 pounds, Jones fills the bill. The
Patriots feel so strongly about Jones they dealt last year's
starter, Jimmy Hitchcock, to the Minnesota Vikings for a
third-round draft pick. Carroll is also hoping last year's No. 1
pick, Chris Canty, finally takes the job seriously and can
challenge Jones, or at least be an adequate backup. Carroll also
has veteran Steve Israel if Jones isn't quite ready.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the task of replacing Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett's value was that he never fumbled. He always ran up to
catch a punt and never left his team in poor field position, all
traits of a great returner.
</P>
<P>
   He had been slowing as a kick returner, and Derrick Cullors
stepped in and exceled last season.
</P>
<P>
   On punts, Carroll is giving the job to Brown, who had been
Meggett's sidekick on returns for two years before Brown was
re-assigned as Glenn's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   In their dream of dreams, the Patriots would love Gaiter, a
second-year player out of Miami, to emerge. Gaiter, 5-8, 170
pounds, is the quickest player on the roster and he has
unbelievable moves.
</P>
<P>
   The team will likely sign Terry Kirby, or a similar-type player
before training camp, to give them a good third-down back who can
catch.
</P>
<P>
   This camp will also be more of a showcase for the sophomore
players. The Patriots would like to demonstrate that the '96 draft
wasn't the bust some experts think it was. Offensive linemen Ed
Ellis, Scott Rehberg, and Damon Denson will receive significant
playing time. Second-round pick Brandon Mitchell will get to
compete with Mark Wheeler for a starting job in the interior
defensive line. Shaw will get to take snaps with the first team and
hope to prove his stock as a third-round pick. And Canty, who had
two excellent minicamps, is hoping to show he can cover big-time
receivers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And also watch former Northeastern quarterback Jim Murphy. They
love his attitude and leadership skills. If Murphy is someone they
can work with in the future, Tom Tupa may be able to escape
third-quarterback duties and become a full-time punter.
</P>
<P>
   Gash makes mark
</P>
<P>
   No surprise dept.: Sam Gash has already made an instant impact
with the Bills. The players love him, and he's already considered a
team leader . . . Another interesting story in Buffalo is the play
of free agent Rene Ingoglia. The three-time Division 1-AA
All-American, a 5-11, 211-pound running back from the University of
Massachusetts, took snaps with the Bills' second team and even took
snaps with Antowain Smith and the first unit . . . There have been
some conversations between agent Leigh Steinberg and the Cincinnati
Bengals concerning Neil O'Donnell, recently released by the Jets.
The Bengals were talking to Vinny Testaverde, but the Brown family
nixed a deal and he signed with the Jets. The Bengals appear OK at
QB with Jeff Blake and Paul Justin competing for the top job . . .
Jerry Rice still doesn't second-guess his decision to return to the
49ers as quickly as he did last season, when he broke his kneecap
in his first game back. ``I felt that I had done every thing I
could to come back,'' said Rice. ``I felt great. I felt strong.'' .
. . Darren Flutie had thoughts of quitting football and devoting
his time to his real job at Read Sand and Gravel in Rockland, but
he decided to move to Hamilton, Ontario, and play in the Canadian
Football League one more year for the $150,000 CFL maximum . . .
University of Texas running back Ricky Williams left the
Philadelphia Phillies' rookie team in Batavia of the New York-Penn
League this week, but not because he's giving up baseball.
Williams, who could easily be the next Deion Sanders, could be one
of the top two or three players taken in next year's NFL draft. He
was hitting .288 at Batavia, but the center fielder and leadoff
hitter had to return to Texas because strength coach Mac Brown
prefers his players report for conditioning six weeks before
training camp starts. Williams, who is compared to Brian Jordan, an
All-Pro corner with the Atlanta Falcons and now a superstar with
the St. Louis Cardinals, may play both sports, but after the
football season, he'll sit down with his agents at Woolf Associates
to make a decision . . . Yes, that was Max Lane (perhaps a
two-sport guy himself?) throwing World Wrestling Federation
announcer Dok Hendrix off the dock and into the chilly Charles
River outside the Cambridgeside Galleria last Wednesday. The WWF
boys were in town to promote ``Footbrawl,'' an event to benefit the
Patriots' charitable foundation that will be held at Foxboro
Stadium Aug. 8. The Cambridge event was an arm wrestling
competition between WWF owner Vince McMahon and WWF champ ``Stone
Cold'' Steve Austin . . . Bledsoe started the Drew Bledsoe
Foundation two years ago and runs it with his father, Mac. The
foundation basically emphasizes a parenting with dignity program.
``We've put together some videotapes to help teach parents to
communicate more effectively with their children,'' said the
younger Bledsoe. ``Part of it is to teach their children values.
Some of the charities I've been involved in are reactive rather
than proactive. If we can get into homes and families can watch the
videos together, we feel we can solve a lot of problems before they
occur. It's strange when you think that you go through 13 years of
public school (including kindergarten) and nobody educates you on
how to be a parent when really, there's nothing more important in
life than raising your children.'' . . . Aren't you looking forward
to the first collision between Ted Johnson and Martin in the open
field? Martin gave another boring interview on ESPN's ``Up Close''
last week. Yes, among other things, Martin said he'll be at ``120
percent'' for the upcoming season. Sounds like a prime candidate
for John Dennis's Media Wise . . . Patriot rookies attended the
NFL's orientation program in Denver last week. That's where young
players learn about life in the NFL and how to act on and off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Two of a kind? Hardly
</P>
<P>
   Never thought we'd link Bill Walsh and Lawrence Phillips, but
there's a first time for everything. Both used the ``Do you know
who I am?'' line in separate incidents last week. Phillips
allegedly used it a Plantation, Fla., nightclub when he was accused
of punching a woman who refused to dance with him. And Walsh used
it before he was punched in the mouth at a Lake Tahoe casino by a
man who thought Walsh was peaking at a face-down card while he was
playing blackjack. Walsh suffered a swollen lip. He will recover,
but Phillips has some explaining to do. He's now been involved in
four incidents in his two years in the NFL, and he may be wearing
out his welcome in Miami, where even Jimmy Johnson, who tolerates a
lot of nonsense, might have had enough . . . Brett Favre is opening
his second Brett Favre Steakhouse, in Green Bay in October. Favre's
restaurant in Milwaukee has been a huge success. The new place is
located on Brett Favre Path in Green Bay and will feature a
souvenir shop . . . Word is that former Boston College quarterback
Glenn Foley is in great shape and more than ready for any challenge
Testaverde may give him in Jets camp. Foley wants to end all of the
constant references to his fragility . . . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers
keep getting more and more athletic. This week they added to their
already-deep running game by picking up Leeland McElroy on waivers
from the Arizona Cardinals. McElroy, the 32d player taken in the
1996 draft, became expendable when the Cardinals picked up Adrian
Murrell in a deal with the Jets. McElroy gained 729 yards on 224
carries last year and he's also a decent kick returner . . . The
Chiefs signed their No. 1 pick, offensive tackle Victor Riley, to a
five-year deal. The Chiefs have had problems getting their No. 1
picks into camp on time. Last year, tight end Tony Gonzalez missed
10 days, and two years ago, Jerome Woods missed 19 days . . . Go
figure dept: Last year Rocket Ismail turned down $1.2 million from
Jacksonville because he wanted to go to Carolina. He signed for
$900,000. This offseason he drew interest from Philadelphia and
Chicago. He wouldn't talk to Chicago and never really considered
Philadelphia, because he wanted to return to Carolina. He re-signed
for $400,000 and insisted he'll earn incentives that could bring
him to $1.2 million. And he's happy as a clam . . . Wonder how the
Krafts feel about music promoter Don Law saying he'll relocate
Harborlights to the waterfront property in South Boston they
couldn't use to build a stadium? Can't wait to hear Tom Menino and
Stephen Lynch explain this one.

WALKER ON THE OUTS BEFORE LOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-NBANOTES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Peter May 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week before the lockout, the Celtics asked their players to
come into town for workouts. Rick Pitino even hired a shooting
instructor. Not a bad idea for a team that shot 43.4 percent, 25th
in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone showed up. Ron Mercer was excused and Dana
Barros, well, the last thing he needs is to work on his shooting.
But Pervis Ellison attended the session, which also included weight
and conditioning work.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker did not attend, which again called into question
his future in Boston, if for no other reason than his coach is not
pleased about it, and this isn't the first time Walker has declined
to attend a Pitino-initiated voluntary summer event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine is not the easiest guy to deal with (in the
offseason),'' said Pitino. ``Am I upset? No, not really. Am I
disappointed? Yes, I am. On one hand, he's been with me so long now
that he knows what I want. But on the other hand, he's the captain
of this team, and if you're the captain, you should be at these
kinds of things and lead by example. We invited him to come. He
didn't come.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know Walker could have benefited from extra shooting time
with the instructor, having shot 42.3 percent from the field and
64.5 percent from the line. But, for whatever reason, he decided
instead to go to Vancouver for the NBA draft, where he comforted
former Kentucky teammate Nazr Mohammed, a projected top 15 pick who
tumbled all the way to 29. It was then discovered that Walker was
upset at the Celtics for passing on Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not doing himself any good being out in Vancouver with
Nazr,'' Pitino said. ``He's the captain of this team and I'd have
liked for him to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's agent, David Falk, did not return a phone call
inquiring why his client did not show up. However, it was well
known by then that the Celtics were shopping Walker, including an
offer to the Warriors in a multiplayer deal.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Walker passed up voluntary work. He
also passed up an invitation to Pitino's inaugural rookie camp last
summer. Teams cannot force players to participate in summer events.
The season is long enough as it is, which may well have been
Walker's belief. He hasn't missed a game in two years.
</P>
<P>
   But it also says something about the dynamics at work here.
Before the draft, Pitino told the Globe that he was ``90 percent''
certain he could re-sign Walker. (Most of us took that to mean
50/50.) No one knows what the new rules are going to be, but this
situation may already be beyond rules, regulations, and
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Radja on move
</P>
<P>
   Dino Radja is available. The ex-Celtic decided last week to opt
out of his deal with the Greek team Panathinaikos, making him a
free agent. His agent, Marc Fleisher, knows there is interest in
the NBA, but he's not certain what Radja wants to do. ``One thing
we do know is that he probably won't re-sign with Panathinaikos,''
Fleisher said. ``They are not very happy with what he did. He's got
a lot to consider. He's close to his son, who lives in Split
(Croatia), so that might lead him to decide to stay in Europe. But
the money is much better in the NBA and, given the condition of his
knees, he might prefer a long layoff. I don't know which way it's
going to go.'' The calendar might help with the decision. Many
European teams start training camp next month, so if Radja is going
to play overseas, he needs to sign in the next 2-3 weeks. Fleisher
said his big-name NBA client, Vlade Divac, will stay in the NBA and
wait for the lockout to end. ``He may spend a year in Europe at the
end of his career, but right now, the money he would get in Europe
is not even close to what he can make here,'' Fleisher said . . .
Another Panathinaikos expatriate, Dominique Wilkins, has decided he
will not try out for the United States team competing in the World
Championships in Athens. Tryouts begin this week in Chicago with
USA Basketball scrambling to assemble a team after the 12 NBA
players originally selected were removed following their threat not
to participate in the event of a lockout. Wilkins was presumed to
be a leading candidate for the reconfigured team because he did not
play in the NBA last season and still has star appeal, especially
in Europe, where he has played two of the last three years. But
Wilkins decided not to make himself available. ``It was flattering
at first when I found out I was being considered,'' he said, ``but
if I did it, I would look at myself as betraying the NBA players.
And I support what they are trying to do. The more I thought about
it, the more I said to myself, `You can't do that!' I just
couldn't.'' Wilkins played in Italy last season, but said he'd like
to get back into the NBA next season, whenever that is. ``I'll
probably come back,'' he said. ``I had an option (out of his
Italian deal), and I took it so I can do whatever I want to do now.
Europe was fine, but there's nothing like the (NBA). I feel great
and I'm in great shape, so we'll see what happens.'' Wilkins turns
39 in January . . . Wilkins also suggested that it wouldn't be much
fun playing for a US team that isn't fielding its best. USA
Basketball may have trouble finding professionals willing to make
the time commitment. Byron Scott, a teammate of Radja's last year,
also is leaning against participating, according to his agent, who
said Scott has other summer obligations, including some camps and
clinics. And former Notre Dame guard David Rivers, arguably the top
American playing in Europe, has, according to his agent, ``no
intention of trying out.'' The issues for him are the same that
keep most other players away: fear of injury and the rather mundane
matter of compensation _ there is none . . . Even though several
NBA teams that sponsor WNBA franchises have their own team planes,
the women are being told to fly commercial airliners, even with the
added indignity of sitting in coach most of the time. The reason?
The league wants to increase the players' visibility to the public.
If the women were to do what their male counterparts do, they'd
never be seen except on the basketball floor.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson in economics
</P>
<P>
   Pitino on the decision not to pick up the $480,000 option on
Tyus Edney's contract: ``If we're going to try to sign a free agent
_ and that's a big if _ then we need to free up every penny we can.
It's Roster Reduction 1. Also, I don't think we need to have three
guards who are 6 feet and under.'' Regarding one of those guards,
Pitino said he was not concerned about Kenny Anderson's sore knee.
``He has made great strides since the season ended, and he should
be fine. I'm not concerned.'' . . . Several teams held last-ditch
rookie/free agent camps prior to the lockout. One of those was
Phoenix, which had former Celtic Todd Day as a camper. If there's
one coach who can relate to Day's
shoot-first-run-the-right-play-later mentality, it's Danny Ainge.
The Pacers brought in draftee Al Harrington and were pleasantly
surprised to discover he weighed almost 250 pounds. He was listed
in most draft reports as weighing around 230. He told the Pacers he
preferred to play at 240, which is fine with them. Meanwhile,
Indiana president Donnie Walsh said he was not worried that
assistant coach Rick Carlisle might be hotly pursued. ``I'm sure
people will call. They should. Carlisle's a fine coach,'' Walsh
said. ``But I'm not that worried. I know what I've got. I've got
Larry (Bird). He is the one that's delivering the message, and
that's what's important.'' . . . The scuttlebutt around the league
now seems to be that Pitino was so enamored with Dirk Nowitzki that
he tried not only to downplay it, but also that he suggested that
Nowitzki's coach tell one and all that the player was staying in
Europe. One NBA executive said whatever Pitino may have done, it
was worth the chance because Nowitzki looks like a keeper. ``With
the shoulders and the red hair, he reminds me a little of (Bill)
Walton at that age,'' said a general manager. ``You can tell he's
going to fill out, and he already has great hands. The guy he
reminds me of most as a player is probably Danny Manning before he
got hurt. To do all those things at 6-11 is scary.'' Celtics GM
Chris Wallace recalled seeing the famed film of Nowitzki, which has
become the Zapruder film of the NBA. The tape that has everyone
drooling. Wallace said he immediately called Pitino, who was on the
road with the team, and said, ``whatever you're doing, stop. I've
got something you have to see.'' . . . The possibility for
shenanigans this summer is not all that remote, given that teams
are allowed to have a member of their medical staff oversee a
player with a rehabilitative need. Is tendinitis a rehabilitative
need? Back pain? The only qualifer is that any contact has to be at
a neutral location. ``I think the teams understand the basic
concept,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We're not
looking to hurt a player. But they cannot use the team's
facilities.'' . . . The Bulls may be interviewing candidates to
replace Phil Jackson, but the guy GM Jerry Krause is grooming for
the job, we're told, is assistant coach Bill Cartwright . . .
Fleisher's take on reports that Fox and CBS would like to get
involved somehow in pro basketball if the lockout lingers: ``Any
new league needs two things to survive: owners and television. Fox
has both. It could own the league and dispense the franchises (like
the NBA does with the WNBA) and it would have programming.'' This
is also a not-so-subtle tweak at commissioner David Stern, who
awhile back was quoted as saying he'd talk to some of his owners
about getting involved in a new football league, which
hypothetically would be run by the NBA's television
co-conspirators, TNT and NBC, the official network of the Chicago
Bulls . . . Neither Stern nor Granik seemed too worried last week
about the possibility that the union might vote to decertify,
throwing everything into antitrust territory. You may recall the
players voted against decertification three years ago, but this
time around, the result may be different. ``That's a tactic for the
players to get a better deal,'' Stern said. ``The only place for
that deal will be at the bargaining table. The only way out of this
is through negotiations.''

HULL GIVES DALLAS STAR POWER
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-NHLNOTES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Nancy L. Marrapese 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Louis just became a much duller place with the departure of
franchise forward Brett Hull to the Dallas Stars Friday. The
colorful right wing walked away from the Blues, saying it wasn't
the money, it was the fact the team wouldn't give him a no-trade
clause. It was widely reported that Hull would land in Chicago,
where his father, Bobby, became a legend, but the Blackhawks opted
instead to sign former New Jersey center Doug Gilmour to a
three-year deal worth $18 million. That paved the way for the Stars
to ink Hull, who turns 34 next month, to a three-year, $17 million
pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not possible for us to (sign both Gilmour and Hull),''
said Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray. ``I've got a couple of
other things I want to get done. We took the guy who's going to
help the hockey team the most.''
</P>
<P>
   But will he? Gilmour is a terrific leader and a gritty veteran
who plays all-out every game. But at 35, his skills have
diminished. While he's averaged 25 goals per season over his
15-year career, he had just 13 last year with defensive-minded New
Jersey, his lowest since the lockout- shortened season of 1994-95,
when he had 10. Hull also had a subpar season with a career-low 27
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins? All money issues aside, both teams. The Blackhawks
clearly improve their club with the acquisition of Gilmour. But the
bigger winner is Dallas, which now has a deadly combination of Mike
Modano and Hull. It should be enough to lead Dallas from the
bridesmaid role all the way down the altar this time.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Phoenix Terrier
</P>

   Former Bruin and all-around good guy Mike Sullivan, who went to
Nashville from Boston in the expansion draft, landed in Phoenix,
when the Coyotes acquired him for a seventh-round pick in next
year's entry draft. If the team can iron out its prolonged soap
opera/contract problem with captain Keith Tkachuk, then Sullivan
will get his first chance to play with his fellow Boston University
alum. The two didn't overlap at the school as Sullivan departed
just prior to Tkachuk arriving. Other New Englanders on the club
are Jeremy Roenick, Bob Corkum, Keith Carney, and Deron Quint . . .
Phoenix GM Bobby Smith suspended negotiations with Tkachuk's agent,
Bob Murray, last week and pulled the club's offer off the table.
Reportedly, Tkachuk is asking for a renegotiation that would pay
him $8 million a year. The team's offer, rejected by Tkachuk and
Murray last week, was for an average of $6.5 million a year the
next five seasons . . . The Red Wings' back-to-back Stanley Cups
may have the Detroit fans delirious, but that success hasn't
translated into national endorsements. Sergei Fedorov doesn't
capture the imagination the way Ken Griffey Jr. and Michael Jordan
do. ``Jordan knows how to blink, Griffey how to wear a hat
backward,'' Mike Bernacchi, a University of Detroit Mercy marketing
professor, told the Detroit News. ``Fedorov knows how to play
hockey.'' . . . One sign we're all getting old: The Calgary Flames
took Shaun Sutter in the fourth round, No. 102 overall, in last
Saturday's draft. Sutter, a 5-foot-11-inch, 160-pound center,
played for Lethbridge of the Western Hockey League last season and
is the son of former Bruins coach Brian Sutter. ``I guess I've come
full circle,'' said Brian Sutter, now behind the Flames' bench. ``I
started out at the draft as a player, came as a coach, and now as a
father.'' . . . The Rangers took South Shore native Patrick Leahy
in the fifth round. Leahy, who could someday play with the Rangers'
Kevin Stevens, works out with the winger and even painted his
Duxbury house last summer . . . Ottawa netminder Ron Tugnutt nearly
became one of the goalies selected by Nashville in the expansion
draft, but at the last minute, the Predators opted for the Kings'
Frederic Chabot. ``We had a couple of 11th-hour deals that went
down and what they did was affect Ottawa; Ottawa being Tugnutt,''
said Predators coach Barry Trotz. ``We made a last-minute,
11th-hour decision that squeezed Tugnutt out.'' . . . Ken Wregget's
career received a boost when he was dealt from the Penguins to the
Calgary Flames along with Dave Roche for German Titov and Todd
Hlushko. Wregget, who has spent his career primarily as a backup
and was bumped out of the top job in Pittsburgh by the resurgence
of Tom Barrasso last season, was told the No. 1 job is his. ``I was
never happy being a backup,'' said Wregget. ``I always wanted to
play. To have this opportunity now is good because I was never
really happy sitting back, watching, waiting. I've had the
opportunity here and there, but the opportunities were like when I
was in Philadelphia when Ron Hextall went down and I did the job
and did it well. But then that guy comes back. I've never lost a
starting position and never had an outright chance at one. Right
now I feel relieved I'm getting the opportunity and I'm going to do
everything I possibly can to jump in, have a good year, and make it
the best possible enjoyable time I can.'' . . . Rick Dudley, who
replaced Pierre Gauthier as Ottawa general manager after Gauthier's
surprise resignation, didn't waste any time making changes. His
first order of business was to cut six players, including captain
Randy Cunneyworth. It's likely Alexei Yashin will be named the new
captain. But the big move was Dudley saying they wouldn't offer a
contract to forward Pat Falloon, who was picked up from the Flyers
in the Alexandre Daigle deal. Falloon was taken No. 2 overall in
the 1991 draft by San Jose and finished fourth in balloting for
rookie of the year honors in 1991-92. The 25-year-old struggled
mightily in his brief tenure with the Senators. He arrived in
January from Philly and scored a paltry two goals. The Senators
would've had to pay Falloon $1.2 million US to keep him but didn't
feel it was worth it . . . Word out of Ottawa is that Gauthier
seems likely to land as the director of pro scouting for Anaheim.
Reportedly the Senators will not ask for any compensation . . .
It's likely the biggest headache Dudley will have this summer is
signing restricted free agent forward Shawn McEachern, who made
$850,000 US last season. The club made him a qualifying offer, but
word out of Ottawa is that the team would trade him if McEachern's
demands were too high. After a solid season in which he scored 24
goals and was second on the club in scoring with 48 points behind
Yashin's 72, McEachern had no goals in the postseason. It wouldn't
be surprising to see McEachern opt for arbitration, where he's had
success . . . Reports say that Craig Ramsay, who formerly worked
with Roger Neilson as an assistant coach in Florida, will rejoin
Neilson as an assistant in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Heartfelt decision
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton president/GM Glen Sather, who was coveted by a number
of teams, elected to stay with the Oilers and signed a multiyear
deal. ``It's home,'' said Sather. ``It's not complicated. This is
where my friends are. It's where my dogs can go for a run in the
morning and I don't have to worry about anything. It's a great city
to live in and I think if more people recognized that, we'd be a
lot better off.'' Sather said there are particular charms about
Edmonton that are unlike other cities. ``You know, I shot a
porcupine out my window once. Right here in the city. Middle of the
night. I had (his wife) Annie hold the flashlight. I put the .22 on
her shoulder and I said, `Don't move.' He was chewing the hell out
of this tree. You know, they go all around and kill the tree, so I
shot it.'' As someone who grew up in rural New Hampshire and
witnessed my father, in bathrobe and slippers, shooting a woodchuck
out the living room window to prevent the animal from demolishing
the garden, I can relate . . . In this era of whopping pay
increases for unrestricted free agents, Sharks right wing Tony
Granato opted for security over testing the market and will
actually take a pay cut. Granato appears set to sign a two-year
deal that will pay him less than the $1.5 million he earned last
year. It's likely the Sharks will lose unrestricted free agent John
MacLean, opening up ice time for Granato . . . The Predators
plucked defenseman Al Iafrate from the San Jose roster but then
declined the option on his $1.85 million salary for next season,
making him an unrestricted free agent. It's possible the club might
try to sign him at a lower figure, given Iafrate's history of
injuries. An incentive-laden clause would make the most sense . . .
Former Bruins goalie Andy Moog, who hung up his pads for the final
time after the season in Montreal, ending an 18-year-career, will
become the primary owner of the Fort Worth Brahmas minor league
hockey franchise. Moog, formerly a minority investor in the Western
Professional Hockey League team, decided to take over the club
after its inaugural season because the league had taken control
near the end of the season when the previous ownership group
couldn't pay the freight of about $20,000 . . . 97 days until the
season opener. Unreal.

BURNED BOY, 8, `TOUGH LITTLE KID' WHO IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELANIE COFFEE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An 8-year-old Houston-area boy, who suffered
third-degree burns over 99 percent of his body when he was set
afire, is a ``tough little kid'' fighting for his life, medical
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray Middleton was taken to the Shriners Burns
Hospital-Galveston June 28 after being doused with gasoline and set
on fire along a wooded trail near his home in northwest Splendora,
about 30 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County authorities are holding a 13-year-old boy in
connection with the assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``A burn over 99 percent of the body is usually not survived
even the first 24 or 48 hours,'' said Dr. David Herndon, chief of
staff at the hospital. ``People usually cannot maintain their blood
pressure and go into kidney failure, but he didn't because he's a
strong little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Robert had an operation to remove the majority of his
burned tissue, Herndon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said unburned tissue about the size of a silver dollar also
was removed from the top of both the child's feet. That tissue was
sent to the Shriner's Hospital in Boston where it will be used to
grow new tissue to supply doctors with graft material to use in a
series of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert is breathing on his own, Herndon said. His body is washed
and covered with salve twice a day to help prevent infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this is very painful for him,'' Herndon said. ``He's a
really tough little kid. He has to be to have made it this far.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next five months, Robert will remain in critical
condition and go through 15 to 20 skin graft operations, Herndon
said. He said the youngster is currently experiencing a prolonged
adrenaline rush that will last throughout the five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural response to a massive burn injury,'' Herndon
said. ``It's the way the body makes healing proteins that ward off
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert's adrenaline levels are three to six times higher than
normal, his heart is beating twice the usual rate, his eyes move
quickly back and forth, and his body consumes three times as much
sugar to maintain its bodily functions, said Herndon.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's lungs also were injured by the fire, and the hospital
is trying to let them heal themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his first series of operations, Robert will have about 20
more as he ages to replace the scar tissue that will cover most of
his body. He also will have several years of physical therapy,
Herndon said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said his family is pleased with his progress
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a devastated, but a very strong family,'' Herndon
said. ``They've been very realistic, supportive and kind to the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL INCLUDED) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two funds have been set up to help the family with their
expenses related to caring for Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions can be made to the Robert Ray Middleton Benefit
Fund at the Heritage Bank, P.O. Box 1789, Cleveland, 77327. The
bank's telephone number is 281-592-2661.

 &HT;    WCW star takes fight to court
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Welcome to the two worlds of Ric Flair and watch as
they zoom toward collision.
</P>
<P>
   In the curious, comic-book realm of big-time wrestling, Flair
has reigned as the iconic ``Nature Boy'' for 25 years, cheered
almost nightly by fans who scream for violent vengeance, even while
knowing _ or strongly suspecting _ that it's a setup, a hoax, a
macho ballet of good vs. evil, choreographed to the endless,
symphonic ker-ching! ker-ching! of a massive profit machine.
</P>
<P>
   In everyday Charlotte, though, Flair plays the suburban-Dad
counterpoint to his brash on-stage persona. He owns eight gyms,
four here in his adopted hometown, where he has lived since 1974.
He drives a Mercedes sedan and wears a Rolex _ his third, he points
out. Articulate and warm at 49, with his famously flowing white
hair cut shoulder-length, Flair is also smaller than his image
might suggest, built more like an ordinary aging jock than a
13-time world heavyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two faces of Flair are being drawn to one arena, Fulton
County Superior Court, in a real-life battle more serious and
somber than the arenas Flair has come to personify.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime employer, Atlanta-based World Championship
Wrestling, sued Flair in April for breach of contract after he
began missing matches.
</P>
<P>
   Flair sued back last month, saying he never signed a contract
and had not been shown the esteem he's due as the ``Babe Ruth'' of
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have to take it, you shouldn't, and I just drew
the line,'' Flair said, adopting a third role as put-upon working
man. ``I had been vented on one too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million Americans tune in weekly to the matches of
WCW and its rival World Wrestling Federation, the shows
consistently drawing top cable and pay-per-view ratings. The
industry _ a hybrid of vaudeville, TV's lowest-common-denominator
elements and even, perhaps, a touch of the ancient sport of
wrestling _ generates more than $1 billion a year from pay per view
and merchandising alone. Fans follow it with an almost religious
zeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, though, a bit of context might be helpful
in appreciating the magnitude of the Flair-WCW rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be like the Yankees suing Mickey Mantle,'' so
indelibly linked are Flair and WCW, said Dave Meltzer of
California, publisher of the weekly Wrestling Observer newsletter.
``Longevity-wise, he's the longest-ranking superstar and without
question, he's the greatest performer in the history of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   During performances, like this Monday's Nitro at the Georgia
Dome, wrestlers bellow their taunts and fans shriek their adoration
or loathing. Flair is known for his battle-cry ``Whooo!'' as much
as for his perfectly shaped blond tresses or rhinestone robes.
</P>
<P>
   But the noise is muted in the court dispute. WCW won't comment.
Attorneys seem intent on bringing a little dignity to the brawl by
not talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they can take me off the air for six months (and be
done with me),'' Flair said. ``Twenty years ago, I was selling out
every arena in the southeast United States. I have endured the test
of time. I've made millions. I've spent millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `You'll have a home here forever _ you're the
one-and-only Ric Flair,''' he said. ``Famous last words.''
</P>
<P>
   In what's often called a soap opera for men, Flair's flamboyant
style has served him well as both the ``villain'' and the ``good
guy'' throughout the decades. Flair twice earned fans' votes as
``Most Hated Wrestler'' along with unwavering respect. Since WCW
sued him when he stopped performing in April, crowds have chanted
``We Want Flair!'' during matches featuring other wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fans have been taking this situation negatively, and
they feel he should be treated with a lot more respect than he's
getting from WCW,'' said Jeff Bunda, 18, who lives just two miles
from his hero, hangs Flair posters on his wall and maintains The
Temple of the Nature Boy Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bunda doesn't fret the lack of competition or suspense; he loves
the spectacle. It's no different than ``predetermined'' dramas like
the movie ``Titanic'' or even Shakespeare, he said. ``You know that
Romeo and Juliet are going to commit suicide. It's the same
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Flair hit it big in wrestling almost from the start. After
struggling in college, he stumbled his way into the ring in 1972
and arrived in Charlotte two years later, buying his first Cadillac
with his first $1,000 paycheck. A plane crash broke his back in
1975, but Flair was back in the ring six months later.
</P>
<P>
   He taught new lessons in self-promotion as a Cadillac-driving
ladies man, ``the latest and the greatest, stylin' and profilin'.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, with his four children and businesses
growing and bringing demands for new roles, Flair has learned to
tone down the antics in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go to the bank to get a loan and do the `Whoooo,'''
he said. A courtroom arena is a logical extension of the ring's
pageantry and themes, said Michael R. Ball, author of
``Professional Wrestling as Ritual Drama in American Popular
Culture'' and a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin.
Wrestling's rituals are classic, involving heroes and villains,
glory for the good, comeuppance for blowhards _ and offering easy
reinforcement of audience beliefs in ``the system, the way things
are, the way they have to be played out,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit filed April 17, WCW accused Flair of reneging on a
three-year, $1.95 million deal, forcing last-minute rewrites of
``storylines'' that propel the game. WCW says it had planned to
reintroduce the popular ``Four Horsemen'' group, with Flair as its
leader. It says Flair started missing work with an April 9
nationally televised ``Thunder'' program in Tallahassee _ and
started talking to the dreaded competition at WWF, which he worked
for briefly in the early 90s.
</P>
<P>
   WCW wants at least $2 million in damages, plus legal costs and
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In Flair's countersuit, he says he signed only a non-binding
draft to stay at WCW, where he spent his entire career. During
contract negotiations, WCW promised ``reasonable involvement in the
`story lines''' and ``legitimate consideration'' for his experience
and popularity, Flair's suit says. But the final WCW offer fell far
short and Flair refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Flair agrees that he missed the April 9 show. But he says he
gave notice months in advance that he planned to attend his
10-year-old son's own national wrestling meet (which the boy later
won) in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   His role had been downplayed, anyway, partly to meet the demands
of Terry ``Hollywood Hulk'' Hogan, whom WCW lured from WWF in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Further, WCW honcho Eric Bischoff treated Flair, off stage, ``in
an increasingly hostile, rude, threatening and degrading manner,''
Flair's suit says. ``Bischoff's language toward Mr. Flair is rude,
crude and socially unacceptable, even in the world of professional
wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   It says Bischoff referred to Flair as ``garbage'' and threatened
to bankrupt and exile him to another country.
</P>
<P>
   Flair's suit says he talked to rival WWF after it became clear
the WCW deal wouldn't fly. ``The furthest thing from my mind was
ever wanting to leave WCW,'' Flair said, adding he would consider
returning _ on the right terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you put into words 'mutual respect.' I did a
lot to help that company and have always been a very big supporter
of WCW. Then again, that doesn't mean you get a gold watch. It
doesn't mean anything. But to me it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Flair remains a loyalist to the sport. The show. He said he
never heard of ``storylines'' until two years ago and is reluctant
to answer whether they extend to the outcomes of matches.
</P>
<P>
   Though others have pulled the curtain back on his changing world
of wrestling, Flair just winked and smiled: ``I would never be able
to sleep at night if I admitted that to you.''

 &HT;    Radical treatment gives breast cancer patient new hope
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the cancer came back for the second time, the
options seemed dismal. But a sister's devotion and an experimental
treatment for advanced breast cancer has given Yolanda Thompson a
second chance.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Northside Hospital patient from Seneca, S.C., is
the first metastatic breast cancer patient in the Southeast to
undergo this new treatment. When breast cancer has metastasized, it
has spread to other body tissues or organs.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique combines a donor bone marrow transplant with
cellular immunotherapy, a procedure that reinfuses donated T-cells
each month to boost the immune system's response to any remaining
cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, doctors have treated advanced breast cancer
through a procedure called autologous bone marrow transplantation.
Doctors remove healthy bone marrow from the patient, then give the
patient high doses of chemotherapy, which kills not only the cancer
cells, but also the remaining bone marrow. Afterward, the patient's
bone marrow is reinfused and grows, redeveloping infection-fighting
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors didn't think an autologous bone marrow transplant
would help Thompson. This was her second bout with breast cancer,
and it had spread to her lungs and liver. Thompson's immune system
was so weakened that it most likely would not be able to fight
remaining cancer cells after another round of chemotherapy _ even
with a reinfusion of her own bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thompson needed a new immune system. ``Autologous
transplants have been a standard procedure, but now we're trying to
do better,'' said Gerard Connagham, a hematologist/oncologist who
assisted with the procedure. ``We have all the benefits of an
autologous transplant, but we hope to have the extra benefit that
the new immune system will act against the tumor as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kent Holland, a hematol- ogist/oncologist at Northside
Hospital, opted for the experimental treatment _ an allogeneic bone
marrow transplant. The transplant would remove healthy bone marrow
from a donor. After intense chemotherapy, Holland would reinfuse
the donated bone marrow and let it grow, in the hopes it might
better fight any remaining cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I use my own marrow, the system that develops after
(chemotherapy) is my old immune system,'' Connagham explained. ``If
I use someone else's immune system, (it) may be able to do what my
old system could not do. It may attack and get rid of the tumor
cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a dietitian, and her husband, a gastroenterologist,
did some research on their own and came to the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Rogers, Thompson's 39-year-old sister, provided the new
immune system. All six of her sisters tested to see if their bone
marrow would match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was spooky,'' Thompson said. ``She never worried that she
would be a match. She just knew (that she would be the one).''
</P>
<P>
   It will be several months before doctors can tell how well the
procedure, performed on April 6, worked. But Thompson and her
doctors are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is 100 percent,'' said Thompson, who fought off cancer
in 1994 only to have it return in 1997. ``But I feel like I have
what I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson received the second infusion of her sister's T-cells
last week. She and her doctors must watch for the risks associated
with the transplant, the major one being that the new immune system
could attack her healthy tissues. High doses of chemotherapy could
lead to life-threatening infections, and chemotherapy complications
could affect her heart, liver, lungs and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   The allogeneic bone marrow transplant has been used in the past
year on several metastatic breast cancer patients in Texas, all of
whom are healthy so far. The same type of transplant is often
successful for leukemia and lymphoma patients, where it can lower
risk of the cancer returning by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two said that just trying the new technique has
helped. ``You don't know the pressure it takes off of you,''
Thompson said. ``The pressure is taken off when you know that if
the cancer comes back, there's something else that can be
offered.''

 &HT;    WWII sailors face asbestos health risks
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- William Burton has read enough medical journals and
heard from enough doctors to realize it probably is only a matter
of time before the estimated 5 billion asbestos fibers he has
unknowingly carried in his lungs for more than five decades will
develop into cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Burton more is that tens of thousands of others who
served in the same elite branch of the U.S. Navy that he did during
World War II might not know they run the same risk.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Burton, now 72 and retired from Coca-Cola, has set
out to educate fellow World War II sailors about possible exposure
to asbestos fibers that still have the potential to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys have asbestos in their lungs and don't
even realize it,'' said Burton. ``What I want to do is make them
aware of it and do what I can to get legislation enacted so that
they can get service-connected disability for the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton is writing members of Congress and the Department of
Veterans Affairs in addition to contacting veterans groups about
the asbestos risk. He also is working with veterans who may have
been exposed to help guide them through the often confusing and
complicated process of evaluation by doctors and claims for
compensation from the VA.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his effort is focused on the unit in which he served,
the U.S. Navy Armed Guard, composed of sailors assigned to guard
troop transports, tankers and supply ships from enemy submarines
and aircraft. It was a relatively small unit, but one of the most
vital to the Allied effort and most vulnerable to enemy attack
because the ships were very lightly armed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lloyd of Raleigh, N.C., chairman of the U.S. Naval Armed
Guard Association, said of the 6,236 ships on which members served,
710 were sunk. And of the 145,000 sailors who served in this
capacity, 1,810 died during the war, most of them lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all those ships were constructed with large amounts of
asbestos, which was used as a fire retardant and as insulation,
according to Donald Krispin, an attorney with the Jacques Admiralty
Law Firm of Detroit. The firm represents more than 25,000 merchant
mariners and sailors in asbestos-related lawsuits dating from World
War II to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they were working with (asbestos) or sleeping in the
vessel, they were susceptible,'' said Krispin, who estimates
600,000 merchant mariners were exposed to asbestos during the war,
plus an untold number of sailors and shipyard workers.
</P>
<P>
   VA officials say it is impossible to determine how many
servicemen might have been exposed to asbestos without going back
through all individual records of service to determine what type of
jobs they had and where they served.
</P>
<P>
   Although those who served on the ships were unaware of the
potential risks from inhaling asbestos fibers, Krispin said the
government and shipbuilders knew of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain manufacturers conspired to cover up information about
the hazards rather than taking a proactive role. Instead of issuing
warnings they did just the opposite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he can remember seeing fibers flaking off asbestos
that covered boilers and pipes during his 32 months of sea duty,
much of it in the north Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We breathed the stuff every day. It was in the air and in our
food but we had no idea at the time it could kill us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes now that the three cases of pneumonia he had during
the war, and numerous other bouts with the illness since then, are
a result of asbestos exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was wrong with me, but I couldn't figure out
what,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1996, said Burton, that members of the Armed
Guard learned of the extent asbestos was used on the ships they
guarded and the potential for diseases caused by the toxic
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I heard the word asbestosis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestosis is an irreversible lung disease, brought on by
prolonged exposure to asbestos, that has no treatment and gets
progressively worse.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos exposure also can lead to other diseases, including a
fatal cancer of the chest or abdominal cavities known as
mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has been diagnosed with asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   The VA has ruled his asbestosis is service-connected but with
zero disability.
</P>
<P>
   Burton also has a 10 percent service-connected disability for a
duodenal ulcer. He could be re-evaluated if he develops a more
serious disease.
</P>
<P>
   VA officials say 50 percent of people with asbestosis eventually
develop lung cancer, while about 17 percent develop mesothelioma.
Another 10 percent develop gastrointestinal and urogenital cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Krispin said medical research has shown that asbestos-related
diseases sometimes do not show up for as long as 15 to 45 years
after the initial exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making these guys aware that there may be a problem is my
goal,'' said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for a lot of them it's already too late.''

 &HT;    Pushing the horizon for cable
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Diego -- In this sunny land of endless roads, Cox
Communications has opened a telecommunications superstore on the
information highway.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company is offering a growing number of its
762,000 subscribers in Southern California a vast array of new
services. They include 210 channels of digital television, local
telephone service and high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more bandwidth at a lower cost and in more homes than
anybody,'' says William Geppert, general manager of Cox
Communications' San Diego system.
</P>
<P>
   While impressive, this telecom firepower doesn't guarantee that
enough people will want these services _ and want them from Cox
Communications _ to make this business profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox Communications has a great pipe, but none of this stuff
will happen overnight,'' says Bruce Leitchman, a media analyst at
telecom consultant the Yankee Group. ``Nor will it happen in the
next four years. But it's still a great long-run play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is not alone in using its cable systems to
offer advanced services such as cable modems. Denver-based MediaOne
is trying to offer the same lineup of services to its 540,000
customers in metro Atlanta. So is Comcast's system in Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. is also getting into the cable TV business in
metro Atlanta, offering beaming service via microwaves to customer
homes.
</P>
<P>
   And nationally, long-distance carrier AT&AMP;T is buying
Tele-Communications so it can offer local telephone service and
Internet access through the lines of that cable company.
</P>
<P>
   All of these players could learn from Cox Communications, which
Wall Street considers the industry leader in offering digital
services. Not surprisingly, the industry is watching Cox
Communications as it rewires San Diego and Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern California is a microcosm of the future for the rest
of the country,'' Geppert says.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is a public company controlled by
Atlanta-based media conglomerate Cox Enterprises Inc., which also
owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   While strong today as the sixth-largest operator, Cox
Communications says it has no choice but to try offering new
services to grow in the future. The once-rapid growth of cable TV
has slowed sharply as penetration inches toward 70 percent of all
households.
</P>
<P>
   That means cable operators will have to grow now by selling
their existing customers new services. First among such services is
digital television, which offers more channels, a sharper picture
and greater viewer control.
</P>
<P>
   Next is local and long-distance telephone service. And third is
cable modems, which enable users to connect their computers to the
Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than traditional
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Like a big department store, Cox Communications wants to offer
customers all these services from one source. And then send them
one bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a compelling idea, but will it work? Not everyone is
convinced. Leitchman doubts that Cox Communications can succeed
long-term selling telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because Sears sells jeans doesn't mean you'd buy them
there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, a St. Louis-based brokerage firm, is
sold on Cox Communications' strategy. In a recent research report
on the company and its California operations, it concluded that Cox
Communications had a winning combination of good customer service
and system reliability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, Cox Communications led its industry with a
99.986 percent reliability rate for its cable systems, a
performance slightly less than that of the regional telephone
company industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, J.D. Power &AMP; Associates awarded Cox Communications
its highest ratings for customer service among cable operators in
1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox's excellent reputation should enable it to lure a
significant number of customers,'' A.G. Edwards says in its report.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the brokerage firm estimates Cox Communications
will eventually sell cable modems to 15 percent of its subscribers
nationwide, generating $160 million a year in new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And it estimates the Cox will eventually sign up the same
percentage of subscribers for local telephone service. Right now,
A.G. Edwards says the company is capturing 6 percent of those
offered telephone service _ a rate it calls ``impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these new services offered by Cox Communications require
a two-way digital network. And once again, the company is a leader,
says A.G. Edwards. It reports that more than 40 percent of the
company's customers are now served by two-way digital systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Cox Communications is one of the companies
best positioned to capitalize on the convergence of voice, video
and data,'' A.G. Edwards' report says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Cox Communications' digital pipeline is in Southern
California south of Los Angeles _ and for good reason. Much of this
area's population is affluent, techno-savvy and loves leading the
nation in anything new.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, for example, 80 percent of all homes are wired for
cable, and 64 percent have computers. Moreover, 50 percent of those
with computers are online. All these numbers are far above the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more fiber-optic cable in Southern California than
anywhere else in the country, including the Silicon Valley,'' says
Geppert. ``A quarter of all cable modem customers are in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   But the region's advanced telecommunications infrastructure
doesn't guarantee demand for cable modems and the like. So Cox
Communications has proceeded slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, for example, only 60,000 of Cox
Communications' 278,000 customers have been marketed for all three
of its main services, telephone, digital TV and cable modems. Tens
of thousands of other customers, though, are receiving at least one
of these three new services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working really hard to ensure that people have a good
experience with this stuff,'' says Geppert. ``And so far, we've had
virtually no churn,'' which is industry jargon for turnover in
customers.
</P>
<P>
   While small, the number of customers buying new services is
growing. Cox Communications has 24,000 cable modem customers in its
California systems and is adding 400 a week in San Diego alone.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, MediaOne has about 600 cable modem customers in
metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, Cox Communications has sold local telephone
service to more than 2,000 customers. That doesn't sound like a
lot, but it represents a good percentage of the small number of
houses offered the service. Says General Manager Leo Brennan, ``We
ran out of lines in the first 10 weeks and had to temporarily stop
selling the service.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan's experience represents not only initial success but how
difficult and frustrating it has been selling digital services. The
company has encountered a series of setbacks large and small.
</P>
<P>
   It's a never-ending struggle to get enough telephone lines from
Pacific Bell. And installing cable modem service is slow and
expensive. Right now, Cox Communications must send out to every new
customer two representatives to install and explain the modems.
</P>
<P>
   At times rolling out digital services has been so frustrating
that Cox Communications President and Chief Executive Jim Robbins
has wrung his hands in public. This spring he lamented to a group
of reporters in Washington, ``The rollout is going slower than I'd
like.''

TITLE, NOT MONEY, SHAPED HULL'S MOVE TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact is, Brett Hull has experienced every euphoria in
hockey, except one.
</P>
<P>
   He has delivered a perfectly timed pass to a teammate for a
game-winning goal. He has crept inside the blue line and hammered a
game-winning shot past a defenseless goalie; his famous slap shot
is not easily stopped or avoided.
</P>
<P>
   He has done almost everything a player can do and done most of
it better than anybody else, except for this: Brett Hull has not
won the game that will cement him as one of the greatest of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   His stellar seasons in St. Louis are overshadowed by early
playoff exits. His biggest victory came when Team USA won a gold
medal in the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had his tremendous World Cup performance and the U.S.
won, guys were celebrating and Brett turned to Chris Chelios and
whispered: `I've never won anything of this magnitude. What are we
supposed to do?''' longtime family friend Susie Mathieu recalled.
``I thought that was pretty telling.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of his prolific scoring (554 goals in 801 games), for
all of his achievements (league-leading 521 goals in past 10
seasons), for all of his awards (a Hart and a Lady Byng Trophy),
Brett Hull has discovered the sweet taste of victory to be
frustratingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   And that's his explanation.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he yanked a Stars jersey over his golden-blond
covered head on Friday instead of the Blackhawks jersey that
everyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple, Hull says. He wanted to win. In the end,
Hull accepted less money to play for the Stars, signing a
three-year, $17 million contract, because he thought the Stars had
a better chance than anybody to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dallas called, I thought of that as an opportunity to
win,'' Hull said. ``I thought they were as close as anybody to
winning a Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull had figured on many Stanley Cups when he entered NHL in
1986. He began his quest in Calgary, playing a handful of games
that season.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary traded him late in 1987-88 season, and then went on to
win a Cup without him that next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is nobody wants to win more than Brett Hull,''
said Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk, who played with Hull in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   When Hull arrived in St. Louis in 1988, he was young and
extremely talented. His hunger has built. He became an instant
superstar in St. Louis, a city that envelops its players.
</P>
<P>
   Mathieu, then a Blues public relations person, was assigned to
handle Hull's public relations as stipulated in his contract. Hull
became an instant fan favorite, at times, becoming bigger than his
team.
</P>
<P>
   He played with Adam Oates from 1989-92. Hull and Oates posters
were suddenly in many youths' rooms, a prolific tandem that
accounted for 539 points in just under three seasons together.
</P>
<P>
   Then Oates was traded to Boston in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Talented players danced through St. Louis during Hull's career
with amazing alacrity from then on.
</P>
<P>
   Oates was first. Players like Brendan Shanahan and Curtis Joseph
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hull remained constant, providing a sometimes staggering
Blues team with a marquee player always big enough to draw the fans
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was literally the mortar that caused the Kiel Center to be
standing today,'' Hull's agent Mike Barnett said of St. Louis new
arena opened in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was to St. Louis as Modano has been for this Stars
organization.
</P>
<P>
   He has a smile reminiscent of Modano's too, only Hull has been
through experiences that have added a few wrinkles to his beaming
smile and a few more around his bright blue eyes, that still
twinkle when he talks.
</P>
<P>
   Wrinkles from 10 seasons in St. Louis without a single
postseason that lasted beyond the second round. A Stanley Cup
always being just further than his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do that,'' Hull said. ``I wanted to do
that in St. Louis, but I'm not in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Shanahan said when he exited: ``When you're in St. Louis,
there always seems to be a huge weight on your shoulders. It has
happened to just about every player before (Hull), so I don't think
(Hull) should take it too personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, a self-described ``happy-go-lucky, easy-going kind of
guy,'' had to learn that lesson for himself.
</P>
<P>
   His lessons were sometimes painful.
</P>
<P>
   Then he faced Mike Keenan, a demanding coach brought into St.
Louis in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hull fretted as cornerstone players like Joseph and Shanahan
were sent packing. Keenan brought in his guys, and Hull, being
Hull, began expressing his displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan blasted Hull for not being a team player, eventually
stripping him of his captain's ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say he lost his love for the game,'' said Hull's
wife, Alison. ``I think he lost his innocence. He always thought
that everyone was so good, and always thought best of folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade rumors swirled, and Hull's production plummeted. He had
his lowest amount of goals last season, scoring 27. In games 4 and
6 against Detroit in the playoffs, the last Hull would ever play in
St. Louis, the fans booed him. Then, last week, the Blues told Hull
they weren't going to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' Hull said. ``It's like I told them the other day,
unfortunately, the thing I am going to take from (the Blues) is my
departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blues general manager Larry Pleau: ``We've made our
decision. There are no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   A few said Hull had gotten a bit too old (he'll be 34 when Stars
begin training camp in September). A few said the Blues hadn't won
anything while he was there.
</P>
<P>
   So Hull was left to think about his career, the way a person
thinks when the results have always come short of expectations _
both his own and others _ and it's time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that saddens me is Brett and I were talking
about the Hall of Fame,'' Mathieu said. ``I said: `Brett, you are
going to be in there.' And he said: `Well you never know. I don't
know that I'm a Hall of Famer.'''
</P>
<P>
   His numbers say he will be. He ranks seventh among active player
in career goals, 16th overall. He is third among NHL players in
goals per game (.691). His 86 goals in 1990-91 are the
third-highest total in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in his mind, what happens when he plays for the Stars
will, in many ways, define his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want to say about Brett Hull, he's coming here
because he wants to win now,'' Stars veteran Guy Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull arrived at The Ballpark in Arlington on Friday night to
toss out the ceremonial first pitch for Stars owner Tom Hick's
other enterprise, the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras followed his motions, chronicling his talk with Rangers
first baseman Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The camera loved him, and he loved the camera. The two guys
sitting side by side talking the finer points of media interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like long, lost buddies,'' Will joked.
</P>
<P>
   Alison thinks Hull looks and sounds so much like his father when
he's in situations like that.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hull, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, had that same
blend of outspoken brashness, bull-headed stubbornness and
crowd-pleasing charisma during his playing days in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And The Golden Brett had a chance to play where The Golden Jet
had earned his nickname and his reputation, a place where his
number hangs from the rafters _ retired and remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had a chance to finish his career in Chicago. Alison said
that the Blackhawks had been No. 1 until the Stars called.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so proud of his dad, and thinks he's the best hockey
player ever,'' Alison said. ``I thought he would be crazy to go to
Chicago and play in his father's shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett had been Bobby's son, a blessing and a curse in many ways.
Expectations coming standard with surnames. And now everyone
expected him to be in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so written about and talked about Chicago, because of
my dad, that everyone just assumed, and I think even my close
friends just assumed, that is where I was going to be,'' Hull said.
``When Dallas came into the picture it just brought a whole new
light on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull wants a chance to do the one thing his father has done that
he hasn't, to hoist a Stanley Cup over his head.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, if it happens, Brett Hull won't have to ask what
to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moment that Brett and Alison Hull imagined while sitting
in their kitchen last week in Duluth, Minn. They were having the
conversation they never thought they'd have about a subject you
never think about as the years pass.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull had to decide where to finish his career, where to
take his last shot at his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about what are you playing this game for,'' Alison
Hull said. ``Because believe it or not, it's not about the money.
There gets to be so much money anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Brett says: `I want to win.' For as long as he's played,
and he doesn't have many years left, and for all he has done, he
hasn't been a part of a winner. And I said: `You have your
answer.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars had their man.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT CAN HELP PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED ENJOY OUTDOOR
ACTIVITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advanced equipment and changing attitudes are helping physically
challenged men and women have fun hunting, fishing, skiing or
participating in a variety of outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the most part, physically challenged individuals such
as Tim Goldberg, John Paddon and Don Krebs have designed,
engineered or tested the new equipment and advanced artificial
limbs.
</P>
<P>
   However, no piece of equipment is worth the box it comes in
without the person having the right attitude, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitude is one of the biggest factors in whether a person who
has become physically challenged continues to enjoy outdoor
activities,'' Goldberg said. ``Just how active you can be, of
course, depends upon your own physical limitations, but there are a
lot of ways to still do things you used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg lost a leg after a 25-foot fall while rock climbing.
Now, he skis, goes snorkeling and enjoys other water activities
with artificial legs he designed for those activities. Goldberg's
ProsthetiCare company in Fort Worth builds and fits artificial
limbs to amputees.
</P>
<P>
   He can adapt artificial limbs for outdoor activities, but it can
be expensive. For example, Goldberg said a prosthesis he made for
himself to hold a rubber flipper used by scuba divers and
snorkelers would cost $2,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   For special fishing equipment, Krebs might be the leading
expert. The resident of Thousand Oaks, Calif., who became a
quadriplegic 20 years ago as the result of a water-skiing accident,
founded Access to Recreation, which supplies highly specialized
fishing equipment, outdoor gear and therapeutic aids.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing through Krebs' Access to Recreation order catalog, one
will find such fascinating devices as motorized fishing reels, rod
holders, casting devices and units designed to hold cameras, field
glasses, rifles, hand guns, fishing rods and work trays.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an organization or group of anglers, hunters or boaters
that promotes outdoor activities for the physically challenged is
as close as the telephone or computer.
</P>
<P>
   Every September, numerous amputees and others gather in Olney
(about 40 miles south of Wichita Falls) to take part in a ``One-Arm
Dove Hunt,'' an event hosted by Jack Northrup, the town's city
manager who describes himself as a ``one-arm Jack.''
</P>

   ``I strongly encourage everyone to be as active as possible,''
Krebs said. ``Recreation will improve the quality of your life. As
you exercise, you will improve your health, and, as you accomplish
physical goals, you will build your confidence and self-esteem. We
are fortunate to live in an era that emphasizes the abilities and
needs of the physically challenged.''

GONZALEZ HAS HIT A HAPPY BEAT IN LIFE, DRIVES IN RUNS AT A RECORD
PACE

<P>
   The heat is tropical and the air is still as the Rangers take
batting practice on an early July day. The patter of line drives
and idle batting-cage talk begin to fill the Texas air.
</P>
<P>
   But as Juan Gonzalez steps into the cage, the chatter seems to
suddenly dim.
</P>
<P>
   Ears perk. Heads abruptly turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' teammate Lee Stevens will
say later, ``but when Juan hits, the ball just sounds different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I could take the exact same bat and go out there and
swing at the exact same pitch, and it wouldn't sound the same as
when Juan hits it.''
</P>
<P>
   The noise is the rhythm of a prodigious record being chased.
</P>
<P>
   Hack Wilson of the Chicago Cubs, the eternal RBI king, has a
68-year head start. But Juan Gonzalez of the Rangers is gaining
fast.
</P>
<P>
   In his 13th professional baseball season, Gonzalez at long last
hears the beat. Part merengue, part Latin love ballad, it has
brought the Rangers right fielder happiness, and it has found him
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In their native Puerto Rico, weeks of rumor ended four years ago
in a very public kiss. From her concert stage at Roberto Clemente
Coliseum, singer Olga Tanon leaned down and kissed Juan Gonzalez,
and in the process, they say, broke a million island hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The slugger and the recording artist had known each other since
they met at the Pediatric Center for Children with HIV in San Juan.
Their budding romance, like DiMaggio and Marilyn, had been hard to
conceal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the concert,'' Gonzalez recalled, ``and ``yo pues,
enamorado al fin.''''
</P>
<P>
   He was in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``She leaned over, I kissed her,'' Gonzalez said, breaking into
a smile, ``and out of that kiss, they have written many novels.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, despite missing 28 games because of injuries, Gonzalez
hit 47 home runs and drove in 144 to earn the American League's
Most Valuable Player Award. Last season, after spending the first
three weeks on the disabled list, Gonzalez came back with 42 homers
and 131 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, somehow, this season for Gonzalez has been even better. He
has 96 RBI in the Rangers' 85 games before last night, and he
chases Wilson's seemingly unapproachable single-season RBI mark
(190), set in 1930. He smiles broadly and frequently.
</P>
<P>
   And he hears the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Tanon was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, on April 13, 1967.
She began her musical career in the mid-1980s by singing with the
group, Las Nenas de Ringo y Jossie. Merengue is the native beat of
the neighboring Dominican Republic, but the little girl with the
big voice adopted it and harvested it into a career that has
featured seven platinum albums.
</P>
<P>
   Her third solo album, in 1994, ``Siente El Amor'', reached the
``Billboard'' magazine top three. The same album won Tanon honors
for Univision's best tropical artist of the year, best tropical
album of the year and best song of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of her early songs, she was ``Mujer de Fuego'' _ a lady
on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Once they met at the children's hospital, Gonzalez said, ``I
wanted to get to know her. And I worked on it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Until we've walked where Juan Gonzalez has walked, his manager
says, we just won't understand. Rangers manager Johnny Oates has
walked the streets of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, during visits each of
the past two off-seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can appreciate how far he's come until
you've been there,'' Oates said. ``We might be making choices
between going to the movies or going to the skating rink. But look
at the choices the kids there were faced with growing up _ do you
want to do drugs or get beaten up?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it says so much about him that he was able to rise
above the peer pressure in Vega Baja. He had enough intelligence to
say, `I don't want to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez didn't always make the right choices, however. When he
reached his junior year at Vega Baja High School, the world began
to move fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed him to a contract at age 16. When he was 19,
moving up to Triple-A Oklahoma City, he got married.
</P>
<P>
   That marriage ended in divorce, as did his second marriage two
years later. Three years after that, Puerto Rican volleyball star
Elaine Lopez, sister of Atlanta Braves catcher Javier Lopez, found
herself in the news contesting whether she was Gonzalez's third
wife or not. Juan didn't think so, and the ``marriage'' was
dissolved after only two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I married for the first time, things didn't go the way I
expected,'' Gonzalez said. ``When things don't go right, you try to
end up as friends, and each person goes his or her own way.''
</P>
<P>
   You can scour the Gonzalez dossier for dirt or trawl the police
files for late-night mischief, but this _ his failed love life
before age 25 _ is the extent of it. Oh, he bashed more than a few
water coolers after striking out. And he was a well-publicized
no-show one night when he was to receive the top award at the
Rangers' annual banquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes of immaturity,'' someone once called it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've all made mistakes,'' Oates said. ``You take a
16-year-old kid, playing professional baseball for the first time.
He reaches fame and fortune very, very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like a bronzed statue. And when he gives you that
smile, with that dark mustache and those beautiful white teeth,
every female who is looking is going to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was a young man who looked back a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The looking all changed when Gonzalez met Olga. Already a
celebrity, Tanon presented yet another adjustment for him. She
didn't need his money. Tanon describes herself as ``demanding and
meticulous,'' and tried to establish a sense of order in the young
slugger's life.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what attracted him most to her, besides the obvious
physical attributes, Gonzalez answered, without hesitation, ``Her
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olga Tanon story that Rangers people like to tell involves
the woman who runs the elevator at Detroit's old Tiger Stadium. For
more than two decades, Sarah Simpson had quietly suffered in
cramped, non-air-conditioned discomfort, shuttling media and
dignitaries to and from the press box.
</P>
<P>
   Tanon accompanied Gonzalez on a Detroit trip and noticed the
elevator lady, sweating in sauna-like silence. That night at the
hotel, Olga told Juan, and the next day the two bought a fan to be
installed in the stadium elevator.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Sarah Simpson remains probably the biggest Juan
Gonzalez and merengue music fan in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has long told friends that if he wasn't a ballplayer,
he would have been a social worker. One day, after he retires from
the game, he thinks the same feelings may turn him to politics in
his native Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonzales put it, ``The reason I like politics is because I
like to help those who are forgotten, those who have been rejected
by society. I identify with the poor, with those who have suffered.
Where I come from, I saw a lot of people suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see some of those things on the streets and in the
neighborhood where I grew up. Many of those people have gone the
wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, we're all human beings, and there is no reason why
another human being should turn his back on those who have taken
the road of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the road of victory. But I can't forget someone who
took the road of defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's charitable works while with the Rangers fill a
lengthy paragraph in his media guide biography. Last year he was
honored with the club's Roberto Clemente Man of the Year award for
community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't talk readily about the awards or the money he has
contributed. His parents, Juan and Iris Gonzalez, have raised their
son well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are humble, hardworking people,'' the outfielder
said. ``They are ``luchadores,'' (fighters), who always tried to
provide the best for me and my two sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   In his old neighborhood on the rugged streets of Vega Baja,
Gonzalez has opened a standing account with the local pharmacy. For
those who can't pay for their prescriptions, Juan will buy the
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Those same people were praying for Gonzalez and Tanon two
winters ago when the couple's baby, Gabriela, was stricken with a
severe and mysterious blood disorder. Young Gabriela was suffering
seizures, and doctors were having trouble providing answers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first true time in his life, Gonzalez said, he found
himself thanking God for being rich. He and Olga were able to take
Gabriela to a specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore,
who finally diagnosed the disorder and prescribed the medication to
control it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thanked God that I had the resources to take her anywhere in
the world to any doctor to be cured,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela Marie Gonzalez, healthy and growing, turned 2 years old
in May.
</P>
<P>
   When Olga travels, the baby goes with her. Gonzalez admits it's
difficult trying to schedule time with Olga when both of them are
sometimes gone for 10 days or more at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But the beat goes on.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Louis' Mark McGwire leads the chase for one of
baseball's most fabled records, Roger Maris' 61 homers, Gonzalez
stalks one of its supposedly insurmountable ones. For 2 1/2
seasons, Gonzalez, nicknamed ``Igor'' back in Puerto Rico, has
shown almost an eerie propensity for driving in runs.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates marvel at the season he has enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``He's
the only guy I know who could drive in three runs with nobody on
base. At least, that's what it seems like.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 season, Gonzalez adapted his off-season program
to fit the philosophies of trainer Angel Precinal of the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the injuries,'' Gonzalez explained, ``I decided
to find a personal trainer to help me out with my flexibility and
my daily workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of volume in my muscles, like a bodybuilder, and
that brought me a lot of problems with my body. So we decided to
reduce the muscle volume and work more with flexibility and a
program of stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez responded to the new program by winning the American
League MVP award. When he arrived at spring training this season,
he announced that he wanted to play all 162 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have men on base, the pitcher has to throw strikes to
you,'' Rangers hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo said. ``Mentally,
that's when Juan seems to take it up a notch. He'll find a way to
get the run in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to pitch him away. But that's no big deal.
Whether it's in or away, when he's going right, he can hit either
pitch, and you're not going to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammate, Stevens, a power hitter in his own right, just
shakes his head when he thinks about what Gonzalez has done in the
first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got unbelievable leverage,'' Stevens said. ``He's 6-3,
220 pounds. His hands are so strong and huge and he's got them up
high. That's just a lot of leverage and strength right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's brute force behind what he's hitting. I tell you _ you
want to stay off the infield when he's taking batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez takes batting practice, the normal thwack of the
bat takes on almost a sharp ring. The ball launches like a missile.
</P>
<P>
   When Juan Gonzalez hits, the batting cage chatter slows and
heads turn.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Igor de fuego.'' There's a slugger on fire, and he's smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The beat goes on.

Column: Three Americans blew their chance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ This Wimbledon ladies final was a
delightful, if not particularly artistic, affair, a warm and fuzzy
pairing of two hard-luck women _ one 30, the other crowding it _
who deserved a today before they ran out of tomorrows.
</P>
<P>
   Centre Court owes lesser lights such as Jana Novotna and
Nathalie Tauziat an occasional bone such as Saturday's, even if the
ratings-crazed TV types disagree. Sometimes, underdogs should bark
last and loudest, hang the overnights.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna and Tauziat had their day in the sun, although it was
one of heavy overcast. If you believe the stuff of fairy tales,
watching Novotna's face flush with joy rather than contort in
anguish after a tense straight-sets victory over her inner demons
and a feisty Frenchwoman made it a gripping entanglement.
</P>
<P>
   A pity the Duchess of Kent isn't playful. She could have strode
onto the court for the plate presentation wearing a parka, meant to
protect her impeccably tailored suit from Novotna's infamous tear
stains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet surprisingly, against longer odds than her winning a
tournament none of the high-profile women _ young or old _ appeared
to want, the quick-to-cry Czech fought off the strong urge to start
bawling. But now it's done. Novotna's Choke-oslovakian passport has
been revoked. She has a Grand Slam title and closure. And everybody
else can get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport lacks champ's heart
</P>
<P>
   The three who should be working the hardest while lamenting the
loudest over the strange detour Wimbledon '98 took are Lindsay
Davenport and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena. Given the
opportunities presented by the current upside-down conclusion, the
crying shame from an American perspective is none of the
aforementioned trio had the right stuff to step forward and seize
what could have been a dandy Yankee Doodle Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Should you be counting _ I try not to anymore _ it has been 17
Wimbledons since the last American-born female, Chris Evert in
1981, held the champion's plate aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Serena we'll cut some slack, despite the bizarre manner in which
she walked out on her fourth-round match against Virginia Ruano
Pascual, claiming a mysterious leg injury possibly incurred while _
she said this _ shopping the day earlier. But the kid's only 16 and
a tour rookie, even if she talks enough of a game to make us forget
she has accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, 22, is the logical one to have made her move, if she
has a move inside her to make. That's a big if, it appears.
Promising runs at Roland Garros and Wimbledon ended with inglorious
thuds, renewing questions about her conditioning and courage more
so than her strokes.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, assuming there can be an American breakthrough in
the near future, it will have to come from Team Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle is a lot better, while the players that come out
of some of the Eastern European countries are much hungrier than we
are,'' Evert said several years ago, and her words ring true in
1998. ``They're more eager. They want it more than the American
girls do.''
</P>
<P>
   Except Venus and Serena came out of the same sort of environment
of which Evert speaks. Streets don't get a whole lot meaner than
those of Compton, Calif. Martina Hingis is closer to being a
Hapsburg or a Rothschild than a kindred spirit with Team Williams.
And their father, Richard, has instilled an us-against-the-world
mind-set that should, in tandem with their physical skills, make
them world-beaters.
</P>
<P>
   Williamses can't back up talk
</P>
<P>
   The problem is they're too caught up in believing their talk,
none of which has been underwritten by results. Venus got routed in
the U.S. Open final by Hingis last fall, her only 15 minutes of
deserved fame to date. And Serena's best showing has been a
semifinal defeat at a middling tournament in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But to quote Venus, after she prevailed in the quarterfinals
over Ruano Pascual: ``I am definitely at the point where I can win
this tournament because Serena was the toughest player out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And to quote Serena, after she so cavalierly had quit against
Ruano Pascual: ``Venus might go a long way now because I am out of
the draw. We were going to be pretty excited about facing each
other (in the quarters). It was going to give England something
exciting for once.''
</P>
<P>
   You kidding me? Serena was getting her behind paddled by a so-so
Spaniard when she packed her rackets and flounced off without
extending a handshake, much less an explanation. Then she played
dumb later, saying: ``I didn't? Wow. I didn't even realize. I just
forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the U.S. Open is coming up. Our tournament, last won by
an American-born woman _ Evert _ in 1982. Perhaps Venus and Serena
will deign to do more practicing than posturing between now and
then, thereby giving themselves a chance to have something to talk
about in New York.

 &HT;    Caution light for school bus ads
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jackie Dyer, superintendent of a poor school
district in far West Texas, thought he hit upon a perfect idea for
raising extra money to finance safety equipment for school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who heads the Fabens Independent School District, did not
go to taxpayers for help. He went to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Fabens' 12 yellow school buses now bear McDonald's, Coca Cola,
American Airlines and other ads. And thanks to the ad revenue, the
buses carry two-way radios and flashing red stop signs that unfold
into traffic when children board or exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way for us to earn some extra dollars,'' Dyer said
of the advertising, which generates $18,000 annually for his
district _ the 13th poorest of the state's more than 1,000
districts.
</P>
<P>
   But his new source of money may be dried up by actions playing
out in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Public Safety, responding to a law
passed in 1997, is devising rules to regulate advertising on school
buses. If passed in their current form, the regulations would
severely limit the space and placement of advertising on buses _ in
the name of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer's case points up a dilemma faced by school districts across
the state and nation. Strapped for cash, some increasingly are
turning to advertising for new money to finance school activities.
But bright, colorful advertising emblazoned across school buses may
go too far, posing safety risks for students, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are more important than income,'' said Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education Committee. ``We
parents are entrusting our children's lives to these vehicles, and
I think we should be very cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   New state rules regulating advertising on school buses would
have far-reaching effects. Aside from the Fabens school district,
Socorro in West Texas and the Lake Worth district near Fort Worth
also are carrying ads. And the San Marcos district _ as well as
others _ may not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which
regulates school bus transportation, say they are proceeding with
caution in drafting the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, advertising would be limited to only
two places on a school bus _ the left rear quarter panel and above
the windows on either side of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to balance the needs of school districts, who are
looking for additional money to finance school activities, against
the safety of children who ride the school buses. DPS officials
worry that ads would distract drivers and detract from the effect
of the school buses' bright yellow color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing advertising on the sides of the school bus within a
student's reach could entice a student to enter or linger in the
`danger zone' with the intention of touching the advertisement,''
DPS Director Dudley Thomas said in a March 1998 letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school bus is one of the most widely recognized vehicles
on the road due to its shape, yellow color and school bus
markings.''
</P>
<P>
   Eye-catching ads on the exterior of a bus might distract drivers
or interfere with their ability to easily recognize a school bus.
That, in turn, could lead to more accidents involving school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer is not buying that explanation. His district buses have
rolled along the streets of Fabens for two years without incident
or accident because of the ads, he said. And he points to school
districts in six other states, whose buses are bearing ads, he
says, apparently without an increase in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado districts in 1994 were the first to offer school buses
for advertising. Since 1997, five additional states have adopted
rules. Because programs are new, there is not enough data to know
if ads are causing more accidents, according to the DPS. In
Colorado Springs, where ad contracts for school buses and hallways
total $8 million annually, safety has not been a primary issue.
</P>
<P>
   Texas DPS officials say that before rules are approved and put
on the books, the public will have a chance to comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer said DPS has not done its homework thoroughly. He calls it
a case of big government picking on little government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had come down here and stood on the street corner and
witnessed two or three accidents, then I could understand it,'' he
said. ``I might as well not advertise if they make me take them
(ads) off from all but the back panel (of the bus).''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer has solicited the help of Gov. George W. Bush and U.S. Sen.
Phil Gramm to stop the rules, or at least loosen them to allow more
advertising in more places on a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to force these rules on us,'' he said. ``Yes,
we are poor. But it's not right for them to push us around.''
</P>
<P>
   The district, with 2,760 students, has a dozen buses that
display ads, which sell for $250 each. Aside from McDonald's, Coca
Cola and American Airlines, the buses carry ads from 14 other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If Fabens in rural West Texas can raise $18,000 a year through
such a program, San Marcos _ with about 60 school buses _ could
pull in about $100,000, figures Hector Montenegro, superintendent
of the San Marcos Consolidated School District south of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most taxpayers would probably support our interest to
look at other options to finance district-related activities,''
Montenegro said. ``We are looking into that as an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro said school districts have entered an era of greater
collaboration between corporations and schools. The school bus
advertising program seems ``a natural segue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others aren't so sure. They said that increasingly,
corporate America is aggressively reaching into the nation's
schools to the captive audience of schoolchildren. And schools,
strapped for cash, are willing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some concerns about the growing commercialism in
schools and the impact on our kids,'' said Melissa Anderson, a
spokeswoman for the National Education Association. ``Kids are in
school to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the trend hardly is expected to let up because
schools are constantly looking for new sources of money to
supplement tax dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lake Worth district, a recorded message greets callers:
``Thank you for calling the Lake Worth Independent School District,
educational partners with Lake Worth National Bank and American
Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the decision of whether to offer school buses,
hallways or school score boards to advertisers is a local decision.
But he added, regulating ads on school buses is a safety issue that
belongs to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins offered one creative solution to the dilemma of school
bus advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe all the advertising could be yellow,'' he said.

 &HT;    Web cameras show what's going on, no matter how routine
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Andrea Oakes likes to look at people when she
chats with them.
</P>
<P>
   So when she uses her computer to talk to Isaac Kishk over the
Internet, Oakes simultaneously visits his Web site, KazCam, to see
Kishk live and in person in his Austin home.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes can see Kishk through the watchful lens of his Web camera,
a palm-sized device that looks _ and works _ like an oversized
electronic eyeball. The camera is connected to Kishk's computer and
trained constantly on his bedroom, not unlike a real-life version
of the Jim Carrey hit movie ``The Truman Show.'' Every time a user
accesses the KazCam page, the camera snaps a photo and displays it
on the Web within 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With KazCam, I know exactly who I'm talking to,'' Oakes said.
``It's hard to tell who is lying about who they are these days.
When you throw a computer into the mix, you're likely to be talking
to a 15-year-old kid instead of the 30-year-old businessman he told
you he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakes isn't the only one peeking at Kishk through his camera's
lens. This year alone, KazCam has logged more than 86,000 hits, or
requests for photos, and his Web site averages 473 hits per day _
be they from casual observers hoping he'll just wave or dedicated
voyeurs hoping he'll do a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really feels intrusive,'' said Kishk, 21, a former UT
student who works for Austin-based Illuminati Online, an Internet
service provider. ``I used to be in broadcasting back in high
school, so I see it as just another curious eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of curious eyes opening up around the globe is
growing rapidly _ and so is the use of Web cameras.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of growth of Web cameras can be found at the Web
site of EarthCam, where users can peruse a directory of national
and international sites like the KazCam, including several in
Austin. To travel farther, EarthCam's visitors are a click away
from photos of Times Square or action on Wimbledon's Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site has increased dramatically over the past two years,''
said Brian Cury, president of Hackensack, N.J.-based EarthCam,
which is chiefly a television production company. ``When we first
started the site, we added maybe one to three cameras a week. Now,
it's 10-20 cameras a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are self-proclaimed exhibitionists like Kishk, who don't
mind giving the world a window into their lives; others are
attracted to the technology and the range of possibilities it
brings. Mark Bryant, an economist with MCI Communications Corp.,
has a Web camera that snaps photos of him in his Austin home
office, something he said piqued his interest because of potential
practical uses for live Web photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents could use it to monitor their kids, or kids too sick
to go to school could still see what's happening in the
classroom,'' Bryant said. ``There are educational and practical
applications. Plus, you can see the world anytime, from the streets
of San Francisco to the canals in Holland.''
</P>
<P>
   And from there, to the Austin skyline. The local Fox Network
affiliate, KTBC-TV, puts a live picture of downtown Austin on its
Web page. The photo is updated throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Web cameras and the software needed to run them start at $99 or
so at CompUSA. Both Bryant and Kishk opted to use high-speed ISDN
phone lines to connect to the Internet and upload the photos to
their Web pages, but ISDN lines aren't essential. Cury's company
has studied the Web camera market since August 1996, when EarthCam
created its online directory. As more Web camera pages crop up,
Cury predicts Web cameras' popularity will parallel that of the
video camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal Web cams are a big area for growth,'' he said. ``Just
think of how many millions of people now have video cameras,
compared to when they just started taking off. Right now, only
several thousand Web cameras are hooked up, but there's similar
potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Kishk _ like his audience _ is just having fun
with KazCam. Web users in the United Kingdom, Brazil and even Malta
_ along with a U.S. audience that includes government employees and
college students _ watch Kishk sit at his desk, leave his room or
even sleep with his teddy bear under a leopard-skin blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numerous requests to bare more of himself on-camera
_ including an invitation to play strip dreidel _ Kishk said he
doesn't bow to the pressure and tries to be careful about what the
camera captures.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't rule out playing a joke or two on his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wired it to my kitchen once,'' he said. ``I laid out a bagel
with cream cheese to rot. But I got grossed out after a couple days
and threw it out.''

Novotna claims elusive title
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ If Goran Ivanisevic is seeking an extra
source of inspiration _ beyond even his beloved Croatia's World Cup
upset-of-the-century victory over Germany _ for what's surely to be
an uphill battle for him in the Wimbledon men's final today, he
needs look no further than Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, at long last, claimed her elusive women's championship
on Centre Court on Saturday. Until she did so, she and Ivanisevic
were kindred spirits, the best players on their respective tours to
never have won a major title. And both were 0-2 in Wimbledon
finals, having let grand opportunities slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Ivanisevic, there's one striking dissimilarity
in their respective circumstances. Nathalie Tauziat, fortuitously
Novotna's third-time's-a-charm foil, is no Pete Sampras,
Ivanisevic's last daunting hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   But Novotna's got hers now, having this time fought through
another late fit of nerve-induced wobbles. Although she defeated
Tauziat, only 16th-seeded and perhaps the most unsung Wimbledon
women's finalist of the Open Era, with a less-than-classic
performance, the 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) result probably felt like 6-0, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   It definitely made her deliriously happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it means everything really,'' Novotna said after
coming down from the clouds, relaxing her hammerlock grip on the
champion's plate and embracing everyone on the grounds, from her
mother and her coach, Hana Mandlikova, on through the stewards and
the guys who empty the rubbish bins. ``It's a dream what I've been
working for for many, many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over. I'm quitting now. Absolutely now.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, a 29-year-old Czech who was playing here for a lucky
13th time, didn't mean that, of course. But there's no question,
even if she wins the next 10 Wimbledons, she will never enjoy a
more feel-good, letting-it-all-go moment than when she belted that
flush forehand return cleanly down the line past Tauziat to
conclude the second-set tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   They were in the tiebreaker because Novotna, serving tentatively
for the match at 5-4, had been broken, conjuring up more memories
of her third-set agony against Steffi Graf in 1993, when a 4-1 lead
didn't hold up and, afterward, she sobbed uncontrollably on the
shoulder of the Duchess of Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Then was also last year, when a first-set triumph still pointed
ultimately toward a three-set failure, with 16-year-old Martina
Hingis and a pulled stomach muscle doing her in.
</P>
<P>
   However, both Graf and young Hingis were ranked No. 1 in the
world at the moment of their victories. Against the 30-year-old
Tauziat, who had to play 43 Grand Slam tournaments before she
finally lasted all the way through to a final, the third-seeded and
now second-ranked Novotna was solidly favored.
</P>
<P>
   No 16th seed, Tauziat's precarious perch, had ever had the
audacity to win Wimbledon. A defeat Saturday would have been
Novotna's biggest disaster of them all, although she later
protested long and loudly to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that coming into this match it was going to be really,
really hard to beat Nathalie,'' Novotna said. ``As I've told you
before, my record against her isn't good, she's a very intelligent
player, very experienced, and I thought it would be the toughest
match of the whole championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna already had blown down Irina Spirlea, Venus Williams and
then the still-No. 1 Hingis, her doubles partner, in the
semifinals, clearing a wide swath through three of the most highly
regarded young players in the game, albeit none of them possessing
a wealth of experience on grass.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, in turn, has won 75 career grass-court matches.
Tauziat? Would you believe 88? That's second only to Lori McNeil's
108 among active players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The match against Martina was a piece of cake compared to this
one,'' Novotna contended. ``Believe me, simply because of the way
Nathalie plays on grass. She always puts so much pressure on you.
Not only at 5-4 I didn't serve well but the whole match, simply
because I was feeling so much pressure from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that every second serve she's going to come in, she's
going to take over the net and it will be just very difficult to
pass her.''
</P>
<P>
   What Tauziat couldn't, or chose not to do, was come in behind
her own second serve, a fatal strategic shortcoming in high-level
lawn tennis. As a result, Novotna kept the consistent heat on
herself, and it brought Tauziat down as the 1{-hour match dragged
on. After leading the second-set tiebreaker 2-1, she cratered,
losing six points in succession _ three on lackluster errors.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tauziat still secured the No. 10 spot in the
Women's Tennis Association rankings, finally sneaking into the top
10 after 14 years of labor on the Tour. Her biggest victory en
route to Saturday came against the former No. 2, Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to regret,'' Tauziat said. ``It is never easy
to play your game when you are for the first time in the final of a
big tournament like this. Jana played better than me. She deserved
to win. But I'm very pleased about my game. I hope next year is
going to be my Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that, for it to have any chance to be, she will
have to show more initiative on her serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second serve hurt me,'' Tauziat said, ``because she always
attacked it. If I didn't put my first one in, it was tough. She
came in with very aggressive balls, very long, very low, very
difficult to pass her with. I decided to come in at the end more,
but it was too late, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat was, of course, aware of Novotna's previous,
well-documented travails and would be asked to speculate on the
possibility that Novotna was about to unravel again when that
service game got away from her. Although she was able to reclaim
deuce from 15-40, she left herself facing another break point by
not following her serve in, then letting fly a loose forehand.
</P>
<P>
   When Tauziat gained the break with a clean crosscourt volley,
nobody in the stadium was exactly awash with confidence that
Novotna, her body language souring, could right herself _ including
the Duchess, who had assured Novotna 12 months earlier about how
the ``third time's charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, however, bristled at the suggestion Novotna was trying
to gag.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Jana's a fighter,'' she said. ``I play her many, many
times. It was always three sets, very strong match. But
journalists, they don't help her in a good way because they always
talk about how Jana Novotna lost Wimbledon against Graf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now she's won the championship; she's won Wimbledon. So
stop talking about the past.''

ROOTIN' TEUTONS THEY AIN'T: CROATIA BEATS GERMANY, 3-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Late in the first half, Croatia's players began
making the sign of the cross, putting their hands together
prayerfully and looking upward, as if they felt divine intervention
would be necessary to defeat mighty Germany in their first trip to
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a more earthly arbiter _ the Norwegian referee Rune
Pedersen _ who made the most critical decision in Saturday night's
quarterfinal match that produced a stunning 3-0 victory for Croatia
and set up an unexpected semifinal meeting with France on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 40th minute of a scoreless game that Germany was
dominating and that was becoming increasingly contentious, Pedersen
gave a red card to the German defender Christian Worns for a late,
open-field tackle of Croatia's star forward, Davor Suker. It was
hardly the most vicious of the 54 fouls called, but it changed the
course of the game irrevocably.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to play with 10 men for the final 50 minutes, Germany, a
three-time World Cup champion, suffered its largest defeat since a
meaningless 8-3 loss to Hungary in the first round of the 1954
World Cup. For the second consecutive time, Germany has exited the
World Cup in the quarterfinal round.
</P>
<P>
   There were no comebacks for Germany on Saturday, as there had
been against Yugoslavia and Mexico. For the fourth consecutive
game, Coach Berti Vogts' team failed to score in the first half.
Age, and the disputed red card, finally overcame Germany's
relentlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, meanwhile, became the first team since Portugal in 1966
to reach the semifinals on its first trip to the World Cup. Its
players are not exactly rookies, however. Four of them played for a
united Yugoslavia in the 1990 World Cup, and the roster stocks some
of Europe's top club teams.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no diminishing Saturday night's achievement.
Croatia, which gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1992, is
second only to Jamaica among the 32 teams in the tournament in
terms of smallness of its population, with 4.7 million residents.
That compares to 6.2 million registered soccer players in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with this victory; it's a historical
result,'' said Miroslav Blazevic, the Croatian coach. ``A Croatian
team has never achieved anything this important.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Dario Simic said: ``It is a big, big, big, big, big
victory for us. It's a dream. We're a small country. Right now,
it's incredible what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Croatia and Germany enjoy a complicated relationship and a
brief, but ill-tempered, soccer history. Croatia's Ustacha regime
was a Nazi puppet in World War II, and Germany, along with the
Vatican, was the first nation to recognize Croatia's independence
from Yugoslavia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing sweeter than to defeat your friends,''
Blazevic said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic had called for revenge for a dyspeptic match between
the two teams in the 1996 European championships, in which the
Croatian defender Robert Jarni was ejected and Germany prevailed,
2-1, in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, it was Germany that was stung by a red card in
the 40th minute when defender Worns took out the legs of Suker and
sent him windmilling.
</P>
<P>
   The tackle seemed more clumsy than wicked, but Pedersen
apparently issued a red card because the takedown had been made in
the open field. Worns put his hands to his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 32 minutes, Croatia did not even manage a shot on
goal, while Germany streamed down the flanks and threatened
constantly. But, with Worns out, Germany's spirit visibly deflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 30 minutes were the best performance by the German
team,'' defender Juergen Kohler said. ``I don't think the sending
off was fair. I think we have to say the referee lost the game, not
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first half extended into three minutes of extra time,
Germany's short-handed defense displayed inevitable vulnerability.
Mario Stanic, the Croatian midfielder, cleverly pushed the ball to
his left to the area vacated by Worns, where Jarni was waiting.
Jorg Heinrich tried to pinch in with help from the wing, but all
the German midfielder could do was turn his back as Jarni unleashed
a searing blast that bounced once and slammed into the right corner
of the net from 25 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams missed repeated chances to score from point-blank
range in the second half, and Germany grew more desperate, removing
playmaker Thomas Hassler and the free-kick expert Dietmar Hamann as
Vogts went with four forwards.
</P>
<P>
   But that left the midfield depleted, and Croatia scored again on
a counterattack rocket by Goran Vlaovic in the 80th minute. If that
was not dispiriting enough for the Germans, Suker put a shot
through the legs of goalie Andreas Kopke in the 85th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine what we've done,'' the Croatian
midfielder Aljosa Asanovic said. ``Maybe in the morning we will
understand. Right now it is impossible.''

EVIDENCE INDICATES NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS REDUCE AIDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A collection of 17 studies unveiled here last week
shows beyond doubt, researchers say, that the AIDS epidemic among
New York City's 150,000 injecting drug users has been brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which were almost lost amid the thousands of
reports at the 12th World AIDS Conference that adjourned Friday,
provide the first convincing evidence that programs to reduce
sharing of hypodermic syringes among drug users can reverse the
course of the epidemic within this highest-risk population.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has repeatedly shown such programs reduce risky
behavior, but this is the first to link these prevention efforts to
the bottom line: a broad and lasting impact on new AIDS virus
infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great news that it is possible to control this epidemic''
among drug users ``is one of the best things we've heard in more
than 15 years,'' said Don C. DesJarlais, perhaps the world's
leading authority on this facet of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   DesJarlais conducted the studies with colleagues at New York's
Beth Israel Medical Center, where he heads the Chemical Dependency
Unit, and the New York City Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Since about half of the nation's estimated 40,000 new AIDS-virus
infections each year occur among injecting drug users or their sex
partners, the New York findings carry major implications for
reining in the overall epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The New York studies also appear likely to revive a stalemated
debate about the urgency of funding needle exchange programs to
reduce transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, among
drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledged in late April that
providing sterile needles and syringes to drug users reduces the
spread of AIDS while not increasing illicit drug use. But President
Clinton decided not to fund needle exchange efforts after a fierce
debate among his top advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new data make even more unconscionable the Clinton
administration's refusal to fund needle exchange programs,'' said
Peter Lurie of the Washington-based Health Research Group.
``Responsibility for the unnecessary infections that will ensue
lies with Bill Clinton himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helene Gayle, who heads AIDS programs at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, last week acknowledged that
politics rather than public health data are obstructing federal
funding for needle exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know science should be the basis of our policy,'' Gayle
said. ``But it's not a perfect world. People in policy roles juggle
a lot of things. Needle exchange is a complex issue in a complex
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration, federal funding of needle
exchanges has been opposed by General Barry McCaffrey, the director
of the White House Office on Drug Policy, who is concerned about
the message such programs send to drug users. That sentiment is
shared by Congress. On April 29 the House of Representatives voted
287-140 against funding needle exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Other than transfusion of blood containing HIV _ no longer a
problem in developed countries _ sharing contaminated needles is
the most efficient way to spread the deadly virus. Needle-sharing
among illicit drug users also spreads hepatitis B and C, two other
dangerous viral infections.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp reduction in needle-sharing in New York, researchers say,
is a major factor in bringing the spread of HIV there under
control. That is something many thought would never happen in New
York, which has the world's biggest and longest-established
drug-associated AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has tallied more cases of AIDS among injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children _ up to 80,000,
using the current definition of the disease _ than any European
country.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say an epidemic has been controlled when
new cases do not exceed one or two cases for every 100
``person-years at risk,'' or 100 people at risk of infection for
one year. At that rate, an epidemic is no longer growing.
</P>
<P>
   Five new studies show that HIV infections among injecting drug
users in New York are occurring at a rate of 1.4 cases per 100
person-years. In the early 1980s, when HIV infections were
spreading explosively among the city's illicit drug users, the rate
was 13 per 100 person-years.
</P>
<P>
   Another dozen studies, involving more than 11,000 New York City
drug users, show that the percentage who are infected at a given
time, a measure known as seroprevalence, has dropped from 44
percent in the 1980s to 28 percent recently.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp decline in HIV transmission and prevalence among New
York drug users has not yet shown up in the statistics for the
number of AIDS cases, DesJarlais said, because there is a 10-year
lag time between HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent
triple-drug treatments to suppress HIV, which are getting to a
sizable fraction of addicts and recovering addicts, may increase
that lag.
</P>
<P>
   DesJarlais, who has been tracking HIV in drug users for years,
said he first began to suspect the falloff in infections within the
past year. But the ``eureka moment'' did not occur until he pulled
together data to present in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The findings represent a broad spectrum of drug users from drug
treatment programs, clinics for sexually transmitted diseases,
street outreach efforts, and needle exchange programs. All showed
very similar drops in both the proportion of HIV-infected clients
and new cases of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   DesJarlais said the reductions appear due, in about equal
measure, to two factors. First, thousands of drug users infected in
the 1980s have died, so they are not infecting others in
exponential fashion.
</P>
<P>
   More important, from a public health standpoint, is the
undeniable effect of needle exchange programs. Beginning in 1992,
New York State began funding such efforts, and now spends about $1
million on them in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the city's 150,000 injecting drug users are
participating in needle exchange programs, DesJarlais said. An
earlier study found a 70 percent drop in new HIV infections among
drug users in needle exchange programs compared with others not
obtaining clean needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a dramatic change in risky behavior along with the
drop in prevalence and incidence'' of HIV among drug users, the
researcher said. The proportion of users' injections that involve
shared syringes has dropped in recent years from about half to
around 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But DesJarlais cautioned that risky behavior could increase
again if prevention efforts are not maintained _ or if the price of
heroin increases, which would drive many addicts to switch from
sniffing the drug to injecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are about 120 needle exchange programs funded
by states, cities and private groups. Massachusetts has
state-funded programs in Boston, Cambridge, Provincetown, and
Northampton.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark importance of the New York studies was not lost on
those at the conference who are struggling with rapidly growing
AIDS epidemics among drug users in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important information,'' said Alec Katchaturian
of the Russian Federation, where injecting drug use is behind
explosive growth in HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the situation we were about 1979,'' DesJarlais told
Katchaturian.

STRONG WINDS CAN'T MOVE PAK OUT OF THE OPEN LEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Strong winds arrived at the U.S. Women's Open on
Saturday, causing havoc throughout the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were so treacherous that nobody was able to break
par. Saturday's course average was 77.8, more than six strokes over
par (71). And when the blustery third round was over, the outcome
of the year's third women's major was left very much up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving the most demanding day of her young career, Se Ri Pak,
at one over for the tournament, took a one-stroke lead over Mhairi
McKay and Liselotte Neumann into Sunday's final round at the
Blackwolf Run course. Pak's three-round total of 214 left her a
shade ahead of McKay, a little-known 23-year-old from Glasgow,
Scotland, and Neumann, who won the Open in 1988 and has already won
two tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
   With winds gusting to more than 25 miles an hour on a course
that is extremely difficult under normal conditions, shooting a low
score Saturday was out of the question. Saturday is called moving
day in golf, but this Saturday, players moved in reverse. The idea
wasn't to win the tournament, but to avoid a disastrous round that
could lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Pak did exactly that, shooting a four-over 75. Starting the
third round with a one-stroke lead over Neumann, Pak once again
showed remarkable composure for a 20-year-old, regrouping to regain
the lead after losing it on the first hole and then making a
double-bogey three-putt at No. 13 that dropped her two strokes
behind Neumann at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Pak has stumbled on some holes like everyone else in this
tournament, but she has never fallen flat on her face. Resiliency
may be the key to victory Sunday, particularly if conditions are
like Saturday's. But if Pak can hold her lead, she will become the
first woman since Meg Mallon in 1991 to win back-to-back majors.
Pak, who won the McDonald's LPGA Championship in May, would also
become the first player since Laura Davies in 1996 to win two
majors in the same year, and the first rookie since Juli Inkster in
1984 to win two majors.
</P>
<P>
   That is lofty company, but for Pak to emerge from her trying day
still holding the lead showed something about her toughness and her
talent. Putting continued to be the one weakness in her arsenal, as
she made costly three-putts on No. 10 and No. 14. But over all, her
game was still good enough to hold onto the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very happy, because it's a big tournament and I'm still
the leader,'' said Pak, a native of Korea. ``I played well on a
tough course. After winning the McDonald's, I have more confidence
in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neumann, who had one of the most emotional 75s that a player
could have, also showed she is a special player, making the day's
most dramatic shot, a crucial par saving chip-in from in from about
35 yards that should send her into Sunday with momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The round was like a roller-coaster ride for Neumann. She
cruised through the first six holes at two under par, to reach four
under for the tournament. But then Neumann lost her rhythm and
plummeted into deep trouble. After making back-to-back bogeys at No
7 and No. 8, Neumann fell out of first place on the brutal back
nine, making five consecutive bogeys starting at the 11th hole. A
lesser player may have completely lost her composure, but Neumann
made a key 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 16, followed by her
sensational chip shot at 18.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting her second shot at No. 18 into the water, and
looking at almost a sure bogey at best, Neumann saved par when the
chip in landed softly on the green and rolled as if radar-guided
into the cup. It was an emotional boost for Neumann, who raised her
arms in triumph, as the gallery surrounding the green roared. And
Neumann's chip-in became even bigger, when Pak three-putted for
bogey at 18, cutting her two-stroke lead in half heading into
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie McKay's round of 73, which tied her for best of the
day, was both a surprise and a thrill for her. She actually reached
the 17th tee holding a one-stroke lead over Pak, but McKay hit her
tee shot at 17 into the water, leading to a double-bogey. Yet, she
was still in position for an improbable win. ``Whatever happens
tomorrow will be a dream come true for me.'' Said McKay. ``You
dream of being in contention at the Open when you're growing up.
I'm just going to concentrate on each shot and see what happens.''

Netherlands edges Argentina
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ It was beginning to look as if a third World
Cup championship was in the cards for Argentina _ red and yellow
cards.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Argentines again benefited from a referee's
whistle to go a man up during the critical stages of an elimination
game Saturday, Argentina forward Ariel Ortega trumped his nation's
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wholly ironic moment, considering how Argentina had
used a similar blunder on the way to this World Cup quarterfinal
game, then caught another break when the Netherlands' Arthur Numan
was sent off.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ill-advised and unforgettable fit of emotion that made
England's David Beckham's spasm last week look like a tender
moment. It also was all the Dutch needed to turn things around and
pull out a thrilling 2-1 last-minute victory that sends them to the
World Cup semifinals for the first time since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking like we were going to win,'' Argentina coach
Daniel Passarella said, ``and then we were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes left in regulation in a game that had swung
Argentina's way, Ortega earned a red card for head-butting
Netherlands goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, veteran Dutch star Dennis Bergkamp scored perhaps
the best goal of the tournament, making sure Argentina paid for
Ortega's blunder and powering the ball into the net in the 90th
minute for the remarkable Dutch victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a tremendous way to end the game and win it,'' Bergkamp
said. ``We had to work very hard today. When we went down a man, it
wasn't looking good. There was so much tension and nervousness for
us. But now, this is terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Argentina's victory over England in the round of 16, which
was helped greatly when England's Beckham was red-carded early in
the second half, is only a distant memory for the heartbroken
Argentines.
</P>
<P>
   The blue and white clearly had another terrific chance to win
and advance when Numan was thrown out for earning his second yellow
card after a hard tackle against Argentina's Diego Simeone in the
77th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican referee Arturo Brizio Carter's decision left Argentina
playing 11 on 10 with the score tied at 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in trouble,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Numan's ejection, the entertaining game had swung back and
forth all day, although the Dutch were getting more chances in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch had taken the lead in the opening minutes of this
scorching afternoon when Patrick Kluivert took a header from
Bergkamp in the 12th minute and calmly beat Argentina goalkeeper
Carlos Roa.
</P>
<P>
   But just six minutes later Argentina equalized when Claudio
Lopez beat the Dutch to a pass from Juan Veron and slid the ball
through van der Sar's legs.
</P>
<P>
   But by the second half, the South Americans seemed to wither in
the heat, not the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holland had more control and pushed us back,'' Passarella
said. ``Fatigue set in from the England game. But we
counterattacked and still looked dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Numan's second yellow card and expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Once Argentina gained the numbers edge, it attacked with more
gusto and took two good shots, including one by Gabriel Batistuta
that bounced off the left post.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ortega, who also hammered a shot off the left upright, made
the decision that both sides will remember for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible twist of fate,'' Passarella said. ``I didn't
see it very well, but what I think doesn't matter because we lost a
player and a very key player.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence began when Ortega tried to draw a penalty kick by
diving inside the Dutch box after contact with defender Japp Stam.
</P>
<P>
   Carter did not fall for the trick and was pulling out a yellow
card to penalize Ortega for trying to draw the call.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as van der Sar stood over Ortega complaining about his
dive, Ortega rose quickly and jammed his head into van der Sar's
face, hitting him hard in the chin and mouth and flooring the Dutch
goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ortega's sending off gave us new heart,'' Bergkamp said. ``We
thought we deserved to win this game and wanted to somehow find a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between van der Sar and Ortega was it. It gave the
Dutch renewed life and jolted their attack.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes after Ortega was tossed and the regulation
clock was winding down, Holland's Frank de Boer lofted a long pass
toward Bergkamp that led to the remarkable highlight-reel goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bergkamp brought down the nearly 40-yard pass on the fly with
his right foot and cut the ball back against Argentine defender
Roberto Ayala and toward the goal. He then used his right foot to
drive it past Roa into the back of the net and into World Cup lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never imagine scoring a goal like that, it just
happens,'' Bergkamp sad. ``When the ball was coming to me I thought
I had a chance to catch it and as it turned out Frank got it to me
perfectly. What a thrill to be in a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch now must face defending champion Brazil in Marseille
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them come,'' Bergkamp said. ``We can beat them. This team
is very confident. We are getting better with every game.''

EVIDENCE INDICATES NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS REDUCE AIDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A collection of 17 studies unveiled here last week
shows beyond doubt, researchers say, that the AIDS epidemic among
New York City's 150,000 injecting drug users has been brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which were almost lost amid the thousands of
reports at the 12th World AIDS Conference that adjourned Friday,
provide the first convincing evidence that programs to reduce
sharing of hypodermic syringes among drug users can reverse the
course of the epidemic within this highest-risk population.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has repeatedly shown such programs reduce risky
behavior, but this is the first to link these prevention efforts to
the bottom line: a broad and lasting impact on new AIDS virus
infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great news that it is possible to control this epidemic''
among drug users ``is one of the best things we've heard in more
than 15 years,'' said Don C. DesJarlais, perhaps the world's
leading authority on this facet of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   DesJarlais conducted the studies with colleagues at New York's
Beth Israel Medical Center, where he heads the Chemical Dependency
Unit, and the New York City Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Since about half of the nation's estimated 40,000 new AIDS-virus
infections each year occur among injecting drug users or their sex
partners, the New York findings carry major implications for
reining in the overall epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The New York studies also appear likely to revive a stalemated
debate about the urgency of funding needle exchange programs to
reduce transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, among
drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledged in late April that
providing sterile needles and syringes to drug users reduces the
spread of AIDS while not increasing illicit drug use. But President
Clinton decided not to fund needle exchange efforts after a fierce
debate among his top advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new data make even more unconscionable the Clinton
administration's refusal to fund needle exchange programs,'' said
Peter Lurie of the Washington-based Health Research Group.
``Responsibility for the unnecessary infections that will ensue
lies with Bill Clinton himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helene Gayle, who heads AIDS programs at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, last week acknowledged that
politics rather than public health data are obstructing federal
funding for needle exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know science should be the basis of our policy,'' Gayle
said. ``But it's not a perfect world. People in policy roles juggle
a lot of things. Needle exchange is a complex issue in a complex
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration, federal funding of needle
exchanges has been opposed by General Barry McCaffrey, the director
of the White House Office on Drug Policy, who is concerned about
the message such programs send to drug users. That sentiment is
shared by Congress. On April 29 the House of Representatives voted
287-140 against funding needle exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Other than transfusion of blood containing HIV _ no longer a
problem in developed countries _ sharing contaminated needles is
the most efficient way to spread the deadly virus. Needle-sharing
among illicit drug users also spreads hepatitis B and C, two other
dangerous viral infections.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp reduction in needle-sharing in New York, researchers say,
is a major factor in bringing the spread of HIV there under
control. That is something many thought would never happen in New
York, which has the world's biggest and longest-established
drug-associated AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has tallied more cases of AIDS among injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children _ up to 80,000,
using the current definition of the disease _ than any European
country.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say an epidemic has been controlled when
new cases do not exceed one or two cases for every 100
``person-years at risk,'' or 100 people at risk of infection for
one year. At that rate, an epidemic is no longer growing.
</P>
<P>
   Five new studies show that HIV infections among injecting drug
users in New York are occurring at a rate of 1.4 cases per 100
person-years. In the early 1980s, when HIV infections were
spreading explosively among the city's illicit drug users, the rate

</P>

York drug users has not yet shown up in the statistics for the

lag time between HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent

BRITISH ARMY BRACES FOR CONFLICT IN PORTADOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ When you ask Catholics here why
they don't want the Orange Order to march down Garvaghy Road, they
inevitably bring up Robert Hamill and Adrian Lamph.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill, 25, was kicked to death last year by a loyalist mob in
the town center, allegedly in front of police who did nothing.
Lamph, 28, was shot dead in April in the town recycling yard where
he worked, singled out by loyalist extremists because his Garvaghy
Road address marked him as a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   When you ask Protestants why they should be allowed to march in
a Catholic neighborhood where they are not wanted, they inevitably
bring up the years 1807 and 1916. Orangemen have been marching the
same route to and from Drumcree Church since 1807, and the service
from which they want to march down the Garvaghy Road commemorates
the Battle of the Somme in 1916, when thousands of loyal Ulstermen
died in service to their king.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland has voted to
endorse the Good Friday agreement that accommodates the different
aspirations of a divided society, where Protestant unionists want
to remain in the United Kingdom and Catholic nationalists want to
join the Irish Republic. In doing so, most people have decided to
endorse the future in a place that has long been beholden to the
past.
</P>
<P>
   But here in ``Portydown,'' as many locals pronounce it, history
and the dead still wield enormous influence. The spirit of
compromise and accommodation has not trickled down here. Instead,
there is the Spirit of Drumcree, a radical wing of Orangemen who
say this is the last stand, the Alamo of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been painted into a corner,'' said Joel Patton, the
Spirit of Drumcree leader. ``We've nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Sunday, confrontation seems inevitable. Orangemen vow to
defy a British government ban against marching down the Garvaghy
Road. Catholic nationalists, who are a minority in Portadown and
segregated in their housing projects just outside the town center,
are in no mood to make concessions to the Orangemen, who refuse to
meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   The British army, meanwhile, spent Saturday digging in for what
could be a long standoff. Two years ago, police blocked the
Orangemen from marching for five days before giving in to the
violence and threats of loyalists who turned up by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is the army, not the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
that appears to be taking the lead role in assuring that loyalists
are prevented from gathering in enough numbers to wreak havoc.
Saturday, army engineers erected steel barriers in the fields that
surround Drumcree Church, which sits on a hill, less than a
half-mile from the top of the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that Portadown is a microcosm of the problems
in Northern Ireland, and in many ways it is. But it is also
something of an anomaly. Most of Northern Ireland has moved well
beyond squabbles over parades. Unionists and nationalists have
agreed to share real power, in a real assembly, 26 years after the
British Parliament decided they were incapable of governing.
</P>
<P>
   But here, hatred is palpable and neither side feels it is in a
position to be magnanimous. The Orangemen cite their heritage and
civil rights in refusing to budge. Catholic nationalists say that
their heritage and civil rights have been trampled for years and
that they are not going to take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   As Breandan Mac Cionnaith, the local residents' leader,
explains, nothing has changed in Portadown, despite the
overwhelming endorsement of the Good Friday agreement and the
successful inaugural meeting last Wednesday of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community continues to be marginalized, demonized, and
ignored,'' said Mac Cionnaith, whose imprisonment for a 1974
bombing of the local British Army veterans hall by the Irish
Republican Army is cited by Orangemen in refusing to meet with
residents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Garvaghy Road residents agreed to let the march proceed
with the understanding that there would be no triumphalist
displays, and with a promise from the local police commander that
any future parades would require the consent of residents. But
after Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and the Rev. Ian
Paisley, a fundamentalist preacher who leads the most
uncompromising of unionists, were photographed dancing gleefully
down the road and proclaiming a ``victory'' in getting the parade
through, Mac Cionnaith and the residents dug in their heels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after police relented against the loyalist threat and
beat nationalists off the road to let the parade pass, widespread
rioting flared throughout Northern Ireland. Last year, the police
chief, Ronnie Flanagan, decided that letting the parade through was
the ``lesser of two evils.'' Again, residents were forcibly moved
from the road so the parade could pass. Again, riots flared.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Parades Commission, created by the British
government to arbitrate parade disputes, ruled that in the interest
of stability throughout Northern Ireland, the march would be
rerouted away from the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Although they pride themselves as sticklers on law and order,
Orangemen say they don't recognize the legitimacy of the Parades
Commission. Nationalists want to see the government stand up to the
Orangemen. Here in Portydown, compromise is just a word.
</P>
<P>
   As happens almost every July in Portadown in particular and
Northern Ireland in general, churches and social clubs on both
sides are being burned down. People are packing their cars and
heading off, if they can. The threat that the situation here poses
to the new-found stability of Northern Ireland led British Prime
Minister Tony Blair to visit Thursday to plead for cooler heads to
prevail. It led President Clinton, whose administration has
invested much time and money in the peace process, to interrupt his
China visit to ask people here to not lose sight of the bigger
picture.
</P>
<P>
   But for many here there is no bigger picture. For the 3,000 or
so Catholics who live on or just off the Garvaghy Road, their world
is roughly a square mile, their horizons confined by St. John the
Baptist's Church to the north, and the railway line to the south.
Many of them would not think of venturing into the town center,
just a short stroll from the bottom of the Garvaghy Road, after
nightfall, lest they be stomped to death like Bobby Hamill.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, David Burrows, a leading Orangeman, says
Protestants have nothing left to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give anything more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Monica McWilliams, the leader of the Women's
Coalition, was beaming after the Assembly's inaugural meeting. It
went more smoothly than anyone could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   But as Portadown and contentious parades in her native Belfast
next week loomed, even the optimistic McWilliams acknowledged,
almost apologetically, that she and her family were taking a
vacation. ``It's been a long year,'' she sighed.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long week, especially in Portydown.

 &HT;    Incoming Carson CEO hints of a new look
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Gregory Andrews joins Carson as its new chief
executive officer in a few weeks, he faces an industry at a
crossroads but one that still has potential for strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next several years _ as we move toward year 2000 _ are
going to be very interesting,'' said Andrews during a telephone
interview from his Colgate-Palmolive office in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andrews says it is too early for him to talk about a
specific strategy, he is clearly aware of the challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, 46, began his career at Johnson Products, another
ethnic personal care company, and once owned his own ethnic hair
care business. ``I think it's moving away from small, family-run
businesses to bigger, publicly held companies. These companies are
now giving much more attention to black consumers, largely because
everybody in consumer products is looking for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds to the pressure Savannah-based Carson already faces:
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, with a 52-week high of $13.50 and a closing
price of as high as $10.75 in mid-April, ended this week at $7.68
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   It reported a loss of $501,000, or 3 cents a share, on revenue
of $31.8 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Roy Keith, who stepped down as chief executive, said
the second quarter ``will probably be no better'' than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its outlook on the
company to negative from stable amid concerns about soft earnings
in its core businesses. Carson, for its part, has said it wants to
strengthen its core business and solidify relationships with
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Carson was a closely held company that churned out
industry leading products such as Dark &AMP; Lovely hair relaxers and
colorings and Magic shaving products.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, an investor group, which included Keith, acquired the
company. They took it public a little more than a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the company embarked upon an acquisition
spree, buying Let's Jam and Cutex, which Carson recently announced
it would sell. Carson recently announced it would acquire Johnson
Products and Posner in a $70 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   It began eyeing international markets, buying Nu-Me' Cosmetics
of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't that many ways to grow,'' said Ken Smikle,
publisher of Target Market News, which tracks the ethnic market.
``You have to grow internationally and increase domestic share
through acquisition, introducing new products and diversifying into
related products lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But the competition hasn't been sitting still. L'Oreal S.A. of
Paris said it plans to acquire Soft Sheen Products, a major maker
of ethnic products.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction ``will create strategic growth opportunities for
ethnic beauty for L'Oreal and Soft Sheen, allowing the company to
expand its reach to black people globally,'' said a press release
announcing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The problems at Carson are indicative of the $3 billion ethnic
health and beauty aids industry, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the industry experienced double-digit growth, and the
ethnic market was so attractive that it grabbed the attention of
mainline corporations such as Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   But in time, the explosive growth began tapering off, driven in
part by price wars that drove down the price of hair relaxers, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Carson and other product makers, have been hurt by
drug store consolidation. By one estimate, as much as 40 percent of
Carson's business is done through drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of suppliers, the mergers have had the affect of
freezing them out of certain major chains,'' said James Frederick,
senior pharmacy editor for Drug Store News. ``If the larger chain
doesn't deal with Carson, then chances are those contracts aren't
renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the industry, which once spawned several black
millionaires, saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't maintain double-digit growth forever in anything,''
said Nathaniel Bronner, vice president of manufacturing for
Marietta-based Bronner Brothers. ``It has to come to a point,
sooner or later, when things are going to level off. I think it
(the industry) has held up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson's Andrews thinks so as well. He said he would like to see
the company continue its international expansion and target other
ethnic markets. Additionally, he wants the company to introduce new
products to generate consumer interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think companies with strong brands like Dark &AMP; Lovely, Magic
and Ultra Sheen will have an edge,'' said Andrews. Still, ``those
companies have got to be smarter and faster than the big guy.
There's plenty of room for all of us and hopefully, the consumer
will be the big winner.''

 &HT;    Too easy too early to be true
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Sometimes things look easier than they
really are. Just ask Kenny Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Success came so quickly that Irwin just now is realizing how
difficult things can be on the Winston Cup circuit. He finds
himself more appreciative of the guiding hand that team owner
Robert Yates extended a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin had some success last year during the final stages of his
rookie season, and he had no reason to believe this year would be
any different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got spoiled,'' said Irwin, who qualified second and finished
eighth last fall in Richmond. ``Robert told me then, 'Don't get a
big head, because this isn't the way it's always going to be,' and
I kind of laughed it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Things had come easily for Irwin. He was the 1993 Rookie of the
Year in the Sprint Car series, top rookie a year later in the
Silver Crown series, champion in 1996 of the Midget Series and
rookie of the year in last season's truck series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to happen, but I didn't want it to
happen,'' said Yates, who had released veteran Ernie Irvan and
signed a young man who never had raced Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot to ask of a driver,'' Yates said, ``to be at the
first time at a place and to do all things right, to find that
edge. But every person who has ever raced has to go through this.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the Primestar 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway that
Irwin realized it. He led much of the race before settling for
fifth place in his fourth start of the season. Yates didn't get too
excited, but his driver did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking the whole year was going to be like this,''
Irwin said. ``Well, Robert told me that weekend the whole year
wasn't gonna be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reckoning came on his home turf, and it was the ultimate
racing disappointment. Irwin failed to make the field for the
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated, but Robert made it easier for me to get
through it,'' Irwin said. ``It was an eye-opener. It was like I had
been exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   And, that, says fellow driver Jeremy Mayfield, changes
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate enough to go through steps,'' said Mayfield, a
five-year veteran who won for the first time two weeks ago. ``My
first two years, if I ran good, everybody knew about it. If I ran
bad, everybody would say it was normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in Kenny's situation, though, and you don't
perform, it makes you look 10 times worse than you really are. I'm
glad I didn't have the kind of pressure he's under.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin rebounded from the Charlotte slip with a couple of top 10s
and moved up eight positions, from 34th to 26th, on the driver
points list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned more in the last three or four months than I ever
would imagine,'' Irwin said. ``It's just what Robert has been
telling me all along: I've just got to be patient.''

   Winston cup
</P>
<P>
   Teams playing musical drivers
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a recent trend, you might need a scorecard to keep up
with driver changes from a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   For instance:
</P>
<P>
   This week, instead of Earl Sadler's car, Andy Hillenberg is
driving the car owned by LJ Racing, which saw its driver, Kevin
Lepage, leave to join Roush Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Shepherd sat out last week but was in the Buz McCall Cat
car last week, replacing Robby Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Bud Moore already had decided not to bother with this
Pepsi 400, citing a poor testing performance at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   And Todd Bodine, who normally drives the No. 35 Tabasco Pontiac,
is out, and Loy Allen is in. Team owner Bob Hanchen will decide who
takes it from there.
</P>
<P>
   Together, again
</P>
<P>
   Waddell Wilson and Geoff Bodine are a team again. Wilson, who
most recently worked for Darrell Waltrip, has been named vice
president of operations for Mattei Motorsports, overseeing the
team's day-to-day operations. Wilson was Bodine's crew chief in
1989 at Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mast is fully recovered from carbon-monoxide poisoning and
dehydration after last week's SaveMart 300 at Sears Point, where he
finished eighth. ... Kyle Petty is weighing the possibility of
running his son, Adam, in some NASCAR events this fall, after the
22-race ASA schedule ends in September.
</P>
<P>
   Busch series
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot's track
</P>
<P>
   If there are tracks for certain drivers, put Buckshot Jones down
as a Milwaukee Mile Man.
</P>
<P>
   It's where he made his Busch Grand National debut and where in
1996 he won his first race under the most unusual circumstances. He
didn't realize he'd won the race until his crew told him over their
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the checkered flag because the windshield was so
dirty,'' Jones said. ``I thought there was a lap to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished fourth last year and is one of the favorites in
today's DieHard 250.
</P>
<P>
   On to Myrtle Beach
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Sadler isn't looking past Milwaukee, just looking
forward to the Advance Auto Parts 250 in Myrtle Beach. It's the
site of his most impressive victory, where he set the qualifying
and race records. All that after overcoming an early wreck and
having to conserve his tires.
</P>
<P>
   Craftsman trucks
</P>
<P>
   Big lead, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sprague had good news and bad news heading into Saturday's
DieHard 200 at the Milwaukee Mile. The good news was that no
competitor in the series' four-year history had taken a bigger
points lead into the annual event.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that no driver has entered or left Milwaukee
with the points lead and gone on to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Rich Bickle held a 44-point lead over Sprague at
this point, but Sprague came back, winning the title by 232 points.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Andy Houston has a 16-point lead over Greg Biffle in the Rookie
of the Year standings going into Saturday's race. ... Jerry
Glanville returned to the Craftsman series Saturday after his
injury while attempting to qualify for a NASCAR Winston West race
in Phoenix.

 &HT;    Sorenstam `drained' after a crushing 79
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ You can add Annika Sorenstam to the list of
casualties on a day when Blackwolf Run huffed and puffed and blew
down the field of the U.S. Women's Open. The two-time champion was
rendered weary by a third-round 79 Saturday that included a
quintuple-bogey 9 on the par-4, 402-yard third hole. She ended the
day out of the tournament and out of breath at 12-over 225.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the course is playing, par is 75 today,'' Sorenstam
said. ``You just scratch your head. You don't know what to do. You
saw the wind. You end up in places you can't hit from. I just want
to get out of this wind. I'm drained.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news? Sorenstam played the last 10 holes in 1-under.
But for the second straight year the Swede has fallen to some giant
numbers, not what you would expect from Ms. Fairways and Greens.
Last year at Pumpkin Ridge she opened with a 77 that was
highlighted by a quadruple bogey. This year she made a quad in the
first round, then went higher Saturday, taking the 9, then
following it with a double-bogey at the 415-yard seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit driver, 3-wood short,'' Sorenstam said. ``I would have
needed Tiger Woods' swing to get on that green.''
</P>
<P>
   At No. 3 Sorenstam hit her approach with a 4-iron left of the
green into some high weeds. In hindsight, taking an unplayable lie
might have been prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a sand wedge and moved it about three inches,'' she
said. ``I tried again, and moved it about four inches. The third
time I didn't go anywhere. The fourth time I hit it as hard as I
could and went over the green.''
</P>
<P>
   She chipped up and 2-putted for a 9.
</P>
<P>
   The 421-yard, par-4 18th hole was playing like a par-5 for many
players. Sorenstam hit driver 30 yards shorter than she normally
does. Her 3-wood approach traveled 20 yards below average.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're talking about a 470-yard par 4,'' Sorenstam said,
``with water on the left. It's got all the hazards in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Departing after her highest score in 17 U.S. Open rounds,
Sorenstam said, ``I'm just going to go and try to forget this
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Third ace an Open record
</P>
<P>
   Brandie Burton's hole-in-one on the 142-yard 13th hole, with a
6-iron, Saturday, was the third ace of the tournament and a Women's
Open record. Earlier aces were recorded on the 152-yard eighth hole
by Clarissa Childs and Helen Alfredsson. ... South Korea's Se Ri
Pak can become the first rookie in 14 years to win two majors in
one year. Juli Inkster is the only other player to accomplish it,
winning the Nabisco Dinah Shore and the du Maurier Classic in 1984.
Meg Mallon was the last player to win back-to-back majors _ the
1991 Open and McDonald's LPGA Championship. The last player to win
two majors in one season was Laura Davies (du Maurier Classic,
McDonald's LPGA, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Cut comes at 8-over par
</P>
<P>
   When 21 players stopped by darkness Friday night completed their
second rounds Saturday morning, the cut was established at
8-over-par 150, with 62 players moving to weekend play. Missing the
cut by a stroke was Newnan's Cindy McCurdy (77-74 _ 151). ... What
do you suppose were the odds that Nancy Lopez would not only miss
the cut, but miss it by 10 shots? Less surprising was defending
champion Alison Nicholas' failure to qualify for weekend play. She
shot 78-78 _ 156. ``With the pressure attached to this, it makes
you play a bit worse sometimes,'' said Nicholas. ``I'm sure that
Nancy felt the same about it.'' ... Cecelia Logan, 49, of Jamison,
Pa., who was hit just below the right eye with a golf ball struck
by Lopez on the first hole, was released Friday night the Sheboygan
Clinic, where she was evaulated by an ophthalmologist. Logan must
have a follow-up appointment, but early indications were of no loss
of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Local knowledge draws fans
</P>
<P>
   One player discovered a certain way to gain local support from
Wisconsin golf fans. LaRee Sugg wore a yellow hair bow with a Green
Packers emblem on it. ... Karrie Webb, who started the third round
at 7-over par, made a brief move Saturday. She birdied the first
three holes of her back nine, then double-bogeyed 14 and bogeyed 15
on the way to a 2-over 73 and 54-hole total of 9-over 213. ...
Hollis Stacy's 29th consecutive Women's Open appearance tied a
record set earlier by Kathy Whitworth.

 &HT;    Pak not at par, but leads Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ With winds gusting to 25 mph and scores soaring
into the obscene range, the U.S. Women's Open became a battle for
survival Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first major golf tournament ever held in Wisconsin turned
into a veritable Green Muenster.
</P>
<P>
   Very few players managed to survive. Nobody even matched par. Of
the first 44 players to finish Saturday, 13 of them shot 80 or
higher. Nobody is shooting par _ not even leader Se Ri Pak of South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, when all the triple-bogeys were tallied and the
wounds treated, the 20-year-old Pak emerged as the 54-hole leader.
The lead bounced among Pak, Sweden's Liselotte Neumann and
Scotland's Mhairi (pronouned Var-ee) McKay during the turbulent
third round, but Pak managed to regain the lead at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a three-putt bogey at the 18th, Pak took a one-stroke
leading heading into today's final round with a 4-over 75 and a
54-hole total of 21-over 214.
</P>
<P>
   McKay, a LPGA tour rookie from Glasgow, had a two-shot lead with
four holes to play, but slipped. She found the water hazard at the
par-3 17th and double-bogeyed, then bogeyed the 18th to finish at
2-over 215, one shot behind Pak.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, who started the day a stroke behind Pak, fell apart on
the back nine with five straight bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Through six holes Neumann had a six-shot lead on McKay and led
Pack by two through 10 holes. Neumann finished with a 75 and also
is two shots behind Pak at 215.

   A day after Nancy Lopez missed the cut with a second-round 83,
two-time champion Annika Sorenstam disappeared from any glimmer of
contention. Sorenstam took a quintuple bogey on the third hole en
route to a 79 and is at 12-over 225.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting the day's low round on Friday, Savannah native
Hollis Stacy saw the other side of life with an 11-over 82.

   Once the second half begins, the Orioles will begin moving
players. They really have no choice. Baltimore has a $70 million
payroll and is 24 1/2 games out of first. General manager Pat
Gillick also is expected to retire at the end of the year. Players
on the trading block include second baseman Roberto Alomar, first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro and outfielder Joe Carter. Those around
baseball are saying the Braves are interested in Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Toronto's Dave Stieb has returned to the majors after a
five-year absence. Only two major-leaguers, both pitchers, have
been away longer. ``Ball Four'' author Jim Bouton returned after
missing seven years, making his comeback with the Braves in 1978.
Hod Lisenbee returned with the Reds in 1945 after taking off nine
years. . . . Expect Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams, out
with a knee injury, to return to the lineup on July 9, when New
York opens the second half against Tampa Bay. . . . The Blue Jays'
signing of the troubled Tony Phillips shows just how desperate they
are for offense. ... Don't be surprised to see autographed balls
soon with the signatures of David Wells and Don Larsen, the only
Yankees ever to pitch perfect games.

   Word from Cleveland has the Braves interested in acquiring
Indians reliever Jose Mesa, whose days at Jacobs Field appear to be
finished. Mesa is 2-3 at home with a 5.86 ERA and is getting booed
every time he walks to the mound. ``I think it's become a little
psychological for him at Jacobs Field,'' general manager John Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A lot of teams are calling the Twins about reliever Rick
Aguilera, who has 17 saves and has converted 12 of his last 13
opportunities. . . . White Sox outfielder Albert Belle became the
12th player to reach the upper deck at the Astrodome last week. . .
. Cleveland's David Justice recently went 80 at-bats between
homers. . . . In the first inning this season, the Tigers have been
outscored 79-31. . . . Royals manager Tony Muser on ex-Brave
Jermaine Dye, who is back in the minors because he was hitting
.213: ``Jermaine hasn't locked into a real high confidence level
yet. Jermaine is up and down and up and down.'' . . . Indians
center fielder Kenny Lofton has 28 stolen bases, one more than he
had all season last year with the Braves. . . . Twins right-hander
Bob Tewksbury had his (very) slow curveball clocked at 44 mph.
``I'm going from 44 to 83 on the gun. That's a big variance. Not
too many pitchers can do that,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   This is the first year the Rangers will have two elected
starters in the All-Star Game _ catcher Ivan Rodriguez and Juan
Gonzalez, who are from the same small town in Puerto Rico, Vega
Baja. Population is 14,000. ``It's nice to go with your friend,''
Gonzalez said. Rodriguez becomes the fifth catcher in history _ the
last was Johnny Bench _ to start at least six consecutive All-Star
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: If the season ended today, Oakland's Rickey Henderson
would lead the league in both stolen bases and walks, something
that has been done by six players. Henderson has done it three
times, the last in 1989. ... Seattle's best known relievers, Bobby
Ayala and Heathcliff Slocumb, have ERAs of 7.06 and 8.39,
respectively. . . . Mariners starter Jamie Moyer has lost games by
scores of 5-0, 2-0, 6-0 and 5-2. No wonder that Moyer, a 17-game
winner from last year, is 5-6. . . . Even though the Angels are on
top of the division, they had only one position player to finish
among the top 10 in the All-Star voting _ shortstop Gary DiSarcina,
who was ninth. . . . Angels starter Jack McDowell, on the DL since
June 1 with an elbow injury, thinks he will return in early August.

 &HT;    Smoltz gets injections for pain in lower back
 &HT;    ByThomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Smoltz has received cortisone injections to his lower back
to lessen inflammation that has built up over the last week. Though
his right elbow has not caused problems since he came off the
disabled list June 20, the muscles in the middle of his lower back
have acted up in his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very bothersome between starts,'' Smoltz said. ``On
that one play (against Toronto June 26) when I fielded a throw from
(Keith Lockhart), I tweaked it pretty good, but it had already been
acting up. With the way I throw, I always have periodic back
problems. This is just a way during the All-Star break to calm it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz returned home from Tampa Bay on Thursday, before the rest
of the team, to have the treatments, and reported relief Saturday
afteroon. He threw on the side as scheduled and is set to start the
Braves' first game after the break at Florida on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was starting to alter the way I throw a little bit. Or it
could,'' he said. ``But like I said, this is the year of just
trying to fight through things.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Long-Ball
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones is a confirmed participant in Monday's Home Run
Contest at Coors Field, but Andres Galarraga, who had back troubles
himself last week, has put off deciding whether he'll take part
until that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared a little bit for my back,'' Galarraga said. ``If I
had to say yes or no now, I'd say no. But I don't know about
Monday. They said they'd save my spot until I can say I can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Greg Vaughn has already scratched, and should
Galarraga back out, Javy Lopez, who has 19 homers, becomes a
possible alternate. But the Braves catcher wasn't enthusiastic
about the contest, saying, ``I don't know. I like to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Javy down
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was scratched from Saturday's lineup after his right foot
became too painful to take batting practice. He was forced from
Friday night's game when Carlos Baerga fouled a ball off Lopez's
instep in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can squat, but it hurts,'' said Lopez. ``When I try to run
and cover first base, it hurts. If I get a base hit, it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan pipeline
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have signed Venezuela's top catching prospect. He is
Jose Salas, 16, a switch-hitter from Caracas who is already
6-foot-3 and 202 pounds. He signed a contract Friday believed to be
worth $750,000 and took batting practice with the Braves Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Club scouting and player development director Paul Snyder would
not say Salas signed with Atlanta over the New York Yankees or Los
Angeles because Venezuelan nationals Galarraga, Eddie Perez and
Ozzie Guillen play for the Braves. But Snyder also said it didn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does an awful lot of things well for a young man,'' Synder
said. ``And the best thing is he's self-motivated, so you don't
have to prod him to do it. ... He realizes, I think, playing
baseball is a little easier than working on the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Salas will play with the Braves' Gulf Coast League team this
summer as well as the fall instructional league.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' close call
</P>
<P>
   Brush fires closed to within 200 yards of Chipper Jones' family
home in Pierson, Fla., Friday before some volunteers, including
Jones' father Larry, extinguished the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Though his parents and grandparents were evacuated, residents
have been allowed back to their homes.

 &HT;    On Deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    ByThomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (9-6, 3.46; 4-3,
4.48 lifetime vs. Mets) vs. RHP Rick Reed (9-5, 2.71; 2-0, 4.05
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Neagle's change-up, his out-pitch and the backbone of his
repertoire, was rounding back into form in his last outing, a 7-2
win at Tampa Bay last Tuesday. While he lost five of six starts May
31-June 25, it was the change-up that caused Neagle's trouble, the
pitch cutting back over the plate instead of down and out of the
strike zone. Working on the angle of his hand at delivery, Neagle
allowed just five hits _ and no home runs _ to the Devil Rays over
six innings for his second win in three starts. Neagle had served
up 17 home run balls in his first 17 starts. He will be careful
with the Mets' Bernard Gilkey, who brings .400 career average
against Neagle (12-for-30, 2 HR) into the game. In his most
successful season after 13 years of organized baseball, Reed has
been as consistent as any Mets pitcher. He has worked at least
seven innings in 13 of his 16 starts, has allowed more than three
earned runs just four times and his walks allowed per nine innings
(1.4) is second only to Greg Maddux (1.0). He is coming off a 6-3
loss at Toronto, when he gave up nine hits and six runs in just
four innings.

 &HT;    The best at the break
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- What a fabulous first half it's been. A perfect game.
Kerry Wood. Slammin' Sammy, Big Mac and Junior. And no mention of
Don Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   So who has been the best? Who picks up the midseason awards?
Where are the flops? Take a look:
</P>
<P>
   National League
</P>
<P>
   Best team: The Braves, you say? Nope. The Padres are better,
because they have Trevor Hoffman, who is 3-0 with 25 saves and has
allowed just eight runs in 37 2/3 innings. It might change, if
Atlanta finds bullpen help. But right now, the Padres remind
everyone of last year's Marlins _ not a spectacular team but no
holes anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest flop (team): Several teams fit here: Dodgers, Rockies
and, of course, the Marlins. But Los Angeles is the biggest
disappointment, including a team ERA of 3.86, seventh in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   MVP: Easy. Nobody has been better than Mark McGwire, and 15 of
his 37 homers have gone 430 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young: Greg Maddux's numbers overwhelm everyone, his 1.54 ERA
almost a run better than all but one other starter (Al Leiter of
the Mets). But teammate Tom Glavine also deserves consideration. He
is 6-0 in starts after the team loses. Maddux, however, gets the
call.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the year: Wood. Wood. Wood. Despite spending the first
three weeks in the minors, he is second in the league in strikeouts
with 139. But he won't be in Denver for the All-Star Game on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Manager of the year: Toss-up between Bruce Bochy of the Padres
and Houston's Larry Dierker. The nod here goes to Dierker, who has
done a wonderful job in just his second year away from the
announcing booth.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest flop (player): The Rockies thought they were getting one
of the best arms in baseball when they signed Darryl Kile. He
hasn't won since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Manager on the hot seat: Colorado's Don Baylor might be the
first to go, but Chicago's Jim Riggleman has to keep his team in
the wild-card race or Jim Leyland could be sitting in the dugout at
Wrigley next year.
</P>
<P>
   American League
</P>
<P>
   Best team: The Yankees' 59-20 start matches their best ever, but
watch out for the Indians. They have fixed their pitching problems,
and offensively they can be as good as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest flop (team): It would be easy to say Baltimore, but
Seattle also deserves mention. What should concern the Orioles the
most is that the future doesn't look good; the minor-league
organization is far from stocked, and many of their best players
become free agents this winter.
</P>
<P>
   MVP: Tough call here. Ken Griffey Jr. is in there, as well as
teammate Alex Rodriguez. But what if Rangers outfielder Juan
Gonzalez breaks the RBI record, which he is nearly on pace to do.
And Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams is hitting a blistering
.353, although he has to deal with injuries. Overall, A-Rod's
numbers are the best _ .312 with 27 homers and 69 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young: Another tough one. Yankees right-hander Hideki Irabu
has the best ERA (2.47) but only six wins. Boston's Pedro Martinez
has 10 wins but a 3.02 ERA. Cleveland's Bartolo Colon is 8-4 with a
2.51 ERA. And don't forget David Wells and his perfect nine
innings. Plus, he has 11 wins. Wells gets the nod.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the year: Oakland's Ben Grieve has been everything
advertised and is on pace to finish with 200 hits, something a
rookie hasn't done in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Manager of the year: New York's Joe Torre. While he has the most
talent in baseball, he also has had to deal with one injury after
another. Also, hats off to Boston's Jimy Williams, who has made
Beantown a fun place again.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest flop (player): Hands down, Orioles leadoff hitter Brady
Anderson, hitting .211.
</P>
<P>
   Manager on the hot seat: Lou Piniella won't have a problem
finding a new job, but unless he turns things around, it's doubtful
he'll be back in Seattle.

   While the team doctors question whether he can come back anytime
soon from a knee injury, Mets starter Al Leiter sees himself back
in the rotation by the end of the month. ``As far as I'm concerned
the doctors that say I could be out 4-6 weeks are wrong,''' Leiter
said. ``I mean, it's not my arm. It's not even my landing leg. Even
if I'm not 100 percent, I'm pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Mets outfielder Benny Agbayani is the third Hawaiian-born
player to play in the majors. The other two also happened to play
for New York _ Ron Darling and Sid Fernandez. ... When the
Phillies' Scott Rolen and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra met in a game
recently, it was the first time two reigning rookie-of-the-year
winners faced each other in the regular season. The only other time
it has happened was in the 1966 postseason, when Jim Lefebvre of
the Dodgers faced Curt Blefary of the Orioles in the World Series.
... The $800,000 signing bonus the Braves gave outfielder Ryan
Langerhans ties a record for a third-round pick. Langerhans had
signed to play for the University of Texas. ... The ex-Marlins who
were traded away from last year's world-championship team received
a total of 6,549,493 All-Star votes, while the current Marlins on
the ballot received 962,659.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get picked for the All-Star Game, but Jeff Bagwell
appears to be the old Bagwell again. In games Tuesday and Wednesday
against the White Sox, he drove in a total of six runs and scored
six. He has hit safely in 20 of his last 21 games with 10 homers
and 29 RBIs during that stretch. If Bagwell stays hot, the club
just might run away with the division.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: In a game in Houston last week, Astros catcher Brad
Ausmus watched a ball bounce behind him and into the pocket of
umpire Gerry Davis. On the play, Ray Durham scored for the White
Sox as Ausmus looked around for the ball. ``I asked (Davis) if I
was supposed to pick him up and throw him in front of the runner,''
Ausmus said. . . . The Astros scored 48 runs in a recent four-game
stretch. . . . Cardinals third baseman Gary Gaetti has hit a home
run in 33 different parks, a record shared with Ellis Burks of the
Rockies. . . . When Pirates catcher Jason Kendall collected four of
his club's five hits Tuesday against Detroit, it came in front of
his father, Fred Kendall, the bullpen coach for the Tigers. ...
Hats off to Mark McGwire's agent, who had a clause in the first
baseman's contract that said he receives an extra $100,000 for
leading the league in All-Star voting, which he did easily.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Baseball used to be so tough when anyone in the sport was
involved with gambling in any way. But on Arizona's Internet site,
visitors can link with the Las Vegas authority's home page, where
there is a gaming guide that includes a page on sports books. But
acting commissioner Bud Selig says he has no problem with the
setup. ``After all, gambling is legal everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Dodgers general manager Tommy Lasorda insists he didn't
get manager Bill Russell fired. ``There is no way, no way, that I
ever wanted to see Billy Russell get fired. He's the guy I
recommended for the job. He's the guy that I had prepared for the
job. He's the guy that I said whoever replaces me, I hope and pray
it's Billy Russell.'' . . . The Dodgers need pitching help and have
offered the Reds first base prospect Paul Konerko for closer Jeff
Shaw. The Reds want third baseman Adrian Beltre. That won't happen.
. . . Greg Vaughn hit 28 homers in the first 163 games he played
for the Padres. He already has 28 this season. ... All of a sudden
Padres right-hander Kevin Brown has put himself back in the Cy
Young race, winning his last seven decisions and lowering his ERA
to 2.69

HANDWRITING ANALYST READS HUMAN NATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- You are what you write.
</P>
<P>
   Or so says Sheila Lowe, a handwriting analyst for 31 years and
one of the nation's most prominent experts in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your handwriting always tells the truth,'' Lowe said during a
recent interview in her Santa Clarita home, 20 miles north of Los
Angeles. ``Handwriting is projective behavior in that when you
write, you bring in all the experiences of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's bread-and-butter business is providing companies with
personality analysis of prospective hires, derived from several
pages of writing samples at rates ranging from $95 to $250. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``What you're doing when you use someone like me is being
proactive, looking for someone who'll fit in and avoiding people
who may cause problems,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   A cosmetic surgeon in Beverly Hills learned that lesson the hard
way. He decided to ignore Lowe's advice that another surgeon,
despite superb references, might have difficulty controlling his
temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his handwriting showed he'd be emotionally immature
with probability of throwing tantrums if there was a lot of
pressure,'' Lowe recalls. ``So that's what happened and it took
nine months and $250,000 to get him out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the field once was scorned by scientists as something
akin to fortune-telling and palm reading, handwriting analysis has
achieved a respectable profile in recent decades with hundreds of
graphologists like Lowe in Southern California. Two organizations _
the Chicago-based International Graphoanalysis Society and the
American Handwriting Analysis Foundation in San Jose _ operate
certification-testing programs, but there is no licensing agency
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheila is one of the best known in this field, where there are
a lot of people doing it as a hobby or half-heartedly,'' said Heidi
Harralson, head of certification at the American Handwriting
Analysis Foundation. ``The ones who do it full time tend to be good
marketers because they have to educate everyone. You have to do a
lot of convincing that handwriting analysis is a useful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the work of graphologists involves extrapolation of
whether a person is a good leader or loyal follower, and what kind
of self-image, social style, work style and motivations they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is to see if they will fit into an environment,
but I always tell people that my report should not be the sole
determining factor in their decision,'' Lowe said. ``I'm always
looking for red flags such as someone being extremely sarcastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's profile rose in recent years when she often commented to
the media on O.J. Simpson's handwriting during his criminal and
civil trials _ ``I can't tell you if he is the killer, but he does
have a volatile, explosive personality'' _ and on the JonBenet
Ramsey murder case. She gives dozens of speeches each year
throughout the country and has appeared on CNN and NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Nichols, who runs an accounting firm in Irvine, Calif.,
hired Lowe four years ago after hearing her on a radio interview.
Nichols had decided she needed to improve her ability to find
employees who could deal with the stress of tax season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a wish list for what I wanted with a new hire but
when you read resumes, check references and do the interviews, it's
very difficult to get more than name, rank and serial number,'' she
said. ``People tend to put their best foot forward in interviews,
so what I need is to find people who can manage to not react in
negative situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheila's been spot-on about her evaluations, which I see as a
real proactive tool.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet growing demand for her services, Lowe has been selling
her own computer program for the past 18 months through RI
Software. Sheila Lowe's Professional Handwriting Analyzer costs
$395 a copy. Sales have enough zip for RI to have published three
more versions. The biggest buyers are human-resource specialists
and psychotherapists.
</P>
<P>
   She's also negotiating to sign a book deal for a murder mystery
involving a graphologist. The title? ``Poison Pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses aren't Lowe's only business. She also works on
background investigations for law enforcement agencies, people
wondering about romantic entanglements and parents seeking guidance
on child rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to me about relationships, I ask them to
include their own handwriting so I can get a sense of what their
expectations are because there's usually a problem if they've come
to me,'' she said. ``Often, if you know what people's expectations
are, you can make the relationship work.''
</P>
<P>
   When she looks at handwriting, Lowe tries to focus both on small
details, such as how T's are crossed, and the larger picture. ``I
look at the whole arrangement and balance on the page and whether
anything stands out,'' she explained. ``The whole process is fairly
intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe finds layers of revelation based on even a few words. For
example, a four-sentence inter-office memo written by Walt Disney
Co. Chairman Michael Eisner produced a five-page report that
included measurement of 50 personality categories.
</P>
<P>
   Among her observations:
</P>
<P>
   --``Because his own standards are high, Michael finds it
extremely disappointing when someone else lets him down or proves
less than sincere in their promises.''
</P>
<P>
   --``His firm commitment to his own ethical standards makes it a
sure thing that Michael can be counted on for reliability and
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Without difficult problems to solve or challenges to meet,
Michael would soon lose his interest in life.''
</P>
<P>
   --``When bad things happen to him, he is able to bounce back
from them in a reasonable amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Michael concentrates so keenly on making everything `just
right' that he may find it difficult to get a project finished on
time. He does not know when to stop improving things.''
</P>
<P>
   --``This is not someone who waits for the road to be paved
before heading out on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the memo is more than a year old, so Lowe's
conclusions may no longer apply. ``As you change your personality,
your writing changes in a million ways,'' she said. ``The human
brain is such a huge subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of her takes on other prominent people:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton: ``A combination of strength and flexibility. He
can stand firm and build a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Swaggart: ``Circling the name indicates manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley: ``You can tell he was in ill health and
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson: ``The writing is very sad and immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky: ``Very direct and mature, not at all like a
Valley girl.''
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson: ``He's volatile and can be explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Brown: ``The writing is very immature. She needed lots of
affection and approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fuhrman: ``The big block printing is like a lot of police
officers. It shows he's stubborn, hard-headed and self-confident.''

THE NBA ASKED FOR THIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I got into an amiable argument with the general manager of the
Los Angeles Lakers, Mitch Kupchak, the other day over the NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was more a philosophical debate.
</P>
<P>
   I believe fervently in the American free-enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kupchak believes fervently in that socialist gimmick, the
salary cap it arbitrarily sets the income ceiling of an entire
industry that has become the rage among owners of professional
sports franchises in America.
</P>
<P>
   I told the old North Carolina and Washington Bullets' star
forward that I thought the lockout was a total farce caused by the
owners' own wild spending sprees.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the owners are violating every precept of the American
capitalistic system that was responsible for them becoming
multi-millionaires in the first place,'' I said. ``They want it
codified into NBA law what amount they're able to spend on their
players in order to curb their own uncontrollable, insatiable
spending habits. In essence, they're saying, `I need a salary cap
to save myself from myself.' No other major businesses in this
country outside athletics operate in this manner. Why should
athletes agree to a system that inevitably will wind up slashing
their salaries?''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kupchak paused, and then acknowledged that the owners,
indeed, did create their own financial Pandora's Box, but that
something had to be done before the small market places like
Sacramento, San Antonio, Vancouver, Utah, etc., would be unable to
compete with the big population centers like New York and Chicago
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if the small market places can't compete?'' I said.
``That would be just too bad. Who shed a tear for all the
mom-and-pop hamburger joints in America that were put out of
business by McDonald's and the other burger chains? How many video
places closed because of Blockbuster? How many places went belly up
when Wal-Mart and Home Depot opened their doors? Why should it be
any different in pro sports? Why shouldn't the fittest and
strongest survive? Isn't that a harsh, albeit sad reality of
American commerce?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the salary cap gives everyone the same opportunity to
compete and assures the league stability,'' said Kupchak. ``If
there was no salary cap, the same teams would always make the big
money and be able to sign the star players. They'd always win and
the small market teams would always lose. The Knicks and the Lakers
and the Bulls and perhaps the Pistons and 76ers would, I'm sure,
wind up with all the good players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen to a place like Sacramento? Eventually, an
owner would become disgusted and have to sell the team, or move it.
Or, in the worst case scenario, the team might have to fold its
tent. A lot of people would be deprived of watching pro
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, welcome to the harsh world of reality.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, miss watching NFL games in person in Southern
California. But, for a variety of reasons all of which are linked
to money we no longer have a pro football franchise in our midst.
</P>
<P>
   This certainly is unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow I've survived this terrible cultural vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento would also survive without the Kings, who haven't
exactly been a rousing community success story, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I'm sure life would be quite bearable without the
presence of the Kings, or Vancouver Grizzlies, or Minnesota
Timberwolves, or one of those other dreary franchises that pollute
the NBA these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the loss of the Kings be fair to the people of
Sacramento who have supported the team all these years?'' wondered
Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   What's fair?
</P>
<P>
   Was it fair for Los Angeles to lose the Rams to Anaheim when all
the NFL attendance records were established by that team when it
played at the Coliseum? Was it fair for Anaheim to lose the Rams to
St. Louis because the honest politicians in Missouri showered
Georgia Frontiere with so many taxpayer-subsidized goodies that she
would have been the fool she normally is to refuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I'd feel bad for the Sacramento fans,'' I said.
``But what about the fans up in Fresno? They've never even been
given the opportunity to support an NBA team. A lot of fans from a
lot of areas around America have never had a major league team in
their area to support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA will be in serious trouble unless it gets a handle on
the players' salaries,'' Kupchak persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, OK, Mitch, what about the coaches salaries?,'' I said.
``Is there going to be a lid put on their income, too? After all,
Rick Pitino and Pat Riley both have annual earnings that surpass
the gross national product of many Third World countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's another issue,'' said Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   I told Kupchak I wouldn't be distressed if a bunch of NBA teams
suddenly folded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, that might be a good thing,'' I said, as Kupchak
winced perceptibly. ``I think the league suddenly would become far
more competitive and the quality of play would improve
dramatically. I'd love to see a league with 10 or 12 teams in it.
It would be streamlined to the point it would be a lot more
entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA much like the NFL and the NHL and major league baseball
will continue with its unwieldly alliance of too many faceless,
hapless teams.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sure this latest NBA labor dispute eventually will be
resolved with a hard salary cap in place. I'll be surprised after
the settlement if a team still will be allowed to pay one of its
free agent players as much as it wants without the money counting
against the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, I'm not going to lose any sleep over the NBA's
lockout,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might,'' admitted Mitch Kupchak, clearly worried about his
league.

FOR NOVOTNA, A ROYAL PREDICTION COMES TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change York to Kent in 1st graf; duchess of Kent is
correct)  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Five years ago she lent a devastated Jana
Novotna a shoulder to cry on, and last year, after Novotna again
came away distraught from her attempt to make her first career
Grand Slam title a Wimbledon title, the duchess of Kent,
Wimbledon's most loyal and royal hostess, gave the Czech veteran
some sterling advice. Three's a charm, the duchess assured her, and
on Saturday at Wimbledon that prediction came true.
</P>
<P>
   Turning a royal wish into a royal command, Jana Novotna, whose
painstaking quest to win this Wimbledon title had begun to be the
stuff of legends, provided the answer to her own prayers with a
6-4, 7-6(7-2) defeat of 16th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France,
like Novotna a serve-and-volley throwback to times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   The instant her match-winning forehand return coasted straight
down the sideline the way she'd hoped it would, the 29-year-old
Novotna fell to her much-used knees and burst into tears. For a
change, on finals day at Wimbledon, Novotna's tears were tears of
joy.
</P>
<P>
   After embracing the 30-year-old Tauziat, the first French woman
to reach this final since Suzanne Lenglen won in 1925 and the
lowest-ranked Wimbledon finalist in the Open era, Novotna scampered
into the stands to hug her longtime coach, Hana Madlikova, and her
mother, Liba.
</P>
<P>
   Then she hustled back to Centre Court for an emotional reunion
with the royal benefactor who had predicted she would win this
championship if she found the will to reach its final round a third
time. The duchess clasped both of Novotna's hands in hers, told her
she was proud of her, and then gave her the silver trophy that had
eluded her in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, who was 0-for-3 in Grand Slam finals until Saturday,
said she was so dazed by the time she struck the final winner of
the tiebreaker that she didn't even know what shot she'd hit: All
that mattered was that her last shot was an unreturnable shot.
</P>
<P>
   As she had in her semifinal against top-ranked Martina Hingis,
the teenager who defeated her in Wimbledon's 1997 final, Novotna
got off to a tremulous beginning: She failed to convert a break
point against Tauziat in the opening game of the first set and,
handicapped by a pair of double faults, promptly lost her own serve
to trail 2-0 after the French underdog skimmed a backhand volley
across the net at break point.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna broke straight back courtesy of a pair of backhand
errors by Tauziat, who tended to let out a piercing shriek with
every mistake, high-decibel behavior for the same player who blew
the whistle and called out the grunt police on Monica Seles here in
1992. Novotna held for 2-2, and the set unfolded on serve until the
seventh game, where the Czech veteran finally converted her seventh
break point with an overhead just after Tauziat had saved the sixth
break point with an overhead reply to a limp lob from Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna started the next game with a double fault, but she
regrouped, took herself to game point by following her second serve
with a bold half volley, and achieved a 5-3 advantage that, after
Tauziat held for 4-5, put her in prime position to serve for the
opening set.
</P>
<P>
   With more and better acrobatics at the net, including a high
backhand volley that took her to 30-15 and a lunging forehand
volley that gave her a double set point, Novotna earned the set
when Tauziat, who began to unravel once Novotna's aggressive shots
began zeroing in on their targets, pumped a forehand return into
the net, her 16th unforced error of the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' hissed Novotna, who then expanded her hold on the match
by breaking Tauziat in the first game of the second set.
Consolidation of that break wasn't a given: An out-of-control
double fault put Novotna 0-30 in arrears, but her resolve, and
Tauziat's lack of it, soon put her back in front 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   When Novotna managed to swoop down and scoop up a backhand half
volley that soared past the French challenger and kept her ahead,
3-1, she looked up at the leaden sky and screamed, ``Thank God!''
Nervousness played a definite role in this final, but the good news
for Novotna was that, for a change, the opponent's nerves were just
as frayed as hers.
</P>
<P>
   But the opponent's serves weren't as disobedient as hers, and
when Novotna, just after using an ace to save face at triple break
point of the fourth game, unfurled her seventh double fault, the
second set was level at 3-3. The break didn't rattle Novotna for
long and, just as she had done in the first set, she immediately
repaired it, this time with a backhand volley winner after another
head-on exchange of volleys at the net with Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna then held for a 5-3 lead that, had it not been for her
history of folding in the home stretch, might have looked
commanding. After Tauziat held for 4-5, it was up to Novotna, who
pronounced herself a different player from the bundle of anxiety
that frittered away a 4-1 third-set lead over Steffi Graf here in
the 1993 final, to serve for the title.
</P>
<P>
   On first try, she buckled: She pushed a forehand volley into the
net to put herself behind 15-40, netted a forehand on Tauziat's
third break opportunity, and the set suddenly became anybody's set
at 5-5. Tauziat held for a 6-5 lead, and then it was Novotna's turn
to try and stay in the set and force a tiebreaker: This time, she
didn't compromise herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiebreaker, Novotna rededicated herself to ending the
match and Tauziat again disintegrated: A stream of errors from the
French player and a magnificent lunging backhand volley gave
Novotna her first match point and, fortuitously, she didn't have to
serve for it. That task went to Tauziat, and a forehand return
ended not just the match but 13 years of Wimbledon futility for
Novotna.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here at her favorite slam, Novotna had been careful to take a
page from the sentimental diary of Martina Navratilova, a nine-time
Wimbledon champion, and made sure to reaffirm her rapport with the
Centre Court even before the tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   While Navratilova always liked to pocket a few blades of grass
to keep as a lucky talisman, Novotna simply chose to have a brief
conversation with the grass on Wimbledon's center stage. So she
slipped unnoticed into the empty stadium on the eve of opening day
and, according to her, ``said hello to him and asked how he was
doing.'' The grass, the first new crop on Centre Court in 30 years,
did not respond in kind, but apparently appreciated the veteran's
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Like the grass, this was a new version of the nearly 30-year-old
Novotna who came into this year's event: ``A couple of years ago, I
was perhaps a little too serious, and I thought that's all it takes
to become the No. 1 player in the world, but I think I've found a
happy medium, and I know I can still work hard and be a
professional, but I can have fun and be a little more relaxed about
it,'' said Novotna, who didn't win a grass court singles event
until this year's Wimbledon warm-up at Eastbourne. ``I mean, it's
something that definitely comes with age, and I wish I would have
felt like this seven or eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it took her until 1998, on her 13th visit to Wimbledon
and her third trek to its finale, to relax and celebrate a first
slam championship that was, said Novotna, entirely worth the wait.

 &HT;    A day in the life of a firefighter
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIMS, Fla. _ ``The old man started crying,'' Palm Beach County
Fire Rescue Lt. Grant Bain said, as he climbed back into truck 23.
</P>
<P>
   Bain had stopped to check on the frail-looking man who was
standing on the edge of his yard with a garden hose, trying to put
out smoldering stumps in the woods next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes his whole living out of that shed,'' Bain said. ``If
he's got a garden hose, then he's pretty concerned. If he's
concerned, we want to let him know that we're here. That's what
gets me the most. These people, they're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain and two other firefighters from Palm Beach County roamed
northern Brevard County Saturday, basically cleaning up. There were
no big fires for them to fight. Other firefighters had those under
control. But the 45,000 acres of smoldering forest are still
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters saved the vast majority of homes in the area _ only
about 35 were lost in the whole county. In some neighborhoods,
charred woods go all the way up to the walls of houses, testament
to the hard work of people like Bain and his crew. Another Palm
Beach County crew in this area was almost run over by a wildfire
Thursday. Their truck was badly burned while they tried to protect
a home.
</P>
<P>
   After Bain's crew refills the 750-gallon truck, Brian Maury
asks, ``Why don't we go back and pump that guy who's crying?''
</P>
<P>
   Back they head, only to be pulled over by a Florida Power &AMP;
Light truck in need of someone who can put out a smoldering power
pole. The pole is hanging by its wires, burned almost to the
transformer.
</P>
<P>
   With that put out, the crew heads to the old man's house.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wilson does body work on cars, has since 1955, and his
shed is full of paint thinner, paint, acetylene, oxygen, all
chemicals he needs to work. And chemicals that could blow the
forest up if an ember catches them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if it would go, it would be a big one,'' says Wilson,
63.
</P>
<P>
   Bain asks Wilson about his blood pressure, tells him not to
worry. Maury and the third member of the crew, Ed Krasinski, pull
their hose into the woods. Bain sets up Wilson's garden hose and a
sprinkler on a smoldering pile.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson doesn't say much. He thanks them as they leave.
</P>
<P>
   As they drive around a burned-out neighborhood, residents stop
to thank them, to offer them water, sandwiches, Gatorade. Many
homes have plywood leaning up against mailboxes or fences, spray
painted with ``Thank you firemen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over.
</P>
<P>
   The crew periodically runs into other crews. One, a group of
wildfire fighters from Bar Nunn, Wyo., work without water, using
only shovels and axes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do in Wyoming when we have a big fire like this is we
stay with it until we get it put out or it snows,'' Don Cooper
explained. ``I told my wife I'll be here until it snows.''
</P>
<P>
   County emergency management officials estimate they need at
least 14 inches of rain to get the area out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   At one smoldering patch of woods, a resident helps Bain's crew,
digging up piles of ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was my county and this was my only fire, I wouldn't
want him here,'' Bain said. ``But this community has experienced
something that I haven't seen in my 14 years _ dialing 911 and not
getting anybody. That's pretty scary.''

 &HT;    ``There's a real ray of hope and optimism today''
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla. _ Residents of Florida's most beleaguered
county anxiously returned home Saturday to ravaged yards and
smoke-stained houses saved only, many said, ``by the grace of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Damp weather and gentle winds muted the massive flames that have
claimed 125,000 acres in Volusia County and sent more than 20,000
residents fleeing from their homes. After being pummeled during
three particularly brutal days, firemen and local officials quickly
claimed victory as attention turned to new troubles in neighboring
Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real ray of hope and optimism today,'' Volusia
spokesman Dave Byron said. ``We have no homes in Volusia County
that are threatened and people are returning home.''
</P>
<P>
   What they are finding _ houses completely surrounded by
burnt-out trees and grass, melted siding and, in some cases,
blown-up cars _ leave many wondering how their homes escaped. Only
one house in the county was lost, compared to more than 80 combined
in Flagler and Brevard counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but think somebody's looking out for us,'' said
Charlie Gehm after returning to his beautiful log home in Riverbend
Acres. The home and a nearby utility shed remained standing even
though flames came within 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Tymber Creek area of Ormond Beach survived much
closer calls. They described the scary Wednesday night night they
were evacuated and forced to watch the blaze from a nearby
7-Eleven, about 2 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   As flames grew to about 90 feet high, neighbors guessed which
houses would perish.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We could see the fire coming up to the back corner of Tymber
Creek and everyone knew that my house was going to be gone,'' said
Janelle Selig. ``We watched this big wall of flames, and I knew if
they hit my trees, I was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig's trees did catch on fire as flames rolled through her
back yard destroying a satellite dish, melting pipes attached to
her house and lapping at the bottom of the brick house. The flame
was so intense that a ``Whirlpool'' tag on the air conditioner
melted and the tire of a wheelbarrow blew out.
</P>
<P>
   Then firefighters arrived. Four trucks raced past the 7-Eleven
around 10 p.m. as residents cheered, then went into the subdivision
and saved about a dozen homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had given up hope because I thought it was too late,'' Selig
said. ``It's pretty scary, because you don't know what's happening.
I kept thinking I should have cleared out all the trees and brush
from out back, like I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't have to now,'' she added, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A mile away, David Bailey showed a visitor the burned picket
fence that surrounds his built-in swimming pool. Perhaps no
resident had a more frightening night than Bailey, even though he
was 200 miles away in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was heading home and talking to his wife by cellular
phone around 10 p.m. when she told him the fire had spread so far
that she could see it in the back yard. Then he lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``About an hour later I was able to call her and I got no
answer,'' Bailey said Saturday. ``I checked my messages on the
(cell) phone, and I heard this real panicky message saying, `The
woods are on fire and they are making us evacuate.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she cut off,'' Bailey said. ``That was it. I didn't know
where she and my (three) kids were. That was the worst few hours of
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey arrived home to find his road blocked and a bunch of
people he didn't know standing near the entrance to his
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me that they saved just about everything and I
didn't have to worry,'' Bailey said. ``Then one of them asked, Is
your name, Bailey? You might have a problem.' The feeling was
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything turned out fine. His wife and kids evacuated safely,
and fires that melted a garden hose and left holes in the kids'
trampoline left his house alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see how much damage this caused around the house, you
start thinking it survived only by the grace of God,'' Bailey said.
``I don't want to sound dramatic, but I can't see any other
explanation.''

 &HT;    Khannouchi nails down a star-spangled victory
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Here it was Independence Day, and Khalid Khannouchi
loved it. Couldn't have scripted it any better.The aspiring Yankee
was hot on his way to the finish line, and who should be there to
greet the Peachtree Road Race winner than present-day versions of
Betsy Ross and Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Moroccan, who settled in New York five years ago
and dreams of gaining citizenship in time for the 2000 Olympics,
further enhanced his stature as king of the roads _ claiming a
second straight men's title in the World Championship of Road
Racing. Last October, in his marathon debut, he took Chicago in the
fastest time ever in the United States. A first Peachtree title, he
said, was almost as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the Fourth of July, and it being a big
day in the United States,'' said Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining,
N.Y., with his wife, Sandra. ``I'm more excited to win on the
Fourth of July, and I hope I can get (citizenship).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be proud one day to wear the U.S. uniform.'' As the sun
began turning Peachtree Road into a warm grill Saturday morning,
Khannouchi wrested the men's 10K race from Kenyan domination _
Kenyans had taken five of the last six races _ running down Simon
Rono and then gamely out-dueling him in a sprint through Piedmont
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud because I wanted to defend my (Professional Road
Running Organization) title and win Peachtree,'' said Khannouchi,
last year's Peachtree runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   How his citizenship effort will go, he can only hope. But
already he's come a long way from the day five years ago when he
stepped on U.S. soil for the World University Games in Buffalo,
N.Y. He returned a few months later, calling New York his home.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 22, he spoke hardly a word of English. He washed dishes
and waited tables in a Middle Eastern restaurant, leaving his road
work and training to late in the night. Back home, the Moroccan
federation never fully grasped what it had. Khannouchi was a
middle-of-the-pack runner who had gotten lost in the shuffle. Now,
he wants nothing to do with his old federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look out only for the top guys,'' he said of the Moroccan
federation. ``... Now they really regret it. They want me to run
with them. I say, `No.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to run here in the United States, where I came into my
peak. A lot of people have helped me. ... The people that helped
deserve to see me in an American uniform.''

 &HT;    Hellenic era continues for third straight year
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For a few miles, fans were permitted the extravagant
vision of the top women battling it out head-to-head down Peachtree
Road. Maybe it would come down to the final narrow stretch inside
Piedmont Park. Maybe two-time defending Peachtree champ Hellen
Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei and two-time world champion Colleen De Reuck of
South Africa would lock up in a race for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   De Reuck had come in saying she'd peaked for the race, eyeing
$25,000 and another world crown. Cardiac Hill wouldn't get her
again, she promised.
</P>
<P>
   But the midrace hill did get the best of her Saturday, while
Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei continued to prove herself a master of the steep
incline _ leaving De Reuck and the other would-be challengers
behind to win comfortably in 31 minutes and 52 seconds, a minute
off her 1996 course-record 30:52. Kenyan women grabbed four of the
top five spots, with De Reuck third after back-to-back second-place
finishes at Peachtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the course, and I like the hills,'' Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei
said. ``I know the hills were coming up. Just like the last two
years, I said `Let me just try (and go hard).'''
</P>
<P>
   End of race. Chalk up a three-peat for the 29-year-old Kenyan.
</P>
<P>
   Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei, 29, who arrived only a day before the race,
said she was bothered more by the humidity than in past years. That
may have put a dent in her time, but it did equal damage to the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year they drop me at the same spot, the steep section of
hills,'' said De Reuck, who lives and trains in Boulder, Colo.
``They dropped me last year, (and) the year before. I did a lot of
hills in training and I'm a strong hill runner, but they just get
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where Hellen gets a gap. She just has the ability to
run down hills and float up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sweet victory for Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei who bested De Reuck
in the previous two Peachtrees, only to lose to her later in the
championship race of the road racing circuit. With Peachtree
designated as the championship race this year, Hellen of Nairobi
was in her element _ spiked humidity or not.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some question, though, whether the Kenyan
federation would clear Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei to run Peachtree because
of a conflict this weekend with the Kenyan national championships,
which serve as a qualifier for the Commonwealth Games later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came as a last-minute decision,'' said Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei,
refusing further comment on negotiations with the federation.

 &HT;    Three's a charm for Novotna
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Centre Court stadium murmured and rumbled
every time
</P>
<P>
   Jana Novotna stumbled in the Wimbledon final Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She whacked a nervous forehand far long on the first point,
andthere were
</P>
<P>
   wide eyes all around. She lost her first service game, and
elbows poked
</P>
<P>
   elbows. Serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set, she
gottight, lost
</P>
<P>
   the game and there were gagging coughs and thousands whispering
``Oh no.'' But
</P>
<P>
   when two-time runner-up Novotna finally beat Nathalie
Tauziat6-4, 7-6(7-2),
</P>
<P>
   there were tears all around Centre Court. Novotna fell to her
knees, covered
</P>
<P>
   her eyes for a quick cry, thengot upto charge into the family
box for hugs
</P>
<P>
   with her mom, coach, familyandfriends. ``Winning Wimbledon means
_ well, I
</P>
<P>
   guess it means everything,really,''said Novotna, dedicating the
trophy to her
</P>
<P>
   coach, Hana Mandlikova,who wonevery Grand Slam but Wimbledon as
a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I havebeen waitingfor and working for.'' The
third seed, who
</P>
<P>
   will move to No. 2 in the world Monday, had alongerand more
painful wait for
</P>
<P>
   her first Grand Slam title than most,although itdid earn her a
special place
</P>
<P>
   in the hearts of the English and mosttennis fansaround the
world. In the
</P>
<P>
   1993 Wimbledon final, Novotna played Steffi Graf. Novotnalost
thefirst set
</P>
<P>
   in a tiebreaker, won the second easily and was up 4-1,40-30 in
thethird when
</P>
<P>
   she suddenly started flailing uncontrollably. She
didn'twinanother game,
</P>
<P>
   losing 7-6 (8-6), 1-6, 6-4. She still hates the word ``choke''
and that match
</P>
<P>
   will remain astrongNovotna memory. But now she hopes her
championship can
</P>
<P>
   push thatmemory aside. She played an outstanding tournament this
fortnight,
</P>
<P>
   losing onlyone seten route to the title, and defeating 10th seed
Irina
</P>
<P>
   Spirlea,talented youngseventh seed Venus Williams and top-ranked
Martina
</P>
<P>
   Hingis to reachthe final. As might be expected of someone with
such a
</P>
<P>
   terrible memory of afinal,Saturday's match was her most
difficult. She
</P>
<P>
   played someone who hasbeaten heras often as not and whose style
is similar
</P>
<P>
   to her own. Both were seeking their first Grand Slam titles,
Tauziat from
</P>
<P>
   thelong-shot position of 15th in the world and lowest seed (16)
in the
</P>
<P>
   finalsince theOpen Era began in 1968. At 30, she may never get
another
</P>
<P>
   chance.Novotna, 29,also didn't have many more years to try.
``The whole match
</P>
<P>
   was extremely difficult,'' Novotna said. ``Ireally feltthat this
final didn't
</P>
<P>
   bring the best tennis out of both of us.'' The points went
quickly, many
</P>
<P>
   ending in ugly unforced errors.Bothplayers were nervous for most
of the
</P>
<P>
   first set (Novotna said she wastense thewhole time) and played
</P>
<P>
   conservatively. A few great points poppedthrough,revealing
Novotna's
</P>
<P>
   acrobatic skill at the net and Tauziat's abilityto hitangles and
pass. But
</P>
<P>
   it wasn't an outstanding match because of the nerves. ``I felt
like the match
</P>
<P>
   against Martina was a piece of cake,compared tothis one, believe
me,''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna said, ``because (Tauziat) always putsso muchpressure on
me.'' Novotna
</P>
<P>
   and Mandlikova spent 90 minutes Friday night studying atape
ofTauziat's
</P>
<P>
   semifinal victory over Natasha Zvereva. Novotna learnedwhat
toexpect and
</P>
<P>
   considered that her key to winning. And when she finally did,
the murmuring
</P>
<P>
   stopped and turned toapplause, asthe crowd stood to accept blown
kisses from
</P>
<P>
   the champion, snap herphoto andwatch her speak to the Duchess of
Kent again
</P>
<P>
   _ for the third time infiveyears. The first time, she had cried
on the
</P>
<P>
   Duchess' shoulder. Thesecond time,the Duchess told her she would
win it in
</P>
<P>
   her third final. And thethird time?She heard a polite and royal
version of
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you so.'' ``She was very pleased that I have finally
won this
</P>
<P>
   championship,and shewas just so sure,'' Novotna said. ``She
said, `What was
</P>
<P>
   the bigthing? I toldyou last year that, if you make it to the
final for the
</P>
<P>
   third time,it will bethird time lucky.' '' Novotna responded,
while holding
</P>
<P>
   both of the Duchess' hands andsmilingbroadly, by saying how nice
it was to
</P>
<P>
   see the Duchess. Said Novotna: ``I told her she was absolutely
right,
</P>
<P>
   whatever shetold melast year.''

 &HT;    Goran's Grand Slam in reach
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Without a Grand Slam title, Goran
Ivanisevichas earned
</P>
<P>
   a title identical to the one that had hung on Jana Novotna for
so many
</P>
<P>
   years: greatest player never to win a major.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Novotna decided not to let it bother her
_ and
</P>
<P>
   promptly won her first Grand Slam on Saturday. Ivanisevic, a
mentally and
</P>
<P>
   physically erratic player, has never been so relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Not winning a Grand Slam has always bothered him and he doesn't
expect that
</P>
<P>
   to change, unless he wins his first title today. Like Novotna,
he is hoping
</P>
<P>
   for what the Duchess of Kent called ``third time lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic plays top seed and No. 1-ranked Pete Sampras. They
meet for the
</P>
<P>
   17th time. Sampras leads the series 10-6 and has won eight of
their past
</P>
<P>
   nine meetings. They're even in grass-court meetings, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   And although Sampras could be the best grass player ever, he is
more
</P>
<P>
   vulnerable this year than he has been since winning his the
first of his
</P>
<P>
   four titles in 1993. Unless he wins Wimbledon, he will surrender
his No. 1
</P>
<P>
   ranking to Marcelo Rios for the second time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is making too big of a deal about this year,''
Samprassaid after
</P>
<P>
   ousting hometown favorite Tim Henman in the semifinals. ``It
would be nice to
</P>
<P>
   win every week, but I'm not going to. I'm going to have my bad
days.''
</P>
<P>
   No one should expect Sampras to have a bad day, however, in his
12th career
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam final. He has lost only two of those and is just two
victories
</P>
<P>
   from tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic is not as reliable. He has a hot-and-cold game based
on a big
</P>
<P>
   serve and volatile emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's going to win,'' said Richard Krajicek, whom
Ivanisevic
</P>
<P>
   defeated in a five-set semifinal on Friday. ``He's playing good,
but I don't
</P>
<P>
   think Pete would let him get away with what he got away with
against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, though, feels confident. He assumed he would play
Sampras and
</P>
<P>
   was excited about the prospect.

THE BAY AREA'S FRAGILITY REMINDS US WE'RE ALL AT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the last killer earthquake body-slammed the
Bay Area in 1989, the late Herb Caen, the San Francisco Chronicle's
marvelous columnist, wrote these revealing words: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The people. . .were as badly shaken as the rest of the Bay
Area. Suddenly and terrifyingly, they came face to face with a
reality of life in this most fragile of cities. It CAN happen here
again. And yet again. The price we pay for being San Franciscans is
the never-ending threat of instant disaster.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes wonder why my oldest sister choses to live here,
across the bay in Berkeley. Does she not grasp the tenuous nature
of life in this nervous metropolis, the constant risk of death at
the hands of nature run amok? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But my sister, besides reminding me that I've chosen to live in
a part of the Midwest often beaten up by tornadoes, says, simply,
``I feel pretty safe and don't worry about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which, oddly enough, is precisely how I feel about living
beneath angry skies that spit down mauling twisters from time to
time. The fact is, we all make accommodations and take risks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet Herb Caen was right. There (ital)is(end-ital) a special
fragility about the Bay Area. Not only do several earthquake fault
lines spiderweb the subterranean map here, but the climate creates
a high risk of the kind of wild fire that tore through the Berkeley
hills in 1991. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only reason my sister's house was not incinerated then, she
says, is that officials decided to try to save the lovely old
Claremont Hotel that her property abuts, and it worked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening my wife and I listened at dinner to my sister
and two friends tell desperately frightening stories of that 1991
fire. At one point, one of her friends described driving through
smoke over a hill above Oakland and finding only blackened and
sizzling house foundations left in what once was a beautiful
neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said with an awe and wonder in no way diminished
by the intervening years, ``the picture of Hiroshima.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet surviving owners of those charred foundations have built new
homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People rebuild here,'' says my sister. ``Why do they rebuild?
Because it's just so beautiful here.'' It seems to her a full and
reasonable enough explanation. And maybe it is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But signs of fragility are all around. Drive through the
Berkeley hills, for instance, and you see signs that say, ``Fire
Hazard Today'' followed by a designation. When I was here recently
the risk was always ``Moderate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or go to the Lawrence Hall of Science, part of the University of
California-Berkeley, and you can see an exhibit about earthquakes
that includes home preparedness tips (bolt the foundation of your
house to the wood structure; strap guard rails across shelves to
keep things from falling; secure tall furniture to the wall with
brackets, and on and on). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One display shows the last nine days of seismic activity in
California. When I was there at midafternoon one weekday, there
already had been eight earthquakes detected in the state that day,
ranging up to a magnitude 3.1 temblor near Bishop just west of the
Nevada border. Before I'd left the hall, a ninth quake occurred,
but only of a 1.9 magnitude, also near Bishop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hayward Fault, in fact, runs right through the Berkeley
campus. It begins southeast of San Jose and runs northwest past
Miltipas, through Fremont, by Hayward, through Berkeley and
eventually into the San Pablo Bay. West of the Hayward Fault lies
the much longer San Andreas Fault, said to have been active for 200
million years. To its east is the shorter Calaveras Fault. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the potential for disaster is always underfoot, though some
times of the year seem more susceptible than others. Although the
powerful 1906 earthquake struck here in April, both the 1989 quake
and the 1991 fire happened in October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We call October shake and bake month,'' says my sister. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's something else required for living with what Caen called
the ``never-ending threat of instant disaster'' _ a sense of humor.
In fact, the fragility that people in the Bay Area experience is,
in many ways, simply a sharp mirror image of the undependable,
insecure nature of life everywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether we go by fire, quake or ice, we're all going to go. And
the truth for residents here is the truth for us all: None of us
knows when. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN MOONLIGHT CROQUET AGAINST MARINES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It was, I think, when the world's largest mariachi
band was leading a parade here through palm trees in the dark
toward a croquet match between newspaper columnists and some
members of the United States Marine Corps that I took a deep,
self-satisfied breath and said to myself, ``You are in the right
business, boy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper columnists may not make anything like the money paid
to baseball players or good plumbers, but, unlike them, we get to
do things like play croquet against Marines, meet cheetahs named
Kramer and visit places like the Bull Semen Hall of Fame in Ohio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is why the dean of San Diego's columnists, Neil
Morgan, calls our work ``the most dangerous job on a newspaper.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some day I'll get back to what Morgan and others had to
say about column writing here recently at the annual conference of
the National Society of Newspaper Columnists. But I know most of
you will be more interested in the croquet deal because, well,
that's the kind of people you are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Diane Ketcham, Long Island columnist of the New York
Times, has been our mischief director at these NSNC gatherings. A
couple of years ago, for instance, when we met near Salt Lake City,
she cobbled together a spelling bee between columnists and some
academics who were in the same hotel for a high-powered linguists'
convention. Naturally, we killed them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year Diane discovered a contingent of Marines, apparently
assigned to keep folks from invading Humphrey's Half Moon Inn, our
convention hotel. I don't know how Diane did it but she talked them
into engaging several columnists in a late-night croquet match on
the hotel lawn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when our awards dinner ended, the entertainment _ four guys
who called themselves the world's tallest mariachi band _ led us
from the banquet hall through the dark to the site of the croquet
match while playing, among other things, the Marine song, ``From
the Halls of Montezuma.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to see how our team could lose. After all, we had a
columnist from Honolulu who, in his spare time, runs a web page
that tries to discourage people from using mayonnaise. We had a
college football player/columnist from Kentucky who could have
bench-pressed most animals at the San Diego Zoo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had a Winnipeg columnist who had just won our most
prestigious writing award and who, the next day, would turn 40 and
spend part of her day at the San Diego Wild Animal Park on a
flatbed truck rolling over rhino dung. And we had our president,
who said he was the Oregon state croquet champion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Marines? They had four young guys in short hair who looked,
well, like Marines, with those tight, chiseled bodies that you
naturally get from years of hard training to play croquet and kill
people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because it was dark, the hotel furnished us with small ``Power
to the People'' flashlights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our problem, I'd say, had to do with the fact that our best
player, the alleged Oregon state champ, decided not to play but to
be the umpire because, well, no one else knew the rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After two noise complaints from hotel guests, a Marine, Capt.
Rob Winchester of Tallahassee, Fla., who is based in New Orleans,
won. So we hollered ``Semper Fi!'' (Latin for ``Marines Cheat!'')
and beat it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are the kind of inexplicably bizarre experiences that help
keep columnists loose and open to new ideas. Once you've spent an
evening, as I have, watching the O.J. Simpson slow Bronco chase
with columnist Molly Ivins (who won the bet on when it would end)
or stood on the stage of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry with Little
Jimmy Dickens or ridden an unairconditioned bus to Plain City,
Ohio, to see the Bull Semen Hall of Fame, your brain tends to be on
alert for the oddnesses of life that help to illuminate how we
live. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This stuff forces us to think. And that's a job requirement for
columnists, whose primary goal is to get readers to think. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, about that cheetah named Kramer. Joan Embry, goodwill
ambassador of the San Diego Zoo, brought him to our first session,
along with an Andean condor named Claudia, whom she described as
the largest known vulture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, Joan may know her cheetahs, but we like to think that the
largest known vultures are in journalism. At least the ones not in
law. &QL;
</P>
<P>

STILL NO ROUNDUP AT THE RANCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was four months to the day that Connie Woodward's grandson
had been transformed by the merciless magicians at Arizona Boys
Ranch from juvenile delinquent to martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Four months since Nicholaus Contreraz, 15-year-old petty
criminal and troublemaker, was led by his keepers on a modern day
Stations of the Cross.
</P>
<P>
   It began when a boy complaining of illness, with 2{ quarts of
pus in the lining of one lung, was told by a ranch nurse he was
fine.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to exercise, ridiculed by staff members for
defecating on himself, then made to carry a bucket of his own
soiled clothing, to do push-ups over it.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to go on, unable to breathe, the boy collapsed while,
according to a sheriff's department report, a staff member told him
he deserved an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   It was four months to the day that Connie Woodward's grandson
died this miserable tortured death, and she wanted to know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is no one being held accountable?'' she asked. ``I don't
understand. What's the problem in finding charges to bring against
the people responsible? God knows we'd all be in jail if he'd been
at home and this had happened.'' &QL; 
CALIFORNIA CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Woodward and Nick's mother, Julie Vega, had been
to a hearing on the issue at the California statehouse in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   They live nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Nick had been sent from Sacramento to a place juvenile
authorities call the Last Chance Ranch, where kids get an
opportunity to straighten out before facing prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in the ``Sacramento Bee,'' nearly
two-thirds of the boys at the Arizona Ranch once came from
California, earning the facility $18.6 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Since Contreraz's death, California has stopped sending inmates
and started asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the hearing Connie Woodward attended, U.S. Rep.
George Miller of California said, ``I seriously question the legal
policy that subjects children to treatment in Arizona and Nevada
that would be a crime were it to be conducted in their home
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz's Sacramento County probation officer has said ranch
personal did things to the boy that shouldn't be done to any human
being.
</P>
<P>
   There are ongoing investigations being conducted by Arizona's
Pinal County Attorney's Office, state Child Protective Services and
the California Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also has suspended its policy of referring boys to the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, no one has been arrested or charged with a crime. &QL; 
4 MONTHS AND COUNTING
</P>
<P>
   The president of Boys Ranch, Bob Thomas, called what happened to
Contreraz ``a total management breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Woodward has a darker view.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed a boy for no reason,'' she said. ``This was
supposed to be the place that would turn his life around. Instead,
they finished him off. And they turned my life and my daughter's
life upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ranch officials acknowledged the terrible treatment
of Contreraz, dismissed personnel and closed the Oracle campus
where Nick died. They admitted that ``staff actions totally
disregarded established disciplinary policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the ranch is still open. Last week, Arizona
extended the facility's temporary license until Sept. 1 while as
many as 25 other complaints of mistreatment are being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch President Thomas doesn't put much stock in the word of
delinquents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lied before, they've cheated, they've stolen, they've
done violent acts,'' he told the ``Bee.'' ``They come to Boys Ranch
and they have instant credibility, more so than staff. I've always
been amazed by that.''
</P>
<P>
   As amazed as some are that a boy suffering from pneumonia,
bronchitis and other infections would wind up frightened,
humiliated and dead?
</P>
<P>
   As amazed that no one's in jail? &QL;

SURVIVING ARIZONA SUMMER: MR. BEER IS NOT YOUR FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may have noticed that it's warmed up a bit in the past few
days. One day we're having the coolest June in 27 years and the
next day it's 110.
</P>
<P>
   If you've lived here awhile, you are not surprised by this. It
happens every year. Even if you are a newcomer, you shouldn't be
surprised, but you may be surprised by just how hot it is.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it isn't really that hot. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have lived here awhile like to impress newcomers
by telling them how hot it used to be. This seems to be a pointless
exercise. To paraphrase Scripture, sufficient unto the day is the
heat thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one year it really did get hot: June 26, 1990. It was
122, the hottest ever in Phoenix. Now that was hot. You new folks
should have been here then.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest it's ever been in Arizona was on June 28, 1994. It
was 128. That was in Lake Havasu City. The town was abandoned not
long after that and today tumbleweeds blow down the streets and
only a few boarded-up buildings remain of what was once a thriving
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not true, but it should be. Why anyone would
place a city in a spot where it gets to be 128 is beyond me. It
isn't natural.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us still don't understand why they put Phoenix here in
the first place when they just as easily could have put it in Greer
or Flagstaff or some other place involving pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Heat can be dangerous. You have to pace yourself. If you're
smart _ and rich _ you should pace yourself straight over to San
Diego and stay there until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, way before air-conditioning, rich men used to
send their wives and families to mountain resorts for the summer
and then stay in town to fool around with other women. Considering
that fooling around can be sweaty work and there wasn't any
air-conditioning, those guys must have been really, really
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of us can't afford to go away for the entire
summer, so we have to stay here and make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Making the most of it usually just involves common sense. We
don't mean to imply that you are too dim to figure this out for
yourself, but heat makes people do strange things. So here are a
few tips for surviving the summer if you are a newcomer or if you
have lived here a long time and actually are a bit dim.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the best way to deal with the heat is avoid it.
Stay away from it. Do not exert yourself unduly under the sun. You
may look extremely studly or babe-ish jogging up Squaw Peak at
noon, but everyone thinks you're a moron. Stay home. Or go to a
mall. With all the rich people gone to San Diego there is plenty of
room at the malls and they are always nicely air-conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   Water: Mr. Water is your friend. Water is good. Drink a lot of
it. Then drink some more. Carry it around with you. Sit in it. Give
it to your friends and loved ones. Be one with water.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Beer, on the other hand, is not your friend. A tall, cold
one might indeed hit the spot, but alcohol actually dries you out,
so don't drink a lot of it in hopes of cooling off. And besides, it
makes you stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stupid, puhleeeeze don't go off and leave your
child, pet, grandma or any other living thing in the car in the
heat. You'd be surprised how often that happens. Sunscreen: After
Mr. Water, Mr. Sunscreen is your next best friend. Slather it on.
Sunscreen, a broad-brimmed hat, cotton clothing _ you can't go
wrong. Go ahead and work on your tan if you insist, but overdo it
and you'll end up looking like a hot dog that was microwaved on
high for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So, let's review what we've learned so far: Too much heat _ bad.
Water, sunscreen, common sense _ good.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now one question newcomers often ask is this: ``When is this
heat going to end?'' The good news is, yes, the weather will
change. The bad news is it's going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few weeks the monsoon is going to set in.
This is very, very nasty. The highs go down a bit, but the humidity
goes up and the evenings are marked by dust storms or
thunderstorms. And power outages, as in the power that runs your
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   And it never really cools off at night. You get up in the
morning and find out the overnight low was 90. This wears on you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the monsoon won't last forever, either. Sometime
around the end of September, things start to cool off and the rich
people come home from San Diego and you remember why you moved here
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   And you will have survived another desert summer. Of course, it
was nothing like last summer. Last summer it was really hot. &QL;

TUCSON JAILERS FOSTER DIGNITY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to dealing with jail inmates, Maricopa County and
Pima County are as different as a carrot and a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Joe Arpaio wants his 7,000 Phoenix prisoners to hate
jail life so much they won't come back.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety miles to the south, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik wants his
1,400 Tucson wards to develop pride and skills so they won't come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio arms his ``detention officers'' with pepper spray or
electric stun devices and houses most inmates behind glass or
metal.
</P>
<P>
   Dupnik's ``correctional officers'' are unarmed and work among
the guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two very opposites,'' noted Capt. John Alese, operations
commander for Pima County jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want inmates back, so we try to give them valuable
skills. And we try to give them a program where some of their
dignity is restored, rather than taken away from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as a society, have an obligation that, when people enter
our system, No. 1, we do no harm. (We) create a safe, secure and
humane environment for the inmate and for staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Alese, a national consultant on jail management, is careful not
to criticize Arpaio for using tough, punitive programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a political question,'' he said. ``There are different
philosophies. I'm not going to comment on whether his is right or
wrong. That's his decision. . . . The people of Maricopa County
elected the sheriff based on his platform. They obviously agree
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alese makes it clear that he views Phoenix's philosophy as
passe in the correctional world: ``It's history. . . . There are
some people who believe it is their duty to be carriers-out of
retribution.'' &QL; 
ARPAIO'S RESPONSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio snorts at those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this program is so great in Pima County . . .'' he began,
then flashed a public opinion survey that shows 62 percent of
Tucson-area &QL; 
residents view him favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio's jail commander, &QL; 
Deputy Chief Larry Wendt, added that Pima County's detention center
has a 4 percent higher recidivism rate than Maricopa &QL; 
County's and spends two-thirds more per prisoner .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the citizens of Maricopa County would go for
paying $57 a day to incarcerate an inmate'' Wendt said, compared
with $34 per day in Maricopa &QL; 
County.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference involves more than money.
</P>
<P>
   Correctional experts refer to traditional jail life as ``linear
incarceration'' because inmates are housed in cells along
corridors, with guards patrolling the catwalk. Most Maricopa County
facilities fit that description, or a so-called ``podular remote''
system whereby officers observe inmates from con trol booths. &QL; 
`PODULAR SUPERVISION' &QL; 
Pima County, in contrast, led a wave of America's ``megajails'' in
adopting ``podular direct supervision,'' meaning officers work
among the prisoners in open clusters. When inmates have a problem,
Alese says, guards are on hand to deal with it. They act as
internal leaders, rather than external watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one statistic _ on the number of assaults on prisoners
_ from the 1996 National Corrections Yearbook: Pima County had 27
while Maricopa County had 494. That's more than 18 times as many in
a jail system that is just five times larger.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Hutchinson, director of the National Institute of
Corrections, said direct supervision has proven the most effective
way to control more prisoners with less violence. She described the
Tucson jail as a success story, adding, ``For the first time in our
history with county jails, we're absolutely supervising inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson emphasized that correctional management is a
local sheriff's prerogative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Phoenix's jail,'' she said, ``and if it's working, you
do what works. . . . He (Arpaio) is probably giving folks what they
want, or what they think they want.'' &QL; 
NOT SIGN OF SOFTNESS &QL; 
Alese said giving prisoners a few comforts is not a sign of
softness or naivete, but practicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inmates will always play games,'' he said. ``Our philosophy
here is: `You're going to play our game. So we give you coffee, TV,
outdoor recreation. Now, if you don't play, we're going to lock you
up for 23 hours a day.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The data show that this kind of correctional facility works.
Why other people don't use it, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite overcrowding and a staff shortage, Alese said the Tucson
jail has not had a serious act of violence in the past month: No
inmates shocked with electric prods. No escapes in at least a
decade. No riots or group demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday, Pima County prisoners watched World Cup
soccer on TV, made phone calls, played checkers, talked with a
corrections officer.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Johnson, 28, said he's done time at both county lock-ups,
and there is a palpable difference in Tucson: The jail is mellower,
cleaner and safer, with less racial friction and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Durango and Towers (Maricopa County), you don't have guards
in with you like this,'' Johnson added. ``There's a lot more chance
for stuff to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he saw a dozen violent incidents in Maricopa County
and was pepper-sprayed several times. In Tucson, he's witnessed one
altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat you better here,'' he added. ``Yet they are
stricter about certain things like cleanliness and making your bed.
These guards seem to care more about their jobs. In Maricopa,
they're just picking up a paycheck.'' &QL; 
FEW ASSAULTS ON GUARDS &QL; 
Although it may seem dangerous for an unarmed officer to mingle
with 36 prisoners, Alese said there are few assaults because guards
are trained to defuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're armed with what we feel are excellent interpersonal
communications skills _ our officers use their brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Alese said, inmates know the consequences: ``If
they hurt one of my people, they're in permanent lockdown. They're
permanently shackled and cuffed. I will not tolerate my people
being touched, and they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alese said every inmate is screened, and some who are too
violent for the open environment get shunted to lockdown cells.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the convicted inmates (as opposed to pre-trial
detainees) are assigned to work details where they can learn
skills. Not chain gangs under the watch of gun-toting guards, Alese
added, but unshackled prisoners supervised outside the jail by
unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not soft or touchy-feely,'' he added. ``We've got rules.
This is our jail, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, we're not out there to embarrass inmates by
putting them in leg irons in front of the public. And we've never
had anybody run away.'' &QL;

GERMANY STUNNED BY CROATIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ The sense of history wasn't lost on the
Croatians, who have endured so much of the stuff in a few short
years, rarely with the joy that accompanied what they achieved
Saturday night at Stade Gerland.
</P>
<P>
   In what is by far the biggest stunner of this World Cup, of many
World Cups, for that matter, Croatia tiny, inconsequential Croatia
took its place among the final four with a 3-0 romp over three-time
champion Germany in a clash fraught with controversy.
</P>
<P>
   A disputed red card, which forced the Germans to play with only
10 men for more than half the match, provided the means for a
Croatian triumph, an historic conquest that left one side rapturous
and the other bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still not aware of what we have done,'' defender Slaven
Bilic offered after the Croats, playing in their first World Cup,
claimed a spot in Wednesday's semifinal against France in
Saint-Denis. ``This is a dream come true, but we are not afraid of
anybody. ... When (Coach Miroslav) Blazevic said two years ago that
we were the best in the world, we all laughed. But we are laughing
less and less now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' goalkeeper Drazen Ladic added, ``we can say we're
the best team in the world tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a point with which the Germans might argue, given their
mood following Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen's expulsion of
defender Christian Woerns their top player this tournament for a
clumsy attack on Davor Suker in the 40th minute. Their dominance,
unfailing to that point, quickly evaporated, and Robert Jarni's
stirring strike nearly three minutes into injury time provided the
Croats with everything they needed.
</P>
<P>
   When Goran Vlaovic, with a near carbon-copy of Jarni's blast,
and Suker added counterattack goals in the final 10 minutes,
Croatia had avenged a similarly controversial defeat in the
European Championship quarterfinals two years ago to become the
first Cup debutante since Portugal in 1966 to reach the final four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is going to be burning in celebration,'' said
Suker, whose goal was his fourth of the Cup. ``We played with our
hearts. ... This shows not always do the big teams win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, big, big, big, big victory for us,'' said Dario
Simic, seeking some sort of perspective. ``We're a small country.
Right now it's incredible what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   To place it in context, Croatia which gained its independence
from Yugoslavia seven years ago is a nation of 4.7 million people;
Germany has 6 million registered players.
</P>
<P>
   The only one that counted, ultimately, was Woerns, whose
midfield challenge on Suker was indeed late he slammed into the
Croat's knee after the ball had been pushed past but didn't appear
premeditated. Pedersen's penalty seemed harsh, but he was
challenged all night by a particularly rough affair, full of shoves
and elbows, in which 54 fouls were whistled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the replay on television,'' Woerns said, ``and I
think that the red card was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision raised the ire of the Germans, whose win over
Croatia in 1996 was largely determined by a questionable red card
that gave them the advantage. This time, the Croats took charge,
using the extra man to find space in what had been a tight,
organized German defense.
</P>
<P>
   After Jarni's goal a 22-yard blast inside the right post after a
nifty run and feed from Mario Stanic Germany was forced to push
forward, leaving plenty of space for the Croat counter to exploit.
It led to myriad chances, then, finally, Vlaovic's goal in the 80th
minute. Suker added his in the 85th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not us who lost the game, but it was the referee who
cost us the match,'' charged German defender Juergen Kohler. ``The
red-card decision was unjust. It was ridiculous. Why is it always
the Germans who get cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear that the red card was not a red card,'' said
sweeper Lothar Matthaeus. ``The quality of refereeing was well
below standard. I'm not alone in blaming the referee, but we also
have to take responsibility for the loss. Even with 10 men, we had
our chances. This shows the diminishment of the quality of
refereeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which failed in the quarterfinals for the second
successive World Cup after reaching the semifinal round the
previous seven tournaments, had plenty of opportunity to take
charge. Dietmar Hamann put a header just over the bar in the 22nd
minute, and Oliver Bierhoff forced Ladic to make a diving save on
another header in the 31st. That one was especially dangerous Ladic
couldn't hold on to the ball, and Juergen Klinsmann rushed in to
knock home the rebound; Ladic, lying on the ground, booted the ball
away.
</P>
<P>
   Ladic, who has three shutouts and has surrendered only two World
Cup goals in five matches, made another strong save on Bierhoff in
the 52nd, and a Hamann blast off a free kick ricocheted off the
Croatian wall and kissed the left post in the 78th. By the end,
German coach Berti Vogts whose ``David and Goliath'' comments on
Friday angered the Croats had four strikers on the field, to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, it's difficult,'' admitted Vogts, whose team
demonstrated the usual German organization but little flair. ``I
have to say that until Woerns was sent off, there was no doubt that
Germany put on its best performance of the World Cup so far.
There's no point going over and over the question of the red card.
The fact is Croatia goes on to Paris ... and we go back home.''

RED SOX ARE NO-SHOWS FOR CHO
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-WHITESOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jin Ho Cho did everything Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
asked of him on the Daffy Duck sketchboard Kerrigan used to bridge
the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Lost somewhere in the translation Saturday afternoon, however,
was the Red Sox offense, which spoiled the Fenway Park debut of the
22-year-old Korean pitcher whose big-league career was born with a
loss on the Fourth of July, 3-0, to the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cho? Maybe that's what I should call him, Mr. Cho,'' said
manager Jimy Williams, responding to a question from a Korean
reporter who referred to his countryman in that manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything about him that didn't impress me,''
Williams said of Cho, who gave up one run, on a home run by Mike
Cameron in the fifth, before departing after a leadoff single by
Magglio Ordonez in the seventh. ``That was a strong performance out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who had scored 43 runs in the last four games and
30 in the last two nights, were shut out by another rookie making
his first big-league start, John Snyder, a kid who hails from the
California side of the Pacific Ocean and now can take credit for
bringing to an end Nomar Garciaparra's 24-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra struck out in the first, walked in the fourth, and
grounded to shortstop in the sixth against Snyder, who had been
bombed for six runs in 1 2/3 relief innings against Houston Tuesday
but gave up just five hits in 7 2/3 innings Saturday. Garciaparra
came to the plate for the last time with the score 2-0 in the
eighth inning and Donnie Sadler on second after a bunt single and
an infield out. He was walked on four pitches by another rookie,
Bob Howry.
</P>
<P>
   Howry came back to strike out Midre Cummings, the cleanup hitter
of the day, and a third Chicago pitcher, Bill Simas, pitched a
1-2-3 ninth to close out the game and what had been a four-game Red
Sox winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's streak was the longest in the majors this season
and six games short of the 30-gamer he had as a rookie last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing his job,'' Garciaparra said of Howry. ``I was
trying to get on base or drive in a run. My first concern was to
win the damn ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't afford to give me a good pitch in that situation. If
I get a hit or spark something, it's 2-1. I never concerned myself
with (the streak). If I get a hit and we lose, I'm still ticked.
I'm mad.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was upset with Cho, who received a $700,000 bonus to sign
with the Red Sox at the end of March, started the spring on the
lowest rung of the team's minor league system, and wound up in the
majors less than three months later, even though members of the
Korean media here for the game said he was a bit of a mystery to
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a complete unknown to the Red Sox, having pitched for
them in their exhibition against Double A Trenton in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he's been through the wars on the international
level,'' Kerrigan said of Cho, who prepared for this exercise by
sitting in front of his locker, listening to classical music on his
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Kerrigan pulled out the drawing board he bought
in spring training and wrote H-A-T-T-I-E so Cho would know what to
call his catcher, Scott Hatteberg. He used it between innings to
show Cho how to work hitters by sketching home plate and the strike
zone, reminding him to throw his forkball to lefthanded hitters,
follow it with fastballs inside, then throw his curveball and
slider to righthanders.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to remind Cho, whose fastball averaged 92 miles per
hour, to stop shaking off Hatteberg's signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did that a lot in Trenton,'' Kerrigan said, ``and he did it
three times again to Hattie before Frank Thomas hit that double in
the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho gave up another Wall double to Robin Ventura in the second
and walked Greg Norton, his only free pass of the day, but induced
the next two batters to pop out. In the fifth, after Cameron's
screen-shot home run, he set down the next three hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good mound presence,'' Williams said. ``He's pitched
in three-tiered stadiums before, so this wasn't a novelty to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was still a 1-0 game when Ray Durham, Chicago's lone
All-Star, drew a one-out walk in the eighth off Derek Lowe, the
pitcher whom Cho replaced in the rotation, and stole second and
third on the next two pitches. He scored on Mike Caruso's high
chopper to first.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's two-out homer in the ninth off Jim Corsi accounted for
Chicago's third run.
</P>
<P>
   Williams refused to come out and say that Cho, who gave up six
hits and struck out two, will get another start, though he is
penciled in to start next Sunday in Baltimore. ``Two and two is
four in most cases,'' he said. ``Add things up, see the way the kid
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's here to stay, but I'd like to see the kid
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And to a Korean TV reporter who pressed him on the topic,
Williams said, ``You'll just have to hang around, spend some money
in Boston and Baltimore, and come and see us.''

HANNUM STAYED AHEAD OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's NBA coach tries to bond with his players by getting a
tattoo. Alex Hannum wore a tutu.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a Halloween costume party in 1968 when Hannum,
named last week to the Basketball Hall of Fame, was coaching the
Oakland Oaks of the American Basketball Association. The players
and coaches ran in the same social circles in those days so many
Oaks were around that night to behold the sight of the 6-foot-7,
230-pound Hannum dressed from festooned-head to slippered-toe as a
ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman no doubt would have eaten his heart out, then lost
whatever else happened to be in his stomach the next day when
Hannum timed his players in sprints at the end of practice, as he
was wont to do.
</P>
<P>
   The pace slowed for no one, not even when Oakland's Jim Hadnot
collapsed one day while running and told Hannum between torturous
gasps, ``you won't believe this, but I'm breathing through my
ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannum, 74, oozed passion from every pore during a labyrinthine
odyssey that took him from Hamilton High to USC to six pro teams in
nine years as a player to seven teams and two leagues in 16 years
as a coach to a place alongside fellow 1998 Hall of Fame inductee
Larry Bird at the pinnacle of their profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was it's going to be tough to get tickets to
the induction dinner,'' quipped Hannum, who will be presented by
one of his former players, Wilt Chamberlain, at the ceremony in
Springfield, Mass., in October.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, the Clippers will have hired a coach by then.
Hannum would be the perfect candidate, if not for one small detail.
It's not his age _ Tex Winter, who was one year ahead of Hannum at
USC, is an assistant with the Bulls, after all. It's more of a
generational thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern game and its players,'' Hannum said the other day
from his home in San Diego, ``have passed me by.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was when no one outran Hannum. Tom ``The Mad Manchurian''
Meschery, who played on the Hannum-coached San Francisco Warriors
team that reached the NBA Finals in 1964, once remarked, ``When I
think of Alex's training camps, I think of guys throwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Loose Balls,'' author Terry Pluto's anecdotal history of
the ABA, Hannum said he'd end every practice with a scrimmage. The
first side to five baskets won. The losers, Hannum said, ``ran _ a
lot. You could say that those games were pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Misery, thy name was Meschery as one practice wound down and the
player found himself guarding rookie Rick Barry. Hannum, in his
role as referee, let Barry barrel by Meschery for a basket, then
whistled Meschery for charging when he crashed into Barry at the
other end. Meschery was so enraged, the practice eventually had to
be called on account of his dark mood.
</P>
<P>
   It would take Meschery some 30 minutes to calm down. Aside to
Latrell Sprewell: not once did Meschery reach for Hannum's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just would not have happened with me,'' Hannum said of
the chokehold Sprewell attempted to apply to Warriors coach P.J.
Carlesimo after a practice this past season.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed Hannum was able to squeeze greatness out of
lemons. He turned the NBA's Syracuse Nationals around in the early
1960s, then took over a San Francisco Warriors team that had
finished fourth in the Western Division in 1963 and guided it to an
NBA Finals appearance the next year against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He had a pretty good player riding shotgun that year, a center
by the name of Chamberlain. Chamberlain would score at least 50
points 118 times in his 14-season career. Under Hannum's tutelage
in San Francisco, and later in Philadelphia, Chamberlain became
more committed to defense and team play. The payoff, when it came
in 1967, was nothing short of the jackpot: an NBA championship with
the 76ers, courtesy of a six-game series win over Bill Russell and
the dynasty-in-full-flower that was the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to none of the Chicago championship teams of the
1990s, Hannum called that Philadelphia squad, which included Luke
Jackson, Chet Walker, Hal Greer, Larry Costello and sixth man Billy
Cunningham, ``the best team ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea set forth in recent years that the greatest team
of all time has to have Michael Jordan on it, ``I view it with
amusement,'' Hannum said drolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern player is a magnificent athlete,'' he said. ``He is
bigger, stronger, better trained. He can jump higher, etcetera,
etcetera. That doesn't mean any team now could beat my 76ers. That
team had a camaraderie, a chemistry that was really special.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing good lasts forever and as the 1960s bowed to the 1970s
it became obvious to Hannum that his old-school sensibilities were
at odds with the new breed of players. When money woes felled the
Oaks after their championship season, Hannum drifted to the San
Diego Clippers of the NBA and the Denver Rockets/Nuggets of the ABA
before calling it quits in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say the way the game was being approached by
players and agents was changing,'' Hannum said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Loose Balls,'' he elaborated: ``Toward the end in Denver, I
had trouble communicating with some guys. Also, that was when drugs
were starting to become a factor. I remember hearing guys say that
cocaine was the greatest thing, if you could just afford it. It was
a very discouraging situation.''
</P>
<P>
   So the man who turned two fixer-upper NBA teams and one ABA
squad into title-holders turned full-time to his second job as a
licensed general contractor. Hannum had been dabbling in
construction since his playing days at Oshkosh, Wis.; Syracuse,
N.Y.; Baltimore; Rochester, N.Y.; Milwaukee and St. Louis. It made
perfect cents back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make enough money to support a family in basketball
in those days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days they're talking about holding exhibition games
featuring locked-out NBA players, with the proceeds going to help
pros who may labor to pay their bills if there's a protracted work
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Hannum looks back on the brown-bag lunches he packed (because $5
per diem didn't go very far) and the cramped car rides to far-away
arenas he endured (because it was too expensive to fly even the
rickety DC-3s built before World War II) and the announced crowds
of 98 that turned out for some of his games and all the players of
his era who chose not to pursue pro ball because society largely
shunned the profession. He sees today's players digging in for a
larger piece of paradise and he wonders: How has it come to this?
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain phoned Hannum as soon as he heard of his selection
to the Hall of Fame and the two men ``got talking about the old,
old, old days of basketball,'' Hannum said. ``We didn't make much
money, we didn't have much fan acceptance, but we loved the game.
Both of us were in agreement that the way things are going now, we
hope these guys don't screw the game up.'' &QL;

   His stay was shockingly brief. But Brett Hull, Olympian and

   ``Yeah,'' Hull-san answered. ``Kirin Light.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a local beer, of course. Hull and the U.S. team
discovered an establishment called the ``Kirin House'' on their
first night at the Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   In their week under the Olympic rings, no U.S. player
entertained the daily news media throng quite like Hull.
Brandishing an impish grin and a ready wit, Hull explained one day
how he had embraced the local culture.
</P>
<P>
   He ate crickets. Fried crickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very crispy,'' he told Bernie Miklasz of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty liberal,'' he continued. ``But I'll bet you I held
that thing in front of my mouth for a good five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know _ it's a cricket, for Pete's sake. Just being able to
put it in your mouth is a feat in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. He entertains. He says what's on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   If he scores even an occasional goal, let me suggest that Hull
will be $17 million well spent.
</P>
<P>
   He is a class act, even when he's not acting so classy. He is
good in the locker room, even when he's in front of the minicams,
saying that the coach has got to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has already made Mike Modano a better player. Wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's presence on the ice commands attention. Modano will get
more elbow room, on the ice and in the postgame dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   And how did the crickets taste, someone asked Hull?
</P>
<P>
   Well, they didn't taste like chicken, he reported. ``Kind of a
hickory taste _ and crispy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bite into the cricket, make sure you don't bite
lengthwise down the middle,'' he said. ``The legs will kind of hang
out of your mouth, and it's pretty gross.''
</P>
<P>
   See? When was the last time you read Benoit Hogue say something
like that?
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to semipopular rumor, Hull was not one of the Team USA
players who broke chairs and launched a fire extinguisher from a
fifth-floor window in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has vehemently denied that he was involved and threatened
to sue anyone who said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But beer is brewski, and Hull was known to be spotted at the
occasional West County pub during his years in St. Louis. Some
Blues fans had a problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hull was not a hell-raiser in the Biblical sense. His
recent troubles were confined to a chronic runaway tongue and a
call for the coach's head (Mike Keenan's).
</P>
<P>
   On the latter point, it turned out that Hull was right. The
controversial Keenan had already whisked away Brendan Shanahan and
Curtis Joseph, and Hull's verbal intervention might have opened
some eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He says what he thinks. He doesn't run and hide in the training
room after losses. He doesn't shoot from the lip and then claim he
was misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't had anything like him. Whether he wants it
here or not, Hull will find himself in the spotlight, as a career
554-goal scorer should. Modano should revel in the ensuing freedom.
</P>
<P>
   If you truly think the Detroit Red Wings didn't raise an eyebrow
at their nearest competitor adding Hull, you need to step back and
smell the pizza. Two more Stars goal scorers (Hull and Joe
Nieuwendyk) might well have made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how Hull will play? He was booed in his last game in a
Blues uniform, but the Red Wings had a way of doing that to people.
For a guy who is alleged to be selfish, Hull did a chivalrous job
of adapting to St. Louis coach Joel Quenneville's defense-first
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues all but dominated the Stars in their meetings last
season. Quenneville's team can forget that now.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Brett Hull had become hot air in St. Louis. But here he
will be like a breath of spring.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to love him.

THE POWER OF SUGGESTIONS WORKS FOR CHO
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-WHITESOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Shira Springer 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Satuday at Fenway Park, Korean Red Sox starter Jin Ho
Cho added two words to American baseball jargon: as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed? Looking for something with a little more pizzazz?
Hoping for the first Korean catch phrase? Sorry. Behind the
language barrier, Cho's true novelty is pitching as the
organization predicted he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a hell of a job for a kid coming from Double A,'' said
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``Throwing him right into the major
league fire, he did a hell of a job. He was as advertised, throwing
a lot of first-pitch strikes and a lot of strikes, period.
Everything the minor league people said about him was true. All the
reports were right on.''
</P>
<P>
   In six innings-plus, Cho threw 78 pitches for 50 strikes, with
six hits, one home run, two strikeouts, and one walk. He displayed
four good pitches _ fastball, curve, slider, and changeup, and good
mound presence. His cross-seamed grip _ not uncommon with pitchers
from Korea and Japan _ created a lot of fly-ball outs. On the
downside, he used the slide-step often with men on base and lost a
little off his fastball as the game wore on.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new for those who've seen him pitch. Mystery solved for
those curious about a prospect signed at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fortune-teller but I think he looks like he's got what
it takes,'' said catcher Scott Hatteberg. ``He's very poised,
especially for someone who's 22 years old. He's very mature. He
didn't seem intimidated by the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Most encouraging, though, was Cho's ability to act on Kerrigan's
suggestions when he later faced the same batters. When Robin
Ventura hit a double to start the second inning, Kerrigan told Cho
of the batter's tendencies and Cho adjusted. In his next at-bat,
Ventura grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some adjustments after the first inning,'' said
Kerrigan. ``After Ventura hit the double off him, we made some
adjustments on how to pitch Ventura. He understood exactly what we
wanted and went back out there and did the exact plan that we asked
him to do on Ventura.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find any major differences (from Double A to the
major leagues), except that the batters, they seemed to be much
more perceptive,'' said Cho. ``They are not being deceived or
confused by different balls. I learned that I need to study more
the opposing party because today I didn't really know the opposing
party.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Cho got caught with his homework incomplete. Mike
Cameron hadn't seen a changeup in his first at-bat and came to the
plate in the fifth expecting a fastball. He got one. Cameron hit a
home run on the first pitch for Chicago's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some baseball smarts but I didn't want to flood him
today with too much,'' said Kerrigan, who recognizes the need to
provide more specific information on future hitters. ``I just
recommended he throw his changeup to the lefthanders. He understood
that. I just asked him to follow Hatteberg, to follow the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, however, was not worked to perfection or for a win and
Cho voiced his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a home game and especially because today was
Independence Day I wanted a win,'' said Cho. ``Since we lost I feel
very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   As advertised and apologetic after a loss ... not a bad
combination for a prospect.

CUBS' SOSA HAS BEEN ON A POWER TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 BBN-CUBS-SOSA-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Larry Whiteside 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ You should know about Sammy Sosa. He has lived in the
comparable ghettos of Chicago for so long it has almost become
second nature. First, he roamed the ruins of Comiskey Park. Now, he
clings to the vines of Wrigley Field, where desperate Cub fans have
placed him on a pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Jordan locked out of his NBA palace, Sosa has,
temporarily at least, emerged as the new Lord of Chicago. Traded to
the Cubs in 1992, Sosa, 29, has responded to the challenge of
long-suffering Cub fans who yearn for the glory days of Ernie
Banks, Ron Santo, and Billy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know about Sammy Sosa, he's the guy who crept into
the 1998 home run race with an awesome power-hitting performance
that produced 20 home runs in June and given him 33 with one game
remaining before Tuesday's All-Star Game. For a man who has
averaged 34 homers a season, this should not be a surprise. But it
is, and now you have to wonder why he wasn't voted in as a starter
for the midsummer classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa may be highly underrated by the fans, but he is so valuable
to the Cubs that they decided last year to sign him to a four-year
contract extension worth $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   A native of San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, Sosa
is finally experiencing the fan worship that his countryman, Pedro
Martinez, is receiving in Boston. Maybe it should be that way. They
are neighbors in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the White Sox, I was very young and scared in
those days,'' said Sosa, a 10-year veteran. ``I just hoped to stay
in the majors. So I tried to do everything I could do to survive at
the major league level. I got traded to the Cubs, but I didn't get
upset. I said to myself, I was going to the North Side, a new house
for me. I decided to go there, play hard, put up some numbers, and
let the people know I could play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is one of those cities that embraces its legends. Thus
you'll hear the best first baseman in history is still Ernie Banks,
not Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa can run and hit with power. And has a throwing arm to match
his physical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy is a guy who crosses all barriers,'' said Cubs manager
Jim Riggleman, asked to sum up the feeling of Chicagoans about
Sosa. ``He appeals to all nationalities, be it Dominican,
Canadians, Mexican, black and white. He's appealing to everybody
because of his style of play. He's just got an energy about him
that people get excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy to see him make the All-Star team. He made it
so clear-cut despite what the voting said. There was no way that he
couldn't be on the team. He's doing things that nobody else has
ever done in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was on fire in June. Not only did he inject himself into
the home run race with Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr., but he
also chalked up 40 RBIs in batting a modest .298. His 20 home runs
broke the mark for most homers in a month, a record formerly held
by Detroit's Rudy York, who hit 18 in August 1937. The Giants'
Willie Mays had the National League rec-ord of 17, in August 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The homers come tougher in the second half, but Sosa has been
there before. In 1996, he hit a career-high 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm a little bit surprised about the attention,'' he
said. ``I've always been the player that I am. The problem was that
I had so many pressures before because I didn't have anybody
hitting behind me. I didn't have the quality people we have this
year (Mark Grace, Henry Rodriguez).
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I've been able to do everything ... less strikeouts,
take a walk, try to be patient, and don't try to go crazy. I used
to attack the ball, and it never went anywhere. I had a lot of
strikeouts. Now, I stay back. I see the ball better, and the ideas
that I have about hitting now are working better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa doesn't get cheated in any at-bats. He has hit 203 home
runs since 1993. During that same period, he has struck out 749
times. He has struck out 80 times in 83 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cub fans are used to both.
</P>
<P>
   `I've done a pretty good job because the plan that I have is
much better,'' said Sosa. ``I'm more selective and I don't swing at
bad pitches I used to go after. I'm just more comfortable up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still growing on fans
</P>
<P>
   A few months into the All-Star voting, some interesting thoughts
were expressed on the Internet. Sosa's success even spawned a poll
that suggested a large percentage of fans objected to his challenge
for the home run leadership with McGwire. The survey revealed that
most fans did not want Sosa to win the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously McGwire is a fan favorite. The St. Louis slugger has
been through the chase before and says he won't even start counting
until 50. The Cardinals are not contenders. Sosa is playing for a
team that has wild-card aspirations. With Grace for protection,
Sosa should see a lot of good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any competition with those guys,'' said Sosa. ``I
know they have been there before. I will just keep it going and
finish strong. I do my job every day and whatever happens, happens.
I don't want to change anything right now. I can't afford to worry
about whether I can catch Griffey or McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get along great with the fans. I have a low profile and I'd
like to keep it that way. I like to let people say whatever they
want to say, or compare me to anybody else. But in my mind, that's
not me. I have to keep going hard every day and keep doing what I
am doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's agent, Adam Katz, said that in the years to come, the
Cubs will appreciate how Sosa has carried himself. ``If you look at
his career, his curve was enormous,'' Katz said. ``The numbers
steadily improved. That's part of the reason the Cubs paid him last
year. He was the core of the club. And today, the core guy is the
player the fans connect with and relate to. He has become their
guy.
</P>
<P>
   `They appreciate him off the field because he's always been
charitable. He's assimilated more culturally. It took a little
while, but he's done a nice job of making an adjustment. I think
the people who get to know him will see this.''
</P>
<P>
   In footsteps of legends
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the baton at Wrigley Field is a sacred ritual
attended most days by 30,000 close friends. For a club with a
history of losing, there are a handful of heroes whom the fans
still hold dear. Sosa is getting there, but he should be careful
what he wishes for.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Hack, Andy Pakfo and Phil Cavarretta came out of the '40s.
They got to a World Series once. You can still hear talk at Wrigley
Field about the loss to Detroit in 1945. They haven't had another
chance, although there were division flags flying over Chicago in
1984 and 1989. (They lost to San Diego and San Francisco,
respectively).
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Kiner was a legend, as was teammate Hank Sauer. They were
followed by Banks and Williams in the '60s. Then along came Santo
and Ferguson Jenkins. All were All-Stars. But they never reached a
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Dawson, Ryne Sandberg, and Grace were all touted as
legends, but they didn't have staying power. Sosa just is a little
better right now, and the folks at Wrigley recognize this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy is a little stronger than I was,'' said Williams, a Hall
of Fame inductee. ``He is around 195 pounds and I was around 171.
We both have quickness but because of his strength, he makes better
contact. The wind doesn't affect the balls he hits here. They did
me, I was lefthanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just attribute his success to the young pitching.
It's still the major leagues. Quite naturally, the pitching is
going to be diluted because there are so many teams in the league.
But I haven't seen his kind of power to go along with a knack for
base hits. He used to hit in the .250's. Now he's steady in the
.320's.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sosa: ``My hero is God. He's the one who spurred me and
gave me all the opportunity and ability that I have. He's been with
me all the time ... as a player and a person inside.''

CROATIA GIVES GERMANY THE BOOT
</HEADLINE>
 SOC-CROATIA-GERMANY-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Frank Dell'Apa 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ The country has been involved in civil war since
voting to secede from the Yugoslav Republic in 1991. The coach was
involved in France's biggest sporting scandal. So, a World Cup
quarterfinal match filled with subplots of revenge and makeup calls
barely seemed to affect the Croatian national team Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats accomplished one of the biggest upsets of the
tournament by eliminating Germany, 3-0, to set up a semifinal
meeting against France at Saint-Denis Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jarni scored an emphatic goal in the final minutes of the
first half, just after Germany's Christian Woerns had been ejected,
and the Croats had gained control while playing with a man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Germany emphatically disputed the ejection, which some claimed
was to compensate for some unfair treatment Croatia received in a
2-1 loss to Germany in the 1996 European Championships in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became easier for us after the sending off,'' said Croatia
coach Miroslav Blazevic, who was jailed briefly during the
Olympique Marseille match-fixing scandal in 1993. ``But that
doesn't take anything away from this win. Germany played with their
typical character and determination and sporting spirit when the
score was 0-0 and after it was 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   But Croatia had an effective formula to overcome Germany _ a
well-organized, physical defense, combined with the highly-skilled,
confident and expressive midfield play of Aljosa Asanovic, Zvonimir
Boban, and Mario Stanic.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats remained poised despite a powerful German onslaught
at the start, and retained some respect by displaying a
counterattacking threat with Davor Suker.
</P>
<P>
   They showed the resourcefulness of Blazevic, who has friends in
high places _ namely, president Franjo Tudjman, who named Blazevic
the country's first minister of sport seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This tournament has been the background for a huge display of
nationalism for Croatia, and Tudjman was probably one of the
proudest Croats at Stade Gerland, especially since he was sitting
near German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia began expressing its resentment from Euro '96 early in
the match. Slaven Bilic, the rugged central defender nicknamed
``Bilic The Kid,'' asserted himself quickly, but Bierhoff got the
best of most of their aerial duels. Referee Rune Pedersen halted
the action midway through the half, requiring Igor Stimac and Jorge
Heinrich to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   The tension escalated as Bierhoff retreated into defense to
elbow Zvonimir Soldo in the head. In the 40th minute, Woerns
departed after taking down Suker. Lothar Matthaus controlled a
clearance just over the halfway line, but Suker anticipated his
pass to Woerns. Suker slipped through on the way to goal, and
Pedersen issued a red card as Suker tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany had the best scoring chances in the run of play.
Bierhoff drew two defenders on a corner kick, leaving Dietmar
Hamann to head inches high. Bierhoff eluded the defense for a
powerful header in the 30th minute that was saved by Drazen Ladic.
Croatia soon defused the German attack, though, by limiting Thomas
Hassler's involvement in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans still seemed in command, until the ejection, which
they disputed en masse, and continued to protest to Pedersen as the
first half ended.
</P>
<P>
   Though Croatia had the advantage in numbers for the final
minutes of the half, the goal was unexpected. Germany had
reorganized, and continued to threaten. But Bilic stopped a foray
and neatly dribbled past two opponents before finding Stanic just
over the halfway line on the right. Stanic dribbled toward the
penalty area, faked a shot, and calmly retained possession. This
appeared to momentarily cause the Germans to relax, and also
allowed Jarni to catch up with the action from his left back
position.
</P>
<P>
   Jarni lined up the shot from 20 yards away on the left and
blasted a low, left-footer that skipped over Andreas Koepke's left
hand and hit just inside the far post less than a minute before the
end of the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans' best chance to tie was in the eighth minute of the
second half, but Ladic saved Bierhoff's point-blank drive inches
from the goal. In the 31st minute, Hamann's free kick glanced off
the outside of the post for a corner. Goran Vlaovic scored the
second goal a minute later, after Boban collected a Bierhoff
header, dribbled down the middle of the field, and laid off on the
right. Vlaovic's hard low shot evaded Koepke, who also struggled
with the third goal, as Suker slammed a 15-yarder under his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Germany had become vulnerable by going to a four-forward lineup,
with East German-born Ulf Kirsten and Olaf Marschall, in an all-out
attempt to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the sending off incident, there was no doubt Germany
gave its best performance of the World Cup,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``There is no point in discussing the red card, the
fact is Croatia goes on to Paris and we go back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the upper hand, and until this incident, which was a
rather provocative one, we were controlling the game. But I don't
want to say any more about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, with a population of 5 million, has a chance to become
the smallest country to reach the World Cup championship match
besides two-time champion Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big, big, big, big, big,'' Dario Simic said, ``a big
victory for us. We are a small country and right now it's
incredible what we've done.''

CONFLICTING VIEWS FROM TENT CITY JAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started over an extra pair of socks.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Saulsberry, a work-release inmate at Tent City jail,
wanted to bring them through the gate after a day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Detention officer Mitch Field said it wasn't allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Saulsberry was on the ground allegedly getting
kicked, choked and jolted with a stun gun, then hauled to a jail
infirmary where guards pinned him down and shoved a catheter up his
penis, drawing blood instead of urine.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 9, three months after Attorney
General Janet Reno sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio for excessive force
against inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates phoned The Arizona Re public to report that guards had
brutalized a guy named Cedric.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were beating him, kneeing him, kicking him,'' said
Brandyn Young, 18, a Mesa drug offender. ``They were stomping on
his back, saying, `You like that? You like that?' Sticking the
taser to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Five inmates told the same story in separate interviews. Except
for Young, the witnesses asked not to be identified for fear of
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   They said Field pushed him against a fence for unknown rea sons,
then threw him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, they added, deten tion officer Jason Leheir
grabbed Saulsberry's arm and began twisting while Field used a stun
gun.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates say they yelled at the jailers, ``You guys need to get
off of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates said other guards joined in the stomping and kicking,
then led Saulsberry away.
</P>
<P>
   That's one version of events.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Another appears in a sheriff's report that includes narratives
from Field and Leheir. Using nearly identical sentences, the guards
al lege that Saulsberry violated jail policy by bringing
unauthorized clothing, then used obscene lan guage and tried to
punch Field.
</P>
<P>
   Their report contains no state ments from Saulsberry or an esti
mated 65 onlookers, no mention of kicks or stomps. It says Field
held his stun device to the prisoner's back and made threats, but
never activated it.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Office sought fel ony prosecution of Saulsberry
for assaulting Field, but no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI launched an investigation. Saulsberry filed
griev ances and hired a civil attorney.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview in Towers Jail, the inmate said he had
permission to bring extra work clothes to Tent City. That claim was
verified by Laura Lanich, his adult probation officer, who said she
faxed a letter to the jail on Saulsberry's behalf after getting
approval from a sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``No inmate should ever have to go through what I went
through,'' Saulsberry said. ``If people like me stay silent,
history will keep repeat ing itself. &QL; 
DOING THE TIME &QL; 
The Saulsberry saga is just one perspective on a jail that suffers
from overcrowding, understaffing and philosophical conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County's eight deten tion centers ooze stories of out
manned guards; of contraband, criminals and red tape; of lawsuits
and politics; of correctional experts condemning jail violence; of
prison ers in sweat-hot tents eating stale food; of taxpayers and
voters with divergent notions of justice.
</P>
<P>
   At the locus of it all is Arpaio, a former DEA agent who molded
this torpid institution to his crime-fight ing image.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio is listed as defendant in more than 800 lawsuits filed in
U.S. District Court and Maricopa County Superior Court since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of those involve allegations of prisoner civil
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Many are clearly frivolous _ bemoaning bugs or tent leaks or
lost shoes. Just this month, an appellate court shot down Arpaio's
ban on girlie magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But most civil complaints get dropped or thrown out after being
filed by inmates who lack the resources, sophistication or tenacity
for a years-long legal process. Sheriff's officials say less than
$100,000 has been paid out on inmate suits under Arpaio, not
counting legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   But prisoners aren't alone in complaining of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, jail experts, Amnesty International,
de fense lawyers and the federal gov ernment all have condemned
conditions in the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department lawsuit was lodged Oct. 31 after a pair
of studies by correctional consultants Eugene Miller and George
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's critical report in 1996 was followed by a letter from
Assistant Attorney General Deval L. Patrick, who wrote of inmates
being beaten, hog-tied and having stun guns applied to their
testicles. He said guards lacked training and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio was so incensed with the findings that he persuaded
federal lawyers to hire another expert to repeat the work.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, by Sullivan, was also damning. Sullivan criti
cized grievance procedures, an un safe intake area and use-of-force
policies. He said some violence by guards was ``unprovoked, unneces
sary and, consequently, unjustified and excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   After release of the report _ which Arpaio resisted _ the
sheriff issued a rebuttal disputing some allegations and claiming
that he'd already dealt with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's work became a corner stone of the Justice Department
lawsuit that claimed not only that inmates were abused, but that
offi cials knew of misconduct and chose not to remedy the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed along with a settlement signed by Arpaio.
Among other things, he agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   _Ban the hogtying of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibit the use of restraint chairs as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish strict rules on the use of pepper spray and stun
guns.
</P>
<P>
   _Review all incidents where force is used against inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Napolitano, then-U.S. attor ney for Arizona, derided her
own lawsuit as ``lawyerly paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio chimed in, ``It may be a lawsuit, but it's not. Let me
say this for the people of Maricopa County: The chain gangs stay.
The tents stay. The pink underwear stay. All my programs stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, it is unclear what prompted the Justice
Depart ment to drop its case. Sullivan, who was assigned to review
jail condi tions, visited for several days but filed no follow-up
report. Federal lawyers in Washington, D.C., re fused to discuss
whether Arpaio had lived up to the agreement. &QL; 
MISERY LOVES COMPANY &QL; 
Others are not silent, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't changed one damn thing,'' said Joel Robbins, an
attorney who has sued Arpaio on behalf of several prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have improved, they were really bad before,'' said
Peter Hickey, a lawyer who represents prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio complains that nobody mentions his 42 programs designed
to help prisoners, including drug treatment, religious groups and a
Girl Scout troop for inmate mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the next breath, he brags of using jail to make each
inmate a public example of misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to use the word `punishment,' '' explains the
sheriff. ``I want them to hate the place so when they get out
they'll never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy apparently doesn't work: During a recent
government research project, ASU Justice Stud ies Professor John
Hepburn tracked 4,800 Maricopa County inmates _ and found no
evidence that harsh treatment reduced recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   According to inmates, however, the sheriff did his best.
</P>
<P>
   _``This is jail, and we were wrong, but we're still human,''
said a woman who would not give her name. ``I did my crime. I
admitted to it, and I'm serving my time. But don't treat me like an
animal. . . . If it's his (Arpaio's) goal to make you absolutely
miserable, he is achieving it in a very inhumane way.''
</P>
<P>
   _``They made me sleep on filthy, cold floors,'' said Stan
Fishman, 62, who spent two years behind bars awaiting trial for
fraud. ``When I was sick, they wouldn't give me medication. The
food was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   _``I sat in solitary for a week, trying to pass a kidney stone
with no medication,'' said Gary Kruczyn ski.
</P>
<P>
   _``It is the most degrading, awful feeling to be in that jail,''
said a current inmate, who asked not to be identified. ``And he
(Arpaio) is making it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff makes no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   He has parlayed the ``toughest sheriff'' label into worldwide
fame. He has written a book, made an estimated 500 talk-show appear
ances, won an 85 percent approval rating among county residents.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio likes to tell how three presidential candidates asked the
same question after touring Mari copa County Jail: ``How do you get
away with this?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``You know how to get it done? You do it! If we were
so bad, do you think I'd still be sheriff after five years? I
haven't been driven out of town.'' &QL; 
POLITICS OF PUNISHMENT &QL; 
Donna Hamm, president of the Middle Ground inmate advocacy group,
offers another explanation. She says Arpaio has ``successfully
appealed to the base mentality'' of those who believe that everyone
in jail is guilty, despicable, dangerous and deserving of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are throw-away people. They have no value. And we
can treat them any way we want because nobody cares. That's a staff
mantra in the county jail. They (guards) have the most popular
politician in the state (as their boss), so they can do what they
want,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, she contends, is a correctional minefield of
lawsuits and simmering violence that will cost taxpayers far more
than run ning a decent jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Arpaio is a good snake oil salesman,'' adds Hamm. ``And I
think that makes him as dangerous to the public as any street thug
sitting in a cell. People are buying his snake oil. . . . They
think he has it under control. It's far out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Arpaio has admitted his jails are on the brink of
violence. In a November 1996 letter to Ed King, then chairman of
the county Board of Supervisors, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail overcrowding has reached a critical stage far beyond
simple bed shortages. We cannot function safely or legally without
adequate staffing, and we must have infrastructure that can support
our entire inmate popu lation. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``When officers' only truthful response to inmate complaints
about cold food, lack of hot water, crowding and long waits for
medical care is, `There's nothing we can do,' they are soon
identified as bad guys by the inmates. Angry, frustrated inmates
see no potential redress for their grievances and react out of
control. . . . Violence is bound to erupt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Arpaio disputed his own words, then said,
``I am not going to point the finger at other people to justify
some of the problems we do have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Chief Larry Wendt, head of custody operations, ac
knowledged that the jails are a ``powder keg.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendt oversees 7,000 inmates in a system with a capacity for
5,300. He said medical care, laundries and legal services are
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   As for food services, Wendt said, kitchens designed to produce
13,000 daily meals are churning out 28,000. Inmates gripe about
cold meals, Wendt added, so guards apologize. Then more inmates
complain, and guards get sick of it. Tempers erupt. Obscenities
flow, followed by as saults and lockdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the confrontation,'' said Wendt. ``There's the
downward spiral that hurts not only employee morale, but inmate
attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   While county voters contemplate a $900 million jail construction
bond, Arpaio vows never to turn away an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to surrender,'' he says, dramatically flicking
on a neon ``Vacancy'' sign beside his desk. ``I'm not going to just
bump people in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the sheriff, and his fans, ignore a key fact in the
equation of crime and punishment: More than two-thirds of the
prison ers are pretrial defendants _ pre sumed innocent under the
law. And most of the convicted inmates were not sentenced for major
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and worst get the same treatment,'' lawyer Robbins
said. ``They've taken away the carrot, and all that's left is the
stick. He (Arpaio) can't start punishing people (jail employees)
for being tough if he's going to be America's toughest sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio's response: Most pre-trial inmates have long rap sheets,
so there's no reason to distinguish them from convicts. ``They are
crimi nals,'' he added. ``We don't run a first-class section and a
second-class section.'' &QL; 
BOOKING HELL &QL; 
Until a few months ago, most inmates were introduced to custody in
a 40- by 40-foot booking area at downtown Phoenix's Madison Street
Jail.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of space has been doubled with construction of a
second booking area _ one im provement that has occurred since the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the daily ritual continues: Prisoners arrive in handcuffs,
about 400 per day, for prints, mugs and booking. Murderers, mental
cases, thieves, junkies and average folks who failed to pay
speeding tickets. Most are from the demographic depths, wearing
tattoos, scars and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Jail intake, known as ``The Horseshoe'' because of its shape, is
a forbidding place due to the numbers, the craziness, the close
quarters. Druggy-eyed hookers sa shay in skimpskirts. Gangbangers
proclaim innocence and complain about tight handcuffs. A fast-sober
ing yuppy cowers in search of invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   Two semi-circles of worn paint mark the wall where new arrivals
place their hands while detention officers pat them down.
</P>
<P>
   Holding cells are packed with young toughs _ sleeping on con
crete, pacing, casting reptile stares, waiting for bail or
placement in a system they sarcastically call ``Joe's Happy
Hotel.'' A few grab spots on steel bunks against the wall. Others
sleep on a concrete floor without mattresses or bedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is, they mix the violent guys in with the
people picked up on misdemeanors,'' said a man who identified
himself only as ``Bob,'' 39 and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived on the street awhile, so I can handle a lot of
stuff. But you put a 19-year-old kid in there who lives with his
parents, he could freak out. . . . It's bad in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jail commanders say conditions are humane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at any part of this jail,'' Capt. David Alster
said during a tour at Madison Street. ``Tell me where you want to
go. We have nothing to hide. But there's this cloud over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alster, a jailer for 20 years, said the lawyers, experts and
human rights advocates don't understand the innards of a jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we didn't have problems,'' he added, ``but it
isn't a pattern and practice (of abuse) like they said. . . . We
process 130,000 people (a year). Many of them are on
methamphetamines, drunk, psy chotic, violent.'' &QL; 
A JAILER'S VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, First Avenue Jail houses 186 inmates who
refuse to work, plus 90 convicts awaiting shipment to state prison.
They sleep four or eight to a cell.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Donald Moose, who started working the jail in 1976, opens
the catwalk door with a huge latchkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've served more time here than the inmates,'' Moose says,
chuck ling. ``When I started, I never had any training at all. You
walked in, they gave you a set of keys, and you started work.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Moose says, inmates are mean and sneaky. They've got drug
problems, gang records, contempt for authority.
</P>
<P>
   Moose heads down a corridor lined with scowling faces. Inmates
are allowed only clothing, hygiene products, reading materials,
paper and pens. The daily routine begins with wakeup and breakfast
at 4:30 a.m. Lights go out at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners get an hour of recre ation a week. No TV. No coffee.
No smokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who have been sen tenced to state prison, they can't
wait to get out of this joint,'' Moose says.
</P>
<P>
   He clanks the door shut and says guards have little bargaining
power with inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much you can take away because they don't have
much to start with. But the officers learn . . . once your shift is
over, forget about it. You have to learn that.'' &QL; 
ANGRY GUESTS &QL; 
Each time Arpaio gets in the news, which is often, prisoners write
letters such as this one from ``an inmate at Estrella Jail,
female'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Your clothes and underwear you only change once a week. . . .
We shower in cold water . . . (and) have no heat. It is so cold
here, and we have no warm clothes and (they) just allow one
blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mices and roaches help themselves to our food before we
get it. The DOs (detention officers) here are so mean to us and do
not know how to talk to a person. I had an allergic reaction to
fish, my throat started closing. (An officer) did not let me go to
medical for two hours, and I almost lost my life. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to beg for aspirins and sanitary pads. . . . Since I
have been here, my lips have broken out and look like hamburger
meat . . . my back is covered with a rash. . . . We need help out
here!''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates invariably say that most detention officers are
professional and decent. But they remember the bitter and brutal
ones clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're treated like crap, without any dignity, then you
be come hardened, not just to what's in here, but to what's out in
the real world, too,'' said a woman from Tent City. ``When DOs
treat you with dignity, you can keep that dignity when you come out
and treat people like humans.'' &QL; 
AN INMATE'S TALE &QL; 
Which brings us back to Cedric Saulsberry and Jan. 9 at Tent City.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old furniture mover, serving time for an aggravated
assault conviction, said he did not provoke officer Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They handcuffed me, and while I'm handcuffed on the ground,
bleeding, one officer comes up and starts kicking me in the head.
And officer Leheir stuns me with his stun gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Saulsberry said his right eye was swollen and his back was
injured. He was taken to a jail office where guards requested drug
testing. Saulsberry said he was not on drugs, but refused to
urinate in a cup because he didn't trust jail officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a sheriff's report, then-deten tion Officer Brian Moyer
confirms that Saulsberry refused to provide urine unless an outside
doctor conducted the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, a certified drug recogni tion expert, concluded that
Sauls berry was ``under the influence of a central nervous system
stimulant.'' But if so, one of his symptoms was odd: Moyer's final
note says the inmate ``started to nod back and forth to asleep
(sic).''
</P>
<P>
   The incident report ends there, and Arpaio's office refused to
release internal records on the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Wendt, the jail commander, confirmed that Saulsberry was
taken to Estrella Jail's infirmary, where guards pinned him down to
obtain a urine sample. Wendt said the procedure was conducted by
medical personnel to determine if Saulsberry's back pain was
related to a kidney injury.
</P>
<P>
   Saulsberry's version: ``The jail commander had my penis in his
hand. He's got a catheter with a jagged edge. And he says, `Hold
still or I'm going to cut you. . . . '
</P>
<P>
   ``I look down and there's blood everywhere. I was all cut up. I
passed blood for four days. They moved me to the main jail (in
downtown Phoenix). They wouldn't allow me legal calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Jail supervisors say Saulsberry assaulted Field and consented to
the catheter insertion, which had been authorized by medical staff.
Yet they also complained that Saulsberry was uncooperative during
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had consented to the test, why was I held down?''
Saulsberry wrote in a grievance appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Cassidy, an external ref eree, ruled that force was
justified but the catheter incident ``should not have taken
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Saulsberry said authorities tried to silence him by seeking
criminal charges at the same time internal affairs detectives were
supposedly investigating jail guards. He took a lie-detector test _
administered by a sheriff's employee _ and was told he failed.
Later, Saulsberry said, the polygrapher joined a detective in
advising him to drop all complaints or face ``a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Saulsberry's answer: ``I'm not going to let them get away with
this. I want every officer involved in this to do jail time. . . .
If I don't say nothing, they'll keep doing this to others.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Millwood in form in 4-1 win
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Kevin Millwood formally reintroduced himself Saturday
night. Any similarity between him and the person making his
previous two starts is completely coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took their second straight from the Mets 4-1,
extending their win streak to seven, tying their longest this
season, and opening an 11 1/2-game NL East lead on the second-place
New Yorkers. That guaranteed Atlanta a double-digit lead at the
All-Star break for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Compelling news all, but secondary to the return of Millwood,
who held the Mets scoreless through eight innings after gving up 12
runs on 4 2/3 innings in his previous two starts. The Mets' only
run came in the ninth off Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took a 3-0 lead in the fourth, when they scored twice
without a hit. Following walks to Chipper Jones and Andres
Galarraga, the Mets could have ended the inning with a double play
on Andruw Jones' grounder to short. But Rey Ordonez's throw to
second baseman Carlos Baerga was slightly wide to the first base
side, and Galarraga's slide took Baerga down and knocked the ball
loose, allowing Chipper Jones to score from third.
</P>
<P>
   After Eddie Perez walked to load the bases, Gerald Williams
delivered a sacrifice fly to bring in Galarraga. A Keith Lockhart
double and a Chipper Jones single put Braves at first and third in
the seventh. Mets starter Masato Yoshii hit Galarraga with a pitch,
loading the bases, and was replaced by Bill Pulsipher, who retired
the next two hitters but walked Perez to force in the run.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss led off the Braves' first with a double, his first
extra-base hit since May 14. Lockhart singled on the next pitch,
placing men on first and third. Weiss scored while the Mets were
turning a double play on Chipper Jones' hard grounder to the right
side.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost Mike Piazza in the Braves' half of the second,
when Gerald Williams caught the left side of his head with the
follow-through from his swing on a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza eventually left the field under his own power with a
contusion behind his left ear but was taken to Piedmont Hospital
for a precautionary CAT-scan.

 &HT;    The battles rage onBy Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla. -- The flames aren't visible in the dense
stand of pines bordering the Riverbend Community Church, but the
smoke is so thick it leaves everyone nearby gagging and rubbing
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Chris Edwards and Michelle Christiansen walk directly
into the heart of the plume, disappearing within seconds, their
bright yellow fire-protection jackets blurring in the smoky haze.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later a sleek blue helicopter flown by Ray Speights
darts over the pines. A red, 325-gallon water bucket slung on a
line from its belly nearly nicks the tops of the tallest trees.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow through the smoke, Speights spots a fluorescent orange
flag tied to a 10-foot pole that Edwards waves. He pulls a lever
and dumps the water directly on the spot Edwards marked.
</P>
<P>
   Then he banks his chopper and curves back toward a small pond
where he'll load up with more water, his airship snaking through
the air, dodging pine trees and power lines, rotors beating a
steady whump-whump-whump.
</P>
<P>
   It's all big and bright and thundering overhead, like something
out of a war movie.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from pond to flames takes a minute, tops, and Speights
flies it all afternoon in the 100-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to fly in Vietnam and he says it's just like that
fighting a fire,'' said Christiansen, a sunbaked blonde who wears
her hair pulled up in a bun beneath her red hard hat, which bears a
hand-scrawled nickname on a piece of tape: ``Devil Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Speights has something of a breeze in his chopper.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen and Edwards _ the foot soldiers in Florida's war
against wildfire _ slog it out on the ground, wading into the
hottest spots of the fire to guide Speights to his targets.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of a U.S. Forest Service firefighting team,
brought in from Utah to help battle the blazes that in the past
week have nearly overwhelmed Central Florida's Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in the arid west where temperatures soar but the
humidity stays low, Christiansen and Edwards _ his nickname is
``Fast Eddy''_ are college students at Weber State University in
Ogden, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting fires across the country everywhere from Alaska to
Florida may not seem like a normal summer job, but they both love
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a rush,'' said Christiansen, 21. ``It's just a total
rush working with the helicopter. And it makes you feel you're
doing something good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the blistering Florida heat, it also borders on torture. The
forest service crews work 21-day shifts. Then they get two days
off. They work 14-hour work days. They fight fires from sunup to
sundown, then crash in some cheap motel _ if they're lucky _ and
get up and do it again. If the motels are all full, they sleep in
elementary school classrooms or church recreation rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We check out of our motel every day because we never know
where they'll send us next,'' Christiansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The pay beats burger-flipping, but it won't make anybody rich.
The scale varies, but an experienced firefighter makes around $9 to
$10 an hour, plus a little more for hazardous duty and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   To fire-threatened Florida residents, it's some of the best tax
money the federal government has ever spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing an unbelievable job,'' said the Rev. Roy
Hargrave, pastor of the Riverbend church, who has seen the flames
lick the trees not 30 feet from his sprawling building. ``I can't
say enough about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen and Edwards are low key. The fire by the church,
they say, is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' Christiansen said. ``If it gets in this grass,
we can stop it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't think their jobs are anything way out, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my friends do it, too,'' Christiansen said. ``They
think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen's mom _ a federal Bureau of Land Management
employee _ thinks it's great, too. So does her dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's really cool,'' she said. ``He's a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a wiry five-year veteran who sports a big loop earring
and surfer shades, isn't blessed with parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've read it,'' he said of the best-selling book ``Young
Men and Fire,'' about a horrible disaster that befell a forest
service firefighting team like his own in the mountains out west.
Most of the team perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad gave me that book, trying to keep me from doing this,''
Edwards said. ``I'm sure my mom would love to get me out of this
game. She lives in Tampa and she's worried out of her mind. But
some people are born to do it. I love it more than anything I've
ever done in my life. You accomplish something and you get to see
what you've done. Then you go crack a cold one and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   That cold one must shimmer like a frosty mirage in the desert as
the pair prepared to wade back into the smoke engulfing Ormond
Beach last week.
</P>
<P>
   Each carries at least 35 pounds of gear, slung in their blue
rucksacks and strapped to their belts. They wear radios on their
chests for barking out directions to the chopper. They carry big
rubber flappers on poles for beating out the flames.
</P>
<P>
   In the packs are ``fusees''_ flares used to set backfires _
along with a brush jacket, two days' worth of food, goggles, ear
protectors, an emergency tent and a couple of gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   They are dressed in fire-resistant pants and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces, clothes, hands and boots are covered with soot and
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   They don't wear masks or carry oxygen bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much weight,'' said Edwards, 25.
</P>
<P>
   These are the first Florida fires they've ever fought. Usually
they are out west, in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are no hills to climb, no thin air at high altitude
to fight along with the choking smoke. But there is no vantage
point to look down from to see the fire and gauge its direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally different here,'' Christiansen said. ``You can't
see what's going on. The fire stays really low, most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The team arrived in Florida on June 9. Speights flew the chopper
from out west, while the rest of the six-person crew spent four
days driving in a van.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they've had two days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the beach and got sunburned,'' Christiansen laughed.
``This is the first time I've ever been to Florida. I haven't seen
too much of it. It's covered in smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the firefighters has ever had to break out their
emergency tents, which are made of flame-resistant space-age foil.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first summer a fire got all around us and we couldn't get
out,'' Christiansen said. ``That's the closest I've ever gotten. We
got in a track graded by a bulldozer and the flames just went over
us.''
</P>
<P>
   And how long will she work her unusual summer job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it until I graduate,'' said the sports medicine major.
``But that may be quite awhile. By the time we finish in the fall,
I usually only have time for about one semester a year.

DATING VIOLENCE MAKES NIGHTMARE OF TEEN YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIN SHAW  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 17, Rochelle dreams about pizza parties.
</P>
<P>
   She yearns for the normal, fun things teenagers love _ talking
with friends, laughing about boys, planning expeditions to the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   But normality has seemed out of reach for Rochelle, who already
has been physically and mentally abused by several boyfriends. At
16, it drove her to heroin and a suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend used to pick me up and pin me to the brick wall
at school, holding me by my neck,'' Rochelle said.
</P>
<P>
   She flinched as she remembered how other students walked by,
either ignoring her or laughing as she tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle's case is more severe than most. But experts say dating
violence is a reality for one of every three high school students.
</P>
<P>
   Dating abuse can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual,
social workers and school counselors say. It can begin with
name-calling or a simple push. It can end with beatings, rape, even
the threat of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an issue and it's not always reported,'' says
Susan Jenkin, counselor at Canyon Del Oro High School in Tucson.
She says teens are afraid to ask for help because they believe the
abuse they're suffering is ``normal.'' &QL; 
UNSURE OF RELATIONSHIPS &QL; 
Some teens are unsure of what to expect as they begin their first
relationships, Jenkin said. If they haven't been taught to
distinguish between healthy and non-healthy relationships, they may
endure the abuse in an effort to please their abusers.
</P>
<P>
   For others, like Rochelle, abuse is the norm. Perhaps they have
witnessed abuse at home, or been victims themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron knows about being a victim. The 15-year-old wears the
uniform of a teenager _ basketball shoes and Walkman. But his quick
smile dims when he speaks of the abuse in his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepdad used to beat us,'' Aaron said. ``I had black
eyes.'' He witnessed his mother being abused and often begged her
to leave before it was too late. He wondered if it was something he
did that caused his stepfather to fly into a rage.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron vowed he would never abuse another person. But breaking
the cycle of violence is not always simple. Research shows that
violence perpetuates violence; children who have witnessed abuse
are likely to become abusers or victims themselves. &QL; 
TRAPPED IN VIOLENCE &QL; 
``A lot of kids have myths about what makes up a good
relationship,'' said Judy Kreiter, director of the Center Against
Sexual Abuse. Each time she delivers a presentation in high
schools, she's approached by students trapped in violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are in crisis; a lot of them are in borderline
situations and they don't know how to get out,'' Kreiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Many are plagued by low self-esteem, feeling that no one else
would ever want them. They may believe the abuser's promises that
things will change, that the beatings or verbal abuse will end.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Kreiter said, teens in abusive relationships face many
of the same issues as adults.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, however, many teens feel trapped in an abusive
relationship by fear of losing popularity in their peer group, said
Andrea Riteneur of the Preventing Abuse and Violence Program in
Chandler schools.
</P>
<P>
   Riteneur believes that the pressure to ``fit in,'' combined with
lack of dating experience, leads to teens' accepting violent
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're more popular because you are dating a `cool'
person,'' Riteneur said. &QL; 
PRESSURE STARTS EARLIER &QL; 
Teenagers are facing pressures earlier and earlier, she said, while
often unsure of expectations in a dating relationship. It is not
uncommon for Riteneur to speak with 12- and 13-year-olds who
consider themselves to be ``exclusive'' with a boyfriend or
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Dating, or ``going out,'' begins as early as junior high, agreed
several Tempe teens interviewed recently at a local recreation
center. And as teens get older, the pressure to be part of a couple
increases and drives teens to stay in abusive situations.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they have friends who have suffered physical and
emotional abuse because they didn't know how to get out _ in some
cases because they didn't feel comfortable discussing it with their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of families, you don't talk about that (dating and
sex),'' said Perla, 17. ``You go to your friends.'' Jan Sears, a
counselor in the Glendale Union High School District, said parents
should be open to honest conversation with their sons and
daughters, encouraging them to discuss daily events and important
topics. She suggested creating boundaries for the child early
regarding issues such as setting an appropriate age to begin dating
and deciding what curfew will be. She encourages group dating as an
alternative to high-pressure one-on-one dates.
</P>
<P>
   Sears believes it is up to parents, schools and an entire
community to help teens discover themselves and create goals.

IT'S REFRESHING: LASORDA DOESN'T FLINCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At his press conference last week, a few days
after his firing as Dodgers general manager, Fred Claire was asked
if there were lessons he would take along to a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Claire paused for a beat, barely cracking a smile as he said,
``I won't trade Pedro Martinez (again).''
</P>
<P>
   The Pedro Martinez deal, in which the pitcher went to the
Montreal Expos in exchange for second baseman Delino DeShields in
1993, was only the most recent and most glaring example of the
Dodgers trading a good young player for a veteran and later
regretting it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the team's attempts to barter the produce of their farm
system had backfired so spectacularly over the years that you
wondered if they'd ever again take a gamble like the one announced
Saturday, when new GM Tom Lasorda sent infielder Paul Konerko, 22,
and left-hander Dennis Reyes, 21, to the Cincinnati Reds for
bullpen ace Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle involving Martinez, who was 22 at the time of the
trade and went on to win the National League Cy Young Award for
Montreal in '97, had seemed to confirm a Dodgers belief that their
prospects were too good to give up.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered John Franco, 22 in '83 when then-GM Al Campanis
traded him and another young pitcher to Cincinnati for Rafael
Landestoy. Three hundred seventy-seven saves later, Franco is still
pitching for the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered Juan Guzman, 20 in '87 when Claire traded him to
the Toronto Blue Jays for Mike Sharperson. Guzman, between
injuries, pitched brilliantly for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered Mike Devereaux, 25 in '89 when he went to the
Baltimore Orioles for Mike Morgan. A couple of years later,
Devereaux drove in 100 runs for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered John Wetteland, 25 when he and Tim Belcher went
to Cincinnati for Eric Davis and Kip Gross. While Davis was never
himself in Los Angeles, Wetteland has 232 saves for the Expos, New
York Yankees and Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to judge Campanis' and Claire's deal-making solely
by those trades, which were extracted from a long list. But if
Claire and the Dodgers have been as slow on the trigger as critics
claimed, the memory of those disasters explains why.
</P>
<P>
   The past few years, rival GMs came to realize that asking the
Dodgers to part with prospects was like asking them to give away
their children. Worse, seeing that Campanis once traded his own
son.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Fourth of July deal, which will be known around
the nation as ``the Jeff Shaw trade,'' also is significant because
of the kind of players the Dodgers gave up. This is different from
May and June trades, in which the Dodgers lost veterans Mike
Piazza, Todd Zeile and Hideo Nomo, stars of various magnitudes but
known quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko was the consensus minor-league player of the year in '97
and came out of spring training with unlimited potential; the club
was expected to trade Eric Karros to make room for him. Reyes was
the Dodgers' top minor-league pitcher in '97, and was holding down
a spot in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   If Konerko fulfills his promise and Reyes finds home plate, in a
few years we might view this trade as the bad result of an
``interim'' GM, desperate to impress the bosses and win the job
permanently, mortgaging a piece of the future to rouse a team
that's already dead in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they're not dead yet, even if seven games behind the
Giants in the NL wild-card race looks like a lot just a day before
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was announced early in Saturday's game at San
Francisco, and I thought I saw a little more spirit in the Dodgers
after that. In the four-run fifth inning that decided the game,
they pulled the hit-and-run like no Dodgers team since Lasorda's
'88 World Series winners. In the bottom of the inning, when
shortstop Alex Cora turned a grounder up the middle into a Giants
out, the normally stoic Karros pumped his fist in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   If getting Shaw gave them a lift, it should have. Despite the
springtime hope that Antonio Osuna or Scott Radinsky would seize
the closer's role, the eighth and ninth innings remained a snake
pit, the cause of one demoralizing loss after another.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who'll be 32 on Tuesday and blossomed into the NL's top
closer last season, instantly becomes a Dodgers representative in
the All-Star Game. That's a good omen: Los Angeles has sent six
relievers to the All-Star Game _ Phil Regan, Jim Brewer, Mike
Marshall, Steve Howe, Jay Howell and Todd Worrell _ and five of
them also helped the Dodgers to pennants.
</P>
<P>
   That's too much to expect of Shaw this season. But the arrival
of Shaw is only half of the good news for Dodgers fans. The other
half is that Lasorda and the front office, in a single bold move
Saturday, put Pedrophobia behind them. &QL;

DUTCH STUN ARGENTINA, GAIN REDEMPTION

<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ For 20 years, they'd waited for this day.
For 20 years, the Dutch had simmered about a World Cup lost, about
the mind games they thought had been played on them by the hosts in
Buenos Aires, about a 3-1 loss in extra time that was as close as
they'd ever come to fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, as the sun baked the Stade Velodrome in this
ancient port, the Netherlands got even _ and may yet get the
championship they've never won. ``I feel very delighted,'' said
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, after his men had shocked Argentina, 2-1,
on a touchdown pass from Frank de Boer to Dennis Bergkamp in the
90th minute and set up a semifinal showdown with champion Brazil
here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a row that the Dutch had won in the
final moments. On Monday, it was Edgar Davids finishing off the
Yugoslavs in the 93d minute, just when everyone was resigned to
overtime. This time, with both sides playing a man down and
overtime looming again, the Dutch went for broke _ and busted the
Argentines with a master stroke.
</P>
<P>
   After Netherlands defender Arthur Numan was sent off with his
second yellow card in the 77th minute, the Argentines were back in
the position they like best _ playing 11 on 10. They'd scored four
goals on Jamaica that way in the first round, and beaten the
English on penalty kicks after playing a man up for the final 73
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the Dutch had the fatigued Pale Blues back on
their heels for most of the second half, Argentina suddenly had the
upper hand. And for a moment, when defender Jaap Stam hip-checked
Ariel Ortega in the area in the 88th minute, the Pale Blues thought
they might get to win it right there with a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Mexican referee Arturo Brizio Carter yellow-carded
Ortega for taking a dive. When Dutch keeper Edwin Van Der Sar came
out to tell him to get up, Ortega head-butted Van Der Sar under the
jaw and knocked him flat on his back. That got him a red card and
gave the Netherlands a chance to go for the throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in trouble after the sending off of Numan,'' Hiddink
said. ``Then, we are equalized. All of a sudden, we had the
fantastic action of Bergkamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it was de Boer, the Ajax libero and captain, who
launched the long ball that Bergkamp ran down and put away. They'd
stung the Yugoslavs for a goal on a similar fly pattern and figured
they might just catch the Argentines taking a nap before overtime.
</P>
<P>
   So Bergkamp, the Arsenal gunner who'd scored three goals in the
last Cup, took off on the gallop, gathered in the ball, shook off
defender Roberto Ayala (whom England's Michael Owen had left
standing on his mad 50-yard dash) and blasted the ball to the upper
far corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired at the end of the match and I even wanted to
come out,'' said Bergkamp. ``But when Ortega was sent off, I told
myself I could continue for a bit, and that gave me the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands, who were put out in the quarters by the
Brazilians four years ago, had hoped to finish off the Argentines
earlier. The Dutch were working on an extra day's rest and they
knew the Pale Blues had gone 120 black-and-blue minutes with the
English on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dutch went after the Argentines right away and nearly
scored in the sixth minute, when defender Wim Jonk hit the post.
Back they came in the 12th with a lovely combination that evoked
the chronometric precision of the Clockwork Orange days of the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Ron DeBoer began it, cruising up the center of the field and
crossing the ball to Bergkamp on the left. Bergkamp promptly headed
it across the middle to Patrick Kluivert, who split two defenders
and tapped the ball past keeper Carlos Roa from the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly what the Dutch had hoped for, the early goal
that would force the Pale Blues to work harder and earlier than
they wanted to. Instead, they lit a fire under Argentina, which
equalized six minutes later when midfielder Juan Veron threaded a
lovely ball through five orange shirts to striker Claudio Lopez,
who was so much in the clear that he had time to stop and play
cat-'n'-mouse with Van Der Sar before putting the ball through his
legs.
</P>
<P>
   So the Netherlands simply kept calling. Davids fired a rocket in
the 30th minute that Roa barely got a hand and a leg on. Jonk fired
another in the 35th that Roa fisted away. And yet, the Dutch nearly
found themselves behind when Ortega danced in and hit the post in
the 38th.
</P>
<P>
   That was what they had fretted about, that they could have the
Pale Blues backpedaling all day and still get burned by a bit of
magic from Ortega, who wears Diego Maradona's number (10) and
carries his legacy, both for better and worse.
</P>
<P>
   So the Netherlands had banged him around like a punching bag
anytime Ortega came near the ball. Stam got a yellow card for
taking him down. Numan got one for slide-tackling him. Stam leveled
him again. Davids bodychecked him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with two minutes left, Ortega was still bobbing and weaving
and the Dutch were a man down (after Numan's nasty foul on Diego
Simeone) and looking for overtime or beyond. ``We almost _ almost _
dominated the whole game,'' said Hiddink. ``But they can always do
dangerous things with their key players.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, Ortega was gone in disgrace, just as Maradona was in
1982 when he kicked a Brazilian tormentor square in the groin. And
de Boer was putting up the long ball that put the Dutch into the
final four _ and put 1978 and Buenos Aires to rest.

OFFSPRING SURVIVE POLYGAMIST SECT HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)   By KARINA BLAND 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
They were secluded in rural Mexico and forbidden from attending
school by their father, the leader of a polygamist sect who had at
least 13 wives and 57 children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They survived a family legacy of terrorism, robbery, aggra vated
sexual assault, incest and auto and truck theft, as alleged by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Their mothers were mur dered.
</P>
<P>
   And now they are in college, getting nearly perfect grades at
Arizona State University, Mesa Community College and the University
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the youngest children of Ervil LeBaron have shrugged off
their unwanted past and turned to what they can make of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are survivors,'' says 26-year-old Monique LeBaron. ``That
is all we have ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Their achievements are proof of what people are capable of, no
matter what their back ground, says their mentor, Pat McIntyre, a
counselor and teacher at Phoenix College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that they had to go through just to survive has
created not only a love for education _ because they weren't
allowed to have it _ but also a willingness to do whatever it takes
to get an education,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jared LeBaron is a strapping 22-year-old studying finance at
ASU, and a husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer LeBaron, 24, is studying communication at ASU, sure of
a career in public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua LeBaron, 21, is at Mesa Community College, studying engi
neering.
</P>
<P>
   Danny LeBaron, 22, is studying computer science at the
University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And Monique, who is Jared's full sister, also is an ASU student,
studying supply chain management. She is in Maryland on a
prestigious internship, working at a corporation for six months. &QL; 
`A LOT OF SORROW'
</P>
<P>
   As the children of cult leader Ervil LeBaron and his wives, they
endured a legacy of religious vio lence that spanned two decades
and left them orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Their father led the Church of the First Born of the Lamb of
God, a sect whose descendants, authorities believe, are responsible
for the deaths of at least 25 people, includ ing one child, in the
United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The LeBarons have been the fodder for books and a television
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers of these children have been missing and presumed
dead since the kids were young. Jared's mother has been gone since
he was 5, Jennifer's since she was 7. Monique was 9 when her mother
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ervil LeBaron was 56 when he died in 1981 in a Utah prison of a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely was a lot of sorrow in our lives,'' Jennifer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Their history is chilling.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, an FBI bulletin said the LeBarons were wanted
for ``serial murders, cult executions, domestic terrorism, bank
robbery, aggravated sexual assault, incest, auto and truck theft,
transportation of stolen property, weapons viola tions, drug
smuggling and transport ing illegal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   One news magazine compared Ervil LeBaron to Charles Manson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The family moved often, living at one time or another in Salt
Lake City, Denver, San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas and Atlanta. Often,
they split up. &QL; 
KIDS STUCK TOGETHER
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the children of the sect stayed isolated in
rural Mexico, often left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up depending on each other,'' Jennifer says, perched
on a concrete step outside the College of Business at ASU. ``Almost
the only thing we knew was each other.''
</P>
<P>
   All three fondly remember learn ing how to read with the help of
Dr. Seuss books and a 12-year-old sister, who went to sixth grade
before moving to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer studied The Cat in the Hat and followed her sister with
a notebook, begging for homework.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jared and Monique's mother would read to the children and
insist that they read for at least an hour a day _ American
history, Bible stories, biographies. The mother disappeared, but
the books re mained.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators only guess at the total number of slayings because
the bodies of some presumed victims, such as Jared and Monique's
mother, have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the children were placed in Utah foster homes after
being subpoenaed for a grand jury investi gation into the 1987
killing of Daniel Ben Jordon, a Colorado polygamist and former
LeBaron sect member.
</P>
<P>
   The children were warned by their older siblings, Jared says,
not to utter a word. They fled back to Mexico in a car that one of
the teenagers bought for $250.
</P>
<P>
   Jared took care of the younger kids and whatever house they were
living in _ sometimes a simple shack with a roof but no walls.
There are six LeBaron children who are younger than those attending
college in Arizona. They live with their mother in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Monique and Jennifer got jobs teaching English. At just 15,
Jenni fer worked from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The younger children would
greet her with hugs and calls of ``Mommy Jenni fer!'' She worked at
that job until she was 20.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Jared, too, started teaching English, studying each
lesson himself the night before. The job didn't pay much, and some
weeks they ate nothing but tortillas. Other family members came and
went _ some contributing money, some not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the children of the sect studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always pictured myself with a bunch of books under my arm
and on a huge campus,'' says Monique, who taught until she was 22. &QL; 
A HELPING HAND
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Jared came to Arizona. He was put in foster care when a
brother he was staying with was sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   While in foster care, he met McIntyre, who would change not only
his life but also those of some of this brothers and sisters. McIn
tyre works with foster children, helping them apply for grants and
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jared was so thirsty for infor mation, for an education,''
McIntyre says. ``All he needed was for someone to believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jared enrolled at Phoenix Col lege, rode a secondhand bike to
get there and worked part time. He transferred to ASU with honors.
When he turned 18, he rented a room from McIntyre, taking every
thing he owned with him in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McIntyre has helped other LeBaron offspring apply
for grants and scholarships. All, she says, are very bright.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Monique came to Ari zona, also renting a room from
McIntyre. She started classes at Phoenix College a week later.
Jenni fer arrived in December of 1994 and started classes that
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I wanted so badly, I was afraid to believe it
would ever come true,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She, Jared and Monique got an apartment together, leaving the
air-conditioning off even during the hottest weather and eating
tortillas and beans to save money. &UR; Like her brother and sister,
Jennifer got perfect grades and earned a scholar ship. She started
at ASU in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the brothers and sisters I worked with are very serious
about leading a normal life,'' McIntyre says.
</P>
<P>
   Because they did not go to school, saw little television and had
little contact with people other than family, they lack some
everyday knowledge _ for example, Jared didn't know anything about
Plato or Romeo and Juliet.
</P>
<P>
   So, they work extra hard, looking up the things they don't know
and asking a lot of questions. &UR; Monique, Jennifer and Jared all will
graduate in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer has long dark hair and dark eyes. Like her brother, she
is tall, easily 6-foot. He is 6-foot-2. But the similarity ends
there be cause, although they have the same father, they have
different mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Jared has blond hair and light blue-green eyes. Monique, his
full sister, looks like him _ the same color hair and eyes _ though
she says she is short at 5-foot-9.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer and Jared often tell people they are cousins. They talk
little about growing up in the sect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not like anybody to go through what we went through,''
Jennifer says. ``Now, it just seems like it was a different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Monique plans to attend the American Graduate School of Inter
national Management and study business. None of this would have
happened, she says, without people like McIntyre, the government
grants and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Jared, who speaks German and Spanish, wants a master's degree.
He then hopes to start an import-ex port business. His wife is a
student at MCC.
</P>
<P>
   Jared's son is almost 6 months old and, Jared says, will have
the things he never had: a mother and father, toys, enough food to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   And he will go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer also is planning on graduate school. Someday, she hopes
to have a husband and children, though no more than two kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if my husband even thinks about a girlfriend on the
side,'' Jennifer says, laughing, ``he's out.'' &QL;

BURN FALLS TO FIRE, 1-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ That the Dallas Burn went 45 minutes without a major
defensive malfunction last night is a step forward.
</P>
<P>
   It's a glimmer of hope for Dallas (9-9), whose defense was once
the most feared in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Shoring up the other 45 minutes remains a priority after a 1-0
loss to the Chicago Fire (13-5) last night before 12,372 at the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Second-half substitutes Mickey Trotman and Chad Deering gave the
punchless Burn offense pace, spark and direction. But no one could
pull the trigger despite many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Deering was impressive on one day's practice, having
last appeared for the U.S. national team in World Cup '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some chances and didn't put it in,'' Deering said.
``They said they need help scoring goals and knocking it around. We
really didn't play that badly. You can press all night, but you'll
lose if you don't score.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Peter Nowak feasted on the Dallas defense.
Inserting a fourth defender, Tom Soehn, to contain Nowak was to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak missed in the 25th minute on Chicago's first scoring
chance, tapping a ball wide of Burn goalie Mark Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak later gutted the Burn on a 60-yard run and would have
scored if not for a last-second deflection by Jorge Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos ensued further in the Burn backfield as Kosecki centered a
pass to a fallen Nowak. Nowak tapped to Lubos Kubik, who chipped
over Dodd into the top left corner for 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad gave us a spark, but we got tired,'' said Dallas coach
Dave Dir, whose club has lost seven of 10 games. ``That was our
game. It was a big improvement from the game in Chicago (a 4-1
loss). We're not playing our best, but it will get better.''

BRAVES BEAT METS, 4-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One long swing of the bat overshadowed anything else
that happened on the field during the Mets' 4-1 loss to the Atlanta
Braves Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the reeling Mets' sixth in their last eight games
and their second straight at Turner Field, as they dropped a
season-high 11{ games behind the first-place Braves in the National
League East.
</P>
<P>
   But even more ominous was the second-inning swing on which
Atlanta's Gerald Williams fouled off the pitch, and then hit Mets
catcher Mike Piazza behind the left ear on his follow-through.
Piazza, who sustained a contusion behind the ear, walked off the
field looking dazed and continued to feel woozy in the visiting
clubhouse, according to a team spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets sent Piazza, their All-Star catcher, to nearby Piedmont
Hospital for a precautionary round of tests, which revealed a mild
concussion. His status was described as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Without their most dangerous hitter, the Mets (44-38) went
gently against the Atlanta rookie Kevin Millwood (10-4), who became
the Braves' third 10-game winner. Millwood, a right-hander, pitched
eight strong innings of four-hit ball before the sellout crowd of
47,900, which was treated to a Fourth of July fireworks show after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves themselves did not put on much on a display, mounting
a scattershot attack that was helped along by the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii (4-4), who was coming off a sterling seven-inning
outing against the Yankees at Shea Stadium last Sunday night,
frequently had to pitch out of trouble. And some of the messes were
not of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did touch Yoshii for a first-inning run, when Walt
Weiss led off with a double, Keith Lockhart singled and Weiss
scored on a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta scored twice without a hit in the fourth, on three
walks, an error by second baseman Carlos Baerga and a sacrifice
fly. The inning also featured a catcher's interference call on
Piazza's replacement, Todd Pratt, before Yoshii retired Weiss on a
comebacker to leave the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Yoshii had stranded a runner at third in the second
inning and left runners at first and third in the bottom of the
fifth. In the sixth, Yoshii was able to escape another jam. Eddie
Perez opened the inning with a gift double when his bloop to short
right-center field dropped in front of Brian McRae and Butch
Huskey, but failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, meanwhile, allowed just two walks and a fourth-inning
single by Pratt over his first six and two-thirds innings. With two
out and nobody on in the seventh, the Mets mounted their best
threat of the evening. McRae singled past short and then Huskey
doubled off the wall in left center to move McRae to third. Sensing
that this would be his team's best chance to get back in the game,
Manager Bobby Valentine called Rey Ordonez back from the batter's
box and sent in Luis Lopez to pinch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez grounded to short to end the inning. The Braves tacked
on another run in the bottom of the seventh, as Bill Pulsipher
almost, but not quite, bailed Yoshii out of a bases-loaded, no-out
jam. And the Mets headed into their final game before the All-Star
Game break not only hoping to avoid an embarrassing sweep, but also
wondering how long Piazza might be out.

REVOLUTION FINALLY EARN A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 SOC-REVOLUTION-MUTINY-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Michael Vega 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Dust off that double magnum of vintage Dom Perignon.
Pass around those Garcia y Vega cigars. Saturday night it was time
for the New England Revolution to pop the cork on the bubbly, spark
up the stogies, and celebrate their first Major League Soccer
victory after nine straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering Fourth of July evening, which was highlighted by
a fireworks display on the field during the game and off it
afterward, the Revolution earned the right to paint the town red,
white, and blue after scoring a stirring 3-2 victory Saturday night
over the Tampa Bay Mutiny before a crowd of 22,704 at Houlihan's
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, let's just enjoy this one,'' said Revolution coach Thomas
Rongen, who sensed some good vibrations in the air earlier in the
day after his native Holland defeated Argentina and Croatia upset
Germany in World Cup quarterfinals. ``I mean, Holland won, the
Germans are out, and we win on the Fourth of July, what else do we
want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Revo couldn't ask for much more in a victory after it
snapped their nine-game losing streak _ which matched their own MLS
record set a year ago. But it also marked their first road victory
in 18 games versus an Eastern Conference opponent and their first
ever in five games at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the desperately-needed victory gave New England
three precious points for 13 overall and enabled the Revolution
(5-12) to get back in the playoff picture by vaulting from sixth to
fourth place over Tampa Bay (4-14) and Miami (6-11), both of which
have 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely one game we needed,'' said a weary Moore,
who sat in front of his locker suspended in a state somewhere
between exhaustion and euphoria. ``Maybe now we'll go on a
nine-game winning streak.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing to a scoreless stalemate in the first half, Ivan
McKinley scored his first goal of the season in the 53d minute to
give the Revo a 1-0 lead. But it was Raul Diaz-Arce who proved the
Revo's savior when he scored a pair of tie-breaking goals, in the
75th minute on a penalty kick _ which led to the red-card ejection
of Mutiny goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, who flagrantly kicked the ball
at referee Ruben Rodhas after the score _ and in the 84th minute
for the game-winner that answered an empty-net goal by Tampa Bay's
Frankie Hejduk in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I think the goals I had were a victory for the whole
team, not just for me,'' said Diaz-Arce, who supplanted Joe-Max
Moore as the team's single-season scoring leader after scoring his
12th and 13th goals of the season. ``It was more important for us
to win and clear the slate.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting shut out Wednesday night in a 1-0 loss at Kansas
City by a brilliant effort from Wizards goalkeeper Mike Ammann,
McKinley used his 6-foot-1-inch height advantage to soar over his
diminutive opponents and head in a free kick by Moore in the 53d
minute. ``I really couldn't see it,'' said McKinley, who battled
heavy traffic in front of the goal, ``but it felt good to score
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Ramos tallied the equalizer in the 60th minute when he
took a pass from Roy Wegerle, who was back in the Tampa lineup
along with Hejduk after their World Cup sojourn. Ramos fielded
Wegerle's corner kick and blasted a shot from the short corner 20
yards out, which deflected off Revo defender Manny Motajo and
sailed past goalkeeper Jeff Causey. It tied the game, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   After Rodhas hit him with a yellow-card in 65th minute, one of
eight cautions the referee made on the night, Diaz-Arce drew a
reckless foul from Jan Eriksson in the 74th minute as he attempted
to field Moore's pass into the box. Rodhas signaled a penalty shot,
and Diaz-Arce capitalized in the 75th minute by beating Ravelli on
the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Ravelli retaliated when he came charging out of the goal and
kicked the ball at Rodhas, hitting the referee squarely on his leg.
Ravelli wasted little time in reaching for the red card to eject
the Mutiny goalkeeper, who was replaced by backup Doug Petras. ``To
be honest, I don't know what the guy was thinking,'' Moore said of
Ravelli. ``You just don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revo squandered their lead when the Mutiny made a 2-on-1
break on Causey. The Revo goalkeeper committed a critical error
when he strayed too far from the box and failed to stop Alan
Prampin's rush on net. Prampin, as a result, dribbled it to Hedjuk
on the right wing for the easy empty-netter that tied it, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   New England, however, fought back and got a go-ahead goal, 3-2,
when Diaz-Arce converted a pass from Oscar Pareja for a
game-winning shot from the right side that beat Petras on the far
post. Eriksson retreated into the goal and tried to clear it, but
the referee ruled Diaz-Arce's shot had already broken the plane,
which TV replays clearly confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I must have aged about 10 years in that second
half,'' Rongen said, smiling. ``But we just have to savor this one
for a little while.''
