<HEADLINE> Liberian Presidency Calls For Ceasefire In Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's Council of State, the
collective presidency, has called for a ceasefire in the
northwestern town of Tubmanburg, where militiamen have been
fighting the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, a member of the presidency, made the appeal in
Liberia's capital Monrovia Wednesday when he spoke to newsmen
with the presence of two other members of the presidency, Alhaji
Kromah and George Boley.
</P>
<P>
A government-led team would visit Tubmanburg, 60 kilometers
northwest of Monrovia, and other towns in the same county to
ensure that "the whole region remains calm", a report reaching
here today quoted Taylor as saying.
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt Johnson, the leader of the Krahn Wing of the United
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO-K), the
faction involved in the fighting, would also travel to the areas
controlled by ULIMO-K to advise his men not to interfere in the
peace process so that the peace-keepers (deployed there) would
have free movement, Taylor added.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which broke out on December 28 and was still
going on Wednesday morning in Tubmanburg, has left three
peacekeepers dead and several others wounded, and has forced some
3,500 persons to seek refuge in Klay, 20 kilometers south of
Tubmanburg.

<HEADLINE> 3 Prisoners Die in Ustudar Prison Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- At least three prisoners died and
35 people were injured today in a riot at Ustudar Prison in
Umraniye District of Istanbul, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the injured included six soldiers and a prison
warden.
</P>
<P>
The uprising started on December 13 with the inmates, mostly
political prisoners, occupying one of the several cell blocks.
</P>
<P>
The riot later grew after the prison authorities refused to
accept the demands of the prisoners despite earlier promises.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia also said that lawyers for the prisoners said today's
violence erupted when troops called in by the prison authorities
stormed the blocks in which the inmates had barricaded themselves.
</P>
<P>
The three prisoners who died in the ensuing fighting were
identified as Sadik Eroglu, Cengiz Calikoparan and Abdulmecit
Keskin.
</P>
<P>
In previous prison violence last year, three inmates died at
Izmir's Buca Jail, prompting wide-spreading hunger strikes at 23
prisons which lasted 50 days.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-one foreign
prisoners awaiting trial at Johannesburg Medium Prison have begun
a hunger strike to protest against being imprisoned pending their
trial.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of Department of Correctional Services, Koos
Gerber, said in Pretoria today 29 of the prisoners went on hunger
strike yesterday and the rest joined them this morning.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners include 48 Pakistanis, two Somalis and one
Malian.
</P>
<P>
The accused are being held in connection with a trunk call
scam which last year caused South Africa's leading
telecommunication company Telkom losses of 375 million Rand (103
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gerber said that the strikers have demanded refugee status and
are unhappy about being in prison, but they have made no
complaints about their treatment in prison.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the strike has been brought under the
attention of the senior control magistrate as well as the
Pakistani high commissioner in South Africa.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
anti-apartheid veterans, older than 60, will be honoured by
President Nelson Mandela on July 18 this year on the occasion of
his 78 birthday.
</P>

members, according to the ANC veteran.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela entertained 1500 ANC veterans last year on
his birthday in Pretoria.

<P>
"It was a most emotional gathering of veterans last year as
there were people who had not seen one another for 30 to 40
years," said Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
A committee is being formed for the organizational work of
the planned gathering, Sisulu added.

KHARTOUM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Abu Bakr Yunis, head of a
Libyan delegation currently visiting Sudan, said here Wednesday
that his country is mediating between Sudan and Uganda in a bid to
remove the misunderstanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yunis, one of the Libyan leaders, affirmed while meeting with
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Khartoum that Libya is making
efforts to help Sudan and Uganda settle their differences, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The senior Libyan official added that he examined with
President al-Bashir the existing state of tension between Sudan on
the one hand and Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia on the other hand,
as well as the necessity of finding a way out of it.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda signed in April 1995 in the Libyan capital
Tripoli a Libya-mediated agreement intended to settle the
differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda severed its relations with Sudan about two
weeks after the signing of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Yemen's Parliament Calls for Firm Attitude Toward Island Dispute with Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yemeni House of
Representatives has urged the government to adopt a firm attitude
toward the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute, according to a note of
directives approved by the House today.
</P>
<P>
The directives were the outcome of a heated debate on Eritrea's
occupation of the disputed Red Sea island of Greater Hanish.
</P>
<P>
The House note spelled out the necessity of government
commitment to safeguard the sovereignty of the motherland and its
territorial integrity, to defend the country, and to take serious
and appropriate measures to protect Yemeni islands and territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
The House called upon the Yemeni government to regain the
island of Greater Hanish through legitimate ways and means, to
restore the island to its pre-December 15 status, and to form a
committee to investigate the causes and circumstances
of the fall of the island and to take legal measures against those
who are responsible.
</P>
<P>
The House is, however, appreciative of the good office to
resolve the dispute by peaceful means. It stressed the necessity
of fixing a time limit for these efforts so as to avert the policy
of faits accomplis.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea, which face each other across the Bab
el-Mandeb Strait at the mouth of the Red Sea, fought a brief
battle on the disputed island of Greater Hanish on December 16-17,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea took full control of the island after expelling Yemenis
before a cease-fire took effect on December 18. Two other disputed
islands -- Zuqar and Lesser Hanish -- are presently controlled by
Yemen.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is urged
to place this year's budget emphasis on increased production and
reduced duty and tax.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, issued here today by Bank of Zambia and the
Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, also
calls on the government to take measures to encourage savings to
back the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The two institutions have held discussions on the performance
of the economy and resolved that slippages in the budget should
be avoided in future so as to arrest inflation, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The country needs to restore sanity in the banking and
financial sector by using strong legislation while the Banking
Act should be amended to provide more autonomy and powers to the
central bank to stop irregularities and recklessness in the
sector, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Three commercial banks in Zambia closed one after another in
1995.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the government to take necessary measures
to revamp the mining industry and ensure a return to
profitability of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.

<HEADLINE> 130 Peacekeepers Trapped By Liberian Guerillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of the West African
peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) have begun to move into a
conflicting area in western Liberia where 130 fellow soldiers are
being held by a warring faction, said reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Tanks and hundreds of Peacekeepers with heavy arms and RPGs
(rocket propelled grenades) are now marching toward Tubmanburg,"
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG soldiers were trapped while clearing landmines in
an a rich iron ore mining center near Tubmanburg, a northwestern
Liberian town, where two warring factions were vying for the
control of the area.
</P>
<P>
The two warring factions are the breakaway faction of the
United Liberation Movement for Democratic Liberia led by
Roosevelt Johnson (ULIMO-J), and another ULIMO faction under the
leadership of Alhaji Kromah (ULIMO-K).
</P>
<P>
The trapped ECOMOG soldiers were on a mission to maintain the
ceasefire under the peace accord signed by all the warring
factions in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, on August 20, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of the ECOMOG soldiers resulted in the
retreatment of the ULIMO-K forces and a direct battle between
Johnson's ULIMO-J militia and the ECOMOG peacekeepers, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The 130 men are believed to be all Nigerians, who constitute
the backbone of the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces sent to Liberia in
1990 by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The week-long fighting is the most serious breach of the Abuja
Peace Accord which provides for the general elections in August,
1996.
</P>
<P>
"It posed genuine threats to the planned disarmament of 60,000
faction soldiers scheduled to be started from January 15, a
daunting task that must be completed to ensure free and peaceful
elections," a diplomat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a radio broadcast, Johnson ordered his men to stop
fighting. He allegedly agreed to lead a joint mission to be
composed of ECOMOG peacekeepers and United Nations observers to
enforce the ceasefire in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources doubt whether his soldiers have
listened to his call of ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, with its present 8,500 troops in Liberia, complains
about the lack of human and financial resources, saying it needs
a total of 12,000 soldiers to carry out disarmament in the
faction-ridden west African country, which has been torn apart by
six years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Liberia civil war has so far killed about 150,000 people,
most of them civilians, and displaced half the pre-war population
of 2.8 million. The warfare has also wrecked an economy based on
export of rubber, iron ore and diamonds.

CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen killed a
security guard and injured another in southern Egypt today, the
official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted an Interior Ministry source as saying that the two
security guards were attacked while walking near a plantation in
Malawi, Minya, some 260 kilometer south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Two passers-by were also wounded in the attack, after which the
assailants escaped.
</P>
<P>
It was the first killing and the second reported terrorist
attack in the new year.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, three policemen were slightly injured by
unidentified gunmen near the Al-Rodah village in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been witnessing terrorist attacks, especially in the
south, since 1992. Most of these attacks are believed to have been
carried out by Islamic fundamentalist militants who seek to topple
the secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.

LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The art market in Britain
rebounded remarkably in 1995 with encouraging results reported
from all the four leading auction rooms at the end of December,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's, the largest auction house in UK, saw an increase in
turnover of 25 percent in dollar terms in the previous year. Total
annual turnover was 1.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest annual sales since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Christie's, the second largest London house, also saw an
increase of 17 percent in dollar terms than the previous year,
with sales estimated at 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In total, the company's sales have risen 60 percent since 1991,
indicating the steady climb out of the recession which hit the
market that year.
</P>
<P>
There was considerable satisfaction at London's fourth largest
auction house, Bonhams, where sales totalled more than 62 million
US dollars for the first time. That was an increase of 15.5
percent than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
And Phillips, the third largest, also enjoyed a seven per cent
rise in sales, bringing 1995 turnover to more than 151 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Youth's American Dream Barred By US Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan students who applied for
further education in the United States were held back by the
current budget crisis in Washington, a spokesman of the U.S.
Embassy said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who preferred not to be named, said lack of
financial resources resulted in stoppage of the visa services of
the U.S. embassy in Nairobi which "were only operating on an
emergency basis."
</P>
<P>
This would affect hundreds of Kenyan students who, a couple of
weeks ago, would have had no problem in getting U.S. visas, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration and the U.S. House of
Representatives got strangled in the 1996 budget plans, which has
so far not only resulted in a part closure of the government
agencies but also affected its foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Between December 15, 1994, and January 8, 1995, we processed
302 Kenyan student visas so we must assume a similar number
cannot return this year because we simply don't have visas," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the nearly 200 U.S. staff and 600 Kenyan staff
at the embassy in Nairobi were hit by the budget crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It's a major concern for us. It's an inconvenience for
Kenyans and American staff alike that in this two-week pay period
ending today, we have received only half pay," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the problems continue for two more weeks we are told we
will receive nothing," said the spokesman, adding that whenever
the budget was agreed they would be reimbursed for the delayed
pay.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release 1,200 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to release some
1,200 Palestinian prisoners next week in accordance with the
Israel-PLO Oslo 2 accord on expanding Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Israeli Justice Minister David
Liba'i at a meeting at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the
Gaza Strip with Nabil Shaath, who held the portfolio of Planning
in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
PNA ministers resigned late December to prepare for the
scheduled January 20 Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the exact number of the prisoners is still to be
decided. Some prisoners will be sent home while others will
be sent to areas under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Liba'i made it
clear that no Palestinian prisoners who were involved in
fatal attacks against Israelis will be freed,
including five women prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Shaath criticized Israeli for not releasing the  women
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Liba'i explained that Israel's most important concern is not
what the prisoners did in the past, but that their release
would endanger the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Liba'i canceled his meeting with Freih Abu
Medein, who was PNA Justice Minister before the Palestinian
election campaign started.
</P>
<P>
Liba'i canceled the meeting after Abu Medein compared Israel
to Nazi Germany in an interview with Israel Radio this
morning.

BELGRADE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- An Italian soldier was shot and
wounded early today in the Serb-held district of Vogosca to the
north of Sarajevo, reports from Sarajevo said.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old soldier, Elio Bordon, was shot in the arm when
his was on guard duty near his base in Vogosca, a sector to be
handed over to the Muslim-Croat control in line with the peace
agreement. He was sent to the French military hospital in central
Sarajevo immediately.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Colonel John Kirkwood said an investigation was

</P>
<P>
"This could well be hostile fire but we are trying to be

<HEADLINE> SADC To Make Decision On Membership Of Kenya, Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) would soon decide whether to extend membership
to Kenya and Uganda, a SADC spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Kgosinkwe Moesi, the SADC information
officer in Gaborone, capital of Botswana, in his interview with
the Zimbabwean National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in the wake of a statement released last week
by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe who voiced support for a
stronger SADC which would include Kenya and Uganda as opposed to
a bigger Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
"At present this issue is only academic as the two countries
have not applied for the SADC memberships. Should they decide to
do so, the forthcoming SADC summit will tackle the issue," said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
According to the SADC treaty, there must be a unanimous
approval by the organization's summit before the admission of any
new member.
</P>
<P>
This year's SADC annual summit will be held in August in
Maseru, capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Moesi ruled out possibilities of a merger between SADC and
COMESA, saying that member countries should "discard dual
membership" and decide which organization to join.

The President expressed "deep appreciation for the
Commonwealth's principled position on Cyprus as reflected in the
adoption of a number of communiques".
</P>
<P>
For his part, Speaker of the Cyprus House of Representatives
Alexis Galanos said Commonwealth principles "have yet to be
universally implemented".
</P>
<P>
"This failure is quite evident in the case of Cyprus,
which for over two decades is experiencing foreign occupation
of a substantial part of its territory and gross violations of
the most fundamental human rights of its citizens," he said.

<P>
Commonwealth Parliaments, he added, can make "a most
substantial contribution to promoting the Commonwealth principles".
</P>
<P>
During the scheduled six days of deliberation, the conference will deal
with "the Speakers' role," "the relationship between parliament
and the executive", "the parliamentary mechanisms for the
protection of human rights", and "comparison of the presidential
and parliamentary systems."

<HEADLINE> World Bank To Modify Angolan Aid Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today unveiled a
plan to modify its policy toward Angolan so as to fit in with the
country's political and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Katherine Marshall, director of the
Southern African Department of the World Bank, on her arrival in
Luanda today in a five-day visit to the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Marshall said "very slow progress" had been recorded in the
bank's aid and investment programs in Angola.
</P>
<P>
She admitted that the bank's Angolan policy was "not
applicable" in the southern African country despite its goodwill
and the money it poured into the country.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Marshall visited Angola since she
took over the new post of the World Bank in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
She said she would hold talks with Angolan leaders on the
government's economic reforms and the possibilities of a new
World Bank aid package to the country which had been torn apart
by 20 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Angola has so far received 70 million dollars of financial aid
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for its
eight projects since it joined the two financial institutions in
1989.

<HEADLINE> Earth Temperature Reaches Record High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The earth's average surface
temperature reached the highest level last year since records
first were kept in 1856, the New York Times quoted Meteorologists
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature was 58.72 degrees Fahrenheit in 1995,
seven-hundredths of a degree higher than the previous record
established in 1990, said a provisional report issued by the
British Meteorological Office and the University of East Anglia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the data from the NASA (National Aronautics and
Space Administration) Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
York also show the average temperature in 1995 at 59.7 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
The British figures also show the years 1991 through 1995 to be
warmer than any similar five-year period, including that in the
warmest decade of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
This bolsters some scientists' opinion that a century-long
global warming trend is being caused mostly by human activities,
especially by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum
products and wood that release heat-trapping gases.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations panel of scientists said in a recent
prediction that the heat-trapping gas emissions would cause the
average global temperature to rise by a further 1.8 to 6.3 degrees
by 2100.
</P>
<P>
If the predicted warming is materialized, it may cause
worldwide climate disruption, the panel said.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Growth Remains Fragile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing industry
recovered slightly last month, but growth remained fragile and
uneven, according to a survey released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 290 firms by the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply showed that output and employment rose, new
orders fell less sharply and the stockpile of finished goods
shrank.
</P>
<P>
The Purchasing Managers's Index, compiled by the institute on
questions put to purchasing managers, who buy parts and raw
materials for industry, rose to 50.7 from 49.9 in November, above
the key level of 50, the dividing line between expansion and
decline.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that at only 50.7, the index suggested that
overall growth in December was marginal and that the market
buoyancy seen in the first half of 1995 has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The output index rose marginally from 53 to 53.3 in December,
its highest since April last year. However, the institute said
that the fragility of this growth was highlighted by a
deterioration in order books for the second month in a row.
</P>
<P>
City economist Jonathan Loynes said that the latest index
contained "no real signs of hope for manufacturing". He added that
the government would need further to cut interest rates if it was
to have a chance of hitting its 3 percent growth target.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- British insurers are facing a 500
million pounds (775 million US dollars) bill for the water chaos
that was caused by burst pipes flood as Christmas freeze gave way
to dramatic thaw.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of homes throughout UK were flooded and whole
communities were plagued by water shortage on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Businesses across Scotland and the North East were told not to
reopen after the Christmas break because of the water shortage and
many said they would have to cut staff unless supplies were
restored soon, local press says.
</P>
<P>
General Accident in Scotland opened its offices two days early
this week to cope with insurance inquiries, and the Balcombe
Group, a leading loss adjuster, estimated that the bill was a
"conservative 500 million pounds".
</P>
<P>
Water companies were strongly criticized on Wednesday and share
prices fell at the prospect of huge compensation claims.

<HEADLINE> All Detained Civilians Released by Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb authority released
today all 16 people detained last week in the Serb-held Sarajevo
district of Ilidza, reports from Sarajevo said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs first freed three of the 16 people this morning and
then released the rest this afternoon under strong pressure from
the international community.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Captain Frederic Solano told reporters the three
were freed in Lukavica, a Serb sector in Sarajevo, at 10:00 a.m.
with a French official at presence.
</P>
<P>
The 16 people were detained when they were travelling across
the Serb-held Sarajevo sector of Ilidza last week. The Serb
authority said some of the detainees were prisoners of war and
would be put on trial,
</P>
<P>
The abduction has caused a tension between the Bosnian
government and the newly deployed NATO peace implementation force,
IFOR.
</P>
<P>
The government has said the abduction has posted a direct
challenge to NATO's pledge of freedom of movement for all
civilians. But NATO commanders replied that they came to Bosnia
only to implement the peace agreement in terms of military aspects
and not act as police force.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department protested on Thursday the abduction
of civilians and urged the Serbs to release all captured Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission also threatened on Thursday to withhold
part of an aid package to Bosnia as a protest against the
detention of civilians by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim government, meanwhile, has warned its people not to
travel through Serb-held areas until the free movement was
guaranteed by the IFOR troops. It also urged the IFOR to intervene
to press the Serbs to release all the abducted people.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnia peace agreement, civilians are guaranteed the
freedom of movement in the whole country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin left here today for Asmara, Eritrea to continue Ethiopia's
efforts in mediating the dispute between Eritrea and Yemen over
the Hanish islands.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the Ethiopian minister went to Asmara for
the third time since the conflict between Eritrea and Yemen last
December and will meet pertinent Eritrean officials and exchange
views on how to settle the crisis of the Hanish islands.
</P>
<P>
Both sides claim sovereignty over the Hanish island in the Red
Sea, and they fought a battle in mid-December with Eritrean
troops seizing the greater Hanish and taking prisoners of about
200 yemeni soldiers and citizens. Eritrea later set free the
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin flew to Sanaa yesterday on a similar mission. He said
efforts to settle the dispute over the Hanish islands have been
promoted to a promising stage of development after he met Yemeni
President Ali Abdellah Salah in Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali ended his visit to Yemen today and said the United
Nations is ready to help Yemen and Eritrea resolve their conflict
over the Hanish islands peacefully.

<HEADLINE> UUP Leader Doubtful about Political Talks This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the largest Protestant
political party in Northern Ireland David Trimble said that he was
doubtful if all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland
would begin before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Irish Times newspaper, the leader
of Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) maintained that the British and
Irish government's hopes of establishing the political talks on
the future of the troubled province by the end of February were
"unrealistic".
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, the situation was also complicated by the
fact that "the further we get into 1996, the more the shadow of
elections both in Britain and the Irish Republic will loom."
</P>
<P>
Trimble dismissed the possibility for UUP to have direct talks
with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a series of murders everyone knows were
carried out by the IRA, I can see no evidence of a commitment to
peace," he argued.
</P>
<P>
But he was confident that elections to a new assembly or
constitutional convention in Northern Ireland would take place as
early as Spring.

<P>
ATHENS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece said that it welcomed the
European Union's initiative for immediate intervention to attain a
settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Costas Bikas made the announcement
today while commenting on the initiative of Italian Foreign
Minister Susanna Agnelli to send junior foreign affairs minister
Emanuele Scammacca to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey on a fact-finding
mission. Scammacca is due to arrive in Athens on Friday from
Nicosia for talks with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.
</P>
<P>
Italy currently holds the EU presidency for the first half of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman reiterated that the political
settlement of the Cyprus problem is not connected with Cyprus'
progress towards joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
"They are two different things. Cyprus' accession to the EU is
a different matter, which has been settled with the decision of
march 6, 1995 and confirmed by repeated EU summit and Council of
Ministers resolution," Bikas added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, opposing the efforts by the Greek-Cypriot government to
join the Union, rejected the initiative on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Turkish Cypriot North and Greek Cypriot
South after Turkish troops landed on the island to take control of
one third of its territory in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Petrochemical Company Fourth in Production Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, JANUARY 4 (Xinhua) -- The China Petrochemical
Corp. (SINOPEC) is the world's fourth largest producer of primary
processing of crude oil and ethylene, after Shell, Exxon, and
Dupont, SINOPEC Vice-president Yan Sanzhong said here today.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of annual primary processing or production capacity
of crude oil and ethylene, our corporation ranks fourth in the
world," Yan explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the corporation can process 164 million tons of crude
oil each year, or about 86 percent of the country's total, and
2.48 million tons of ethylene, accounting for 78 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to SINOPEC President Sheng Huaren, the total strength
and technological level of SINOPEC has improved markedly since the
company was set up in July 1983, with approval from the Chinese
government in order to centralize management of the country's
important oil refining, petrochemical, chemical fibre, and
fertilizer companies.
</P>
<P>
"SINOPEC's total assets rose to 250 billion yuan (30.1 billion
US dollars) in 1995 from 21 billion yuan (253 million US dollars)
in 1983, or nearly 12 times," Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
"SINOPEC generated a total of 117 billion yuan (14 billion US
dollars) in profit and taxes from 1991 to 1995, 17 percent more
than the projected figure," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's oil refining technology, which was basically developed
by the country itself, is at the level of that of the late 1980s
or the early 1990s in advanced countries, he explained.
</P>
<P>
After importing ethylene processing and ethylene-related
production technology in the 1970s and 1980s, China made progress
in technological innovation in this field and began to export some
technology, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sheng attributed the achievements to the country's policy of
reform and opening to the outside world, concerted efforts in
technological development, and improved management.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 670,000 employees nationwide, including 180,000
technicians and experts, the corporation has over the past 12
years had 3,050 technological achievements and 1,611 patents,
including some which are of the most advanced devices in the
world.

LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
planning a second visit to the Irish Republic, reported the Irish
Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A second visit to Ireland, which may take place in June, would

<HEADLINE> Serbs Release Some Muslim Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serbs released on
Thursday three of at least 12 Muslim civilian detainees and
promised to release the rest soon, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Captain Frederic Solano told reporters that they
were set free in the Serb-held suburb of Lukavica at 10 a.m. (0900
GMT), in the presence of a senior French official with the
NATO-led peace force.
</P>
<P>
Another spokesman, Colonel Richard Pernod, said the Serbs
claimed only nine remained. "They (the Serbs) promised to free
them as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has protested to NATO over the incidents
in which 16 Muslim civilians were detained by Serbs in their
controlled area, despite a guaranteed freedom of movement in the
peace agreement signed in Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
NATO replied that it is in Bosnia to keep the military factions
separated, not to act as a police force, but it has still brought
pressure on the Serbs for their release of the detainees.

<HEADLINE> Central China Becomes China's Major Grain Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
designated provinces in the central part of the country as the
bread basket in a move to add another 50 billion kg of grain in
six years starting last year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Agriculture said today that
China's current strategy to feed the world's largest population is
to increase grain output in east China, tap the production
potential in the west, and concentrate on production in central
provinces.
</P>
<P>
China produced 466 billion kg of grain in 1995, and by the year
2000, the central provinces are expected to produce 216.2 billion
kg of grain, 43 percent of the country's total. About 52 percent
of the planned increase of 50 billion kg of grain will be produced
in these provinces, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the central Chinese provinces are traditional grain
producers. The Dongting Lake Plain, Jianghan Plain, and
Huanghuaihai Plain are important producers of commodity
grain. Local governments in the central provinces have stepped up
efforts to meet the goals set by the state government.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Huang Jiaxi, party secretary of
Yueyang City in central China's Hunan Province, said the city had
set aside more than 30 million yuan in funds to build a number of
grain production bases.
</P>
<P>
While making new grain production efforts, the city has
invested a large amount of money in infrastructure for
agricultural production. The city has spent 250 million yuan in
harnessing Dongting Lake, China's second largest lake, where 900
km of dykes have been built. The city plans to set aside another
700 million yuan to build water conservation projects in and
around the lake, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Jingmen City is another important grain producer in Hubei
Province. Yao Dafu, who contracted to work more than one hectare
of farmland near the city, earned 20,000 yuan from grain
growing. "Growing grain is profitable because I am experienced and
the government has supported me by providing fertilizer,
pesticides and technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yao is not the only farmer in Hubei who is enthusiastic about
grain production. A survey by the Hubei Provincial Statistics
Bureau has shown that farmers in the province spent an average of
71 yuan on grain production in the first quarter of 1995 alone, a
sharp increase over that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology extension is the key for increasing
grain production," said Deng Daokun, head of the agriculture
department in Hubei.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that better seeds have been popularized in 95 percent
of the farming households in Hubei. Hybrid rice production has
grown by more than 1.4 million hectares, he explained
</P>
<P>
With a number of grain production measures having been
developed by local governments, an official from the Ministry of
Agriculture said, the central government will also increase
investment in grain production in the central Chinese
provinces. To add 50 billion kg of grain by the turn of the
century, he said, another 160 billion yuan has to be spent in
China.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Seeks Trade Balance Through Export Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
formed an export promotion committee to help remove the imbalances
in the country's foreign trade and promote export, the official
news agency RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Commerce Minister Fatteh Singh Tharu,
comprises of government officials and those from private business
and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a two-day national seminar on trade balance through
export promotion began here today aiming at working out
far-reaching policies for achieving trade balance by improving
export performance.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the seminar, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba urged the private sector to show interest in agricultural
production and exportation so as to help the nation reduce its
trade imbalance and be self-sufficient in agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's total foreign trade volume was around 1.54 billion US
dollars during the 1994-95 fiscal year ending last July, with the
trade deficit at 866 million dollars, according to the government
estimates.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country's imports increased by 25
percent while exports declined 7.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Endorses New State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said today that the country's 1996-97 draft state budget is
envisaged to be balanced at the level of 90.6 trillion rupiah
(39.39 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a government statement on the budget which is presented to
the parliament, the president said that the 1996-97 state budget
will increase by 16.1 percent compared with the 1995-96 budget.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that Indonesia must be on the alert for various
global economic upheavals that may emerge at any time this year.
</P>
<P>
Being aware that the competition between nations will also
become fiercer, Indonesia's economy will become more integrated
into the global economy with the improvement of economic
cooperation in various regions, such as ASEAN and APEC.
</P>
<P>
The country's fiscal year starts on April 1 and ends on March
31 next year. In the 1995-96 fiscal year, the Indonesian
government revised the growth target in the sixth five-year
development plan (1994-1999), from an annual average of 6.2
percent to 7.1 percent. Economic growth in 1995 is estimated to be
7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The high growth rate was mainly attributed to the growth of
industry and agriculture, particularly in the non-oil/gas sector
and the tremendous surge of approved investments, which will serve
as the basis for the economic growth in the years to come, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of the capital market in 1995 has also been
heartening which shows the trust of investors in Indonesia's
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Soeharto pointed out that "the challenge to
Indonesia's economic stability today is an overheating economy."
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the overheating economy, he said, it is
necessary to take a series of effective measures to cool the
economy down with an aim at limiting the liquidity expansion in
the economy and banking credit.
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed disappointment that for three
consecutive years, inflation rate has been far above 5 percent and
the rate in 1995 was 8.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also called on all relevant departments, institutes
and people to exercise greater control over inflation this year.
The government has initiated to launch synchronized and harmonized
policies in the fiscal and monetary sectors.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the growing current account deficit which
was caused by the increase in import which was much higher than
that of export, the president said. The current account deficit
in 1995 reached 7.9 billion US dollars as compared with only 2.9
billion US dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the current account deficit, he said, the
government will boost the non-oil/gas export and reduce the growth
rate of import.
</P>
<P>
To improve the balance of payments, the borrowing of foreign
commercial and export credit must be limited and well-coordinated,
the president added.

<HEADLINE> China Sets New Targets for Nuclear Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to bring its
nuclear power capacity to 20 million kw by 2010 and plans to
develop it mainly along its southeast coast from 1996-2000, said
Jiang Xinxiong, president of the China National Nuclear
Corporation (CNNC), here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was speaking to a national telephone conference on work
of the nuclear industry and for setting new targets for the
industry for 1996 and the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Projects will include the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant's second
phase, the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant, and the Liaoning Nuclear
Power Plant in the northeast during the Ninth Five-Year Plan,
starting this year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the power plants' generating units, with a
combined capacity of 6.6 million kw, is expected to be completed
between 2001 and 2003, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China's nuclear industry has grown
steadily, with its output value growing at an annual rate of 20
percent. By the end of 1995, output value was three times 1990's
figure.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also pushed for mechanization of the nuclear fuel
industry in order to keep up with construction of nuclear power
plants, the introduction of new technology, and the
diversification of nuclear industry production.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the development of nuclear products for
non-military purposes so that by the year 2000 their value will
double that of 1995's figure.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called also for the expansion of foreign trade, research
in key technology, and reform of CNNC's operation and management
system.
</P>
<P>
This year, China will place emphasis on the safe operation of
the three generating units at Qinshan and Daya Bay, and on the
construction of nine generating sets at Qinshan, Ling'ao,
Liaoning, and at Pakistan's Chashama power station.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Qinshan generated 2.2 billion kwh of electricity,
while the No.1 and No.2 units of Daya Bay generated 10 billion
kwh, exceeding the state-set quota, according to statistics
released by CNNC.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of products for civilian use in nuclear industry
production rose 80 percent in 1994 from 5 percent in 1980. Last
year, sales of civilian products hit 350 million yuan (about 42
million US dollars), statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Market Economy Changing Urbanites' Minds, But Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of
Chinese urbanites agree that the market economy is vital to
China's modernization drive, but they say that people need to
improve their cultural quality to come up to the standards of a
modern society, according to the results of a national poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll of some 15,000 urban residents showed that people have
gotten somewhat accustomed to the changes taking place during the
transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented one over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Although people still regard job loss and pressure from
competition both at work and in daily life as most unbearable
thing, their response to sudden social changes, such as the
growing income gap, rising prices, and necessity of making
sacrifices, is less fragile than before, according to Guangzhou's
Chinese Culture Promotion Society, organizer of the poll.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what is vital to China's future development,
most of those polled listed the following: a complete legal
system, well-educated citizens, equal rights, and family-planning
policy, as well as political democracy, better use of time, and
increased efficiency, although 75 percent said that they still
would hesitate to appeal to the law if their rights and interests
are infringed.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the organizers of the poll, sociologist
Jing Huaibin, the quality of urbanites, who now number around 450
million or one third of the nation's population, can have an
impact on the country's market-oriented economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese government's move towards a socialist market
economy as its new economic model in 1992, the Chinese people,
especially those in cities, have shown great enthusiasm for it,
and some ideas, such as open competition and pay based on work,
have been widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
"But, they are still not fully or well prepared for the many
changes that have taken place in society," said Jing, explaining
that some backward and traditional views still obstruct market
economy development.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a long and gradual process for the Chinese people
to really accept some new ideas," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Sales Slip to Third Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- European aircraft consortium
Airbus Industrie slipped to the third place in terms of the number
of aircraft sold last year but ranked second in terms of sales
value, British newspaper The European reported today.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that two American aircraft makers,
Boeing and Mcdonnell Douglas, sold 261 and 114 aircraft
respectively last year, while Airbus secured orders for 106
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But in terms of value, Airbus was placed second with sales
reaching 7 billion U.S. dollars, while sales of Boeing and
Mcdonnell Douglas were 18 billion and 4.5 billion dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Airbus outsold the two American companies in civil
aircrafts with sales of 125 jets, compared with Boeing's sales of
120 and Douglas sales of 15.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus' sharp loss of market is partly due to the
competition from Boeing's new twin-jet 777 and the best-selling
737, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, the European consortium ended the year
with a flurry of potential business of 39 aircraft, including a
recent announcement by Philippine Airlines of its intention to
order a fleet of 24 Airbus aircraft, the report said.

One month ago, Schori summoned the U.S. Ambassador to
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and handed over a letter to the
U.S. Department of State.
</P>
<P>
Schori expressed in this letter his deep concern over the
financial crisis in which the international aid system had ended
up.
</P>
<P>
The minister was particularly upset over the U.S. declaration
that it would not make any contributions towards the International
Development Association, World Bank's soft-loan organization.
</P>
<P>
Schori is expected to raise the question during his visit to
the U.S. in February.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest SEZ To Rise As Paradise for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's largest special
economic zone (SEZ), is expected to attract nearly ten billion US
dollars in investment in the upcoming five years as the island
province vows to build up its characteristic industries instead of
real estate and preferential policies which put the island to the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
According to Ruan Chongwu, provincial governor, the island
started to readjust from bubble economy to developing industrial
structure by making use of its resources such as tropical
agriculture, modern industries, tropical tourism.
</P>
<P>
As the only Chinese province with tropical agricultural
resources and marine resources, the province has been proved to be
potential in tropical crops, marine fishery and winter vegetables
and fruits. Over the past five years, its agriculture has jumped
in double digit rate and such momentum is expected to remain in
the last five years of this century.
</P>
<P>
With a vast market in the rest parts of China, the province has
designated petrochemical industry, auto production, soft drinks,
chemical fibre, pharmacy, paper-making and building materials as
the backbone industries. Annual industrial output value is
expected to grow by 28 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major tourist attractions, Hainan has accelerated
its sales promotion in China and the rest of the world in order to
attract 6.5 million tourists with 150 million US dollars in
tourism income by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial official, the province's gross
national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 15 percent
annually. To meet the target, the province is going to increase
its fixed assets investment from 71.2 billion yuan in the past
five years to over 100 billion yuan in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The official said major foreign investment fields in the
province will concentrate on new industries, basic industries,
agriculture and tourism. Seven of the 13 major projects with a
total investment of 1.6 billion US dollars and 6.7 billion yuan
started last year are industrial projects. Another 30 projects
with a total investment of 13 billion US dollars are being
prepared, ranging from oil refining, auto production, chemical
industry, building materials, the construction of airports,
harbors and highways.
</P>
<P>
From January to November last year, the province attracted 870
million US dollars in direct foreign investment, an increase of 13
percent over the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province will announce more foreign-funded
projects with an estimated investment of six billion US dollars,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Hainan will make optimal use of the existing preferential
policies in tax, legislation, visa issued upon arrivals and
improve our economic structure to make them a comprehensive
advantage," said Ruan Chongwu, provincial governor, in a special
interview with Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: H-share Gains As High Hope Pinned On State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index jumped 84 points today to close at 882, after picking up 39
points in the previous trading.
</P>
<P>
The Index, which tracks the overall performance of China's 17
state enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange -- known
as H-share, has come through five consecutive days of rise that
amounted to 148 points.
</P>
<P>
After gaining a five-percent increase yesterday, the
enterprises index went up by 10.5 percent in today's transaction.
Prices of H-shares are expected to rally since traders anticipated
that the tightening economic policy in China will be gradually
eased in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
What is encouraging, traders said, is that the Hang Seng Index
-- the key indicator of Hong Kong's stock market, gained momentum
in the first three trading days of 1996, rocketing by 500 points
to close at 10,574. Total turnover today rose sharply to 8.769
billion HK dollars, the biggest since last May.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the security circles said that, the bullish
kick-off is likely to push up the H-share index, which fell to
the bottom of 684 points in the middle of last November.
</P>
<P>
In today's trading, prices of all 17 H-shares rose except the
Dongfang Electronics. Qingling Motors took the lead by increasing
by 0.45 HK dollars per share, followed by Luoyang Glass which grew
0.25 HK dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The China Enterprises Index, introduced in August 1994, is
devised by Hang Seng Index Services Limited, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is committed to
developing a modern, independent and internationally accepted
framework to protect intellectual property rights in Hong Kong, a
senior Hong Kong government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his visit to the Intellectual Property Department and the
Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said that the enforcement of intellectual property
rights in the territory would help Hong Kong promote trade,
investment and technological innovation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He said the Intellectual Property Department is working on new
localized legislation for the protection of intellectual property
rights involving patents, copyrights and registered designs.
</P>
<P>
On enforcement, he said, the Customs and Excise Department was
determined to combat property piracy and therefore emphasis would
be placed on tackling the problem at the importation and
distribution levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that adequate resources would be allocated to the
Customs in the next financial year to further strengthen its
capability in enforcement and prosecution, intelligence gathering,
border surveillance and interceptions, and liaison with the
Chinese Customs.
</P>
<P>
He said that intelligence gathering and investigation work
relating to organized syndicates in piracy activities in Hong Kong
would be stepped up.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's New Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's newly-formed cabinet was
sworn in today and is expected to take measures to quicken the
pace of the country's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, named late Wednesday by new Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri, held their first meeting chaired by President Hosni
Mubarak immediately after the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy was not present
because he was attending a meeting of Arab interior ministers in
Tunis.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri's cabinet includes seven new ministers.
</P>
<P>
Just as another sign that the new cabinet will aim to speed up
the economic development, the ministers of economy, finance and
industry were replaced.
</P>
<P>
Mohi Eddin al Gharib replaced Mohammed Ahmed el-Razaz to head
the Finance Ministry, Nawal al-Tatawi became minister of economy,
foreign trade and international cooperation and Suleiman Reda took
the post of minister of industry and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Zafer el-Beshri was appointed minister of state for planning,
Talaat Hammad replaced Ahmed Gomaa to take his new post as
minister of cabinet affairs, and Hamdi Zaqzouq became new minister
of religious endowment.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry and the Ministry of Population and Family
were merged into one new ministry -- Ministry of Health and
Population, which is headed by Ismail Sallam.
</P>
<P>
With the Ministry of International Cooperation merged
with the Ministry of Economy, Former Minister of State for
International Cooperation Youssef Boutros Ghali was appointed
minister of state for cabinet affairs dealing with economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The most powerful ministers -- defense, interior and foreign
affairs -- remain in place.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri was assigned by Mubarak Tuesday evening to choose the
new cabinet after the cabinet of Prime Minister Atef Sedki
resigned earlier in the day. Ganzouri is also planning minister
in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, 63, served as deputy prime minister and planning
minister in Sedki's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle is believed to be aimed at accelerating the
pace of the faltering economic reform and reshaping the image of
the government, which has been tarnished by opposition accusations of
widespread vote rigging in the parliamentary elections on November
29 and December 6.

<HEADLINE> Japan-U.S. Security Guidelines to Be Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Defense Agency plans
to revise the guidelines for security cooperation with the United
States so as to cover a wider range of joint security activities,
Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The planned revision will be in line with Japan's new National
Defense Program Outlines approved by the government in November
last year.
</P>
<P>
The revision, the first in 18 years, will be drawn up by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines will set the basis for joint action in the
event of natural disasters and in international conflicts in areas
around Japan, the Japanese government sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan has already started talks with the United States over the
changes, hoping to strengthen the bilateral security ties.
</P>
<P>
Also to be spelled out in the new defense policy manifest will
be possible Japanese-U.S. cooperation in the United Nations
peacekeeping operations, the news service said.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the guidelines, which prescribes joint action in
the event Japan is attacked, will remain intact, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Any proposals for joint action with the United States in the
event of conflicts in the area around Japan, however, is likely to
stir controversy over its constitutionality, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's war-renouncing constitution prohibits the use of the
right to collective self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a Defense Agency official said a variety of cases
for such conflicts will be considered, the news service
added.

<HEADLINE> India's Karnataka Agrees to Release Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Karnataka state of India would
begin to release six thousand million cubic (tmc) feet of water to
neighboring Tamil Nadu from this evening, Karnataka Chief Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda announced.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Bangalore, capital of
Karnataka, Gowda parried questions on whether the state government
had finalized any schedule for water release and about the quantum
it would release every day.
</P>
<P>
He said only that six tmc feet of water would flow into Tamil
Nadu from the reservoirs in the Cauvery Basin.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister strongly defended the decision to release
the water, which was made yesterday in deference to a directive
from Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was made with a view to maintaining the
cordial relationship with Tamil Nadu and creating a conducive
atmosphere in order to find a negotiated settlement to the
century-long vexatious dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two states have recently been locked in the dispute over
the Cauvery waters issue. Tamil Nadu asked Karnataka to release
11 tmc feet of Cauvery water to save standing crops in the state,
but the latter rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
In his latest efforts to resolve the dispute, Prime Minister
Rao urged Karnataka to release six tmc feet of water to Tamil Nadu
immediately while accepting a Karnataka proposal to send a
three-member team of experts to investigate the situation in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks out in Somali Town, Killing 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Clan fighting broke out in the
southwestern Somali town of Baidoa, resulting in at least 12
people killed, a report from Mogadishu quoted both sides as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
Dozens were wounded in the fighting in Baidoa on Wednesday,
the worst violence in two months, as faction leader Mohamed Farah
Aideed's forces were attacked by the Rahanweyn Resistance Army
(rra) which was forced out of the town in September.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a spokesman for Aideed as saying at least 12
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
However, the rra claimed 28 people were killed and more than
40 wounded when rra gunmen clashed with aideed's forces for four
hours with heavy machineguns, mortar bombs, anti-tank rockets,
mines and rifles.
</P>
<P>
Aideed and 600 men backed by 60 battlewagons thrust out of the
capital Mogadishu in September and seized Baidoa until then a
showpiece for continued aid agency work in Somalia despite the
withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers last March.
</P>
<P>
Aideed was elected president of Somalia last June by his
followers but no country in the world has recognized his
government so far.
</P>
<P>
The former general said the attack on Baidoa was aimed at
spreading his authority around Somalia. Baidoa was known as the
"city of death" when it was at the center of Somalia's 1992
famine.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no internationally recognized government since
the fall of late president Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economy Minister Ready to Sack "Saboteurs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Economic Minister Evegeny
Yasin said today that he is ready to sack those in his ministry
who have ignored an investment instruction from the president and
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said President Boris Yeltsin was angry that the
ministry had overlooked his instruction to increase the production
of new farming machines at a plant in the Siberian city of
Krasnoyarsk and to include the plant into the 1995 investment
program.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin visited that plant in the summer of 1994, but in the
December 1995 parliamentary elections the electrorate in
Krasnoyarsk voted overwhelmingly for communists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
Before the New Year's Day, Yeltsin strongly criticized the
ministry for failing to implement last year's investment plans,
and gave Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin two days to "submit
proposals on strengthening the leadership of the Economy Ministry
and on dismissing saboteurs."
</P>
<P>
During an interval of a government meeting, Yasin told
reporters, "The Economy Ministry has prepared an answer to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, as well as a number of organizational
measures in the ministry regarding those responsible for the
non-fulfilment of the presidential instruction on the 1995
investment program."
</P>
<P>
The minister did not elaborate on who may be fired or whether
he himself will be a target. However, his concept of
"organizational measures" means reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> Two Major National Surveys For 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China is planning on conducting
two important surveys during 1996, the State Statistics Bureau
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
One of the surveys is a national industrial study, the third of
its kind since the founding of new China, already at the
registration and data collection stage. It deals with more than 10
million industrial enterprises and production units nationwide,
inquiring about their staff, financial conditions, property,
production, marketing, and technological development.
</P>
<P>
The survey used different indices for different
enterprises. More than 5,000 types of industrial products and
3,000 types of equipment are listed for study.
</P>
<P>
The other survey, on the number of basic units nationwide, is
the first of its kind in China, and is to be done on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Targets of the survey include agricultural, manufacturing,
construction, transportation, restaurant, wholesale, and retail
businesses, government departments, and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the surveys will be greatly helpful to the
making of social and economic development plans and industrial
policies, and to improving national economic management.

<HEADLINE> China Gets Better Results in Onshore Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China's oilfields produced a
record 140 million tons of crude in 1995, some 880,000 tons more
than the previous year, according to the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
Gas production topped 16 billion cu m the same year, also a
sharp rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The country made 52 important discoveries, including 22 large
oil and gas fields. In 1995, China verified a total of 590 million
tons of geological oil reserves and 77.6 billion cu m of gas.
</P>
<P>
The aging oil fields in the eastern part of China produced an
additional 565,000 tons of crude last year by developing 391 oil
wells.
</P>
<P>
In the western part of the country, a group of 10 oil fields in
the three great basins of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
were developed, producing a total of 16.89 million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
Transportation conditions in west China have greatly
improved. Oil fields in the west transported a total of 5.8
million tons of oil to the eastern part of the country in 1995,
representing an increase of 1.91 million tons over 1994's figure.
</P>
<P>
CNPC officials say that China's onshore oil sector achieved
much better economic returns in 1995, with crude sales volume and
profit hitting 127.14 billion yuan and 8.54 billion yuan,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Warlord Urges To Maintain Ceasefire In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, Jan 4 (Xinhua) -- A factional leader today ordered
his soldiers to stop fighting in northwestern Liberia and to
surrender arms to the West African peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
General Roosevelt Johnson, leader of the ULIMO-J which is a
breakaway faction of the United Liberation Movement for
Democratic Liberia, delivered the order in a Monrovia radio
broadcast monitored here this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I order you to lay down your arms," Johnson told his men in
the radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Johnson's forces and soldiers of the ULIMO-K
which is another ULIMO faction led by Alhaji Kromah, has been
lasting for the last seven days.
</P>
<P>
West African peacepeeping forces (ECOMOG) were immediately
sent to the area last week to stop the fighting.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is too early to know whether General Johnson's
call has been heeded by his men," said a journalist from Monrovia
in a telephone interview today.
</P>
<P>
He added that sporadic fighting was still going on this morning
at Tubmanburg and Claye, two towns in northwestern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 innocent civilians as well as fighters of the warring
factions have been killed so far during the clash, according to
diplomats closely watching the developments.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting, which is the most serious armed clash between
the warring factions since the signing of the Abuja Peace Accord
last August, posed a genuine threat to the four-month old peace
process," said one diplomat.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, 1995, all the major warring factions in Liberia
signed a peace accord in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
And an interim coalition government was established a week
later to prepare for the next general elections scheduled to be
held on August 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Monrovia radio report, ECOMOG peacekeepers
were now searching for some ULIMO-J fighters who had ambushed a
convoy of peacekeeping soldiers and robbed 2,000 rounds of
rocket-propelled grenades at a village near the Tubmanburg
Highway.
</P>
<P>
The radio also said that a roaming band of ULIMO-J fighters
"bayoneted to death" more than 90 patients at the Tubmanburg
Hospital "who were suspected of being ECOMOG sympathisers".
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 liberians and 550 Sierra Leoneans were
"trapped" in Tubmanburg and Claye, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
There has been claims and counterclaims as to how the fighting
erupted.
</P>
<P>
ULIMO-J radio accused ECOMOG of arresting its civilian
supporters and killing them, and of "providing arms to ULIMO-K to
destroy ULIMO-J", a claim which ECOMOG dismissed as "silly" in a
statement released in Monrovia today.
</P>
<P>
"We were fired on by ULIMO-J soldiers as we proceeded in the
interior to effect the disarmament," said the ECOMOG statement.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen "Aid the Poor" Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Foundation for
Underdeveloped Regions (CFUR) today launched a large-scale
campaign that calls for people to help people in poor areas in
every way possible.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony here today, Wei Yumin, vice-chairman of CFUR,
said that supplementing government efforts by using the public's
strength to aid the poor is an effective way to help the poor
escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the foundation launched a similar campaign and got
the full support of many parts of society. More than 10 million
yuan has been donated to the foundation, in addition to many
contributions such as medical equipment, agricultural equipment,
and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Wei explained that these donations are being used in poor areas
for constructing road, bridges, schools, medical centers, and
other aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
China has 70 million people living below the poverty line, most
of whom are in the economically-backward middle and western parts
of the country.

LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian researchers at the
University of Florence recently discovered that myrrh, a plant
common in northeast tropical Africa, has pain-killing properties.
</P>
<P>
The science journal Nature today quoted Professor Piero Dolara,
head of the research team, as saying that in laboratory tests,
mice given myrrh stayed longer on a hot metal plate than those not
given myrrh.
</P>
<P>
The pain-killing effects of myrrh is similar to that of
morphine, Dolara said, warning that it may also be addictive.
</P>
<P>
Myrrh has been used to make perfume, embalm bodies and treat
certain diseases since ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover Antiatom, Proving Antiworld's Existence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- An antiatom has been discovered
by scientists working in Geneva, proving the existence of an
antiworld, said today's issue of New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
Working at the CERN atom smasher in Geneva, physicists from
Germany, Italy and Switzerland got an antihydrogen from the
antimatter equivalent of a proton and an electron -- an antiproton
and a positron.
</P>
<P>
"It's really the proof that there is an antiworld," said Walter
Oelert, spokesman for the team. The team will report its findings
in the journal Physics Letters B.
</P>
<P>
High speed antihydrogen was made indirectly when an antiproton
collided with the nuclear of normal atoms. During the process,
positrons were created and a few clung to the antiprotons to make
antihydrogen.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely rare event -- they only have a handful of
antiatoms and they don't last for long," said Michael Charlton, an
antimatter expert at University College London.

HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Commander of the UN
peace-keeping mission in Angola Major-General Phillip Sibanda
said that his mission was making progress but slowly.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda, a Zimbabwean Major-General, told local reporters in
Harare yesterday that the Angolan government and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) still harbored
suspicions against each other.
</P>
<P>
''You must understand that they (the government and UNITA)
have been at war with each other for about 20 years. You cannot
expect them to be friends overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the UN mission had encountered problems,
these were minor. They included ceasefire violations by both
parties but that was expected from long time enemies.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda returns to Angola today. He is commanding 7,000
men from India, Uruguay, Romania, Brazil, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He yesterday called on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
Chairman of the OAU ad hoc Committee on Angola to brief him on

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Issue 10,000-tugrik Bank note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's State Great Hural
(parliament) today passed a resolution authorizing the issue of a
bank note with a denomination of 10,000-tugrik (about 21.3
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The issue, proposed by the Bank of Mongolia, is designed to
rationalize the country's currency structure by replacing
small-denominated bank notes.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mongolia believes such a move will reduce the time
spent on currency checking and counting and minimize the cost of
transportation and safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Bank notes with denominations of 100, 500, 1,000 and 5,000
tugriks presently account for 69.2 percent of the total currency
in circulation, with the rest being notes with a face value less
than 100 tugriks.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Conducts Social Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Tolerance and being
open-minded towards Chinese traditions and foreign culture are the
dominant viewpoints among urban Chinese according to a recent
Guangdong survey.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted using 10,000 urbanites by the Guangdong
Association for the Promotion of the Chinese Nation and showed
that Chinese tend to be traditional when judging virtue, and the
thing they most value is trustworthyness, honesty, diligence,
responsibleness, politeness, and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
The elder generation, according to the survey, are more likely
to look for frugality and responsibility towards work and the
society, while younger people tend to emphasize humaneness,
passion, and privacy.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that money, ease and comfort rank eighth and
ninth, while good health, personal qualities, national interest,
and a happy family are more important than material benefits. The
result, experts point out, is that seeking material gain is not as
important as was imagined.
</P>
<P>
Respondents were asked about 30 types of behavior, and the
answers showed that killing someone in self defense, euthanasia,
remaining single, abortion, and divorce were most likely to be
tolerated, while least tolerated were drug use, prostitution,
corruption, lack of filial piety, homosexuality, and sexual
permissiveness.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that most Chinese are conservative
sexually. About 89 percent said that they cannot tolerate sexual
freedom, 88 percent said that they cannot tolerate homosexuality,
while 90 percent expressed an objection to "sexual relations among
teenagers".
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that Chinese, who used to value stable
families most of all, are not so strict about extramarital affairs
since 23 percent of the respondents expressed tolerance or didn't
have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
In terms of family relations, 70 percent objected to
subordinate relations, demonstrating a marked improvement in
women's status.
</P>
<P>
The younger and more educated the person, the easier he will
accept western values. The group of respondents, the survey
showed, do not adhere so strictly to traditions of social
responsibility and sacrifice and are more inclined to believe in
passion, democracy and equality among different members of a
family.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: H-share Gains As High Hope Pinned On State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index jumped 84 points today to close at 882, after picking up 39
points in the previous trading.
</P>
<P>
The Index, which tracks the overall performance of China's 17
state enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange -- known
as H-share, has come through five consecutive days of rise that
amounted to 148 points.
</P>
<P>
After gaining a five-percent increase yesterday, the
enterprises index went up by 10.5 percent in today's transaction.
Prices of H-shares are expected to rally since traders anticipated
that the tightening economic policy in China will be gradually
eased in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
What is encouraging, traders said, is that the Hang Seng Index
-- the key indicator of Hong Kong's stock market, gained momentum
in the first three trading days of 1996, rocketing by 500 points
to close at 10,574. Total turnover today rose sharply to 8.769
billion HK dollars, the biggest since last May.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the security circles said that, the bullish
kick-off is likely to push up the H-share index, which fell to
the bottom of 684 points in the middle of last November.
</P>
<P>
In today's trading, prices of all 17 H-shares rose except the
Dongfang Electronics. Qingling Motors took the lead by increasing
by 0.45 HK dollars per share, followed by Luoyang Glass which grew
0.25 HK dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The China Enterprises Index , introduced in August 1994, is
devised by Hang Seng Index Services Limited, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian veterinary
department said today that the foot-and-mouth disease had again
hit Terenggaunu, a northeastern state of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
State Veterinary Service Director Ibrahim Embong told the press
today that cases of the disease were detected in some areas of the
state. The disease was said to be brought under control last year.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have not been able to determine the source of the
infection in the affected areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysian news agency, the disease was spreading
fast, infecting 60 cattle so far. And all the infected cattle have
been separated.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said although the situation was under control, the
department viewed the matter seriously as most of the cattle in
the affected areas had not been vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that the disease will spread to the whole state if the
breeders and slaughterers do not take the matter seriously,"
Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
In the previous break-out of the disease in the same state late
last year, about 1,000 cattle in Besut and Setiu were infected.

<TEXT>
<P>
People in the Muus Desert, which covers 18,000 sq km in
northern Shaanxi's Yulin Prefecture, finally won their protracted
battle against desertification.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982 some 573,000 ha and later 273,000 ha of shifting
sands have been brought under control, with 115,000 ha of this
area becoming irrigated fields, according to Huang Wenxuan, the
prefecture's deputy Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
In Yulin City, known for its efficient reclamation of desert
areas, per-capita grain output has surpassed 1,000 kg in a number
of towns, townships and villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
A network of shelter-belts has been formed in the area,
including four million trees.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of orchards, mainly of apples and grapes, in desert
areas has reached 13,000 ha, producing 50 million kg of fruit a
year and bringing in 25 million yuan a year in income.
</P>
<P>
The desert area has become one of the richest areas in the
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sheep-raising has become a pillar industry in
Shaanbei in recent years, as loss of vegetation has been halted by
planting trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Following the development of 700,000 ha of new grassland in
Yulin Prefecture, the population of cattle and horses has grown to
400,000 from 80,000 in the 1960s, and the number of sheep from
380,000 to 1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
In Yan'an Prefecture the number of sheep has risen from 630,000
in 1985 to the present two million, with annual wool output
topping 1,075 tons.
</P>
<P>
"A sheep can be sold for at least 300 yuan," said Cao Jiuwang,
a herdsman in Yulin Prefecture. "My three-member family can earn
nearly 30,000 yuan a year from sheep-herding."
</P>
<P>
Like Cao, many herdsmen have got rich through sheep-raising in
recent years, said Zhou Wanlong, mayor of Yan'an City. Some
families own more than 300 head of sheep each, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, over 40 wool-processing firms have been built in
Yulin, which are bringing in more and more profits for local
residents.

KAMPALA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The oldest shrine of Buganda
Kingdom in Uganda was on Tuesday set ablaze again by unknown
people, the second time that fire has gutted it within three
months, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
On October 12 last year, fire broke out at the shrine, locally
known as Kikumbi Palace, burning the 400-year-old palace to ashes
and destroying all royal regalia.
</P>
<P>
The palace was recently rehabilitated and re-equipped with
traditional regalia.
</P>
<P>
The burnt shrines in the Kikumbi Palace zone, on
Kampala-Entebbe Road, played a significant role during the
enthronement of new kings. It used to be the cleansing place
during the enthronement before the king proceeded to be crowned.
</P>
<P>
Local sources attribute the burning of the shrine to a
conflict between two princes who have reportedly been squabbling
for the control of the palace.

XI'AN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Shaanbei, or northern Shaanxi
Province, only a dozen years ago a land of barren hills and
drifting sands on northwest China's Loess Plateau is becoming a
place of affluence.
</P>
<P>
Crops, trees and sprouting grass surround newly-built houses
and millions of sheep are grazing on pastures, forming a colorful
and splendid picture.
</P>
<P>
The great change has been made through years of arduous and
painstaking efforts made by local people since the 1980s, with the
help of the government and agro-technicians.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua team of reporters found that in October yellow corn
and millet filled the valleys of the area and red apples and dates
blanketed the slopes in Yan'an Prefecture, an old revolutionary
base in Shaanbei.
</P>
<P>
Located in the middle and northern part of the Loess Plateau,
1,000 m above sea level, the prefecture is riddled with hills and
valleys, which used to be a natural defence in wartime but now are
a disadvantage to economic development due to difficulties of
communications, said Ti Kaoshan, secretary of the Prefectural
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
In the early spring of 1984 several technicians from the
Prefectural Forestry Sciences Institute began to publicize the
idea of planting fruit trees in Miaogou, a village near the former
residence of the late Chairman Mao Zedong in Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some 380 ha of farmland in the village has been
transformed into orchards.
</P>
<P>
Despite a drastic drop in per-capita farmland from 0.8 ha to
0.27 ha, per-unit and gross output have increased remarkably, with
per-capita output rising to 500 kg and average per-capita income
netting 5,000 yuan (about 602 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Barren and hilly as it is, the prefecture yet has favorable
weather and soil for growing apples. The acreage of apple trees
has been increasing by 10,000 ha a year, with a annual rise of 50
million kg in output. By now, the acreage of apple orchards has
reached 80,000 ha, with an estimated annual output of 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"We are living a completely different life", said residents of
Yan'an, where the proportion of the acreage of grain and cash
plants now stands at 3:7, as against 7:3 previously.

<HEADLINE> Britain Set to Expel Saudi Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government ordered on
Wednesday the expulsion of a leading Saudi dissident, who has
repeatedly called for the overthrow of the Saudi Royal Family.
</P>
<P>
Muhammed Masari, leader of a group known as the Committee for
the Defense of Legitimate Rights, has been refused to stay in
Britain but he has been offered a safe haven in Dominica, a
spokesman of the British Home Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi dissident will have to leave Britain on January 19
and he had 10 days to lodge an appeal against the deportation, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Masari has repeatedly denounced what he calls the corruption
and anti-Islamic practices of the Saudi Royal Family, according to
a local press report.
</P>
<P>
His actions have embarrassed the British government and have
led to strong protests from the Saudi Arabian government, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
British businessmen have warned that millions of pounds worth
of arms contracts and other exports were at potential risk as long
as Masari was allowed to undertake anti-Saudi government
activities in Britain, the report added.

KAMPALA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Sudanese government
soldiers with military hardware have taken up positions in eight
places along the Uganda-Sudan border, the local daily "New
Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kaya Bridge on the Sudanese side is one of the areas camped by
the Arabian-looking troops, the paper quoted reliable sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear when the Sudanese troops first took up
positions in these areas, most of which have until recently been
under the control of the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lieutenant Hazario Mwekwasize, a Ugandan intelligence
officer, could not confirm whether the Sudanese troops were taking
up positions to fight the SPLA rebels or in preparation for a
possible attack on Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't feel threatened," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Sudanese government has accused Uganda of
supporting SPLA rebels, while Uganda has accused Sudan of aiding
Ugandan rebel groups.

<HEADLINE> Iran Completes Defensive Projects in Three Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed here today that it
has completed defensive projects on three of its strategically
important islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Revolutionary Guards are on full military alert on the
strategic islands to fend off possible attacks by the U.S. Fifth
Fleet stationed in the Persian Gulf, the Persian daily Salam
reported today, citing Brigadier General Mohsen Rezaie, the
commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC).
</P>
<P>
He said that the defensive cover of the Iranian islands in the
Persian Gulf has become complete.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the presence of the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the
Persian Gulf and the intensified American pressure on Iran,
Rezaie said that his forces were in "complete readiness."
</P>
<P>
"The IRGC has prepared plans for the possible moves by the
United States. All the intelligence and defensive systems are on
alert," Rezaie added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iran's Revolutionary Guards have possessed
advanced ballistic missiles and Sam-2 and Sam-6 rockets.
</P>
<P>
Rahim Safavi, the deputy commander-in-chief of Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has reportedly said that IRGC
had also manufactured ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran denied any purchase of 1,000-kilometer long-range
missiles from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Iran is to inaugurate an airport by February 10 on an island
which has been at the center of Tehran's dispute with the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Salam reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted an official of the Transportation Ministry as
saying that the airport at Abu Musa island will be opened during
the Ten Day Dawn festivities.
</P>
<P>
The festivities (on February 1-10) will mark the 17th
anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The three Iranian-held islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and
Greater Tunb are also claimed by the UAE. The islands are
strategically located on the route of two thirds of the world's
oil near the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The recent arrival of three U.S. warships for joint maneuvers
with the Arab states in the region has alarmed Tehran. The
Revolutionary Guards staged two large-scale missile maneuvers in
the Persian Gulf simultaneously with the arrival of the three
ships last month.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has said that it will take its dispute with
Iran to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials have rejected the demand.

<HEADLINE> 17,000 Liters Of Petrol Flow Into Drains In  Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- About 17,000 liters of petrol
gushed out of a B and C hauliers oil tanker in Harare's heavy
industrial area over the weekend and flowed into the storm-water
drains, the daily newspaper ''the Herald'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
While motorists stop to help themselves to the free petrol
despite the potential fire danger, city engineers are worried
about potential pollution of city water supplies and have started
testing river flows.
</P>
<P>
The petrol gushed out when a coupling on the tanker was ripped
off after the tanker's drain pipe hooked onto another truck as
the driver was trying to manoeuvre out of a parking area.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who had collected the petrol from Noczim depot
near Mabvuku in Harare, tried in vain to stop, using his bare
hands, the 17,000 liters from pouring out. Only a few liters
were captured into seven drums.
</P>
<P>
If a fire had started, most of the drivers scooping the petrol
would have been engulfed in the blaze and the fire brigade
advised people to stay away from such scenes.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Drawing More Overseas Travellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has received a total of 1.2 million overseas
tourists since it adopted the policy of reform and opening up to
the outside world in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Spectacular landscapes, abundant natural resources and the
unique ways of life of the local ethnic-minority inhabitants are
major attractions luring an ever-growing number of overseas
visitors, said an official with the local tourism administration.
</P>
<P>
The boom in tourism has brought about plenty of chances for
local people to enrich themselves, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Tourism earned Xinjiang a mere 46,000 US dollars in 1978 when
it was first kicked off. The sector has recorded rapid and steady
growth in the last 17 years. In 1995 alone a total of 200,000
overseas travellers visited Xinjiang, spending about 60 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in Xinjiang are growing at an annual rate of
69 percent, 47 percent higher than the national average, while
tourism revenue registered an annual growth rate of 57
percent. The national percentage stood at 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang tourism industry employs over 10,000 people,
including 500 interpreters and guides who use English, Japanese,
French, German and Russian as their working languages.

<P>
AMMAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Prince
Saud al-Faisal al-Saud will embark on his first high-level mission
to Jordan next week since relations were damaged by the 1990-91
Gulf Crisis, Jordanian officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit, due to start next Tuesday, will allow the
two countries to finally normalize their relations, which were
strained for Jordan's perceived tilt toward Iraq after Baghdad's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, said the English-language daily
Jordan Times, citing the officials.
</P>
<P>
The two kingdoms began mending ties in mid-1995, when Jordan's
Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti made two trips to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ambassador to Jordan, Abdullah Sudairi, arrived here
last November to take his post after a five-year hiatus, marking
the return of Amman-Riyadh ties to normal.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia and hold a
summit with King Fahd early last month. But the visit was
postponed due to the Saudi king's sudden illness.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, King Fahd issued a decree asking his half-brother,
Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel-Aziz, to manage government affairs
as he needed time to rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China has scored marked successes in the fight
against narcotics production, trafficking and abuse, according to
a local senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the last five years the police have cracked
nearly 20,000 drug trafficking cases.
</P>
<P>
Police officers have also smashed 953 drug gangs and one
underground drug-processing workshop. They have confiscated 421.56
kg of heroin, 2,013.4 kg of opium, at least ten tons of opium
poppies and 147.39 kg of marijuana and other narcotics. Some 1,000
drug traffickers have been convicted so far.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi borders on Vietnam and the "Golden Triangle", one of
the world's largest drug production areas. In recent years the
region has seen a rise in the number of cases involving the
smuggling of drugs by drug traffickers via Vietnam and Guangxi to
neighboring Yunnan Province and other parts of China, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has established a network of anti-drug
offices and formulated the Regulations against Drug Trafficking
and Abuse, in accordance with the National People's Congress's
Decision on Eradication of Illegal Dealing in Narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six drug rehabilitation centers, 36 short-term
provisional drug rehabilitation courses, and seven advisory
clinics providing consultancy concerning drug rehabilitation and
treatment have been set up all over Guangxi. By the end of June
1995 these institutes had treated 19,500 drug abusers.

In Fujian today 92 percent of retail sales are subject to

mechanism determined by market forces.

However, profiteering activities are emerging due to lack of

<P>
To curb activities seeking excessive profits and protect
consumers' rights, the province is paying special attention to

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanese Army Authorized to Chase Fugitives in Palestinian Refugee Camps (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese cabinet has given a
go-ahead to the army to break into Ain Al-Hilweh, the largest
Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, to arrest a radical
Palestinian allegedly involved in the murder of a Lebanese
religious leader last August.
</P>
<P>
In a regular meeting Wednesday night, the Council of Ministers
decided to "authorize the military forces to fulfill every
security task ... including arresting all those judicially wanted,
no matter where they are."
</P>
<P>
Official sources knowing the judicial procedures in this
country equated the cabinet decision to a "green light" to the
army to enter the Ain Al-Hilweh camp near southern port city of
Sidon to arrest a Palestinian called Ahmed Abdul Karim Al-Saadi,
best known as "Abu Mohjen."
</P>
<P>
Abu Mohjen is wanted by the Lebanese authority for his alleged
role in the assassination of Sheikh Nizar Halabi, head of the
pro-Syrian Sunni Islamic group Al Ahbash, in Beirut last August.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for the Lebanese army to enter a
Palestinian refugee camp in the country since the civil war ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
There are about 500,000 Palestinian refugees distributed in
dozens of camps all over the country, the largest of which is Ain
Al-Hilweh, with an estimated population of 70,000.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Council of Ministers has also
decided to disband two extremist Islamic groups active in the
north, one of which was named as Al-Hadaya Wa Al-Ihsan
Al-Islamiyeh (the Islamic Gifts and Charity) in Tripoli and
another was Al-Hadaya Al-Khairiyeh (the Welfare Gifts) in Akar.
</P>
<P>
No reason was officially given for the decision. But the
Lebanese sources said that these two extremist groups had been
accused of being linked with a scheme to stage a violent campaign
against restaurants, liquor shops and police stations in northern
districts.
</P>
<P>
After a report reached Ain Al-Hilweh that the authority had
asked Abu Mohjen to surrender or the security forces would
carry out the government decision by force, an atmosphere of
worry and caution has shrouded the largest Palestinian refugee
camp, a few kilometers east of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of clashes, a number of residents in the camp
have left for their relatives in other places, and some
institutions and schools have informed their employees and
students that they would close door today, sources in the camp
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders in Ain Al-Hilweh have asked Abu Mohjen to hand
himself over to the authority, or he "should take the
responsibility for what could happen in the camp," the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
Five suspects, three Lebanese and two Palestinians, were
arrested by the security forces in the Lebanese second largest
city of Tripoli last month, and they have made confessions that
they were the perpetrators of the killing of Sheikh Halabi.
</P>
<P>
Halabi was shot down in front of his residence in a
Sunni Moslem neighborhood in central Beirut on August 31,
1995, by three armed men driving a white Mercedes and two
men riding a motorcycle.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The booming township industry of
Shandong Province in east China recorded an export volume of 41.37
billion yuan-worth in 1995, up 39.4 percent over the figure for
the previous year and eight times the 1991 figure.
</P>
<P>
The 21,000 export-oriented township enterprises in the province
are mainly concentrated in the sectors of foodstuffs, chemical
industry, textiles and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has 1,000 township enterprises with annual
export volume exceeding 10 million yuan each. And the share of
exports in township industry's output value has been expanded to

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Tax to Affect Higher-Income Filipinos (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Filipinos with higher incomes may
be affected by the new tax rule of the country while low-income
families seem to suffer little influence.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the expanded value-added tax
(E-VAD), Filipino families will see their average monthly spending
grow by between 3 percent and 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA), monthly family spending will expand between 50
pesos (two US dollars) and 1,390 pesos (55.6 US dollars),
depending on the income level.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Bancod, an analyst at Peregrine Securities, said today
that the E-VAT is expected to affect more the middle- and
upper-income groups than those in the low-income working class
stratum.
</P>
<P>
"The E-VAT does not touch food items. Services, which it
covers, are something the lower-income bracket can do without," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
With individual incomes amounting to at least 1,000 US dollars
yearly, as measured by the per capita gross domestic product, "the
E-VAT will not have as much dent as anticipated," said the
analyst.
</P>
<P>
The real danger, he said, is the oil price hike, which is seen
to fan demands for a wage increase and subsequently, inflation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Trade Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez said that "the
E-VAT has little or no effect at all" on overall costs of living,
citing results of the NEDA's analysis.
</P>
<P>
The E-VAT, which took effect on January 1, covers transaction
on goods, properties and services, including hotels, restaurants,
securities dealers, taxicabs, tourist buses and car rental firms,
non-life insurance and newspaper publishing.

<P>
SEOUL, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will ease import
restrictions on 14 farm and 17 fishery products this year, the
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to increase the farm and fish market
opening ratio from 94.3 percent to 95.9 percent, as against all
the items traded on the market.
</P>
<P>
Under the market opening schedule, imports of three items --
fresh grapes, frozen Alaskan pollack and apple juice have been
liberalized since January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The markets for the remaining 28 items will be opened to
foreign suppliers on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that these liberalization measures will
adversely affect fruit growers, dairy farmers and fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Peres: No Early Elections if Peace with Syria Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres has said that as long as the peace process with Syria
continues, he will not call for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Peres told new members of the Labor Party at Kfar Hamaccabiah
Wednesday that it is a shame to waste a single day on
electioneering, if that day can be devoted to the peace process,
according to today's English-language daily, The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
"We will stop only when we have to, if there is no other
choice," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that such a contingency could arise "if anything
happens to cause us to lose our parliamentary majority. In such an
eventuality, there will be no choice but to go to the people."
</P>
<P>
"However," said Peres. "Barring such developments, we plan to
fully carry out the mandate given to us by the voters."
</P>
<P>
Peres also told the party members that so far the talks with
the Syrians in the U.S. "were not about substance, but about
creating the atmosphere to allow us to proceed with the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Syrian negotiation teams Wednesday started their
second round of talks near Washington after the long New Year
weekend break.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
will begin participating in the Israeli-Syrian negotiations today,
as part of an intensified effort to make progress toward peace in
advance of his scheduled shuttle visit between Israel and Syria
starting on January 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials expressed their satisfaction with
Wednesday's talks with the Syrians, which they described as "the
most successful so far," Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli officials in Jerusalem who are close
to the negotiations as saying that "concrete progress has been
made and not just in the tone of the talks."
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace negotiations on December
27 after a six-month suspension. The first three-day talks
ended last Friday, both sides said that serious talks have been
held at a positive atmosphere during the first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing second three-day talks will conclude Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli officials said that Israel, Syria and the
U.S. are unlikely to issue a joint statement following the
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
They said that any progress on the substance will occur
only during next week's visit to the region by Christopher,
and it is thought to be pointless to issue a communique
without having much to announce.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai-Taiwan Exchanges Busiest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cultural and academic exchanges
between Shanghai, China's largest city, and Taiwan ranked the
first in the country in 1995, according to a city official.
</P>
<P>
Though relations with Taiwan were strained after Taiwan
President Li Denghui's visit to the United States, nongovernmental
exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan flourished instead of
withering, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the number of exchange projects between Shanghai and
Taiwan totals a record 351.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges in such fields as accounting, urban construction,
law, finance and aviation, which were rare before, increased in
1995, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, exchanges in education show great potential, he
said, adding that the visits of educational institutions and
organizations across the Taiwan Strait have brought "life and
hope" to the expansion of exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Half of Shanghai's 47 full-time universities and colleges have
forged academic exchange relationships with educational
institutions in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges in the social sciences also scored rapid growth in
1995, the official said. The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences,
Fudan University and the Taiwan Research Institute have played
host to many renowned Taiwan scholars.
</P>
<P>
He described the discussions between Shanghai and Taiwan
scholars on many social science subjects as "quite thorough",
adding that research work on several such subjects have received
help from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The visits of leading Shanghai scholars to Taiwan also reported
good results, he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the cultural exchanges, several artistic
organizations from Shanghai have given performances in Taiwan, to
good reviews.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of ancient bronze wares held by the Shanghai
Museum in Taizhong City in Taiwan was on the largest scale of all
the exchange events across the Taiwan Strait, the official said,
noting that it received some 50,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the fourth year of copyright trade between Shanghai
and Taiwan, saw the signing of 47 copyright contracts, involving
52 kinds of publications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges in sports and science and technology also boomed, the
official said, adding that he hoped exchanges in all the fields
between Shanghai and Taiwan would further flourish in the future.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Plan Fresh Attack in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam has decided to make a series of fresh attacks in
northwestern Sri Lanka, according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers are believed to be planning their attacks in
Pahala, Eluvankulam and Kaipititya in the northwestern district of
Puttalam where the military presence is comparatively weak.
</P>
<P>
The military has received information of around 300 rebels who
are roaming in the dense jungles in the district, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels reportedly surrounded a police station in the
Puttalam district Wednesday and some residents had fled the area
after being informed of possible rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Sri Lanka Navy has bolstered its
presence in the stretch of sea along the Puttalam district.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is making arrangement to provide fire
arms for the villagers to ward off any attacks by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Anti-Drug Campaign Bears Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Police in this north China port
city confiscated 423 grams of heroin, 989 grams of "ice" and three
kg of marijuana in the first 11 months of 1995, according to the
Tianjin Municipal Anti-Narcotics Office.
</P>
<P>
Han Huamin, director of the office, said that during that
period police officers cracked 59 drug-related cases and arrested
120 drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
He estimated drug abusers in Tianjin, which has a population of
ten million, at about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug offices have been set up at the district and
municipal levels since the National People's Congress announced in
1991 the Decision on the Eradication of Illegal Dealing in
Narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1993, a local drug rehabilitation
center has treated some 250 drug abusers, Han said.
</P>
<P>
He said that from January 1991 to November 1995 police cracked
down 160 drug trafficking cases, arrested 388 drug dealers,
confiscated 989 g of "ice", 1,655 g of heroin and 13.4 kg of
marijuana. Some 160 drug traffickers have been convicted, three of
them sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
He said that last June the Tianjin police cracked a case
involving the smuggling of drugs to Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1993 Tianjin customs officials arrested a
German woman who was trying to smuggle five kg of marijuana to
Japan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Police have set up an anti-drug task force, tightened the
management of narcotics transportation and imposed compulsory
rehabilitation on drug abusers.

<HEADLINE> US Potato Chips Squeezing into Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- At the Xinjinjiang Grand Hotel
here US sales promoters were patiently teaching their Chinese
customers how to control the quality of fried potato chips.
</P>
<P>
"Please look at the telescreen, and see how we Americans
purchase, transport and process potato chips," an American
business man from the World Marketing Department of the United
States Potato Board (USPB) explained, using videos and slides.
</P>
<P>
American-style potato chips made 700 million US dollars in
profits for the US last year. It has not been easy, though, for
them to enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that fried potato chips can hardly fit into the
traditional Chinese diet, which never took the potato as a staple
food or refreshment.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years fried potato chips have been accepted as a
Western snack by some Chinese consumers, whose horizons have been
broadened by contact with foreign cultures as a result of the
country's "opening wider to the outside world".
</P>
<P>
But the American salesmen have found that their Chinese
competitors can easily process similar food to meet people's new
taste in a country which produces millions of potatoes a year.
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade of market development, the sales
volume in China reached 2,500 tons last year, only one percent of
the world's total sales.
</P>
<P>
But the Americans were not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
"You know, two years ago the sales volume in China was only 500
tons," said Thomas Lipetzky, vice-president of the World Marketing
Department of the USPB.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese market still has great potential, yet
people have still to recognize the good quality of American potato
chips.
</P>
<P>
Knowing the Chinese people's liking for genuine products, the
USPB hosted the demonstration here, where people are more familiar
with Western culture.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was intended to show that fried potato chips
with the best flavor can only be processed from American frozen
potatoes and with the American cooking method.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations will be held in other cities, the
salesmen said.
</P>
<P>
They know that the reduction of tariffs next year will weaken
their favored status in the competition with foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that they may lose the expanding domestic market, the
Chinese manufacturers are asking the agricultural departments to
improve the quality of potatoes and are seeking to learn
world-advanced processing techniques and to improve marketing
methods.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Give Up Anti-China Draft Resolution at UN Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The US government should "give
up its erroneous practice of tabling anti-China draft resolutions
at the UN Commission on Human Rights so as to avoid further damage
to its relations with China", said Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Chen Jian here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark at a press conference here this afternoon
when asked to comment on the US planning to table again an
anti-China draft resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights
to be held in the coming March.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States has, for five times, taken the lead
in producing anti-China draft resolutions at the UN Commission on
the Human Rights, which has all ended up in failure, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions by the US in violation of the purposes and
principles of the UN Charter will only lead to confrontation",
Chen stressed, adding that "they are detrimental not only to the
efforts by the international community for closer cooperation in
the human rights field, but also to the improvement and
development of Sino-US relations".
</P>
<P>
"The US government should proceed from the overall interests
and give up its erroneous practice of tabling anti-China draft
resolutions at the UN Commission on Human Rights so as to avoid
further damage to its relations with China", the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's 32-Member Cabinet Includes Seven New Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's new Prime Minister Kamal
al-Ganzouri has named a cabinet, which includes seven new
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri met each of the ministers individually late Wednesday
night, thus the formation of the new cabinet became apparent. But
there has been no official announcement on the formation.
</P>
<P>
Just as another sign that the new cabinet will aim to quicken
the pace of the economic development, the ministers of economy,
finance and industry were replaced.
</P>
<P>
Eddin al Gharib replaced Mohammed Ahmed el-Razaz to head the
Finance Ministry. Nawal al Tatawi became the new minister of
economy while Suliman Rada took the post as the minister of
industry.
</P>
<P>
The new planning minister is Zafer al Beshri. Talaat Hammad
replaced Ahmed Gomaa to take his new post as the minister of
cabinet affairs, and Hamdi Zaqzouq became the new minister of
waqfs.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry and the Ministry of Population and Family
were merged into the Ministry of Health and Population, which is
headed by Ismail Sallam.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Supply and Internal Trade Ahmed Goweili
became the head of the Ministry of Supply and Internal and Foreign
Trade, as the Ministry of Supply and International Trade was
merged with that of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
With the Ministry of International Cooperation being merged
into the Ministry of Economy, former Minister of International
Cooperation Youssef Boutros Ghali was appointed state minister for
Cabinet affairs dealing with economy.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ibrahim Sulaiman, who had been the minister of state of
new communities, became the minister of reconstruction, housing
and new communities as a result of the merger of the Ministry of
Housing and Utilities and the Ministry of New Communities.
</P>
<P>
The most powerful ministers -- defense, interior and foreign
affairs -- remain in place.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri was assigned by Mubarak Tuesday evening to choose the
new cabinet after the cabinet of Prime Minister Atef Sedki
resigned earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, 63, had been deputy prime minister and planning
minister in Sedki's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri graduated from the Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo
University and got a PHD degree in economics at the Michigan State
University of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet will be sworn in today and then Mubarak will
chair the first cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet shift is believed to be aimed at quickening the
pace of the faltering economic reform and reshaping the image of
the government, which has been accused by opposition parties of
widespread vote rigging in the parliamentary elections on November
29 and December 6.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Meets Malaysian Thai Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today had his first formal meeting with the
Malaysian Thai community in Kampung Titi Akar, the biggest
settlement of Thai Malaysians in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he was happy to meet the community and
appointed Charern Intachart, a Thai Malaysian, to be a member of
the senate.
</P>
<P>
Intachart, 56, former director of the Kedah Royal Customs and
Excise Department, is the country's first Thai Malaysian senator.
</P>
<P>
There are about 50,000 Malaysians of Thai origin in Malaysia,
the majority of whom are now living in Kedah state in northern
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mahathir said that the
Thai community, one of the several minority groups in the country,
has a too small population to have an elected representative.
</P>
<P>
But with the appointment of Senator Intachart, the interests of
the Thai community can now be looked after, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Thai community in Malaysia contributed a lot
to the national development.
</P>
<P>
"The government also wants to see the Thai community and other
minorities progress together and enjoy all the facilities
available," the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> Picturesque Lijiang River an Even Better Place to Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Travelers used to regret that
they could not tour Guilin's Lijiang River, said to be the most
beautiful in China, during the night.
</P>
<P>
But the installation of lamps not long ago has not only made
the river a fairyland even on the darkest night, but also made
diversified tourist programs possible.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Guilin City in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has paid some 10 million yuan
(1.204 million US dollars) to import advanced technology and
decorate the 2.5 km-long section of the river from Xiangbi Hill to
Diecai Hill, which is considered the most picturesque stretch of
the river, with some 400 lamps.
</P>
<P>
Because of the illumination, tourists can now not only see the
unique night view, but also enjoy a new local-flavor program
called "Fishing Boat Light on the Lijiang River", by which
participants can watch how local fishermen catch fish in a
traditional and romantic way.
</P>
<P>
From bamboo rafts the fishermen use cormorants to catch fish.
</P>
<P>
The picturesque river now also provides vacationers with
holiday resort tours after several resorts have been built along
the banks.
</P>
<P>
For example, travelers can go fishing, horse-riding and
dancing, and enjoy the idyllic countryside view at the Guanyan
Scenic Area.
</P>
<P>
They can also amuse themselves in a subterranean river
amusement zone, take part in forest excursions and go hunting.
</P>
<P>
Rafting along the 170-km-long scenic river is also available,
with visits to fishermen's families and evening bonfire parties on
the banks.
</P>
<P>
A newly offered recuperation tour is drawing increasing
tourists, who can do special exercises or take acupuncture
treatment and hot spring baths under the laurel trees along the
scenic banks of the river.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Seeks More Wind Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The wind in Northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is contributing to the local
economy and bringing convenience to people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is rich in wind power resources. In some areas the
wind can blow at 38 m per second. There are nine windy areas which
have the potential to turn out 245 billion kwh of electric power a
year, about 24 times the total annual amount of power generated in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the late 1980s, the government began to pay
attention to exploiting the region's wind energy sources. Ever
since, China has been pursuing technological exchanges and
co-operation with countries like Denmark, the Netherlands,
Britain, Germany and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
With donations from the Danish government, a wind power plant
consisting of 13 units of 150 kw generators was established in
1988 at Dabancheng which is less than 100 km from this regional
capital.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, 33 units of 300-kw or 500-kw generators were assembled
and put into operation with the assistance of foreign funds,
technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 46 units of wind-propelled generators are in
operation only around the Dabancheng area, with a total installed
capacity of 13,000 kw, which accounts for a quarter of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that this year the region will step up the
production of wind energy, by promoting equipment research in
particular.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investors In Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The development zone in this
north China port city has continued to attract an increasing
number of foreign investors since it was established 10 year ago.
</P>
<P>
"The investment environment is sound and the staff are all
first-class. We've achieved great success here," said P. Y. Lai,
an official from Motorola, during an interview.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, which first invested here in 1992, has expanded its
investment to one billion US dollars and become the biggest
investor in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract even more foreign investors, local
authorities have poured 2.4 billion yuan into infrastructure work
such as transportation, telecommunications, water, and
electricity, while improving services. Foreign investors have
expressed satisfaction with the zone.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Tianmei Automotive Parts Co. Ltd, a Japanese-funded
enterprise, has increased its investment to 21.46 million US
dollars from its original investment of 1.05 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the company Yu Ya Ma attributed the
increase in investment to the improvement in market function and
legal services in the zone, as well as the quality and efficiency of
the staff.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Yamaha Electronic Musical Instruments Inc., a
Sino-Japanese joint venture also attributed the company's
development to improvements in the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by the zone's environment, John Smith, president of
General Motors Company, expressed the hope that they can invest
here.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises have been
set up in the zone, and over 1,000 of them have gong into
operation.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Expects to Double Income Tax Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of central
China's Hubei Province is expected to collect 120 million yuan in
individual income taxes in 1995, which will double that of the
previous year, a municipal taxation official said.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of 1995 the city collected 110
million yuan (about 13.2 million US dollars) in individual income
taxes, according to Lu Bakui, a local taxation official.
</P>
<P>
Lu attributed the progress in this aspect to the unremitting
efforts of income tax officials, more awareness on the part of the
public about income tax, and the growing number of high-income
individuals.
</P>
<P>
This year more than 40,000 working units in the city were
required to turn over income taxes on behalf of taxation
departments.
</P>
<P>
With more publicity and strict law-enforcement, local officials
and the public has become more conscientious about paying income
taxes, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, individuals would not volunteer to pay
income taxes, banks would refuse to reveal details of clients'
accounts and local officials were reluctant to levy taxes for fear
of scaring away skilled people with high incomes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years with a boom in the foreign-funded
enterprises and private economy the number of high-income people
has increased to a great extent, in turn expanding the source of
income taxes, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that the loss of income tax revenue in the
city, as well as in the country as a whole, is still serious and
more effective efforts should be made.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sees Jordan's Plan for Iraq Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
voiced concern over the Jordanian plan for peace in Iraq, saying
"it is not acceptable to Iran."
</P>
<P>
Ali Khorram, advisor to Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati,
reiterated Iran's policy in today's English daily Iran News,
saying that the Islamic Republic adheres to Iraq's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Jordan's King Hussein has called for
division of Iraq and creation of a federation comprising of
central Iraq for the Sunnis, northern Iraq for Kurds, and the
southern part of the country for Shia community.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein disclosed his plan last year during the course of
his efforts for peace and reconciliation between Baghdad and the
oppositions of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
"Iran strongly opposes any interference in the internal affairs
of Iraq and only the Iraqi people have the right to determine
their fate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official criticized Jordan's King Hussein for
partition of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Countries such as Iran, Syria, Turkey, Egypt and Kuwait did
not welcome the Jordanian monarch's plan," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This plan was engineered by Israel and the United States and
became futile even at its preliminary stage due to lack of
support."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the plot was to remodel rich
Iraq into three poor countries.
</P>
<P>
"What we expect is that democracy should be introduced in
Iraq along with equal rights for all Sunni, Shia and Kurdish
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq should not be a target of political games of this or
that power and its future should be determined by its own people
alone," he stressed.

<P>
HEFEI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Fuyang, China's largest prefecture
with a population of 13 million, has attracted a number of
doctor's degree holders since it turned into a pivot of the
Jingjiu (Beijing-Kowloon) Railway.
</P>
<P>
Seven academics from the Chinese University of Science and
Technology have received letters of appointment as science and
economics advisors from Ya Zhongqing, deputy commissioner of
Fuyang. They have promised to bring Fuyang their latest research
results.
</P>
<P>
The seven went to Fuyang for a two-day visit on behalf of other
doctor's degree holders at the university based in this capital of
east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huaizhong, secretary of the prefectural committee of the
Communist Party of China, told one of the visitors, Yuan Hongyong,
that though Fuyang leads the province in terms of the economic
progress it has achieved during the past three years, the high
technology industry makes up only five percent of the total
industry.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Fuyang needs intellectuals to help develop its
traditional agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
Yuan decided to choose Fuyang as the place to turn his research
findings into real business, as his intellectual property security
system has been recognized as the best of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
He Liqun, who has studied solar energy application, plans to
popularize low-cost solar heaters in the area.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Coffee Exports Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' coffee exports
earned 10.6 million US dollars in 1995, down 27 percent from 14.5
million US dollars posted in 1994, according to the International
Coffee Organization Certifying Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The export drop was due to the increasing demand on the
domestic market, which trimmed down the country's surplus
production for coffee exports, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Top export markets of the Philippines' coffee products include
the United States, Singapore, Japan and Oman.

ABU DHABI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Interior Minister Ali
Sayyed Abdulla is currently visiting the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) to explain his country's position over a dispute Red Sea
island with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Ali Sayyed arrived here Wednesday following Yemen's President
Ali Abdullah Saleh's remarks that Yemen would not give up its
legal right over the island but would work to prevent a row
between Yemen and Eritrea from endangering shipping.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea both claim sovereignty over Red Sea islands
including Greater Hanish, where at least 12 people died in
fighting between the two countries last month.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which face each other across the strait of
Bab el-Mandeb at the mouth of the Red Sea, fought a brief battle
on December 15.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea took full control of the island before a cease-fire
took effect on December 18.
</P>

Greater Hanish sits astride major shipping lanes, some 160
kilometers north of Bab el-Mandeb.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Railways Bureau has
made sound preparations for the coming peak in passenger
transportation during the traditional Spring Festival season.
</P>
<P>
Sources said 26 pairs of temporary trains running to all major
destinations nationwide will be operated over that period.
</P>
<P>
Railway officials predict that trains starting from the Chinese
capital will carry a total of 18 million passengers, or a daily

1995.
</P>
<P>
The transport peak for the Spring Festival, the traditional red

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reinforces Its Combat against Drug Trafficking in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,800 police officers are
now working in Turkey's anti-smuggling department to combat
illegal drug trafficking and arms trade, the Turkish Daily News
today quoted a police chief as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tuncay Yilmaz, chief of the anti-smuggling department, said
that he sees drug trade as a "crime against humanity," and that
well-trained police officers are the backbone of the operation
against it.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a 25 percent increase in the seizure of hard
drugs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, police confiscated two tons of such drugs, while
1995's seizure reached 2.5 tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that the 1995 seizure of hard drugs included 2,397
kilograms of heroin, 73 kilograms of base morphine, 56 kilograms
of cocaine, and 112 kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Also confiscated were various soft drugs, such as 107,074
captagon tablets (an aphrodisiac) and 9,731 kilograms of hashish,
and 51,139 kilograms of anhydride acid, used in producing heroin,
he added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,359 people were arrested last year in its serious
fight against the drug trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were 170 arms smuggling cases, with 669
smugglers captured and 129 rifles, 1,076 pistols, 53,755 bullets
and 132 various bombs confiscated.
</P>
<P>
He described the country's laws regarding arms smuggling as
insufficient, adding that the current law permits a convicted
smuggler to be sentenced to as few as 10 months in prison, the
same as the owner of an unlicensed gun.

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Reaps Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite the most devastating
floods in a century, east China's Jiangxi Province still reaped a
bumper grain harvest in 1995, the Provincial Statistics Bureau has
announced.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the bureau indicate that the grain output
amounted to 16.074 billion kg in 1995, an increases of 39 million
kg over 1994, up 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat agricultural performance is owing to the bumper
harvest of late rice, which helped make up for the flood-induced
loss of early rice in the first half of the year. The area of late
rice was 21.866 million mu (roughly 1.5 million ha) last year,
40,000 ha more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To boost grain production, Jiangxi increased its input in the
sector by a margin of 50 percent in 1995, as against 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai forces have been reinforced
along the northern border with Myanmar in response to security
concerns sparked by the reported latest surrender of opium warlord
Khun Sa's Mong Tai army.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Myanma troops took over a position from the Mong Tai
army, believed to comprise 6,000-8,000 troops, on a hill at the
Doi Lang mountain range opposite to Thailand's Mae Ai district of
Chiang Mai province.
</P>
<P>
Both Thailand and Myanmar claim sovereignty over the strategic
hill, but the presence of the Mong Tai army has so far served as a
buffer and hampered any serious border conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Thai border authorities have now taken stricter measures to
check travel documents to prevent possible influx of people from
Myanmar's Shan state.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Myanmar government forces moved into Ho Mong, Khun
Sa's headquarters in eastern Shan state, and met no resistance.
Khun Sa's whereabouts are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, over 2,000 Myanma troops gathered at Ho
Mong, about 30 kilometers from the Thai border, to attend a
ceremony at which Mong Tai army fighters handed over their weapons
and officially surrendered to the Myanma troops.
</P>
<P>
Yangon troops have reportedly taken control of all the military
locations of Khun Sa.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Khun Sa, who has been indicted in the
United States on opium trafficking charges, struck a secret truce
with the Myanma government in exchange for an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old drug lord, half-Chinese and half-Shan, had been
fighting for independence of Shan state for four decades.

BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese investment fund
for joint ventures has been established in China, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year fund of 30 million US dollars, raised by Japan's

The fund will mainly invest in China-based Sino-Japanese joint
ventures in manufacturing, with investment in each venture
standing between three to five million US dollars so as to guard
against risk exposure.
</P>

Either the Chinese or Japanese partner of a joint venture can
apply for investment from the fund, the source said, adding that the
fund will not participate in the daily management of the joint
ventures and will be paid in dividends.

Nomura Securities can help enterprises with good performance
records to get listed overseas through its global networks,
according to a spokesman for Nomura, who said he expected the
fund's annual rate of return to reach 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Johansson: Havelange's Pledge to Africa is Premature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- UEFA president Lennart
Johansson says FIFA chief Joao Havelange overstepped his authority
in pledging soccer's 2006 World Cup to Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Havelange has done so much good for soccer in the past, but
now things are starting to go in the wrong direction," Johansson
said, heating up the long-standing feud between soccer's two most
powerful men.
</P>
<P>
Havelange, who turns 80 in May, said Sunday in the Brazilian
newspaper Jornal do Brasil that he would use his upcoming African
visit to assure South African president Nelson Mandela that Africa
would be awarded the 2006 finals.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said Havelange's promise was hollow since FIFA's
21-member executive committee - and not the president alone -
would decide which country gets the finals. That decision is not
due for four more years and several European countries have shown
an interest in staging the event in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I know of so many examples when Havelange has made proposals
that have led to no action by the executive committee," Johansson
said in an interview Wednesday with the Swedish newspaper
Expressen. "There are rules that should be followed. Why is it so
damned difficult to understand?''
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to speculate about Havelange's motives,"
Johansson said. "I can merely state that he has flagrantly
neglected the rules through his statement. His move is an act of
desperation."
</P>
<P>
Johansson said he expected to confront Havelange about his
statements at the African Nations' Cup, which opens January 13 in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup finals have traditionally alternated between
Europe and the Americas. France will host the 1998 finals while
the 2002 championship will be held in Asia for the first time,
with Japan and South Korea as the only bidders.

China.
</P>
<P>
There are caves with scenic underground rivers and lakes, as in
the case of Guanyan Cave in tourist-oriented Guilin city of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with its rivers, and Anshun
Dragon Cave in neighboring Guizhou Province where people can visit
an 800-meter-long section of an underground river while enjoying
the stalactites.
</P>
<P>
A second type of cave is the kind made by deposits, as
represented by the well-known Ludi Cave and Qixing (Seven-Star)
Cave in Guilin.
</P>
<P>
A third type has natural scenery with cultural attractions,
such as Shuiyue (water and moon) Cave, Longyin Cave and a number
of others in Guilin, where ancient carvings in the stone are
visible. In addition, there are also caves where ancient human
fossils and artifacts have been discovered.
</P>
<P>
Travelers can even go to a karst cave to receive medical
treatment now that a number of so-called "medical caves" have been
opened.
</P>
<P>
Cave tours have also been made more colorful with a number of
caves being the site of art and film shows.

<HEADLINE> Chinese May Have Used Ginseng 1,000 Years Earlier than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese may have been
using ginseng some 3,000 years ago, which is 500 to 1,000 years
earlier than was previously thought, latest research by Chinese
scholars claims.
</P>
<P>
This new view is expressed in a new book, "Chinese Ginseng
Culture", by Prof. Sun Wencai, of Tonghua Teachers' College, in
Jilin Province of northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Sun's major evidence is the discovery of the Chinese character
for ginseng in an inscription on bronzeware dating back to the
late Shang Dynasty (C.1600 to C.1100 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the prevailing view that the Chinese character
for ginseng is a phonetic character, Sun reasoned that it is
actually a pictographic character, with the upper part
representing the ground part of ginseng, and the lower part the
fibrous root.
</P>
<P>
The pictographic nature of the character is clear even today on
the simplified form of the character, Sun explains.
</P>
<P>
Because the character is inscribed on bronzeware used as a
drinking vessel, Sun believes that it is an indication that the
aristocrats of the Shang Dynasty might have been drinking
ginseng-soaked liquor to keep themselves fit.

LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- World number eight Anthony Hill
of Australia was banned on Wednesday for three months and fined
1,400 pounds by the Professional Squash Association (PSA) for his
aggressive behaviour on court.
</P>
<P>
The Australian reportedly made an obscene gesture at Finland's
Sami Elopuro and obstructed and argued with world champion Jansher
Khan of Pakistan at the World Open in Nicosia in November.
</P>
<P>
The World Squash Federation is believed to be looking into
Hill's behaviour in the world team championship semifinals in
Cairo when he held two match balls against Zaman Gul in the
deciding rubber of the clash against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But Hill lost the match and his aggressive behaviour included
striking his opponent with the ball.
</P>
<P>
Hill caused uproar at the Qatar International after losing to
Paul Gregory of Greece and demanding that his match referee
should be thrown out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to play seriously against early opponent Derek
Ryan of Ireland in the Mahindra Challenge in Bombay.

<HEADLINE> McClellan's Sister Argues with Don King Over Expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A sister of disabled former
middleweight champion Gerald McClellan on Wednesday charged
promoter Don King for failing to provide enough financial support
for her brother.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone news conference, Lisa McClellan denounced the
controversial promoter's claim that he was taking care of
McClellan's medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
"I hear that he is paying Gerald's medical expenses. That is
not true," Lisa said of King. "We take money out of Gerald's
personal account to pay for his expenses."
</P>
<P>
Lisa said her brother is blind as a result of injuries he
suffered last February 25 in a fight against World Boxing Council
super middleweight champion Nigel Benn in London.
</P>
<P>
Lisa said that some of McClellan's possessions, including cars,
are being sold to raise money for his care.
</P>
<P>
King heatedly denied the charge that they had turned their
backs on the ailing former champion.
</P>
<P>
"I will do whatever I can do," King said.
</P>
<P>
King insisted that Lisa was being controlled by people who were
out to ruin him.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Delhi Blast Rises to Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from
yesterday's blast in the heart of a busy wholesale market in north
Delhi has risen to six as another victim died of injuries later in
the day, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one people were injured in the blast, three of them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, the second in the capital since last November,
damaged several vehicles and shops, and brought to a standstill
all activities on the Qutb road in the Sadar Bazar area of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which apparently took place in a scooter parked
opposite a tonga stand on the busy Qutb road around 3 p.m.,
triggered off a fire which destroyed several shops nearby.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Police Commissioner Nikhil Kumar told reporters at the
scene that the cause and nature of the explosion had yet to be
established. But explosives experts indicated that the blast was
caused by a crude bomb.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front, a militant
outfit which had claimed responsibility for the Connaught Place
blast in the capital last November, said in a telephone call to a
news agency here shortly after the explosion that a bomb was
placed to protest against what he called "atrocities" in Kashmir.

WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will join the Syrian-Israeli peace talks that
restarted today at the Wye Plantation conference center on
Maryland's eastern shore.
</P>
<P>
Christopher wants to gain a personal understanding of the
talks, the second round of negotiations in six months, before
starting his Middle East tour on January 10, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State will meet with Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres during his four-day
visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very real option for him to get a first-hand reading
of the talks. He will need to report on the talks to
the two leaders so this is a very good opportunity for him," said
Burns.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate objective here in 1996 is to try to help Syria
and Israel reach a comprehensive agreement between them that will
resolve the problems that have separated them since 1948."
</P>
<P>
However, Burns noted that "We expect many, many, many difficult
discussions before an agreement is reached, if an agreement is
going to be reached."
</P>
<P>
Syrian and Israeli negotiators held the first round of the
three-day talks in Maryland last week with American mediators and
continued informal discussions in Washington over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration was encouraged by the first round of
discussions and looked forward to further progress, a U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
Both Syrian and Israeli officials described the first round
talks as useful and positive but said no final understandings were
reached.

</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the province has found various ways
to raise funds for building power plants, including joint
ventures, barter trade, introduction of equipment and loans
provided by international financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
So far, the power sector of the province has attracted foreign
investment totalling 2.3 billion US dollars and built power
plants with a total capacity of 6.25 million kw.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the province has benefited greatly from
World Bank loans amounting to 665 million US dollars in building
four generating sets totalling 600,000 kw.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The daily turnover on China's
national foreign exchange market rose 21.5 percent to 260 million
US dollars-worth in 1995, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Total transactions on the Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange
Trading System were worth 65.52 billion US dollars (about 7.9
billion US dollars) last year, which broke down to 59.51 billion
US dollars, 43.16 billion Hong Kong dollars and 49.27 billion
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Currently only the three currencies are traded on the system.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the average trade-weighted value of the
greenback last year was on a generally downward trend against the
local currency, the renminbi yuan, dipping from 8.4462 at the end
of December 1994 to 8.3174 at the end of last month. The decline
of 1,288 points translated into 1.5 percent year-on-year, down
from 2.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuation of the Hong Kong dollar largely followed the US
currency, to which it is pegged. Its exchange rate against the
yuan dropped by 14.6 percent in 1995, down from 1.0915 to 1.0756.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen's exchange rate against the yuan fluctuated in
a wide range last year, as against the US dollar on the
international market. It reached a record high of 100 yen to
10.3716 yuan on April 20 and plunged to a record low of 7.9608 on
September 20.
</P>
<P>
The membership of the system rose to 373 by the end of
December, including 222 Chinese banks, 116 overseas banks and 35
non-banking financial institutions.

MEXICO CITY, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico recorded a 9.85
billion U.S. dollar trade surplus with the United States and
Canada in the first nine months of 1995, the Commerce and
Industrial Promotion Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
But the country suffered a trade deficit of 4.3 billion dollars
with the European Union and Southeast Asian countries, the

</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the ministry show that between January

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports from its partners in the North American Free

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consulate in Bordeaux,
France, the oldest diplomatic representation in the world, will be
shut down on January 31 due to sharp cuts in government spending
at home, the U.S. embassy in France said today.
</P>
<P>
"Budget restrictions" prompted the State Department to make the
difficult decision to close the first U.S. consulate in France,
established in 1790, said Robert Kiene, the acting consul in
Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
The Bordeaux consulate is the latest one of a dozen
U.S. diplomatic representations worldwide to be closed down this
year due to steep federal budget cuts at home, the U.S. embassy
said.
</P>
<P>
The consulate was set up after the first U.S. federal
government was established in 1789 following its independence from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
As France's largest port on the Atlantic coast in the late 18th
century, Bordeaux was chosen as the site for the first American
consulate because the U.S. intended to strengthen its ties with
France, the then second power in the world, to counter Britain's
influence, a local university historian said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Calls for Oust-PM Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Leader of Bangladesh's largest
opposition party has called for a movement to oust Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia to ensure a meaningful election with the participation
of all political parties, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally here Wednesday afternoon, Sheikh Hasina,
president of the Awami (People's) League, said that "people would
not participate in any election under the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) government and the present prime
minister."
</P>
<P>
"If she (the prime minister) does not agree to quit, then what
else can be done other than toppling her along with the chair,"
said the former opposition leader in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also criticized the government for deciding to hold
elections during the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The three mainstream opposition parties in Bangladesh are the
Awami League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami
(Islamic Congress).
</P>
<P>
The BNP is reportedly seeking the participation in the election
of the Jamaat-e-Islami if the other two major opposition parties
continued to boycott the process of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Although this has not been confirmed by the parties concerned,
the Jamaat-e-Islami has publicly called for the appointment of an
advisory council by the president to conduct the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Jamaat-e-Islami's call almost echoed
an announcement last month by the prime minister that her
government might consider a council of advisors under the
president.
</P>
<P>
Last night, Hasina's husband Dr. Wazed Mia had a 70-minute
close-door meeting with BNP Secretary General Abdus Salam
Talukdar.
</P>
<P>
"I proposed to resolve the crisis and it is absolutely on my
own. Neither have I been sent by any party or any individual nor
have I carried any body's briefing," Dr. Wazed told reporters
after the meeting.

KATHMANDU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
considering to legalize human organ export and frame related
regulations, according to Health Minister Arjun Narsing K.C.
recently.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating a national conference of the Nepalese
Society of Kidney Disease earlier this week, the health minister
said the government was considering to give the export of human
organs legal status and proper organization.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to develop medical facilities and
regulations about kidney disease treatment in a country like Nepal
which was stricken by poverty and inequality.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Society of Kidney Disease would continue to
develop and expand medical services for treatment of kidney
patients in Nepal and meanwhile help the government work out
necessary laws.
</P>
<P>
Nepal saw its first ever kidney transplant operation at a
private nursing house last year which has raised controversies
over medical ethics and existing laws.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's existing laws prohibit any human organ transplant
operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China imported 17,300 finished
autos during the January-November period last year, 30 percent
fewer than the same period in 1994, "China Daily" quoted Chen
Ping, vice-president of the China Trade Centre for Imported Cars
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen estimated that the country's imports of cars, buses and
trucks last year also would see a drop of 21 percent over 1994 to
221,800 units.
</P>
<P>
Also during the first 11 months of last year, China imported
118,850 motor vehicles, down 33 percent from the corresponding
1994 period.
</P>
<P>
Against the shrinking market for imported vehicles, the
domestic manufacturers are increasing production, with buses,
trucks and autos reaching 1.45 million units last year, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted, though the volume of imported finished cars were
reducing, the imports of cars in parts were swelling, which
accounted for 83 percent of the total imports of cars during the
first 11 months of last year, compared with 80 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Chen also predicted that the country's demand for imported cars
this year will focus on those with small engines and luxury
interior trim and accessories.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chile's economy grew by more
than 8 percent in 1995 and the economic and financial outlook for
1996 is healthy, Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the country's economic growth last year led
to a 4.1 percent real increase in salaries, a 6 percent rise in
labor productivity. Unemployment was steady at 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 112,000 new jobs were created last year, an increase of
2.3 percent, especially in financial services, mining, and
manufacturing industries, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
More jobs will be created this year, and the unemployment rate
will be pegged at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government will continue to reduce
inflation, from last year's 8.5 percent to a rate of 6.5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The country had a 1.2 billion U.S. dollar foreign trade surplus
and a balanced current account. Garcia said that size of Chile's
international reserves equals a year of imports, enough for the
country to face fluctuations in the international financial
market. But he did not give a concrete figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- After several decades' efforts
to be independent, women in South China's Guangdong Province are
now " holding up half the sky", the " China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the province's Women's Association, women now make
up 46 percent of the province's work force.
</P>
<P>
In the field of politics, in particular, women in Guangdong are
having more say. Statistics from the Women's Association indicate
that 450,000 women now work for Party and government departments
at different levels.
</P>
<P>
The number is 26 times that in the early '80s. Eighteen hold
senior positions in the province's 14 major cities, including
Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
And better education has fundamentally changed women's role in
society. At present, females account for 37 percent of college
undergraduates and 25 percent of post graduates, which are 11 and
54 times more, respectively, than in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the market economy has allowed women
as well as men to show their entrepreneurial spirit. In State
enterprises alone, 6,000 women have become head of their
companies; thus, one-sixth of the province's 36,000 State
companies are in women's hands.
</P>
<P>
And more women are running their own private businesses
successfully. Many of them have become millionaires. A woman from
Jiedong County was named one of the "10 Outsanding Persons of
Guangdong" this year for the tremendous success she had made of
her garment factory. She now has assets of over 20 million yuan
(2.4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Women have also become physically stronger. Between 1990 and
1993, Guangdong women won 40 world sports championships.

<HEADLINE> Germany's East Narrows Gap with West in Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Dramatic changes in farming since
German re-unification have boosted grain output in the east, but
livestock farming has fallen dramatically, says Germany's Minister
of Agriculture Jochen Borchert.
</P>
<P>
Grain output in the east of Germany has risen 22 per cent to
6,010 kilograms per hectare since 1990 and milk output has risen
27 per cent to 5,200 kilograms per cow, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
But animal husbandry still remains at a low level. The
livestock count has fallen by a third to under 3.3 million head.
The number of cows has fallen by half to 1 million head from 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since reunification, the agricultural structure in the east has
changed dramatically, with former large-scale farm enterprises
being transformed into individual household companies and private
companies. It is now facing problems concerning property rights,
old debt and increasing costs.
</P>
<P>
But Borchert told a press conference on Tuesday that the most
difficult period of agricultural restructuring in the east has
passed with the establishment of a competitive plantation
industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Cali airport flight controllers
rejected today allegations by American Airlines pilots that they
were responsible for a December 20 air crash in Colombia that
killed 160 people.
</P>
<P>
Two veteran American Airlines pilots reviewed voice recordings
between the American pilot and the airport controller shortly
before the jet crashed into a mountain near Buga in southwest
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
They told the Miami Herald on Wednesday that the controller and
the pilot did not understand each other, partly because of
language problems. "The controller was giving clearances that made
no sense because he had no radar and couldn't see the airplane,"
one of the pilots told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But Civil Aeronautics regional director Carlos Rubio said a
preliminary investigation showed that the Cali flight controllers
maintained perfect communication with the Boeing 757 crew. The
conversation between them was clear, he said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators did not mention any misunderstandings due to
language, Rubio added. They only concluded that the cause of the
accident was not clear, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cali airport is one of the safest in the country
and a final investigation would determine reponsibility for the
crash.

demands for higher pay to help meet the high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
The demands are being made at the time when the government is
preparing to cut 1,500 jobs, as part of its modernization efforts.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Honduran Association of Public Employees
said the government must honor its promise made months ago to
improve the salaries of public servants and maintain labor
stability.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here, the joint support of all labor
confederations and workers unions of the country, and street
demonstrations, are planned to put pressure on the government to
win pay increases.

<HEADLINE> French Auto Sales Remain Dull in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua)-- The French bought fewer new
automobiles last year and the market remains dull despite efforts
to boost it by the government and auto companies, according to
statistics released Tuesday by the French Automobile Manufacturers
Council.
</P>
<P>
Sales last year declined by 2.1 percent compared to 1994, with
only 1.93 milliion new automobiles sold.
</P>
<P>
The council said that the three famous French auto companies --
Renault, Peugeot and Citroen-- all sold fewer cars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Renault sold 564,000 cars last year, four percent less than in
1994, while Peugeot sold 395,000 cars, 4.3 percent down from
1994. Citroen also registered a 1.4 percent decline in sales.
</P>
<P>
Renault remained the best seller on the French auto market,
taking 29.2 percent of market share. But the entire market share
of French-made automobiles declined from 61.2 percent in 1994 to
59.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 74,800 Japanese cars were bought by
the French, taking 3.88 percent of the market, while more buyers
turned to America's General Motors, Germany's Volkswagen and
Italy's Fiat.
</P>
<P>
The number of new cars bought each year has remained below the
two million level since 1993. In 1993, a total of 1.72 million new
cars were sold -- a consequence of the depressed French economy
and consumers' weaker purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The previous government led by Edouard Balladur had tried to
stimulate auto sales by providing subsidies of 5,000 French francs
(about 1,025 U.S. dollars) to the owners of cars which were ten
years old and above.
</P>
<P>
The present Juppe government is offering subsidies of 7,000
francs (about 1,434 U.S. dollars) to the owners of cars that are
eight years old or more.
</P>
<P>
However, these measures, along with other sales promotions by
the car manufacturers, were not effective due to the depressed
economy.
</P>
<P>
Some car producers hope the government subsidies as well as
compulsory technical inspections of old cars will drive owners to
buy new ones.
</P>
<P>
But they expect the 1996 auto market to remain grim as
additional taxes effective this year will lower purchasing power.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Search Bloc, a
Colombian Army and Police joint command set up to
fight drug trafficking, is intensifying its activities in several
parts of the country to gather evidence against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The Search Bloc has entered and searched two estates in
Palmira, in the Valle del Cauca department, belonging to Vladimir
Mosquera, the lawyer of Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, jailed head of
the Cali drug cartel, and legal counsel of fugitive Helmer Herrera
Buitrago, a former member of the Cali cartel hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
The searches were carried out between December 23 and
27, 1995 to confiscate documents and other evidence against the
cartel.
</P>
<P>
Searches were also made in Cali and other Valle del Cauca towns
visited by drug traffickers either wanted by the General Attorney's
Office or under pre-trial investigations.
</P>
<P>
According to Gustavo Salazar Pineda, Helmer Herrera Buitrago's
current defense lawyer, his client is out of Colombia but is
planning to return to surrender to authorities if certain
conditions are met, including his confinement in a prison in a
warm climate, the lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Rural Unemployment Serious in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- As many as 1.1 million people in
Poland's countryside were registered jobless in 1995, of whom
470,000 have been out of work for more than one year, the
country's Labor Bureau reported today.
</P>
<P>
They are only part of the country's 2.56 million-strong jobless
force, and the unemployment rate in some provinces was above 60
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government had provided up to 1.5 billion zlotys (about 625
million U.S. dollars) in relief funds for the unemployed in rural
areas from January to October last year.
</P>
<P>
In order to cut rural unemployment, the government took such
measures in the past two years as providing interest-free or low
interest loans to boost agriculture production, or attracting
domestic and foreign investment to rural areas with high
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government also tried to create more job
opportunities by setting up special economic zones and more
medium- and small-sized enterprises to process farm produce.

<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned as a
"terrorist act" a bomb attack on a building housing the French
consulate and a branch of the French Paribas bank in Arnhem,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt called
the assault a "criminal or terrorist act," urging Dutch
authorities to make an investigation as soon as possible and
punish those responsible severely.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded late Tuesday night in part of the building's
rear facade and smashed windows of the houses nearby in central
Arnhem. It caused no casualties, however.
</P>
<P>
Dutch police said there were no claims of responsibility but
speculated that the attack could be a protest against France's
current nuclear test, the fifth carried out in 1995, in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
But the French spokesman refused to speculate on motives for
the attack. He said no one had claimed responsibility for the
bombing or explained what was behind it.

<HEADLINE> Austria to Cut Deficit to Enter Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Austria will slice spending by
100 billion schillings (10 billion U.S. dollars) in an effort to
trim its deficit to meet the standard of a future European single
currency, the newly-appointed finance minister Viktor Klima said
here today.
</P>
<P>
After his inauguration earlier today, Klima, joined by
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, vowed to adopt austerity programs to
reduce Austria's deficit to 68 billion schillings (6.8 billion
U.S. dollars), or 2.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, to
ensure its participation in the European Monetary Union beginning
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who replaced Andreas Staribacher after the latter's
surprise resignation Tuesday, said the belt-tightening plan will
take into account Austria's economic situation and high employment.
</P>
<P>
Klima, the ex-minister for state industry and transport, was
widely seen as more capable of breathing new life into stalled
budget talks between the two ruling parties over how to rein in
the bulging state deficit.
</P>
<P>
Disagreement on a 1996 budget triggered the collapse of the
two-party coalition and snap elections last month.

percent higher than 1994's figure. It has put 2.67 billion kg of

<HEADLINE> Darwin's Bird Specimens Discovered in Melbourne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Two birds that gave Charles
Darwin clues of his theory of evolution in the 1830s were
discovered in vaults of a Melbourne museum in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The discovery on Wednesday was hailed as of international
importance. And personnel in the Museum of Victoria suspect that
there are more bird specimens made by the great scientist lying
unrecognized in the vaults, the Melbourne-based newspaper "The
Age" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no reports for a very long time of any Darwin
specimens," said Les Christidis, curator of ornithology at the
museum.  The find of the two preserved birds, still tagged in the
great English naturalist's handwriting, was a complete surprise,
because scientists believed that all Darwin's specimens had been
extensively documented decades ago, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The bird specimens, one of them a finch, was found during an
inventory in the vaults of the museum. The sepia-colored tag
attached to the finch's leg states simply "C. Darwin Esq., 4 Jan.
1837."
</P>
<P>
Christidis said that this probably represents the date that
Darwin handed his specimens to the Royal Zoological Society in
London. He said that Darwin collected the birds during his voyage
around the South American coast on HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836.
</P>
<P>
By comparing the differences in the peaks of finches on the
Galapagos Islands with those on the mainland and in the fossil
record, Darwin developed the idea that species can change and
adapt to the environment.  This provided the basis of his
evolutionary theory in the book that shook the Christian
world--The Origin of Species. His theory of evolution became one
of the most cherished tenets of modern science.
</P>
<P>
The two birds were probably bought by Sir Frederick McCoy, the
founding director of the then National Museum in Melbourne, in the
1880s. The vendor was the famous British bird painter John
Gould, who delivered a landmark speech about Darwin's finches to
the Royal Zoological Society in January 1837, the newspaper said.
Because Gould had a habit of replacing the original collection
tags with his own, Christidis suspects that the museum has more
pieces of Darwin's collection.
</P>
<P>
He has instituted a wider search in the museum in the hope that
other samples might be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
"These two birds (with the original Darwin tags) escaped having
their tags removed. We suspect that we may have more (that were
collected by Darwin)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No other Australian museum has a Darwin bird," he said, "we
are very fortunate."

KUWAIT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Wimbledon champion Michael
Stich was beaten in the second round of the Qatar Open tennis
tournament in Doha on Wednesday and said he would not play in the
Australian Open later this month.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded German, playing only his second match since
an ankle injury put him out of the game in October, was defeated
6-3, 6-4 by Czech Petr Korda.
</P>
<P>
"I will need three or four weeks to get to a certain level and
it makes no sense to go all the way to Australia where it takes
two or three days to recover, so it looks like I won't go," Stich
said after the rain-delayed match.
</P>

"If it was a Grand Slam in Europe then there wouldn't be a
problem. But I want to get in 100 percent shape and I have to
look forward to the rest of the year," he said.

Stich, who won Wimbledon in 1991, was the world number two in

<HEADLINE> Russian-Ukrainian Relations Strengthened: Kozyrev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrei
Kozyrev hailed 1995 as a year of substantial progress made in
strengthening relations with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Yury Sergeyev, director of the press bureau of the Ukrainian
Foreign Ministry, today quoted Kozyrev as saying in a message to
his Ukrainian counterpart, Gennady Udovenko, that the cooperation
between policy-makers of their two countries is expected to
advance further on the basis of the Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev said such a cooperation will also be conducive to
gradually materializing the accords reached between leaders of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev's remarks were considered as an official position of
Russia, Sergeyev told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had said earlier that he
would sign the Ukrainian-Russian Friendship and Partnership for
Peace Cooperation Accord later this month when he meets Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, where the heads of state from
the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to gather for
a summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia initialed the protocol of the agreement last
February. But differences over the division of the Black Sea
Fleet postponed Yeltsin's scheduled visit to Ukraine, during which
the two countries were to officially sign the accord.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that Kozyrev's message came shortly
before U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's official visit to
Ukraine. Perry is to meet Ukrainian and Russian defense ministers
in Kiev on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three military chiefs will discuss the implementation of a
tripartite agreement on the withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces
from Ukraine and the participation of Ukraine and Russia in NATO's
Partnership for Peace program.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms to Employ More Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to employ more
foreigners this year to help in the country's efforts to modernize
its major enterprises, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a government official as saying that an
increasing number of foreign technicians and managers will be
hired by China's state enterprises over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junru, director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts, said
that the central government has decided to launch extensive
restructuring in 1,000 large state firms this year in a move to
establish a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is his bureau's job to facilitate the
reform. The bureau will use more of its annual budget to introduce
managerial talents.
</P>
<P>
But as the bureau is limited by a tight budget, there will not
be a sharp increase in the number of foreign experts hired. There
were 3,000 hired during the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he hoped enterprises will set aside more money for
hiring foreign managerial personnel, which would enhance the
country's overall management. His bureau will strengthen their
recruiting and head-hunting abilities and provide more information
to needy state firms.
</P>
<P>
He said the state budget provides millions of yuan funding the
employment of foreign experts each year, while state enterprises
also contribute to such funds.
</P>
<P>
To help establish a modern enterprise system in Chinese
factories, Ma said, the bureau will seek experienced foreign
managers to work as consultants and factory directors.
</P>
<P>
When thinking of ways to combat profit losses, many people
think it important to import new production lines, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, most firms' deficits have resulted not from outdated
technology, but from poor management," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
When they work with foreign experts, Chinese managers refresh
their knowledge and learn new tricks of the market. Under the
strict supervision of foreign managers, Chinese workers develop a
stronger sense of product quality and work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
While many enterprises will hire advisers, however, only a few
will enlist foreign general managers, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Having a foreigner for a boss is still unacceptable to many
Chinese workers, particularly old workers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China hires foreign managers mainly through
individual recommendation, non-profit organizations and
inter-governmental personnel exchange agreements.
</P>
<P>
But head-hunting companies have also entered into the business
of finding foreign executives for Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are usually paid in line with international
standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria was threatened on
Wednesday with six-year ban from the African Nations' Cup if the
country does not take part in the meet to be held in South Africa
this month.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been given 48 hours to reverse its decision to
withdraw from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"If Nigeria does not participate in the African Nations' Cup
it risks a six-year suspension," Issa Hayatou, president of the
Confederation of African Football (CAF), said.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria has 48 hours to notify CAF of its position."
</P>
<P>
Hayatou told reporters a day after meeting Nigerian officials
that the title-holders would be out of the championship until the
2002 edition and would face fines.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Grobbelaar And Segers Back in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Goalkeepers Bruce Grobbelaar and
Hans Segers, and former Aston Villa striker John Fashanu were
back in court on Wednesday to answer allegations they gave or
accepted money to throw key games.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian businessman, Heng Suan Lim, also appeared with the
players before magistrates in Southampton.
</P>
<P>
After an application by Lim's lawyer Jerome Lynch, a date was
fixed for a committal hearing before Southampton magistrates
sitting in Eastleigh, Hampshire, on March 18. The hearing is
expected to last one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The charges faced by the footballers name Premiership matches
between Newcastle United and Liverpool, and Liverpool and
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar is charged with accepting 40,000 pounds (60,000
U.S. dollars) from Fashanu as a reward for influencing the
result of a Newcastle vs. Liverpool game on November 21, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Southampton goalkeeper allegedly accepted the money from
Fashanu, now retired from the game, in London four days after the
match was played.
</P>
<P>
At the time 38-year-old Grobbelaar, now with Southampton, was
the Liverpool goalkeeper. Newcastle won the game 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Fashanu, 33, is charged with giving the 40,000-pound reward to
Grobbelaar on November 25, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Segers, 34, is accused of accepting 19,000 pounds from Fashanu
as a reward for fixing a match between Liverpool and Wimbledon on

</P>
<P>
Fashanu is charged with giving Wimbledon keeper Segers the cash
for "improperly influencing the outcome" of the game, which
Liverpool won 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar is further charged with accepting 2,000 pounds from
his former business partner Chris Vincent at Southampton on

<HEADLINE> Romania Bid to Improve Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A new foreign trade center to
boost Romania's export industry and help reverse its trade deficit
was opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Foreign Trade Center will provide economic
information for traders and companies about demand, prices,
methods of payment, commercial and trading background.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade has grown significantly over the
past few years and more and more departments, companies and
individuals have been granted export and import rights.
</P>
<P>
However, many small- and medium-sized enterprises are barred
from entering the world market due to lack of timely economic
information. This has contributed to the country's 1.5 billion
U.S. dollar foreign trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Head of the center S. C. Nicolescu told reporters it has a
large database which can provide commercial information for 78,000
consumers. The center will also hold all kinds of exhibitions and
trade fairs, providing necessary service for Romania's foreign
trade.

<HEADLINE> Guegnon Killed as Truck Hits Suspected Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Laurent Gueguen became
the first victim in 1996 Granada-Dakar rally when his Mercedes
lorry crashed and burst into flames after hitting a suspected mine.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened in southern Morocco, some 400 meters off
the main track 157 kilometers into the 474-kilometer fifth leg of
the course from Foum El Hassan to Smara, race authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Gueguen, 26, and married with a young daughter, was competing
for Team Groine. He died trapped in his vehicle after it caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
His two co-drivers Pascal Loudenot and Vincent Baudin were also
injured but course officials described their condition
as 'satisfactory'. They were flown by air ambulance to Europe for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Team head Georges Groine spoke of his profound sadness at the
death of Gueguen but said the team would stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened in an area which remains heavily-mined
following more than a decade of war up until 1989 in the Sahara
between Morocco and the separatist Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
Race authorities would not confirm reports that the racers'
truck had indeed struck a mine, but a French television spoke of
an explosion at the accident site.
</P>
<P>
The Dakar rally has claimed 30 lives since the race began in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Race creator Thierry Sabine himself died in a helicopter crash
in Mali on the fringes of the race in 1986.

<HEADLINE> No Restrictions on Foreign Players in FA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association
announced on Wednesday that FA Cup ties starting Saturday will
carry no restrictions on forign players after the Bosman judgement.
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, FA chief executive Graham Kelly was meeting on
Wednesday with Rick Parry, David Dent and Gordon Taylor - heads of
the Premier League, the Football League and the Professional
Footballers' Association - to discuss the implications of last
month's European Court of Justice ruling.
</P>
<P>
They decided they need more clarification and have agreed to
lobby UEFA further and have a second meeting on January 23.
</P>
<P>
"We still believe that the ruling as regards transfers concerns
only cross-border moves for players out of contract, where no fee
is involved," said FA spokesman Steve Double.
</P>
<P>
After Taylor departed, Kelly, Parry and Dent held a second
encounter, called in part to reconcile differences which broke out
between the organisations during the recent bitter negotiations
over new television contracts.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the FA's initiative to give English clubs
competing in Europe a fighting chance of success, with both the
leagues declaring their willingness to support the move.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping the finer details can be resolved to give clubs
competing in Europe more time to prepare," said Double.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of a mid-winter break, also suggested by managers,
was covered and Double said: "Opinion is building up in support
of that."

OTTAWA, January 3 (xinhua) -- The Glentel Inc., based in
Burnaby, British Columbia, launched cellular services today to
remote areas which represent 85 percent of the Canadian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Starting today, Canadians can make cellular phone calls from
any place in the country.
</P>
<P>
The company uses MSAT satellite to bring such service to the
subscribers. The MSAT (Mobile Satellite Communications) satellite
can relay calls between the switched telephone network and MSAT
telephones anywhere in North America, Hawaii, the Caribbean or
up to 40 kilometers offshore after it was launched last year.
</P>
<P>
The MSAT mobile phone is sized like a briefcase with a
directional antenna. It can transmit a six-watt radio signal, 10
times the strength of a cellular phone signal.
</P>
<P>
AGT Mobility, another Canadian company, will also use same
satellite to start an identical service in the Alberta province
on January 15.
</P>
<P>
Initial services are limited to fixed and mobile voice
telephone and low-speed data transmissions. Fax and dispatch
radio services will be available within the year.
</P>
<P>
The MSAT mobile phone will also bring services to oil, gas,
pipeline and forest product companies as well as 3 million
residents in the remote areas.

<HEADLINE> Maradona: Football Awash with Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer legend
Diego Maradona admitted publicly Wednesday he would always be a
drug addict and claimed the game was increasingly becoming
drug-ridden.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with the weekly magazine Gente, the 35-year-old
said: "I was, am and always will be a drug addict." He added that
cocaine "never left me free to think and act."
</P>
<P>
In his interview, Maradona explained more and more footballers
were turning to drugs, saying: "I am not the only one. Many do
it."
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, four French players have been found
guilty of taking marijuana, while at least two English Premiership
stars have admitted cocaine abuse.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup, is now
fronting a government campaign to stamp out drug abuse. He
admitted taking banned substances for the first time at the age of
22, as he started to make his name in Europe with Barcelona and
then Napoli.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of how his battle to beat the addiction had been a
daily struggle. "You have to say: 'Today I am going to turn round
and fight the drugs hell. It's the only way to escape.'"
</P>
<P>
In an article entitled "how I fought my drugs hell," Maradona
said how he took cocaine for the first time in 1982 and how his
family -- in particular his children -- had suffered "much pain"
as a result.
</P>
<P>
Maradona related how his daughter Gianina once asked him for a
cup of water but he was unable to get up and go to her after
collapsing onto his bed in a cocaine-induced stupor. "I couldn't
get up. My hands were trembling."
</P>
<P>
Gianina again asked him for a drink of water, but he could not
go to her as "the cocaine had put me in a complete haze."
</P>
<P>
Maradona then told his children of his problem, telling them
"Daddy has tried a bad thing which harmed him. This thing is
called drugs." He added he was determined to ensure they would
never suffer the same fate.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, now seeing out the end of his career with Boca
Juniors, said he had accepted a request from President Carlos
Menem to join the anti-drugs campaign "for the children, because I
suffered a lot from drugs - much more than anyone can appreciate.
I am going to explain that suffering to the kids."

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Gains 19-Month High Against Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged to a
19-month high against the Japanese yen today as investors were
seeking higher-yielding currencies.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading Wednesday, the dollar finished at
104.87 yen, up from 103.92 late Tuesday, topping the 1995
dollar-yen high of 104.65.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest dollar level against the yen since June 6,
1994, when it closed at 105.3.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's surge was attributed to investors' favor to
higher-yielding currencies. The one-month deposit rate on yen
holdings is 0.3 percent, compared to the Italian lire, which
yields 10.25 percent and the Spanish peseta, which yields 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The yen is seen as a more stable currency than others and is
more heavily traded because of the need for yen by exporters. But
its yield has fallen because of lower Japanese interest rates
and uncertain future of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the dollar is more attractive as observers
expect an eventual federal budget balance within seven years and a
strong economic performance of the nation in the past year. Strong
U.S. stock and bond markets have also helped the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also strengthened against other currencies. The
dollar against the German mark finished at 1.4453 marks, up from
1.4367 on Tuesday; 1.1648 Swiss francs, up from 1.1590; 4.9296
French francs, up from 4.9034; 1,574 Italian lire, up from 1,568.
The British pound was quoted at 1.5515 U.S. dollars, down from

<HEADLINE> Political Problem in Greece to Be Solved Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The political problem in Greece
arising from the country's prime minister's prolonged illness will
be solved soon, according to a decision taken by the ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).
</P>
<P>
After a six-hour meeting of PASOK's executive bureau this
evening, the party's Central Committee Secretary Costas
Skandalidis said a central committee meeing will be held on
January 20, which will provide a "definitive solution" to the
problem created by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's absence
from the duty due to his hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting said the ruling party's
executive bureau had found that Papandreou's extended absence
created "an acute political problem".
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old leader of PASOK and prime minister of the
country was rushed to intensive care unit on November 20 after
suffering a bout of pneumonia. As the patient showed no signs of
making a quick recovery, a growing number of senior party
officials are calling for the immediate replacement of ailing
premier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's main opposition New Democracy Party
leader Miltiadis Evet threatened to table a censure motion in
parliament next week if the succession issue was not immediately
considered.

<HEADLINE> Government Shutdown an "Unnatural Disaster,"  Clinton Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday called the 19-day partial government shutdown "an
unnatural disaster."
</P>
<P>
"It is long past time to reopen the government," Clinton said
in a statement at the White House briefing room.
</P>
<P>
"Each day this shutdown continues, the consequences grow
worse," Clinton said. "It is not a natural disaster. It is an
unnatural disaster, born of a cynical political strategy."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is part of an explicit strategy by Republicans to
shut the government down to get their way on budget and tax
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget impasse has idled 280,000 federal workers and forced
hundreds of thousands more to labor without pay.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved unanimously Tuesday night a bill to reopen
federal agencies through January 12, but the House voted 206-167
against an effort by Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri to force approval of a measure.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to stop holding the federal workers hostage in this
process," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said the shutdown was not speeding up talks toward a
balanced budget. "This is only casting a shadow over our talks,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited a list of services denied or reduced because of
the shutdown -- Meals on Wheels, small business loans,
environmental cleanup of hazardous waste sites and monitoring of
water safety. He said money is running out for drugs, food and
supplies at Veterans Administration hospitals and there is now a
25,000-case backup for getting government mortgage insurance.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown is "injuring the reputation of the United States
around the world," he said. "People wonder what is going on."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and congressional leaders planned to resume White House
budget talks later today.

<HEADLINE> Two British Soldiers Injured in Sarajevo Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Two British IFOR soldiers were
wounded today when they stumbled on a land mine or an unexploded
shell in Sarajevo, an IFOR spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Lerwill as
saying that the two men were injured near a hotel complex in the
Serb-held suburb of Ilidza. The complex is being converted for use
as headquarters for NATO's Rapid Reaction Corps.
</P>
<P>
Lerwill said the wounds were not life-threatening but the
soldiers were immediately taken to a French military field
hospital in the city for treatment.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first mine explosion casualties of the IFOR
since it began deployment last month in Bosnia to enforce the
fragile peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Two British soldiers were slightly wounded by a land mine last
month in Sanski Most in northwestern Bosnia and an American
soldier was also badly injured by a mine explosion in the northern
village of Bijela on December 30. He was later awarded a Purple
Heart medal for his suffering.
</P>
<P>
Before their arrival, the IFOR troops had undergone an
intensive mine removal training because they were already aware of
some 4 million mines that were planted in Bosnia over the past
three and a half years by the warring parties.

<HEADLINE> Seven Charged With Killing Rewane In Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Seven persons alleged to have
robbed and killed Alfred Rewane at his home in Lagos last October
were today arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrate's court in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Victor Eiremoikhae, said five others were
still at large.
</P>
<P>
The seven arraigned were all accused of robbing Rewane of two
brief cases containing money and other valuable and of killing
him on October 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Rewane was one of the 40 people prosecuted by a former
military regime of Nigeria in the 1980s. He became a leading
critic of the military rule of the country ever since, writing
enormous articles against the military regimes and for civilian
rule.
</P>
<P>
In the magistrate's court, no plea was taken and the
prosecutor applied for an adjournment to enable the police to
seek legal advice from the Lagos state director of public
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The presiding chief magistrate, Mrs Elizabeth Betty Lufadeju,
granted the application and ordered that the seven be remanded at
the police station.
</P>
<P>
The case was adjourned to February 16.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company Launches Cellular Service  to Remote Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 3 (xinhua) -- The Glentel Inc., based in
Burnaby, British Columbia, launched cellular services today to
remote areas which represent 85 percent of the Canadian territory.
</P>
<P>
Starting today, Canadians can make cellular phone call from any
place in the country.
</P>
<P>
The company uses MSAT satellite to bring such service to the
subscribers. The MSAT (Mobile Satellite Communications) satellite
can relay calls between the switched telephone network and MSAT
telephones anywhere in North America, Hawaii, the Caribbean or up
to 40 kimometers offshore after it was launched last year.
</P>
<P>
MSAT mobile phone is sized like a briefcase with a directional
antenna. It can transmit a six-watt radio signal, 10 times the
strength of a cellular phone signal.
</P>
<P>
AGT Mobility, another Canadian company, will also use the same
satellite to start an identical service in the Alberta province on
January 15.
</P>
<P>
Initial services are limited to fixed and mobile voice
telephone and low-speed data transmissions. Fax and dispatch radio
services will be available within the year.
</P>
<P>
The MSAT mobile phone will also bring services to oil, gas,
pipeline and forest product companies as well as 3 million
residents in the remote areas.

<HEADLINE> IFOR General Meets Ilidza Mayor on Muslim Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The IFOR commander and a local
Serb leader in Sarajevo held talks today but failed to solve the
issue of Muslim detainees.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Implementation Force (IFOR) ground troops
in Bosnia General Michael Walker and Mayor of Sarajevo Serb
district Ilidza Nedeljko Prstojevic discussed the problem of a
group of persons held by Bosnian Serbs and freedom of movement,
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Prstojevic as saying that some people had been held
by the Serbs because they had taken prohibited activities and used
illegal routes.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb spokesman Dragan Draganic confirmed that the
group, including a Muslim Security officer and several men in
military uniforms, had been taken into custody for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim government said the Serbs had abducted 16
Bosnians, including Muslims, Croats and Serbs loyal to the Muslim
government, last week when they were travelling through Ilidza of
Serb Sarajevo. It also urged the IFOR to intervene to press the
release of these detainees.
</P>
<P>
Prstojevic declined to say how many have been detained, but he
told reporters that the detainees were currently in the Kula
prison in Sarajevo's Serb district of Lukavica.
</P>
<P>
French officials said three detainees, one woman and two men,
have been released today.
</P>
<P>
IFOR commanders were reportedly unwilling to intervene into the
detention matters on the ground that such small affairs could be
solved by civilian police force.

<HEADLINE> Kwazulu/Natal Cabinet Announces More Steps Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
Kwazulu/Natal Provincial Executive Council today announced a
series of measures aimed at fighting violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed an upsurge in political violence in
Kwazulu/Natal over the past few weeks, highlighted by the
Christmas Day massacre at Shobashobane near Port Shepstone where
20 people were hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Ulundi, Kwazulu/Natal provincial
government Premier Frank Mdlalose said the creation of a
multiparty provincial commission on violence is one of the
measures that would hopefully bring stability to the country's
most volatile area.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Kwazulu/natal is determined to stamp out,
once and for all, political intolerance and violence that goes
with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include the revamping of the cabinet peace
committees to incorporate former Inkatha Freedom Party-aligned
self-protection units and African National Congress-aligned
self-defense units operating in the province.
</P>
<P>
Apart form its own investigations, the multiparty commission
on violence would gather information from various investigations
into recent violence, such as that by a team of detectives
appointed to investigate the Shobashobane massacre.
</P>
<P>
Commission members, expected to be announced within the next
two months, could make recommendations to the Executive Council
regarding further measures to curb violence.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that political violence in Kwazulu/Natal in
the past two years has claimed thousands of lives in the
province.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls For Council's Attention on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked the Security Council to consider
whether to maintain a military presence capable of intervening
rapidly in the event of a sudden deterioration of the situation in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He made the suggestion in the light of "worsening situation" in
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
In a latest letter to the council, which was available here
today, Boutros-Ghali described Burundi as "the scene of a
smouldering civil war".
</P>
<P>
"The situation has continued to deteriorate since May 1995 and
is characterized by daily killings, massacres, torture and
arbitrary detention," said Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"The human rights situation reveals an increasingly marked
genocidal trend of a socio-ethnic nature and perpetrators are
still enjoying impunity," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military presence could be used as a
preventive measure that could help to avoid a repetition of the
tragic events in Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel Hold Second Round of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Israeli
delegations today began the second round of the peace talks at the
Wyr Plantation conference center on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters the
U.S. administration is hopeful that the talks will revitalize
peace efforts between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"That means tackling all of the major substantive issues that
are on the table and, secondly, to figure out a procedural way to
move those discussions forward," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Syrian and Israeli negotiators held the first round of the
three-day talks in six months last week with American mediators in
Maryland and continued informal discussions in Washington over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by what we saw, and we are encouraged that
everybody's coming back tomorrow. And we look forward to further
progress," Department deputy spokesman Glen Davies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Syrian and Israeli officials described the first round as
useful and positive but said no final understandings were reached.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian newspaper said today that "the first round was
exploratory and the second round should end with the adoption of a
specified agenda topped with the issue of Israel's speedy
withdrawal (from the Golan Heights) and ways of programming it."
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiator Itamar Rabinovich, Ambassador to Washington,
said he is convinced that Syria is interested in making peace.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the trip that Secretary of State Warren
Christopher plans to the Middle East next week is likely to be
more significant than today's resumption of the talks.

JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
today called on women in South Africa, especially those in
Kwazulu/Natal Province, to take a firm stand against violence and
act together for peace.

In a statement issued in Durban, the IFP women brigade's

homes and decimated hopes.
</P>
<P>
She noted when IFP members were the victims of violence the
deaths were often reported to have been caused by "clan or
faction fighting", whereas when African National Congress (ANC)
members were victims reference was made to "political murders" or
"shadowy third force activity".
</P>

She urged both the media and the security forces to act in a
fair and even-handed way in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Retail Prices Jump 78.9 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's uncontrolled price surge
ended in a 60-80 percent range in 1995, the state statistics
agency disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) said consumer prices
in December rose by 3.5 percent, sending the year-end rate to 78.9
percent, the lowest year-on-year rate since March 1994.
</P>
<P>
It said wholesale prices went up 4.1 percent in December,
producing a year-end rate of 64.9 percent, the lowest since
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The agency added that the average retail and wholesale year-
end inflation rates were 93.6 percent and 88.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
But economic experts here said December's price statistics did
not reflect the real picture because most prices hikes,
announced immediately after the December 24 general elections were
not included in the statistics, as the DIE only covers price
movements until the 21st of every month.
</P>
<P>
"A wave of price hikes launched on the morning of December 25
will be seen in January's price statistics," one DIE official
said.
</P>
<P>
The government had been reluctant to announce state sector
price hikes prior to polls, but announced massive hikes
immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The DIE said farm prices rose fastest during 1995, by 91.1
percent on average. Energy prices increased 35.7 percent,
manufacturing industry prices 58.9 percent and mining prices 68.8
percent. In sub-sectors, the agency said, meat prices jumped
199.8 percent and tea prices 98.4 percent.
