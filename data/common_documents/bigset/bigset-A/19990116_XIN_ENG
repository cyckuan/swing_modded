<HEADLINE> Sharon Rules Out Releasing Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon ruled out on Friday the possibility of releasing
Palestinian prisoners as a condition for relaunching the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference winding up his three-day visit here,
Sharon said, "I hear people talking from time to time about
political prisoners. While we talk about these prisoners, we are
talking about murderers who kill women, children and the elderly."
</P>
<P>
The members of the Islamic Jihad, the Hamas, and the "murd
erers with blood on their hands" will not be released, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also accused Palestinians of not strictly implementing
the Wye Plantation agreement, but also said that Israel will not
stop the peace process during the coming early general election
in May.
</P>
<P>
"I say there is no reason to stop the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon added that Israel will not give full sovereignty to
Palestinians, although what they will have tomorrow will be "more
than what it is today but less than a state."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon arrived in France on
Wednesday for a working visit to last till Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Finance Ministers Meeting Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from 10 Asian
nations and the 15 European Union member states were meeting
Friday in Frankfurt for talks on currency exchange rate
corridors, the Asian crisis and the situation in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a strong interest in stabilizing currencies," said
Yves Thibault de Silguy, the European Commissioner responsible for
Europe's single currency, the euro, at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to bolster exchange rate stability, Germany and Japan
have called for setting currency exchange rate corridors, a move
that is opposed by the European Central Bank and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"In a world of free capital movements exchange rates cannot be
set by decree," said de Silguy.
</P>
<P>
He said the key to greater currency stability should instead be
reached through cooperation aimed at reducing economic divergence.
</P>
<P>
On the growing Brazil crisis, de Silguy termed the situation
"worrying" but stressed it did not reflect the vulnerability of
the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Europe, he said, was better placed to deal with any spill-over
from Brazil than it would have been just six months ago due to the
euro.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Asia-Europe Finance Minister Meeting (ASEM) will
concentrate on European economic and monetary union issues Friday
and deal with developments in Asia Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Police Warn Terror Attacks in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's police chief
warned of possible fresh terrorist attacks on Friday as police on
both sides of the border investigated a suspected attack on a
security base.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that there is a real threat at the moment from
those calling themselves the Continuity IRA," Sir Ronnie Flanagan,
head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) said, referring to a
breakaway republican guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
"There is a risk of them attempting to carry out a bombing
attack," he told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
"They would intend to carry out acts of a variety of natures.
There is a risk of them attempting to carry out a bomb attack," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were arrested after shots were fired at a police
station in west Belfast on Thursday night and police believe the
attack was the work of the dissident Continuity IRA, which is
opposed to the peace process and is the only terrorist group not
on ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
It came as three powerful anti-aircraft guns were discovered by
police from the Republic on the border, and as Northern Ireland's
chief constable warned that dissident terror groups still posed a
real threat to the peace process
</P>
<P>
A general purpose machine gun and several hundred rounds of
ammunition, including some for Kalashnikov assault rifles, were
also recovered.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident on Thursday night three people were
arrested following further trouble at Drumcree parish church in
Portadown, where a demonstration against a ban on a traditional
marching route is now in its seventh month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Inventory Increase Slightly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Inventories at U.S.
businesses rose a moderate 0.4 percent in November to a seasonally
adjusted 1.09 trillion U.S. dollars in November, the Commerce
Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This increase was in line with business sales, which also rose
0.4 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted 785 billion
dollars, following a 0.3 percent advance the month before.
</P>
<P>
Backlogs of unsold goods were relatively lean heading into
1999. But economists say too big a buildup can signal production
cutbacks as businesses work to reduce backlogs.
</P>
<P>
In November, there were enough goods on shelves and backlogs to
meet demand for 1.39 months at the current sales pace, the same as
in October and September.
</P>
<P>
At retailers, inventories rose 0.8 percent and sales 0.6
percent; at wholesalers, inventories increased 0.6 percent and
sales 0.3 percent, and at manufacturers, inventories edged 0.1
percent higher and sales, 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> No Nigerian General Killed in Freetown Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Defence Ministry said
Friday that no Nigerian general was killed or wounded during the
week-long fighting in Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, Defence Ministry spokesman Lt.
Col. Sam Tella assured the public that all the generals serving in
the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG were well and safe.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers reported Friday that a Nigerian general
had reportedly been killed when the rebels opened fire on a group
of ECOMOG soldiers patrolling the streets of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Tella denied the press reports, but confirmed that two Sierra
Leonean ministers who "strayed into the rebel-held area were
killed".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops backing the
democratically-elected Sierra Leonean government led by President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah has controlled the whole city of capital
Freetown, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a report on the situation in Sierra Leone
presented by the Togolese and Cote d'Ivoire foreign ministers,
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current Chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), continued his
consultations Thursday with the Committee of Six on Sierra Leone
with a view to finding a lasting peace in that country, said a
press release issued in capital Abuja by ECOWAS Secretariat
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in Sierra Leone have agreed to observe a one-week
cease-fire from Monday while rebel field commander Sam Bockarie
said the rebels would resume their offensive if rebel leader Foday
Sankoh was not released by then.
</P>
<P>
A close associate of Sankoh said he expected Sankoh, who had
been imprisoned in a secret location since October following his
conviction for treason and mass murder, to be released in the next
few days possibly in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
However, so far President Kabbah has not yet responded to the
cease-fire proposal made by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation All Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was a 1.6 percentage points up from November's 45.1
percent, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Friday said in its
latest review of the price trends.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 started with inflation at 24 percent in the first
two months.
</P>
<P>
The steady rise began in March at 27.9 percent and increased to
34.3 percent in October, 45.1 in November and 46.6 in December.
</P>
<P>
A major factor was the steady depreciation of the exchange rate
of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major trading currencies, which
began in the second half of 1997 and picked up speed throughout
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The hike in inflation was due to increases in the major
components of the consumer price index: food at 62.9 percent,
drink and tobacco at 66. 6 percent, transport and communication at
62.3 percent," the CSO said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sharif Government Again at Odds with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sherif, who had a hair-breath escape in a judicial
confrontation with the apex court in 1997, seems to be again at
odds with the judiciary over his unfulfilled desire to give "quick
justice" to the people hit by growing urban terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Soon after coming into power in February 1997, Sharif decided
to set up special anti-terrorism court across the country for the
speedy trial and harsh punishment of the terrorists who had
virtually made Pakistan's commercial center of Karachi and Punjab,
the politically most influential province, their hostage.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent edition of weekly "The Friday Times",
some 662 persons have fallen victim to the sectarian violence by
extremist religious outfits in Punjag, the largest province of
this country, in the year 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
Other 800 people lost their lives in political, ethnic and
sectarian violence in Karachi, capital of southern Sindh province,
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's move led to a full-blown and open confrontation with
the then chief justice, Sajjad Ali Shah, who had to leave office
unceremoniously in December 1997 after a revolt from his fellow
judges.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emerged much stronger from the confrontation
as not only Shah was expelled but the antagonistic president,
Farooq Ahmed Leghari, also resigned.
</P>
<P>
As Sharif's burning desire for "quick justice" remained
unfulfilled, he pushed through a controversial piece of
legislation in the National Assembly, lower house of the
parliament, which empowers the government to interpret the Holy
Koran and teachings of Prophet Mohammad as overriding other laws.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's praise for the justice system introduced by the Afghan
Taliban militia in neighboring Afghanistan, which is notorious for
giving harsh penalties to the convicts aroused fears that the
proposed Islamic law would trigger religious intolerance in
Pakistan. The bill was stalled in Senate, upper house of the
parliament, where governments lacks requisite two-third majority.
</P>
<P>
This time around, Prime Minister Sharif set up Military Trial
Courts (MTCs) in Sindh province after dismissing the provincial
government and imposing direct federal rule by rending
opposition-dominated assembly non-functional.
</P>
<P>
Two activists of the ethnic Motehidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), the
government's estranged ally, had already been executed when the
Supreme Court put on hold early this week. The death sentences
were handed down by MTCs.
</P>
<P>
Officials accuse MQM, which represents Urdu-speaking migrants
from India, and its break-away Haqiqi faction of abetting
violence, a charge denied by both factions.
</P>
<P>
Just a few hours after Sharif left for Saudi Arabia for Umra,
an annual Moslem pilgrimage in holy month of Ramadan. the Supreme
Court Tuesday restored the powers of the non-functional Sindh
assembly to legislate.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), led by
former prime minister Benezir Bhutto, filed no-trust motion
against defunct provincial chief minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi, who
belonged to Sharif's Pakistan Moslem League (PML).
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday petitioned the Supreme Court to revoke
its orders stalling the executions ordered by MTCs.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Chaudhry Mohammed Farooq requested the judges
of the apex court to allow prompt executions, saying "the threat
and danger to the integrity of Pakistan can only be averted if the
process (of summery military trials) is allowed to complete its
full stride".
</P>
<P>
"We believe that rushing the judicial process (through military
courts) is as undesirable as denying it for years," said "The
Frontier Post", the major English daily, in an editorial on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It appears as though the prime minister does not care much for
the dignity of the judiciary, the institution he thinks he has
tamed to a great degree. We tend to think differently: the
judiciary is now fully aware that it has to maintain a balance not
only among the state institutions but also between what is
desirable and what is revolting," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP)
Asma Jehangir in her recent article stated: "The situation in
Karachi needs delicate hands to resolve on the one hand the
political anarchy and on the other senseless violence which has
been the outcome of misgovernance and blunders."
</P>
<P>
"A clampdown without an end in sight never yields any results.
It only hardens positions and gives rise to more anarchy," she
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly five million Zimbabwean
people countrywide are receiving food assistance from the
government, Acting Secretary of Public Service, Labor and Social
Welfare Samuel Mhiribidi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mhiribidi told the Zimbabwean News Agency Ziana that a total of
4,910,162 people countrywide were currently receiving food aid
under the free food and grain loan schemes.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had information that there are
sufficient grain reserves in the country to feed the people of
12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government, he said, is aware of the transport
problems to ferry maize to the people who are receiving food aid.
</P>
<P>
"The government has a tender with the Transport Operators
Association who contracts private contractors throughout the
country and there maybe problems here and there but not of serious
nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
A transport unit was established through the Ministry of
Transport and Energy to deal with the transport problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most Zimbabweans did not reap enough yields in the past season
due to the late rains and water logging in some areas.

<HEADLINE> Ozawa's Remarks on "Areas Surrounding Japan" Slammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua news agency
Friday published a commentary criticizing Japan's Liberal Party
leader Ichiro Ozawa's claim that the scope of the revised
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines includes Russia, the
Korean Peninsula and China's Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titled "Keeping Politically Alert," pointed
out that Ozawa's remarks ostensibly ignore the sovereignty of
other nations and the feelings of other peoples, and trigger
resentment from other peoples concerned.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of Japanese politicians toward neighboring
countries will result in distrust from other nations and fail to
achieve good-neighborly ties, it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ozawa's claim came at a time when his party formed a
coalition government with the Liberal Democratic Party, causing
wide concerns over the direction Japan will follow if such a
politician takes part in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, as the press said, will pave the way for the
approval next week of relevant bills on the revised Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ozawa told reporters that it is ridiculous not to
regard "areas surrounding Japan" as a geographical concept.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, the Korean Peninsula and China certainly should be
included in the areas surrounding Japan," Ozawa said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's vague explanation about the areas
surrounding Japan" have instead heightened other countries'
doubts over the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is beneficial in the long run to specify the scope of the
concept, despite protests Japan may receive from concerned
countries, Ozawa alleged.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Business Community Welcomes IMF Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The approval of a bailout
package by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been widely
welcomed by Pakistan's business community, calling it a vote of
confidence" in the government's efforts to revive economy.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Nooriabad Industrial Estate Association Hussain
Dadabhoy said that the approval of a loan package of 1.56 billion
U.S. dollars on Thursday indicates the world's confidence in
Pakistan's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
"I think this endorsement can rightly be termed as 'world
vote' for the country's policies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The President of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(KCCI), Abdullah Ismail, however, expressed his hope that the
availability of the much awaited loan would ease the foreign
exchange problem, and ultimately be helpful in financing the
imports badly needed for the economic revival.
</P>
<P>
The sanction imposed on Pakistan by some western countries in
the wake of its nuclear tests in May last year has deteriorated
the economic situation in this South Asian nation which had
already been obsessed by problems like inflation, trade deficit,
dwindling foreign exchange reserves and social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Former KCCI president Mohammad Hanif Janoo believed that with
the approval of 1.56 billion dollar package, Pakistan "is out of
economic crisis and the fear of default is now over".
</P>
<P>
This will also end dollarization craze which had ruined the
Pakistani currency of rupee, he added.
</P>
<P>
The package will improve trading at Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) by at least 150 points, said Osama Bin Shoaib, analyst at
First ABN-AMRO Securities.
</P>
<P>
If the issue between the government and the independent power
producers over the power rates is also resolved with the package
and debt rescheduling is approved, the KSE 100-Index will response
positively, boosting trading next month, he said.

<HEADLINE> Varsity Urged to Help Address Problems in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged Makerere University to develop and expand
programs to address the country's current problems.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is also the Chancellor of the university,
made the call at the 35th congregation of Makerere University for
the confirmation of degrees and award of diplomas held at Freedom
Square on the main campus Friday, a press release from the
President's Office said in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that Uganda needs well-trained indigenous
personnel to cater for the needs of the society, adding that the
university must help the country reduce unemployment and
under-employment of graduates by equipping them with employable
skills or skills that can help them become self-employed.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the university to produce people prepared to rub
 shoulders with peasants because farmers in Uganda look forward to
 university graduates for direction and guidance on how to
modernize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Students were urged to learn the purpose of their academic
exertions and to be conscious that the more education they acquire
the more they are expected to contribute to society.
</P>
<P>
The government values education as one of the most fundamental
necessities of life and places high priority on education at all
levels, allaying fears that the authorities would focus on primary
education at the expense of higher education.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the university for extricating itself from sole
reliance on government funding to gain some degree of
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, nearly 4,000 students were graduated, 1,344 of
whom were female, representing about 35 percent of the total
number of this year' s graduates.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Challenger Drops Out of Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) - A challenger to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the leadership of the ruling Likud
Party announced on Friday he had decided to drop out of the
race, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of the powerful Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee of Israeli Knesset (parliament), said he quitted
because there was another candidate more suitable to compete with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Arens, a former political sponsor of Netanyahu, has a
better chance to defeat Netanyahu, said Landau.
</P>
<P>
The two men have been criticizing Netanyahu's leadership,
saying it was divisive and destructive to the Likud Party. They

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.S. Plan Means No Change in Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) --The United States
proposed on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that
Iraq be allowed to sell as much oil as it wants to purchase food
and medicine for its people, who have been under U.N. sanctions
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also includes streamlining approvals for Iraqi
contracts for food and medicine, allowing Iraq to borrow money for
food and medicine from an escrow account and asking U.N. agencies
to expand programs for small children.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposals are an apparent reaction to a plan presented
by France to the Council on Wednesday, calling for lifting of the
oil embargo against Iraq and establishing a "Renewed Control
Commission" to replace the United Nations Special Commission
(USCOM) which has been in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass massacre since 1991.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that the move came under pressure from
members of the United Nations Security Council and the
international society to find ways to alleviate the suffering of
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who seeks to overthrow Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein by maintaining severe sanctions against the
country, has been strongly criticized by Council members, namely
China, Russia, France and Brazil and others. These members
welcomed and supported France's proposal to lift the oil embargo
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also welcomed the French
plan, saying that it is a concrete and important step in the
direction of breaking the Council's impasse on Iraq and resuming
the work of disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy on Iraq, a strategy of containment backed by
force, has also been under fire by the Arab nations, who say the
policy must be reshaped to better reflect concerns of the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Arab nations' reactions on the U.S.-led military strikes
against Iraq last month differed from each other, but they share
this common view, that is something has to be done to ease the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S said nothing about the disarmament in Iraq in its
proposal, but it has made it clear that Iraq has not been disarmed
in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions, and UNSCOM must go
back to Iraq to resume its work.
</P>
<P>
Signs have shown that UNSCOM is almost dead. After the U.S.-led
military strikes, Iraq has further determined that it will never
deal with UNSCOM any longer. Permanent members of the Security
Council China, Russia and France have expressed distrust on UNSCOM
and called for the replacement of it.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. regards UNSCOM as the most effective instrument to
disarm Iraq and the only institution which could help it realize
its strategy in the region. In order to save UNSCOM and let it
return to Iraq, the U.S. is forced to make "adjustment" in its
policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In practice, however, the U.S. proposal preserves the status
quo. Iraq now is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over every six months to buy food, medicine and other supplies
under a tightly controlled program to help ease the impact of
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But under this "oil-for-food" plan, Iraq is only able to sell
about 3 billion dollars worth of oil in that time frame because of
its dilapidated oil industry and low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest U.N. report, Iraq cannot raise its oil
export level until March 2000 because of the state of its
pipelines and oil fields.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal failed to receive any warm welcome from
members of the Security Council which has been considering all the
proposals on the table. There of course will be a long debate at
the Security Council before any consensus can be reached.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Speaker Urges to Stop Violence Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the House of
Federation of Ethiopia Almaz Meko Friday urged parents, teachers
and the public at large to refrain from using corporal punishment
as a method of disciplining children.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day seminar organized by the Ethiopian
Psychologists' Association, Speaker Almaz said the practice of
corporal punishment is rampant in the cultures of most
nationalities of Ethiopia as a traditional society .
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted the speaker as saying that
"several years of wars, ethnic conflicts, poverty and illiteracy
have contributed a lot toward the maltreatment of children in the
country."
</P>
<P>
She said the new basic laws of Ethiopia prohibit violent
behaviors against children, adding that "despite the existence of
laws and prohibitions, physical violence against children still
exists in our society."
</P>
<P>
The speaker called upon governmental and non-governmental
organizations as well as the general public to join hands toward
ensuring children rights in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions, explaining, negotiation, tolerance, peaceful
arguments and other techniques have to be developed instead of
corporal punishment," she added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Habtamu Wondimu, President of the
Ethiopian Psychologists' Association, said that apart from
parents, teachers also use corporal punishment to discipline their
pupils.
</P>
<P>
Beating and bodily injuries are commonly reported child abuse
cases in most urban centers and capital Addis Ababa, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Growth Slows Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
said on Friday that industrial production increased 0.2 percent in
December from the month before and it rose only 3.7 percent for
the year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year's increase was the slowest rate in five years since a
3.5 percent gain in 1993 and followed a robust 6 percent advance
in 1997. This reflected economic turmoil abroad.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers were hard hit by loss of export sales to
Asian nations and other countries affected by the world economic
slump that began in Thailand in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
However, there were some signs of recovery during the final
three months of the year. Industrial production advanced at a 3.2
percent annual rate after a gain at a meager 0.9 percent rate in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The rise occurred even though output at utilities declined at a
12.5 percent annual rate during the quarter, the result of
unusually mild weather. Just at factories, the production pace
picked up from 0.4 percent in the third quarter to 5.1 percent in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Some of the acceleration in manufacturing reflected a rebound
at auto manufacturing plants following strikes that idled General
Motors in June and July. Nevertheless, the output of other
manufacturing industries grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the fourth
quarter after little change in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, despite output growth slowing down, industrial
companies continued to expand their capacity to produce at a brisk
rate. It increased 5 percent,the third consecutive year at this
rate. Some industries,such as manufacturers of computers and
office equipment, output grew 54.1 percent in the fourth quarter
of 1998 from the same period of 1997.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Amid heightened tensions in
the northern no-fly zone in Iraq, the United States is sending a
Patriot missile battery to Turkey at the request of the Turkish
government, U.S. defense officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Specialists from U.S. European Command in Germany were now at
Incirlik, Turkey, where there is a U.S. Air Force base for
warplanes to conduct monitoring mission over the northern no-fly
zone, the U.S. officials said. They are making final arrangements
for the deployment of the Patriot missile battery.
</P>
<P>
A formal deployment order is expected to be signed soon, one of
the officials said. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who will sign
the order, is en route to Washington from South Korea on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Four clashes between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air defense radar
sites in the northern no-fly zone this week, but no incident has
occurred on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, as all the U.S warplanes fly their mission from
Turkey's air force base of Incirlik, The Turkish government has
feared to be retaliated by Iraq's Scud missiles, which were used
during the Gulf War in 1991 when Iraq used to attack Israel's
target.
</P>
<P>
Patriots, operated by U.S. Army crews, originally were designed
to shoot down aircraft, but they have been modified for use
against shorter-range missiles. During the Gulf War, Israel used
the Patriots to counter-attacked Iraqi Scuds.
</P>
<P>
Patriot batteries already are deployed in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Reshuffles Advisory Board on Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has appointed 11 new members to his Advisory Board on
Disarmament Matters, which is the U.N. "think-tank" on
international disarmament issues, U.N. officials announced on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The board is composed of eminent persons appointed by the U.N.
Secretary-General in their individual capacities, on the basis of
their expertise in the field of disarmament and international
security and taking into account equitable geographical
representation.
</P>
<P>
Nine members retained their posts on the board, bringing the
total number to 20, five of whom are women, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in its 20-year history, a woman, Therese
Delpech, director for Strategic Affairs of the Atomic Energy
Commission in Paris, will preside over the board at its two
sessions in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, director-general of the Department of Arms Control
and Disarmament of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is

material for weapons purposes, and the status of tactical, or
substrategic, nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The board was set up by the Final Document of the first special

<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern is to start an official visit to Lebanon on Sunday
on bilateral ties and peace process in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, the Irish prime minister will meet
with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and his Lebanese counterpart
Salim Hoss to discuss ways of reactivating the peace talks between
Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the Israeli-Syrian track and the
Israeli-Lebanese track have suspended since the hardline Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been in control of the Golan Heights which it
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. It also set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, to be accompanied by the European Union's Mideast envoy
Miguel Moratinos, will also visit south Lebanon to inspect
Ireland's 500-strong troops stationed there along with the
U.N. peace forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Forces in South Lebanon was set up in March,
1978 after Israel's first invasion to the country.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, nearly 40 Irish soldiers died in
conflicts between Israeli occupying forces and Lebanese
guerrillas who are trying to oust Israelis out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Offensives to Be Launched Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Anti-Taliban commanders in
eastern provinces of Afghanistan have decided to coincide their
offensives against the Taliban with advances from the north after
the religious festival of Muslims, Eid-ul-Fitr.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a summit of the former mujahideen
(holy fighters) commanders, held somewhere in eastern Kunar
province last week, Afghan sources based in Peshawar, capital of
Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by as many as 40 commanders from the
three provinces in eastern Afghanistan. Unconfirmed reports said
former governor of Nangrahar province of Afghanistan Haji Abdul
Qadeer also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to launch offensives against the Taliban
militia in eastern provinces simultaneously with the attacks by
forces loyal to Comander Ahmad Shah Masud from the north of the
Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Masud is reportedly planning to go ahead with a major offensive
against the Taliban troops soon after the forthcoming Eid-ul-Fitr,
celebrated at the end of fasting month of Ramazan.
</P>
<P>
It was further learnt that the Kunar summit decided to arrange
1500 troops each for Kunar and Nangrahar and another 750 for
Lagnman province. Several former mujahideen commanders, including
Haji Qadeer are to lead the anti-Taliban offensives in the eastern
provinces.

NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street
rebounded Friday morning after Brazil let its currency fall freely
against the U.S. dollar which boosted investors' confidence in the
avoidance of Latin American economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
At 12:10 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average soared
144.18 to 9265.11 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
was up 46.15 to 2322.97. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also rose.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's decision to allow the real float will keep its U.S.
dollar reserve at the current level, which in turn will help the
government to make timely payments on international borrowing.
</P>
<P>
To get International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s 41.5 billion dollar
bailout package fully operational, Brazil is requested to meet the
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's new move sent its Bovespa stock index up some 27
percent this morning and helped lift stock markets in Europe and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street has seen the year's first downturn wave this
week with the Dow plunging a total of 522 points since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the real's devaluation on Wednesday, the Dow fell 125
points on Wednesday and 228 points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Investors' panic selling came from their fears about the
contagion effect on other economies of Latin America.

<HEADLINE> WFP Calls for Truce in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) has appealed to all warring parties in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, to observe an immediate
ceasefire to allow aid agencies to assist hundreds of thousands of
civilians trapped in their homes for more than a week with little
or no food or water, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian workers on Friday traveled from Conakry,
Guinea, to Sierra Leone by road, with medicine and other items,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all parties to the conflict to stop hostilities and
enable us to deliver desperately needed food supplies to thousands
of Freetown residents on the brink of starvation," said Paul Ares,
WFP Regional Manager for coastal West Africa, in Abidjan, capital
of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
"People at risk cannot be expected to survive much longer under
such terrible duress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the fighting in Freetown 10 days ago, most
residents have been confined to their homes because of gunfire and
a de facto 24-hour curfew, with no opportunity to stock up on food
and water.
</P>
<P>
Prices of basic food commodities in Freetown have also
escalated rapidly since the outbreak of hostilities, U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has effectively closed the highway linking
Freetown with the rest of Sierra Leone, cutting off the capital
form its major source of food supplies, the country's interior.
Commercial imports were also interrupted by the conflicts, and
shops and markets remain closed.

historical moments alike will have to take a different route to
climb up the Butte du Lion to recall the battle scenes that
triggered the downfall of Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
Construction experts and monument repairers worked overnight to
present on Friday an urgent surgery plan for the monument
dedicated to the 1815 battle of Waterloo to the south of the
Belgian capital city.
</P>
<P>
Five months of intensive work and upwards of 50 million Belgian
francs (1.47 million U.S. dollars) will be contributed to the
repair of the 72-year-old monument commemorating the victory of
the Allies against the French army commanded by Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
The surface soil on the northern slope of the 45-meter-high
earth mount, that serves as the pedestal to a cast-iron lion
monument atop, slid downward over the past 48 hours, leaving a
35-meter-long rupture midway up the hill. The deepest point in
the fissure measured one meter.
</P>
<P>
The monument, known as Butte du Lion in French and Mount of the
Lion in English, will re-open to tourists before next month after
a temporary flight of stairs has been put into place on the
eastern slope, according to Andre Flahaut, chief of the repairing
team.
</P>
<P>
Repair works are not new to the mount. In the winter season
between 1994 and 1995, the mount was consolidated in the same spot
which had been battered by German cannons during the Second World
War. The last repair cost 52 million francs.
</P>
<P>
Wet and chilly weather this winter was believed to have caused
the new damage to the mount.
</P>
<P>
Building of the monument started in the summer of 1921 after
Napoleon had died and took five years to complete. Now an average
of 500,000 tourists climb the mount each year to see the monument
of a lion cast by the melted cannons of the French army. Annual
tourist revenue is around 35 million francs.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes to Relace UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday
proposed to lift the oil embargo against Iraq and establish a new
arms control body to replace the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a paper submitted to the United Nations Security Council
this morning, Russia suggested UNSCOM be replaced by a new
"Monitoring Center" in New York with an office in Iraq that would
be controlled directly by a new committee of all Council members,
thus making it under tighter supervision than UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force by the United States and Britain against Iraq
resulted in actual termination of UNSCOM activities. In order to
resume an international monitoring of the Iraqi proscribed
military programs and prevent the reconstruction by Iraq of its
weapons of mass destruction, it is necessary to establish a new
body adequate to the new situation," Russia said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's proposal came after France and the United States
unveiled their plans in the past two days.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin has set guidelines for fighting organized crime in
Russia, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at an enlarged session of the Interior Ministry
collegiate, Stepashin called for putting the data collected on
organized crime leaders and gangsters to work, overhauling the
banking system, and preventing money from flowing abroad through
bank channels.
</P>
<P>
According to Stepashin, among the anti-criminal actions the
fight against illegal alcohol trafficking is of special
importance, as is need to curb crime in the most lucrative
economic branches and expose corruption on all levels, including
certain top government officials.
</P>
<P>
The national crime record was described as appalling at
Friday's session, said the Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals have become tougher, more aggressive in action,
increasingly resistant to law enforcement agencies, and are even
ready to kill policemen," says a message addressed the collegiate
to rank and file interior service personnel.
</P>
<P>
It said that 1999 should become a turning point in halting
crime.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Resume Presenting Case Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors of the U.S.
House of Representatives Friday resumed presenting their case
against President Bill Clinton in the impeachment trial in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
A team of 13 House prosecutors will explain how the mountain of
evidence collected in the past year against Clinton proves he
violated the law.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged under two articles of impeachment, both related to his
attempts to conceal his extramarital affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. One article charges the president
with perjury before a federal grand jury, the second with
obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors opened their arguments on Thursday that Clinton
should be removed from office for what he has done in the Lewinsky
case.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House said that the House case is based on
political revenge, not law and that everything the prosecutors
presented has been presented before.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. History to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. It takes a two-thirds
vote in the Senate to remove the president from office, meaning a
dozen Democrats would have to join the 55 Republicans to convict
him.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews Croatia-Yugoslavia Observer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution to renew
the mandate of a tiny U.N. observer mission that monitors the
demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, disputed between
Croatia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) until July
15, 1999, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member council welcomed an improvement in cooperation by
Croatia and Yugoslavia with the U.N. military observers and a
decrease in the number of serious incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called on the parties to cease all
violations of the demilitarized regime in the U.N.-designated
zones and to reduce tensions.
</P>
<P>
The council asked the two parties to fully cooperate with the
U.N. military observers and ensure their safety and unrestricted
freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
The council also asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan to consider
reducing the number of observers from 28 to 22.
</P>
<P>
Most of the peninsula, south of Dubrovnik on the Adriatic,
is controlled by Croatia but it borders Yugoslavia's republic
of Montenegro and the main deep water port for its navy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed, in a 1996 accord on normalizing
relations, to settle their dispute over Prevlaka through
negotiations but have made no substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
The council asked Annan to submit a report by April 15 on
the progress of negotiations and on possible ways of
facilitating a negotiated settlement.

<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) - Finance ministers of Germany and
Japan issued a joint call Friday for stricter control of world
banks and possible imposition of exchange rate corridors among
major currencies at meeting in Frankfurt of 25 finance ministers
from Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"International monetary and financial systems need to be
improved in order to achieve a sound development of the world
economy," said German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine and his
Japanese counterpart, Kiichi Miyazawa, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Germany want an exchange rate regime for emerging
countries and tougher supervision and rules for investing in or
lending to hedge funds and enhanced disclosure or reporting
requirements for such funds, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Regulatory bodies and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the World Bank and national regulators should hold regular talks
on issues concerning supervision, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine and Miyazawa renewed calls for moving toward
exchange rate corridors. The statement called for "examining the
possibility of creating an exchange rate regime among major
currencies which would reduce excessive volatility..."
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day meeting are finance ministers from 10
Asian nations and the 15 European Union member states. Talks were
due to focus on the exchange rate corridor debate, the Asian
crisis and the situation in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Population Growth Rate in Tanzania Too High: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye said Friday that Tanzania's population growth
rate is too high to guarantee sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Opening a national population and development forum, Sumaye
said the country's population growth rate stands at 2.8 percent,
compared with gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate at
approximately three to four percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
"In order to be able to cater for such a population growth rate
we need an economic growth rate of between 8 and 10 percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with the demographic challenges and achieving a
balance between economic growth and population size is the main
issue for us as a nation as we approach the next millenium," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye did not say what measures will be taken to curb the
population growth. Instead, he called on people to work hard to
promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Sally Fegan-Wyles, resident coordinator of U.N. System in
Tanzania, said the current growth rate of 2.8 percent means that
the country's present population of some 30 million will double in
25 years.
</P>
<P>
"While we can hope that economic growth will accelerate,
population growth must also decline, to give Tanzania a chance to
improve the quality of services for their people," she told the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the meeting is to review implementation
of the Program of Action adopted by the International Conference
on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994. The
meeting is also a preparatory forum for the Hague Forum planned to
convene next month.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said Tanzania has done a lot toward implementing ICPD
resolutions. For example, on gender equality and empowerment of
women, the government has taken measures to improve girls'
universal access to education. Meanwhile, women are guaranteed 15
percent representation for parliamentary seats and 25 percent for
the local government council's seats.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government in collaboration with
non-government organizations (NGOs), has increased the number of
service delivery points in the rural areas where the majority of
the people are living.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, the prime minister acknowledged that
there still exist customary laws and practices which discriminate
women on issues of property rights and inheritance. At the same
time, he said funds allocated to reproductive health programs have
been insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Charles Mutalemwa, acting permanent secretary in the Planning
Commission, told a press conference at the end of the meeting that
the Tanzanian government will further carry out family planning
education among people, especially women.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has tightened control over radical groups like People
Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) by implementing the Judicial
Amendment Act.
</P>
<P>
Three sections of the act came into effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, certain acts relating to the instruction or
training in military, paramilitary or similar operations will be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
The use or manufacturing of weapons, ammunition and explosive
devices will also be banned.
</P>
<P>
Contravention of the act could lead to an imprisonment of up to
five years and/or a hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
Exemptions form the act included the South African National
Defense Force, the South African Police Service, the Department of
Correctional Services, traffic and security officers, and
employees involved in armaments development and production at arms
manufacturer Denel.
</P>
<P>
A fourth section of the act, dealing with applications for
exemptions, will come into effect on April 1, the Justice
Department said.
</P>
<P>
It is noticed that the new measures were imposed after the
increase of urban terrorism in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb exploded at Cape Town's premier tourist attraction,
the waterfront, on New Year's Day. Later in the month, one member
of Pagad died after being shot by police during illegal
demonstrations against British Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit.

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Program Fails to Meet its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh said on Friday the oil-for-food program failed to
alleviate the humanitarian crisis faced by the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency INA, Saleh said the
oil-for-food deal which had been in place since the beginning of
1997 only met 20 percent of the Iraqi people's needs.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that so far only 18 percent of the
contracted food and medicine under the fourth phase of the
oil-for-food deal had arrived in Iraq, though the fourth phase
had expired on November 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
This program had become "first of all, the sources of funds for
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and other U.N. agencies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a U.S. proposal to allow Iraq to sell as much
oil as it wants to purchase food and medicine for its people, Saleh
said the U.S. attempted to make this proposal an alternative to
the lifting of sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had been blocking Iraq from using its
assets frozen in foreign countries since 1990 to buy food and
medicine for its suffering people. Instead, they agreed to use
these assets to pay for UNSCOM's funds, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would never accept to turn its people into refugees under
the U.S.-British scheme, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was one of the richest countries in the world before the
U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 and it had often made
various donations to other countries and humanitarian agencies to
fulfill its obligations, said the Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would accept nothing but the lifting of sanctions so that
Iraq could meet the needs of its people and fulfill its obligations
in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. resolutions, the sanctions can not be
lifted unless UNSCOM, which is in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, verifies that it is free of these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December U.S.-British bombardment on Iraq, Iraq
declared that it would not allow UNSCOM to return.
</P>
<P>
France proposed to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday to
lift the oil embargo against Iraq and establish a "Renewed
Control Commission " to replace UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the U.S. proposed on Thursday to the
Security Council to allow Iraq to sell as much oil as it wants to
and to streamline approval procedures for Iraqi contracts for food
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. proposal failed to receive any warm welcome
from members of the Security Council which has been considering
all the proposals on the table.

<HEADLINE> Release of U.S. Embassy Bombing Suspects Demanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Tanzanian defense
advocates in the U.S. embassy bombing case have requested the
Kisutu Resident Magistrate' s Court in Dar es Salaam to acquit the
suspects as the prosecution side has failed to complete
investigations in time.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Mwengera, one of the defense advocates in the case, told
Principal Resident Magistrate, Projestus Lugazia, Friday that the
accused persons should be acquitted in accordance with section 225
(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA) of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Mwengera said investigations into the case have conducted since
the arrest of the suspects in early August last year but up to now
it has yet completed.
</P>
<P>
Eleven people were killed and more than 70 others were injured
in the bombing of the United States embassy in Dar es Salaam on
August 7 last year.
</P>
<P>
The suspects in the case are Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, an
Egyptian national, and Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian, who are
charged with murdering 11 persons.
</P>
<P>
"According to this section, the prosecution side is supposed to
complete the investigations of the case within 60 days and not
otherwise," Mwengera said.
</P>
<P>
Twalib Fauz, another defense advocate, said all subordinate
courts are not allowed to try murder cases but they can hear the
proceedings, adding that according to section 225, the Kisutu
court has the power to discharge the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Fauz said the investigations conducted at this moment are
illegal and unfair to the accused persons.
</P>
<P>
The advocates also requested the court to force the prosecution
side to return some properties of the accused which were taken
away by the police.
</P>
<P>
However, Leonard Mashaka, Assistant Commissioner of police,
objected to all requests made by the defense side, saying his side
requires more time to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Mashaka said most of important issues concerning the case have
been completed but the prosecution is currently awaiting some
crucial reports of the United States experts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the police have already handed back the
properties to the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The case will be mentioned again on January 29.

BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here on Friday that it had launched a project of four million
euros to support the European Union (EU) Officers Retraining
Program in Russia over the next two years.

The commission said training in job skills, including
management, banking, ecology, insurance, investment, logistics and
production, will be provided by a total of 600 teachers in a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prosecutor: Clinton Intentionally Seeks to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutor Bill
McCollum told senators in President Bill Clinton's impeachment
trial Friday that former White House intern Monica Lewinsky's
testimony establishes that Clinton "knowingly, intentionally"
sought to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
"If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot
believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers,"
McCollum said in a summary of evidence on behalf of the 13 House
prosecutors on the second day of their presentation.
</P>
<P>
McCollum, a Republican lawmaker, encouraged the senators to
view the case against Clinton as "one big obstruction" in which
the president "thought his scheme out well" in an effort to
conceal his affair with Lewinsky from the court overseeing the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"If you believe the sworn testimony of Monica Lewinsky, if you
believe her testimony that's in the record -- and she's very
credible -- the president knowingly, intentionally and willfully
set out on a course of conduct in December 1997 to lie to the
Jones court, to hide his relationship and to encourage others to
lie and hide evidence," McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in
two articles of impeachment approved on December 19 last year by
the House along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
Senators returned to the Capitol Friday for more evidence and
arguments from House prosecutors, still mostly divided along party
lines on the crucial issues of calling trial witnesses and whether
Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Clinton wouldn't come
to testify, and he called Republican suggestions that Clinton do
so "a non-issue."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president, who left
Washington Friday for a trip to New York, got a 10-15 minute
"rundown" from his lawyers Thursday night on developments in the
trial's first day.
</P>
<P>
"There's no testimony that proves the president committed
perjury. There's no testimony that proves the president obstructed
justice. In fact there is direct testimony to the contrary,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. It takes a two-thirds
vote in the Senate to remove the president from office, meaning a
dozen Democrats would have to join the 55 Republicans to convict

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Committee on
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women will convene the
first of its two annual sessions here from January 19 to February
5, U.N. officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, the only U.N. human rights treaty-monitoring
body concerned exclusively with women, is expected to consider
such issues as the national development and modernization
processes that fail to address the needs of women and the
detrimental effects of customary practices, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Comprised of 23 experts serving in their individual capacities,
the committee monitors the implementation of the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
The Convention, often referred to as an international bill of
rights for women, sets up an agenda for national action to end
discrimination. It was adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 and
entered into force in 1981.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming session, the committee will evaluate
progress made by seven parties to the treaty and formulate general
recommendations on eliminating gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Countries that have ratified or acceded to the Convention are
legally bound to put its provisions into effect. They are also
committed to submitting national reports on measures taken to
comply with their treaty obligations. An initial report is
required within one year of accession, and periodic reports at
least every four years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Gender Issues
and the Advancement of Women, Angela King, is scheduled to open
the session on January 19.

Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the rebels while
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent their troops to DRC
to support Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Turnaround Seen at Cyprus Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The total volume of
transactions in Cyprus Stock Market for this week shot up to 22.9
million pounds (45.8 million dollars, 5 trading sessions) from 4.9
million pounds (9.8 million dollars) for previous week (3 trading
sessions).
</P>
<P>
The daily average volume of transactions for this week reached
4.6 milion pounds (9.2 million dollars), compared to 1.7 million
pounds (3.4 million dollars) the week before.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no signs during the first 4 trading
sessions of the new year that the stock market could embark on a
spectacular run, a weekly market review said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said until 8th January, daily price
deviations were mostly marginal, and the CISCO All-Share index
closed at 455.6 points, with small gains of 0.4 percent since
year end. The daily volume levels were at their normal levels of
about 1.7 million Cyprus pounds (3.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless on January 11, the market entered into a bull run
with prices galloping and investment activity reaching
unprecedented levels in a delirium of exceeding demand.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the market effected a leap of 16.9 points or
3.7 percent, with volume of transactions reaching 5.9 million
pounds (11.8 million dollars), the highest daily level in the
last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The complete market turnaround was triggered by the sudden
announcement over the weekend, by Cyprus Popular Bank that it
signed an agreement with Shacolas for buying Paneuropean, Philiki
and Interamerican insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share index closed on January 14, 1999 at 480.8
points, achieving gains of 5.1 percent for the week. The capital
appreciation of the market since year-end (8 trading sessions) is
estimated at 5.9 percent.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton met
with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley Friday, expressing
his appreciation for her country's support for the U.S. policy in
Iraq and other aspects, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
During 15 minutes of meeting at the State Department, where the
president had gone to deliver a speech, Clinton thanked Shipley's
"strong statement of support for U.S. policy toward Iraq including
the mandate of UNSCOM," White House spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Shipley for her government's decision to lease
28 F-16 warplanes originally destined for Pakistan, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, bought to bolster Pakistan's defenses against
long-time enemy India, were denied to Pakistan by the U.S.
Pressler Amendment which barred military sales to countries with
nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Shipley that he and his wife Hillary looked
forward to traveling to New Zealand next September for the annual
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
</P>
<P>
"The president also commended New Zealand's commitment to free
trade and privatization and talked about the need to further
advance APEC's goal of trade and investment liberatization," Leavy
said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Keep Unemployment Under Seven Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a goal of keeping
unemployment under seven percent this year, Vietnam's English
daily "Vietnam News" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs
(MOLISA) has planned to create 1.2 million new jobs this year,
keeping unemployment under seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures were announced during a two-day conference to
review operations in 1998 and identify the tasks for this year.
The conference was hosted in Ho Chi Minh city by Vietnam's MOLISA
and ended on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Other key goals of this year's program include exporting from
20,000 to 25,000 workers and specialists and increasing the
portion of trained labor to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to reduce the number of poor
households in the nation to 13-14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, "Vietnam News" said, Vietnam's urban unemployment
rate rose to 6.85 percent from 6.01 percent in 1997, though 1.3
million new jobs were created. More than 12,200 people were sent
to work abroad.
</P>
<P>
The National Fund for Job Creation granted loans of almost 500
billion Vietnamese dong (about 36 million U.S. dollars) to 13,600
projects last year. Meanwhile, 125 job introduction service
centers provided consultations and vocational training for 495,000
people and introduced jobs to another 200,000.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam's MOLISA admitted that labor safety was not
given proper attention. About 250 labor accidents occurred last
year killing more than 300 workers while the number of people
suffering from occupational diseases has also increased.

senior Lebanese official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon always pays great attention to its ties with China,
which enjoy a steady and fast growth in economic and social
progress," said Lebanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry
Nasser Said at a ceremony for receiving China's aid.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guobin, Charge d'affairs ad Interim of the Chinese Embassy
in Lebanon, on behalf of the Chinese government delivered office
and training equipments worth 600,000 U.S. dollars to the Lebanese
government at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official welcomed more Chinese businessmen to
invest in his country and to take part in the mass reconstruction
drive which was launched after the end of the country's 1975-1990
civil war.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a Lebanese-Chinese working team be set up to
discuss ways of further promoting economic exchanges between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>

dollars in 1998, a 15 percent increase over that of 1997,

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada's software developer
Corel Corp. is freezing new product development for at least two
years, a report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This represents a reversal of a key strategy of the firm that
has pinned its growth on emerging software technologies.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to go into new areas," Michael Cowpland,
Corel's chairman, president and chief executive officer was
quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Ottawa-based Corel will focus on finding new ways
to sell existing products, mainly its CorelDraw graphics software
and its WordPerfect office suite.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after the firm cut its spending on research and
development by 24 percent or 5.4 million dollars (3.5 million
U.S. dollars) in the third quarter which ended August 31, 1998,
compared with a year earlier.
</P>

Analysts said the move doesn't offer much growth potential,

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Red Crescent
Society (KRCS) reiterated Saturday its readiness to extend relief
supplies to the Iraqi people, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The KRCS is still prepared to provide humanitarian supplies
to the people of Iraq provided it will be overseen by the
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC)," KRCS Chairman
Berges Hmoud Al-Berges told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that his organization was also ready to cooperate
with its Iraqi counterpart on the relief efforts under the
supervision of the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
KRCS offered last May to cooperate with the Iraqi Red Crescent
Society to distribute relief supplies in Iraq, but was
categorically rejected.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the KRCS does not cooperate with the Iraqi opposition
in this regard, Al-Berges said "such cooperation would politicize
the operations."
</P>
<P>
The chairman, meanwhile, shed light on its relief efforts
extended to Iraqi refugees in Iran, which have taken place since
1995 and involved hundreds of tonnes of medicine and other
materials.
</P>
<P>
KRCS statistics show that around 1,041 tonnes of food, 20,000
blankets and medicine had been distributed to 38 refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 other camps in northern Iraq also benefited from
331 tonnes of food supplies.

<P>
CHANGSHA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Three children who had been
taken from their mothers were back in safe hands when the man who
was suspected of kidnapping them was shot and killed by police on
Friday in China's Hunan Province in an attempt to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old man, Zhang Shiming, was a farmer in central
China's Hunan Province who had fallen in love with a divorced
woman, Yang Yinsheng in 1997 and tried to marry her recently.
Then, having been turned down, on 13th, he kidnapped the 3-year-ol
d daughter of Yang's sister, the 6-year-old son of Yang's
brother, and Yang's 8-year-old-daughter and held them hostage in
the town of Xinhuang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang boarded up all the windows of the room he was in and
nailed door shut and threw out a piece of paper saying that he
would blow up the room if Yang did not show up on the afternoon
of the 15th.
</P>
<P>
Police rushed to the scene when they heard about the incident
and immediately asked Zhang's parents, brothers, and friends to
try to persuade him to set the children free, but they got nowhere
</P>
<P>
Then, at 1:40 p.m. on the 15th, police opened fire on the room
and a bullet struck Zhang in the head, killing him instantly.
When they broke into the room they found the three children
huddled up in a corner but with no apparent harm.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Car Owners Urged to Intensify Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Owners and drivers of cars
which transport fuel and dry cargo from Djibouti to Ethiopia were
urged to work on holidays and weekends to minimize accumulation
of goods at Djibouti, "the Ethiopian Herald" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Vice-Minister of Transport and
Communication Ayenew Bitewulign, Minister of Trade and Industry
Kassahun Ayele and Minister of Works and Urban Development Haile
Assegde at a meeting held at the assembly hall of the Road and
Transport Authority here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Minister of Transport and Communication said the
Customs Office, transport Associations and companies, transitors
and drivers must all work during the national holidays and
weekends and coordinate their efforts in transporting the incoming
goods from the Port of Djibouti for their own benefit and the
country generally.
</P>
<P>
He said vehicle owners and drivers must exert maximum effort
and transport the dry cargo and fuel before things go beyond
control.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Industry Kassahun mentioned in detail the
problems that have been created and could be created at the only
port which Ethiopia is using at present because of the
accumulation of cargo goods and proposed the proper deployment of
transport vehicles to overcome the problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, around 73,000 tons of dry cargo have
been accumulated at the port at present and around 205,750 tons is
estimated to arrive there next month.
</P>
<P>
This makes it beyond the capacity of the existing vehicles to
handle the goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Works and Urban Development Haile urged
participants to " sacrifice" their holidays and keep up their
concerted effort to overcome the problem the country is facing at
present.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting agreed to do all that is
expected of them to avoid the problem, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrea border dispute on May 6,
1998 Ethiopia has diverted from Assab Port of Eritrea to Port of
Djibouti as its outlet. Seventy percent of Ethiopia's export and
import goods used to transit through Assab, which was one of
Ethiopia's two seaports before the independence of Eritrea in May,
1993.

<HEADLINE> IMF Package Lends Pak Business Sector Optimism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The approval of a three-year
loan package of 5.5 billion U.S. dollars by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has injected into the business sector here
long-lost optimism about Pakistan's economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF package will help meet the country's balance of payment
deficit in the short run, A.R. Kemal, a well-known economist, said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It will also help Pakistan in improving its credit rating,
which will have positive impact on the lending from commercial
banks, Kemal said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF on Thursday approved a cash disbursement of 575 million
dollars as part of a 5.5 billion dollar package for Pakistan, the
first since international lending was suspended after Pakistan's
nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF funding will enable Pakistan to get loans from the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It will also pave the way for the Paris Club to lend money to
Pakistan, Kemal said, adding that there could be some debt
rescheduling and debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Ashfaq Mahmood Khan said the IMF package will make
Pakistan come out of economic crisis, and the fear of default has
become "a thing of the past".
</P>
<P>
The package will restore the foreign investors' confidence in
the country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the approval of loan will discourage the
speculative activity and then strengthen the Pakistani currency of
rupee against the dollar, he added.
</P>
<P>
The rupee gained 20 paisas in the Kerb market on Friday against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
It will also improve the trading at the stock exchanges,
especially Karachi Stock Exchange, as the months long economic
uncertainty has come to an end, he said.

Provisional methods for using the regional flag and emblem of the
Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa, Quebec City May Sue IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government
may team up with Quebec City to sue the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) to recoup the cost of the bidding war for the
2002 Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Quebec City spent 12 million Canadian dollars (7.92 million
U.S.dollars) to bid for the games that Salt Lake City won in
1995. Ottawa, the Capital of Canada, contributed 2 million
Canadian dollars (1.32 million U.S. dollars) of the total amount.
</P>
<P>
"We are examing all the options at our disposal and this is
one of them," Jacques Lefebvre, a spokesman for Sheila Copps, the
Canadian Minister of Heritage, told the National Post newspaper
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul L'Allier, the mayor of Quebec City, this week raised
the possibility of suing the IOC in light of corruption
allegations surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the city will try first to force the IOC to
reimburse the losing cities for the cost of the bidding war.
</P>
<P>
If Quebec City fails to get a reimbursement after the i
nvestigation by the IOC, L'Allier said he does not rule out suing
the IOC because the organization must bear responsibility for the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Salt Lake City Olympic Organizing
Committee bribed IOC members with favours that included money,
medical treatments, and even prostitutes first surfaced last
November when Mark Holder, an IOC senior member, said that the
American City's efforts to get the games amounted to nothing less
than bribery and corruption.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Leader on Macao-Taiwan Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, the
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), said here today that seven policies on handling
relations between Macao and Taiwan after 1999 announced yesterday
by Vice-Premier Qian Qichen define Macao-Taiwan relations under
the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the policies state the limits of authority of
the Central government and the Macao Special Administrative
Region on relations between Macao and Taiwan after Macao's return
to the mainland on December 20, 1999 and demonstrate the basic
principles of the Macao Basic Law and "One country, two systems"
and "Macao governed by the people of Macao."
</P>
<P>
The seven basic policies are in the interest of both Macao and
Taiwan and also benefit relations across the Taiwan Straits and
the smooth handover of Macao.
</P>
<P>
After Macao is returned, relations between Macao and Taiwan
will be a special part of relations across the Taiwan Straits,
Tang explained. The Central government welcomes the people of
Taiwan to get involved in investment, trade, industrial, and
commercial activities in Macao.
</P>
<P>
However, contacts between Macao and Taiwan will be covered by
the "One China" principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 1.8 million Taiwan people came to the mainland for a
visit or business activities last year, and 700,000 of them came
via Macao, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
In comparing the way relations between Hong Kong and Taiwan
and between Macao and Taiwan were handled, Tang said that
relations between Hong Kong and Taiwan have developed smoothly
since Hong Kong returned to China and this is a good experience
for handling Macao-Taiwan relations.

CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia won the IOC
President's Trophy for the best overall national performance in
the world sailing championship for Olympic sailing classes in
Melbourne on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Australia won the trophy, donated by IOC president Juan

Sweden, with Britain third just one point further back.
</P>
<P>
Australia's sailors scored in every class except the Finn
single-handed dinghy with Chris Nicholson winning the 49er double-
handed dinghy class for the third time in a row.
</P>
<P>
Second place in the Europe women's single-handed dinghy class
for Melanie Dennison was an unexpected bonus, with fourth place
for Michael Blackburn in the Laser single-hander consolidating
Australia's overall position.
</P>
<P>
These were backed up by a sixth in the three-man Soling
keelboat and eighth place in both the 470 men's and women's
events, for Tom King and Jenny Armstrong respectively.
</P>
<P>
Second placed Sweden scored their best results with Fredrik

<P>
They were supported by third place in the Laser for Karl
Suneson and a hard-fought fifth for Hans Wallen in the Solings.
</P>
<P>
Britain were only nudged out of second place by one point
despite having one of the best funded teams in the event. Their
major success was Ben Ainslie's victory in the Laser class.

government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will
start January 26 and run through February 14, according to a meeti
ng of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee
of the Macao SAR, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Qian Qichen, chairman of the Preparatory
Committee of the Macao SAR, told the 5th Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee in Beijing today that the major tasks of
the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR for the next 3 months
are arranging the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
This is an arduous task with great significance, he said, and

forming the selection committee to make it representative, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the National People's Congress decision,
the Selection Committee will have 200 members who are permanent

<HEADLINE> Health Initiative in Villages Launched in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi has announced a "New Health for All Initiative" in the
southern African country, the Malawian News Agency MANA said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi said in Blantyre Friday that he is prompted to introduce
the health initiative in view of the unwarranted deaths in
villages that arose from inadequate health facilities in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is aimed at establishing health centers in every
village.
</P>
<P>
"In every village at the least within walking distance, we will
engage and create a center complete with a medic who will
prescribe to administer medicine to locals," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi said that it was disheartening to figure that people
would die of some diseases which if given proper medical attention
would not result in the patient's death.
</P>
<P>
He said health officials would identify centers in which they
will place retired medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
"I will see to it that retired medical staff and nurses be
re-employed to man the centers. I will ensure that this program
takes off ground by giving it my personal determination and
commitment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said he believes that in two to three years,
there would be a health facility within a reasonable distance in
the villages.

<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Three documents dealing with
Macao's transition were adopted at the 5th Plenary Meeting of the

</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who is chairman of the Preparatory
Committee, said that selecting a candidate who is acceptable to
all Macao residents in accordance with the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR is an important guarantee for the smooth transition and
transfer of power of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The election will also be significant for implementing the
Basic Law and the "one country, two systems" principle in the
Macao SAR, he said, adding that the document fully reflects the
principle of fairness, impartiality, openness, democracy, and
honesty, and that he believes Macao residents will be satisfied
with it.

<P>
Qian said that the 2nd clause of Article 24 of the Basic Law
relates to the permanent residency status of Macao residents, and
after repeated discussion by the Preparatory Committee, it will
help encourage Macao residents to stay there and work for the
region.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that this year is crucial to the return of Macao to
the motherland and outlined the major tasks of the Preparatory
Committee for the new year.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory Committee members will form the Selection
Committee for the First SAR Government, select candidates for the
first Chief Executive, determine the positions of principal
officials of the SAR government, and decide on a framework for
governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, members will work out election or transition
methods for the first legislature and judiciary of the Macao SAR,
examine Macao's existing laws, and help form an unofficial
committee responsible for celebrating Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
Qian emphasized that the smooth transition and transfer of
power of Macao are the responsibility of both China and Portugal
and he asked Portuguese Macao authorities to take steps to
improve security in Macao, and pledged his support in this.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that both sides will continue
negotiation and cooperation on transition issues like the
localization of senior civil servants, the handover ceremony, the
garrison, and Macao's budget for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Fighters Bomb Lebanese Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli fighter planes bombed
guerrilla positions in south Lebanon Saturday in retaliation,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Israeli army as saying that earlier Saturday,
Lebanon's Hezbollah, or Party of God, attacked Israeli troops in
the northern area of the security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter planes were called later to raid the Hezbollah
positions in the region and all fighters returned to their base
safely after reportedly hitting the targets.
</P>
<P>
But the casualties of the bombing cannot be identified yet, the
army said.
</P>
<P>
On December 22, Israeli war planes, missing their targets, hit
a farmer house in the eastern sector of the security zone, killing
a Lebanese woman and her six children.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah retaliated the next day by firing about 30
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 on the pretext of protecting security of its north. Since
then, Lebanese military groups, spearheaded by Hezbollah, have
been fighting against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Safety Day Observed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Earthquake Safety
Day, the first ever in Nepal, was observed here Saturday with a
view to generating awareness about the loss from earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala inaugurated an exhibition
which included posters, pictures and tips on how to save oneself
and others from earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
He said people should learn lessons from the past and construct
small buildings.
</P>
<P>
He released two books about the Seismological Situation of the
Kathmandu Valley and Earthquake Risk Management in the Kathmandu
Valley.
</P>
<P>
An art and essay competition on earthquake was also held on the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
Both local and international experts have predicted a big
earthquake in the near future in the Kathmandu Valley, which lies
in the seismic belt.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation and Science and
Technology Bhim Bahadur Rawal said that despite its limited
resources, the government is making efforts to minimize the damage
of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
A tremor measuring 8.4 on the Richter scale rocked Nepal on
January 15, 1934, killing about 4,300 people.
</P>
<P>
Another one measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale claimed some 700
lives in 1989 in the Himalayan kingdom.

<HEADLINE> China Continuing Efforts To Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Long Yongtu, the chief
negotiator of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), told a seminar on the World Trade
Organization here on Saturday that China will continue to make an
effort to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
As long as China continues its policy of opening to the
outside world and is determined to build its socialist market
economy, efforts to join the WTO will not cease and negotiations
will continue, he said. China must be determined in its policy of
opening to the outside world, he said, with the globalization of
the world economy because China needs to keep up.
</P>
<P>
He said that participants in the Central Conference on
Economic Work in Beijing, December 7-9 last year agreed that
economic growth should rely on increased domestic demand and
increased exports as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that only by participating in the process of the
globalization of the world economy and multilateral world trade
systems can China have an environment needed for further opening
up. Chinese membership in the WTO will allow China to compete in
international business, which could benefit both China and the
world.
</P>
<P>
Joining the WTO does not mean China will open its markets to
one hundred percent, he said, because market opening should be
limited, as is the practice in every country, but opening will
enable China to play a greater role in world economic growth,
especially the economic recovery of Southeast Asian nations.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges Grant for Pak Social Action Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will
provide a grant of 3.88 billion rupees ( about 84 million U.S.
dollars) to Pakistan for the Social Action Program (SAP)
project-II.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted official sources
as saying Saturday that an agreement was reached between the two
sides here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the European Commission worth 3.88 billion
rupees would be the largest single grant ever made by EU, APP
reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU grant will be directed specifically to assist the
government in its stated commitment to institutional reform of the
social sector and to the improvement of the quality and access to
education, health and family planning.
</P>
<P>
The SAP is the nation-wide comprehensive and integrated, aiming
at improving the quality and cost effectiveness of basic service
delivery in four social sectors including elementary education,
basic health, family planning and rural water supply and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Britain also announced earlier this month that it would provide
50 million pounds in grant assistance to support Pakistan's SAP
project phase-II.
</P>
<P>
The grant will also provide for the delivery of technical
assistance in policy formulation, capacity building and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
International donors agencies led by the World Bank also
committed to provide 135 million dollars to Pakistan to support
on-going second phase of SAP during current fiscal year ending on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Ahsan Iqbal has
reiterated the commitment of the government to the objectives of
Social Action Program, assuring policy framework agreed with
donors agencies would be fully honored.
</P>
<P>
The SAP project-II (1997-2001) is a 10 billion dollar program,
with about 10 percent resources contributed by the donors.

<HEADLINE> Indian Artists Reject PM's Call for Debate on Conversions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 artists and
intellectuals Saturday rejected Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee's recent call for a national debate on conversions of
religions in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, they said that the debate would
only foster discrimination, social prejudice and religious
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, religious violence between the
Christians and Hindu in Gujarat State of southern India has
shocked the whole nation. Several churches were burnt and some
Christians were beaten and rendered homeless in the violence. The
Hindu alleged the violence was caused mainly by Christians' effort
to convert the Hindu into Christians in the State. But the
Christians refused the allegation.
</P>
<P>
"It is shocking that instead of condemning the attacks on
Christians and tribals in Gujarat outright, the prime minister
wants to start a national debate on the so-called conversions,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to whip up anti-Christian sentiments was as
organized as the "ongoing attempt" to generate anti-Muslim
feelings, the statement claimed.
</P>
<P>
Former parliament speaker P. A. Sangma said Saturday that
Christian missionaries had done a lot for the country. There was a
panic reaction in BJP (the ruling party) as the party is losing
its grounds very, very fast. So " they are just acting without
thinking. They are bringing this fundamentalist issue more and
more as they are failing on all fronts. They want to become much
more fundamentalist in their approach".
</P>
<P>
Even Vajpayee himself on Saturday expressed concern over the
increasing sense of insecurity among the minorities and reiterated
the government's resolve to change the situation.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to recent incidents of attacks on
Christians in Gujarat State, he said that India had always been a
refuge for persecuted religious communities from across the world.
"It is a matter of regret that some communities are not feeling
safe in this refuge today".

<HEADLINE> Man Who Stole Classical Statue Of Buddha Gets Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- One of the main figures in an
attempt to steal a statue of Buddha from the Tang Dynasty (618
A.D.-907) was given the death sentence on Friday and was executed
in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The man, Gao Yunliao, was a farmer from Henan's Nanzhao
county. He plotted with three other farmers to break into Longmen
Grottoes where they stole the statue in March of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The statue, which weighed more than a ton, was a Category A
antique on the state's protection list. The men broke it into
three pieces while loading it on a truck and then buried it at
Gao's home.
</P>
<P>
Gao's three accomplices were given various prison sentences.
The Buddha statue has now been restored and is back on display.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Designs "Smart Guns" to Curb Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- South African computer
experts have developed a system called a smart gun that may help
curb this country's horrific firearm death statistics.
</P>
<P>
A smart gun is a personalized firearm, which can only be used
by the person accredited to it, according to Saturday Star
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Two methods are being considered to reach that end, according
to Nic van Zyl, the coordinating member of the Computerized
International Firearm Licensing and Authorization Consortium,
which is funded by the Department of Science and Technology to
develop a prototype for the smart gun.
</P>
<P>
"We could have an ID card, similar to the driving license card,
which would be fingerprint encoded," van Zyl said. "When a person
applies for a firearm he would also get this card with a
microprocessor on it."
</P>
<P>
The system would work much the same as an access card, where
the user would swipe the card through an interface on the top of
the gun to activate it.
</P>
<P>
The second method involves delving into the world of
biometrics, where a miniature scanner on the trigger or the back
of the gun would read the fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
The development of the smart gun prototype is set to take two
years, although van Zyl reckoned that it will be a further 10
years before the smart gun becomes the only weapon on sale.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should institute a phasing-out
program for firearms. While he feels that this step could prove
unpopular, he is adamant that the government must take unpopular
steps to restore law and order.
</P>
<P>
Van Zyl doesn't expect that the smart gun will have a smooth
entry into the market. With the gun being more expensive to make
and purchase, he reckons that firearm manufacturers won't be too
pleased.
</P>
<P>
But he believes that firearm sellers have a moral duty to the
community as guns develop into more and more effective killing
machines.
</P>
<P>
Sheena Duncan, national chairperson of Gun Free South Africa,
believes the smart gun will not do much to stem the proliferation
of firearms in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Gun Free's opinion is that it will do little to resolve the
immediate problem, -- too many guns floating around," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Duncan does see a long-term benefit in the development
of the smart gun.
</P>
<P>
"As a long-term project, it will bring about an increase in the
price of guns, which will be extremely welcome," she said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Revive Sluggish Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Saturday pledged that the newly launched coalition
government between his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the
Liberal Party (LP) will make every effort to revitalize Japan's
ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to make utmost efforts so that the coalition
government can take the initiative to rehabilitate Japan," Obuchi
told a LDP party convention.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi reiterated his pledge to achieve positive economic
growth in fiscal 1999, starting April 1, and to revive the
Japanese economy by fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the coalition government, Obuchi said the
coalition with the LP is not the only option for building a
stable power base, adding that he will listen to opinions of
political parties which will cooperate with the government on all
policies.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi launched the LDP-LP coalition government on Thursday by
reshuffling his nearly six-month-old cabinet in a bid to create a
stronger power base for the LDP in the House of Councilors (upper
house), though the ccoalition is still short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
The LDP enjoys a majority in the more powerful House of
Representatives, the lower house.

<HEADLINE> Half of Indians Still Illiterate Today: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said Saturday that 50 years after the country's
independence, half of the Indian people are still illiterate.
</P>
<P>
"We are all guilty of keeping half of India illiterate even 50
years after independence. We could not make even primary education
compulsory as envisioned by our founding fathers," he said at the
jubilee celebrations of the Indraprastha College for Women, the
oldest women's college in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
"It would be fallacious to think that the country can progress
towards a great future while keeping half of its population
illiterate," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are losing out in the global race for lack of education. We
will have to remove it," he said while recalling Nobel laureate
Amartya Sen's observations that India's successive governments
neglected both primary education and primary health care.
</P>
<P>
The government alone cannot solve the problem with its limited
resources, he said. While the government spares no efforts, there
should be non-governmental efforts in this direction, a people's
movement involving youth and students who can engage in literacy
programs, he added.

TOKYO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- World champion Noriko Anno
defeated Diadenys Luna of Cuba to retain the light heavyweight
title on Saturday, leading Japan's gold medal hunt at the Fukuoka
international women's judo tournament.
</P>
<P>
Neither woman could score a point in the under 78kg final, but
the Japanese won the match after Luna received a minor penalty
twice for a shido and a chui for passivity to give Anno the
decisive points lead for a yuko.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do well at all in the Asian Games and this is my
first tournament this year, so I really wanted to get off to a
good start," said Anno, a beaten quarter-finalist in Bangkok last
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Natsuko Sano won the middleweight class and Nami
Kimoto took the light middleweight to add two more gold medals
for Japan. Sano defeated Australia's Cathy Arlove on an ippon
while Asian Games silver medallist Kimoto edged China's Li
Shufang with a waza-ari to take the 63kg category.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, world heavyweight champion Christine Cicot of
France fell victim to Yuan Hua of China as the Asian Games
over-78kg champion scored a unanimous 3-0 decision to take the

<HEADLINE> China, Biggest Winner at Diving World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China won 12 out of the 13
individual and team events, only Mexico depriving it of a clean
sweep, at the 11th Diving World Cup, which started Tuesday and
ended Saturday in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Wellington Regional Aquatic Center saw a brilliant
performance of world's famous divers who were contending for the
top honors in the men's 10-meter and women's three-meter
synchronized diving events, with China's Tian Liang and his
compatriots Yang Lan and Guo Jingjing winning the two events
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two famous divers from 14 countries and regions
participated in the trials of strength for the gold medal in the
men's 10-meter platform, which is usually the most attractive
event in the diving competitions.
</P>
<P>
Like other diving championships, the final of the event was
arranged right before the conclusion of the 11th Diving World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Six entered the final this evening after the premilinaries and
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
With correct executions of his highly difficult dives and also
with graceful diving movements, Chinese Tian Liang became an
undisputable champion of the event. He got an accumulated score
of 488.13 points in the six dives in the final. Teammate He Wei
won the silver medal with 448.56 points and Mark Ruiz of the
United States rank third with 446.88 points.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the final of the men's 10-meter platform, women's
three-meter synchronized final was held with eight pairs from
different countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China's duo of Yang Lan and Guo Jingjing had an exciting
contention with Russia's pair Irina Lashko and Yulia Pakhalina.
Depending on the good execution of their fifth and last dive,
Yang Lan and Guo Jingjing pulled the Russians down from the first
placing and won the title. The Russians ranked second with only
1.74 points less than the Chinese Pair. Olena Zhupina and Ganna
Sorokina of Ukraine won the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the past five days, 10 individual events were held at the
Diving World Cup with the Chinese winning nine gold medals and
Mexican one.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the whole competition, the Chinese
divers also won all three gold medals in the men's, women's and
mixed team events.

beginning Monday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Doctors Claim Discovery of Diabetes Cure Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Malaysian doctors said
on Saturday that they had discovered a process which could lead to
the discovery of the ultimate cure for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the discovery at a press conference here, Mathew
Sebastian and A.J.A. Peter at a private research center described
the process, which could normalize the blood sugar level of
diabetics to an acceptable level without the use of anti-diabetic
drug of any kind, as a "miracle that will bring new hope for
diabetic patients worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The "harmonization process" could free diabetics from their
diabetic condition within a five-day period (the shortest possible
period without the use of anti-diabetic drugs), claimed Sebastian,
himself a diabetic patient for the past 18 years but is now
reportedly completely cured.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery was the result of a formal program
conducted by them recently on 14 people, nine of whom were
diabetics, with full blood examination done both before and after
the process.
</P>
<P>
They found that the normalization of the blood sugar levels to
an acceptable level within the five-day period or at the closest
period would sustain on a long term basis as long as a healthy
life-style was clearly understood and adopted by the patients.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the process, he said it was achieved through a
five-day intensive program in which techniques and methods were
introduced to establish harmony of the mind, emotions and the
physical body.
</P>
<P>
It involves several harmonization cycles, including fasting,
cleansing and intake of harmonizing food at regular intervals
specially designed for this purpose, as well as specific exercise
techniques for the stimulation of the pancreas and associated
organs.
</P>
<P>
Sebastian claimed the process was established after more than
20 years of studies, research and experiment of the direct effects
the mind and emotions had on the physical body.
</P>
<P>
But he said the harmonization process, a natural process, was
not a treatment aimed at supplanting the conventional wisdom of
medical doctors nor was it meant to isolate the diabetic patients
from their doctors.
</P>
<P>
He said patients who had completed the harmonization process
for the purpose of freeing themselves from the diabetic condition
must not take for granted and must continue with their routine
medical examination by their physicians.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Wins Women's Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Corinne Rey-Bellet of
Switzerland stunned the downhill favorites to capture her first
World Cup victory in St. Anton, Austria, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rey-Bellet, 26, stormed down the icy, bumpy Kandahar course in
one minute 28.01 seconds, beating Michaela Dorfmeister to second
in 1:28.20 and Hilde Gerg of Germany was third in 1:28.30.
</P>
<P>
"I had a super run. It's a great feeling to finally win a
World Cup race. That's what I trained for all these years,"
Rey-Bellet said.
</P>
<P>
Rey-Bellet's previous best was a third place in a giant slalom
in Switzerland in 1992, but she was fourth in the last downhill
in Veysonnaz, Switzerland, in December, and clocked the fastest
times in both training runs Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The course was harder today but I skied better than
yesterday. I skied the bottom part perfectly," said Rey-Bellet,
who gave Switzerland its first downhill victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
World Cup leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria finished
sixth, .87 seconds behind Rey-Bellet.
</P>
<P>
Renate Goetschl of Austria, the World Cup downhill champion
and two-time winner this season, was fourth, .68 behind
Rey-Bellet.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Rubber Output Down By 9.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's natural rubber
(NR) output for January-November 1998 declined by 9.8 percent
compared with the same period of 1997, according to the Statistics
Department Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The output during the period stood at 802,678 tons against
889,767 tons a year earlier, statistics released by the department
show.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of 1998, cumulative exports of rubber
totalled 913,802 tons, down by 1.3 percent from the corresponding
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Rubber was mainly exported to the United States, Germany, South
Korea, Britain, Belgium, China, France, Brazil and Italy, the nine
accounting for 55.9 percent of the country's total natural rubber
exports, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's imports of rubber were 511,423 tons, a
jump of 38.9 percent over that of the same period of 1997, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The imports came almost entirely from Thailand, Cambodia,
Liberia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During January-November, a total of 304,329 tons was consumed
locally, an increase of 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department said stocks held at the end of November 1998
were 217,925 tons, down 0.8 percent from the level at end-October
1998, but up 0.3 percent from end-November 1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Saddam's Removal to End Iraqi Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has reiterated the American policy to end the Iraqi crisis through
helping topple the current regime in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In an interview appeared in the London-based Arabic daily
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat's Saturday edition, Clinton said the best option
to resolve the Iraq crisis would be removal of Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
The United States will boost support for the Iraqi oppositions
to this end, he said. But he ruled out the possibility of waging a
full-scale ground military operation to bring down Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that Baghdad must comply with the United
Nations resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He described the U.S. strategy towards Iraq as based on the
principles - international sanctions except for food and medicine,
support for U.N. measures in search for arms, threat of the use of
force to keep Saddam in check and unifying allies and friends to
realize the goals.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the strategy has neither ended the Iraqi
crisis nor compelled Iraq to honor its commitments.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that Washington and its allies would resort to
military means to prevent Saddam's regime from rebuilding its
arsenal of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president acknowledged, however, the "policy is
costly for our country and the Middle East region in regard of
economic and strategic aspects."
</P>
<P>
"So the best path to get out of the destructive dilemma, in the
long-run, will be seeking to establish a new government in Baghdad
with better representation of the Iraqi people and readiness to
honor obligations towards the international community," Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Financial Constraints Reduce Eid Shopping Zeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Shopping, celebrating the
Muslim holy festival of Eid which is coming after Ramazan, should
have gained momentum in these days when the gala is only a few
days away.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, people seem to lack the traditional
enthusiasm for shopping in this Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
It is simply due to reduced purchasing power of common people
owing to the relatively high inflation rate, said Muhammad Faheem,
organizer of a Eid bazaar in this capital city, while commenting
on the lukewarm response from the shoppers.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who come to the bazaar keep asking the
rates of various articles but go without shopping," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This time we have yet to receive a major shopper at our shop,"
said a salesman of a big shopping mall in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the old days, he said people used to come along with
their families to buy shoes, clothing, perfumes and other articles
to greet the most important festival in this Muslim country. But
now they have hardly any enthusiasm to go for these things, said
the salesman, who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"When a common man could hardly buy essential food items, then
how can he buy Eid related items in such a price-escalated
atmosphere," said Abdul Ghaffar, a shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
"I am unable to afford more expenditures," said an old man, who
came to a market in the capital for shopping but only bought shoes
and clothes for his family members.
</P>
<P>
The poor and those from the middle classes just cannot afford
ready-made garments. So they have to get it stitched from tailors
or to do the job themselves.
</P>
<P>
Yet tailors in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have
already hung "no further orders for stitching" signs.
</P>
<P>
The government servants are still waiting for their one-month
advance salary promised by the government to pay for the Eid.
</P>
<P>
A number of special Eid bazaars have been set up by the
occasional investors to make good profits, but they are hardly
able to recoup their capital outlays, said another shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Special discounts offered by some shops have failed to attract
the shoppers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey showed that the sale of Eid cards, the most
popular means of conveying Eid greetings to near or dear ones, has
dropped 25 to 30 percent in Islamabad this year.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, a sharp decline of 75 percent has been recorded in
the sale of Eid cards in Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier
Province, due to the almost 100 percent rise in their prices
compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from one of the main post offices in
Islamabad said people used to purchase cards during the whole
month of Ramazan, the holy month of fasting for Muslims, but this
time they bought cards only in the last several days of Ramazan.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a special Eid," said a woman who required
anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Use BOT/BOL to Ease Classroom Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines may tap the
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) and Build-Operate-Lease (BOL)
programs in its school infrastructure buildup plan to ease the
classroom shortage, which could surpass 20,000 classrooms this
year.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Saturday, the education department said
it has been authorized to ease the classroom shortage in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"(Education) Secretary Andrew Gonzales has called for a study
on the possible use of the BOT/BOL approach as an innovative way
to mobilize funds from the private sector behind the construction
of school buildings all over the country," said Undersecretary of
Education Victor Andres Manhit in the report.
</P>
<P>
He said his department is exploring the possibility of using
the BOT/BOL financial approach in pursuit of President Joseph
Estrada's commitment to provide quality education, especially to
poor Filipino kids.
</P>
<P>
With this year's budget, the government would be able to build
only 8,196 classrooms, or a mere 38 percent of the estimated
nationwide backlog of 21,514 classrooms, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the government should come up with novel
ways to beef up the meager public funds with fresh cash flows from
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the BOT/BOL system would enable the government to pay
private contractors on the installment basis, Manhit said, the
government would be able to build a far greater number of
classrooms each year with the same amount of public funds for the
classroom buildup plan.

<HEADLINE> Polygamy to Be Lawful in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Virtually every South
African man may marry as many wives as he wishes when the
Recognition of Customary Marriages Bill is signed into law, The
Citizen newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by parliament last year, provides for
recognition in common law of African customary marriages,
including polygamous ones.
</P>
<P>
Although the bill was designed to deal with customary marriages
among blacks, there is nothing to stop whites from marrying
according to African custom and legally registering a polygamous
marriage, the paper quoted Professor Roland Nhlapo of the South
African Law Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nhlapo said the constitution made it possible for any person to
adopt the culture of his or her choice and race classification was
a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill prescribed that such a marriage should comply
in every way with African custom including the negotiations prior
to the ceremony, the ritual and the celebrations afterward.
</P>
<P>
The Home Affairs Department was in the process of drawing up
the detailed regulations and it could be some time before these
have been completed and approved.
</P>
<P>
Nhlapo is convinced that once the bill has been promulgated, it
will enable men who are already married to legally acquire as many
more wives as are prepared to join their menage, provided the
African customary rituals are followed.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Troops leave Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The last batch of Nigerian
soldiers of the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG has left
Liberia this week in the wake of accusations that Liberia is
supporting rebels in Sierra Leone, media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops have abandoned all check-points previously
manned by them in the capital, including the two main ones at the
diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point.
</P>
<P>
Some of the ECOMOG soldiers left in lorries on Wednesday and
Thursday as drivers blared their horns to attract the attention of
pedestrians in the capital.
</P>
<P>
No comments are available from the ECOMOG authorities and the
Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops have been in Liberia since 1990, a year after
President Charles Taylor, then a warlord, launched a guerrilla war
which lasted seven years.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Nigerian soldiers from Liberia followed a
warning from the Nigerian Foreign Ministry to stop supporting
Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, Nigeria "views with grave concern the
nefarious role being played by Liberia and some other countries in
and outside the sub- region in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
It cannot be "business as usual" with countries which provide
the bullets that kill and maim our sons and daughters, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria provides the bulk of ECOMOG troops fighting the rebels
in Sierra leone which launched offensive against capital Freetown
10 days ago.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes 75 percent Share of Recovered Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that his government eyes at least a 75
percent share of the allegedly ill-gotten wealth of the Marcos
family that it may recover through negotiations with the heirs of
the late president.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio program here, Estrada said his administration
wants to use the government's share of the Marcos fortune to
indemnify human rights victims and fund his administration's
pro-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we'll start with a claim for 75 percent of the
wealth. I am also pushing for this because there is already some
580 million U.S. dollars in an escrow account in the PNB
(Philippine National Bank)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also stressed that he would fulfill his duty to ensure
that whatever deal his government reaches with the Marcoses would
be favorable to the government.
</P>
<P>
Defending his administration's decision to deal with the
Marcoses, Estrada said the government has failed to recover the
wealth through the courts.
</P>
<P>
Former Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos spent six
years each trying to recover the wealth, but failed to do so
because of lengthy court proceedings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, the government is spending too much on
lawyers who have so far failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Friday, Estrada said that he expects the
government to conclude the negotiations with the Marcos family
before the end of this year.

<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The document on establishing the first French university in
Egypt had been declared after the founders of the university
signed it Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Former Egyptian Ambassador in Paris Samir Safwat said Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and French President Jacques Chirac had
blessed the establishment of the university which is considered
the first of its kind in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- President Hosni Mubarak will deliver a speech on January 25
on the occasion of the Police Day.
</P>
<P>
Following the speech, Mubarak will confer decorations and
medals on families of the police martyrs and the distinguished
officers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The State Supreme Security Court has decided to sustain the

<HEADLINE> Ten More Listed Companies Declare Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Another ten listed companies
declared possible losses for 1998 today, bringing the total
number of such companies to 50 on the Chinese stock market.
</P>
<P>
Setting aside funds to write off non-performing assets is the
primary reason for the ten companies to post losses, according to
the company announcements. Sluggish market and rising cost also
pose difficulties for some firms' management.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to adopt a new, stricter set of accounting
regulations this year governing the annual disclosure of
corporate results, which requires all the listed companies to
deduct from profits in 1998 some of the non-performing assets,
inventories, and unrecalled debts.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 41 companies declared losses in their annual repor
t.  The growing number of listed companies with potential
loss-making risks have resulted in continual sluggishness on the
two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen last week, with the
composite index in Shanghai and component index in Shenzhen
sliding 11.35 and 26.83 points last Friday to 1,137.3 and
2,903.89, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Amid the growing pessimism about poor corporate results in
1998, a company listed on the Shanghai stock market initiated
the disclosure of annual results this year with good pe
rformance, reporting more than 51.26 million yuan in net profits
last year. This break down into a per share profit of 0.6 yuan,
and per share yield of 13.11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Only Poor Students Entitled to Scholarships in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- From now on only the students
whose parents earn less than 250,000 Kwacha (about 100 U.S.
Dollars) a month will be entitled to government scholarships at
the University of Zambia, Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Previously, students applied on their own and now parents will
be required to apply on behalf of their children.
</P>
<P>
In their applications for scholarships the parents will be
required to attach a letter from a social welfare officer showing
their financial status.
</P>
<P>
These letters could also be obtained from recognized clergymen
from various denominations.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper quoted deputy education minister Mathias
Mpande as saying that the government will give priority to the
returning students (they discontinue their study because of
poverty).
</P>
<P>
He said contributions toward tuition fees will range from 10
percent for less privileged students like orphans to 100 percent
for those who are not entitled to the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Mpande also said students will now be required to meet the cost
of mealis and accommodation by paying boarding fees unlike in the
past when the government paid in full.
</P>
<P>
The University of Zambia Students Union (UNZASU) has expressed
disappointment at the development.
</P>
<P>
UNZASU treasurer Johnston Chikwanda said Friday that it is
unrealistic that someone whose income is 250,000 kwacha will
manage to pay three million Kwacha tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
He said UNZASU wants the government to increase the meal
allowances from 90,000 Kwacha to about 240,000 Kwacha a month.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1996, 90,000 Kwacha was equivalent to 120 Dollars
while currently the same amount is only 39 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are two universities in the country and the University of
Zambia is the biggest.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Fresh fighting erupted Thursday

<HEADLINE> Livestock Price declines in Ethiopia's Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Livestock price in
Ethiopia's Somalia State is fast declining due to drought and
decreased supply to the foreign market, the Ethiopian Herald
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a marketing study conducted by four
welfare organizations and the Somalia State Council as saying that
the price has dropped by over 50 percent in just a year.
</P>
<P>
The study said, while the drought and the resultant drying up
of pastures have led to the dramatic decline in livestock prices,
residents of some districts have been compelled to sell their
animals at any price and buy grain which is also in short supply
due to drought.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in the Middle East which used to buy cattle from
the locality have diverted to other markets becoming another cause
for the decline in prices.
</P>
<P>
The study said these countries diverted to other markets
because of fears that a cattle disease that had been afflicting
Tanzania, Kenya and southern Somalia might also exist in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The study recalled that a team drawn from the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) last year conducted a study which confirmed that the
disease does not exist in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture has transmitted a
note to FAO requesting it to issue directives to those countries
that boycotted cattle trade with Ethiopia assuring them the
dreaded livestock disease is non-existent in Ethiopia, according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Region to Tame Yellow River Section </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yinchuan, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Taming the turbulent Yellow
River to ensure the safety of locals living along its banks and
to protect farmland and villages during flooding season this year
is the aim of authorities in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began in October in 1998, involves a total
investment of 213 million yuan (25.7 million US dollars), of
which 100 million yuan (12.5 million US dollars) comes from the
central government and the rest from the local government,
according to Ruan Tingfu, Office Director of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region's Yellow River Reclaiming Project Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
So far, 269-km-long dykes along the river in the region have
been reinforced, and 1.72 million cubic meters of earth-works
have been built up, accounting for 60 percent of the project's
total schemes, Ruan said.
</P>
<P>
Historically, this river, which runs for 396 km through the
region, has caused great economic losses, as well as lives, to
local people as it regularly breached the embankments during
flooding seasons. Statistics show that the direct economic losses
caused by the river in the destruction of farmland, water
conservancy facilities, roads and houses were estimated at an
average of 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) a year over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the local government
has invested a total of 60 million yuan (7.2 million US dollars)
to build 400 km of dykes and other water control projects.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, heavy flooding on the country's longest river,
the Yangtze, and on the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in northeast
China left more than 3,000 people dead and millions of others
homeless. Direct economic losses involved surpassed 20 billion yua
n (2.4 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> . Ethiopian Transport Vehicle Owners Urged to Intensify Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Owners and drivers of
vehicles which transport fuel and dry cargo from Djibouti to
Ethiopia were urged to work on holidays and weekends to minimize
the accumulation of goods at the Port of Djibouti, "the Ethiopian
Herald" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Vice-Minister of Transport and
Communication Ayenew Bitewulign, Minister of Trade and Industry
Kassahun Ayele and Minister of Works and Urban Development Haile
Assegde at a meeting held at the assembly hall of the Road and
Transport Authority here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Minister of Transport and Communication said the
Customs Office, transport Associations and companies, transitors
and drivers must all work during the national holidays and
weekends and coordinate their efforts in transporting the incoming
goods from the Port of Djibouti for their own benefit and the
country generally.
</P>
<P>
He said vehicle owners and drivers must exert maximum effort
and transport the dry cargo and fuel before things go beyond
control.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Industry Kassahun mentioned in detail the
problems that have been created and could be created at the only
port which Ethiopia is using at present because of the
accumulation of cargo goods and proposed the proper deployment of
transport vehicles to overcome the problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, around 73,000 tons of dry cargo have
been accumulated at the port at present and around 205,750 tons is
estimated to arrive there next month.
</P>
<P>
This makes it beyond the capacity of the existing vehicles to
handle the goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Works and Urban Development Haile urged
participants to " sacrifice" their holidays and keep up their
concerted effort to overcome the problem the country is facing at
present.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting agreed to do all that is
expected of them to avoid the problem, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrea border dispute on May 6,
1998 Ethiopia has diverted from Assab Port of Eritrea to Port of
Djibouti as its outlet. Seventy percent of Ethiopia's export and
import goods used to transit through Assab, which was one of
Ethiopia's two seaports before the independence of Eritrea in May,

<TEXT>
<P>
Situated on the bank of beautiful Lijiang River and surrounded
by beautiful scenery, the small town is 65 km southeast of
Guilin, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
Elegant oaks dominated the landscape and the Lijiang River
meanders slowly through it. Hills of different shapes and crystal
streams are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The town has become a tourism destination, thanks to its
unique limestone terrain and a mild climate and evergreen trees.
And most of the hills in Yangshuo is named by locals after their
shapes, such as the Painter boy, White Crane and Swan Peak.
</P>
<P>
The scenery undergoes magical changes as night turns into day
and days turn into seasons. At the oncoming sunset, the limestone
peaks are often hemmed in by fog, etching their unique formations
onto the red, hot-glowing mist.
</P>
<P>
Besides enjoying the magical scenery, tourists can hike or
ride mountain bikes into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
The gentle and limpid Lijiang River is ideal for swimmers and
anglers, as it flows slowly towards the ocean, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tourists can treat themselves to traditional Chinese
cuisines, the ethnic food of local Zhuang people, or hamburgers,
pancakes and pizza in the hundreds of restaurants, bars and
Internet cafes around the town.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Eventful Week for S.Lankan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The past week has witnessed a
peace effort by South Africa's Nelson Mandela towards Sri Lanka's
civil war, an investigation into a Tamil billionaire, an
allegation against Thailand and one of the navy's biggest
victories over the rebels at sea.
</P>
<P>
As the protracted civil war is dragging on between the Sri
Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
as many as 15 international offers to mediate have been proposed,
of which South African President Nelson Mandela's offer was
reportedly accepted.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Monday the Sri Lankan government as well
as the LTTE favored the Mandela intervention and South Africa's
foreign minister will be in Sri Lanka "in due course" to map out
the basis on which South Africa could serve as the facilitator in
bringing the two warring parties back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
While the peace efforts are going on, the government is
pressuring the LTTE rebels both economically as well as
militarily.
</P>
<P>
Police said Tuesday that a Tamil billionaire businessman,
considered to be a close friend of Tamil rebel leader Velupillai
Prabhakaran, had been arrested by the Criminal Investigation
Department recently.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan police and the Interpol are investigating how the
36-year-old businessman had smuggled out of the country about 12
billion rupees (200 million U.S. dollars) illegally in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
They have found that the suspect had credited the illegally
remitted funds to accounts of certain individuals and
organizations in more than 950 banks all over the world, who might
purchase arms for the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government is fighting the civil war both
domestically and internationally as the battle goes to the
diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
In a BBC World Service Radio "Asia Today" interview aired
Tuesday, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said:
"Some Thai ports have been used by known LTTE ships and coastal
towns on the Thai border have been used as naval bases."
</P>
<P>
Press reports said both the Thai Foreign Ministry and the Thai
army have denied that Tamil Tigers had used Thailand's coastal
areas as secret bases to ship weapons and ammunition to northern
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
But the Thai army chief Gen. Surayud Chulanont confirmed
earlier that arms smugglers were using sea lanes in the Gulf of
Thailand and the Andaman Sea to ship war weapons from Cambodia and
Myanmar to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Unnoticed by the rest of the country, the Sri Lanka Navy this
week notched up one of its biggest victories at sea in a battle
between Trincomalee and Mullaitivu northeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 54 LTTE rebels were killed in the fighting, and a huge
number of others, possibly more than 100, were wounded. Among
those confirmed dead is Lt. Col. Keethan, the newly appointed
Batticaloa area political wing leader of the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Keethan is the highest ranking rebel leader to be killed in
many months, analysts here said, adding that Lieutenant Colonel is
the LTTE's second highest rank.
</P>
<P>
But despite the victory in the fighting, which raged on the
nights of January 7, 8 and 11, the navy has to face the fact that
the LTTE rebels are fast arming themselves with smuggled
equipment.
</P>
<P>
It has now been reported that on one of the 11 LTTE Sea Tiger
craft which were sunk or put out of action was a 23 millimeter
gun, a powerful weapon never seen before on a Tiger boat.
</P>
<P>
This 23 mm gun is not among the few which the Tigers captured
from the navy in battles several years ago. Military experts said
it appears to have been manufactured in an East European country,
which most probably means that the LTTE has managed to get at
least one of its supply ships in without being caught. This gun
would have been part of a larger shipment, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, defense experts have strongly urged the government
to strengthen the navy's fleet, as well as to purchase more
reconnaissance planes for the air force, to patrol the coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
As the civil war has been dragging on for 16 years, the
eventful week seems to indicate that for all the efforts, the road
to a lasting peace is by no means smooth.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals Growth Slow in Kenya: Hoteliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Kenya this
year will only increase by 20 percent compared with last year,
informed sources within the industry have revealed.
</P>
<P>
Karl Heinz Strauss, former chairman of the Kenya Association of
Tour Operators (KATO) Coast Branch, was quoted by Saturday's
national press as saying that time for marketing Kenya as a
tourist destination for this year had elapsed and there was very
little to expect this season.
</P>
<P>
Strauss said what stake-holders and the Kenya Tourism Board
(KTB) should do is to embark on an aggressive marketing campaign
abroad.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there is need to sensitize all Kenyans on
the importance of keeping and safeguarding the country's
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Another hotelier, Robert Kinyua, said most hotels are now
experiencing more departures than arrivals and that the trend was
not good enough for the industry.
</P>
<P>
Kinyua, who is General Manager at Whispering Palms, said after
the Christmas and new year festivities, his hotel was operating
on a 25 percent occupancy.
</P>
<P>
At the Sarova Whitesands hotel, bed occupancy according to Joy
Ingabo, an Accounts Manager was 50 percent with a mixture of
locals and repeat guests.
</P>
<P>
Major tourism stake-holders at the Coast have also floated the
idea of establishing a parallel marketing body alongside Kenya
Tourism Board, according to the press reports.
</P>
<P>
Annually, about 70 percent of tourists coming to Kenya will
visit the coastal area of the country.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the United Arab
Emirate and Britain rose in 1998 despite falling oil prices, the
Emirates News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, the UAE exports to Britain witnessed a
21 percent increase, reaching about 800 million dollars in the
first 10 months of 1998, from 658 million U.S. dollars a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Britain in the first 10 months of 1998 totaled
2.16 billion dollars, a 3 percent increase over the 2.11 billion
dollars during the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
British exports to the UAE for the whole of last year was
expected to be 2.49 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The largest share of British exports to the UAE are machinery
and transport equipment, followed by manufactured goods,
chemicals, food and beverages.
</P>
<P>
After a big rise of 11 percent in British exports to the UAE in
1996, the last two years have seen a small but steady increase.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Criticizes Foreign Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Saturday described foreign attacks on Iraq as an
example of a breach of international laws.
</P>
<P>
"They (attackers) have no respect for international law and yet
these are the same people who try to teach us how to run our
country, how to conform to international practices and all that,"
Mahathir said when asked about his opinion on the situation in
Iraq in an interview with Radio and Television Malaysia here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the fact that the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of disarming Iraq had been reportedly used to spy on that
country showed that there was a "lack of regard for what is fair,
right and honorable," according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"They have no honor at all and these are the people we are
dealing with now in the world," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
American and British fighter jets rained missiles on Iraqi
targets for four days last month.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "It looks like now that there is a unipolar
world, those who have power are bent upon maximizing their
oppression of the weak. We thought that the success of Western
democracies would lead to a fairer, more just world. But it is
quite obvious that when people are given power they will misuse
it."

<HEADLINE> Anwar's Appeal for Bail Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's appeal for release on bail was
rejected by the Court of Appeal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Appeal Court Judge N.H. Chan, who read out part of the 31-page
judgment, said that the court had reached a conclusion that an
order for the grant or refusal of bail was not appealable to the
Court of Appeal, making the appeal incompetent and that "we are
constrained to dismiss it."
</P>
<P>
He said the court was "not justified" in interfering with the
discretion exercised by the judge in the High Court "because we
think we might have come to a different conclusion ourselves on
similar material."
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was dismissed as the deputy prime minister and
finance minister on September 2 last year, filed the appeal
following the dismissal of his application for bail by High Court
Justice S. Augustine Paul on October 5 last year on the grounds
that he might tamper with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Anwar failed in his second attempt to be released
on bail after Justice Paul again rejected his application, ruling
that there was no fresh grounds to support his application.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is at present on trial in the High Court on four
corruption charges of abusing his position to interfere in police
investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct against him.

BELGRADE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Serb government Friday
reaffirmed its determination to settle the Kosovo issue through
political dialogue on the basis of respecting territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the republic, as well as ensuring a
full equality among various ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>

After a meeting on the Kosovo issue in Pristina, capital of

separatists and stop using double standards on the Kosovo issue,
and called for cutting foreign assistance to them.

Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will tell the
world the real situation in Kosovo in an objective manner.
</P>

It called on the leaders of ethnic Albanian parties to work
with their counterparts from other ethnic groups to join in the p

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Banks Slow in Disbursing Loans to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The disbursement of agricultural
loans by the banks under the post-flood agri-rehabilitation
program is far behind the expected level in Bangladesh, official
sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The total disbursement of agricultural loans during July and
December 1998, the first half of the current 1998-99 fiscal year,
was 14.42 billion taka (about 297.32 million U.S. dollars), less
than half of the total amount allocated by the government,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 32.7 billion taka (about 674.23
million dollars) in agriculture credits for the current fiscal
year, considering the heavy damage to the agricultural sector
caused by the devastating flood which swept two-thirds of the
country last year.
</P>
<P>
The government allocated 23.52 billion taka (about 484.95
million dollars) for the agri-loan program during the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged flood between July and September in 1998
destroyed 580,000 hectares of crops, causing a loss of about 40
billion taka (about 824.74 million dollars), while farmers lost
3.5 million tons of crops including 2 million tons of rice,
according to the Department of Agricultural Extension.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has increased the amount of loans to
cover the highest possible number of farmers and sharecroppers,
the disbursement rate is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
But bank officials expected huge disbursement of agri-loans
during January and February as these two months are the season for
transplanting boro paddy, an unseasonal and the biggest crop of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Many loan applications are under process throughout the
country while many farmers and sharecroppers are planning to apply
for loan," said an official of Sonali Bank, the largest
nationalized commercial bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
The amount of disbursement could have been a little higher if
the private banks would have joined the process of post-flood
rehabilitation program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Like the low disbursement, the recovery rate of agri-loan in
the first six months of the current fiscal year was also very low
compared with the same period last year, because of a government
decision to sanction new loans to a farmer rescheduling his
earlier loans.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of agri-loans was 8.05 billion taka (about 165.98
million dollars) during the first half of the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Military Joins Police in Hunt for Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest blast prompted Police Commissioner General Pracha
Promnok, top police commanders and Supreme Commander Mongkhol
Ampornpisit to hold an urgent meeting to discuss measures to
further counter bomb threats and to hunt for the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Mongkhol said after the meeting that the armed forces will
support police in security operations using whatever means are
requested.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached by the military and police,
military units will be ordered to send military police to join
city police on patrol. The bomb squad from the Army Ordnance
Department will be on standby around the clock to assist police in
any area as requested. Military intelligence units will forward
information about suspected bombing activity to police, Mongkhol
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces have tightened controls on arms to
prevent their personnel from selling weapons to criminals. But he
said weapons could still slip across the border from neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The military, beginning from 8 p.m. Friday night, dispatched 10
soldiers to every inter-provincial bus terminal in the city to
reinforce local police on regular duty.
</P>
<P>
As police car patrols are increased at shopping and business
centers, police commandos from the Crime Suppression Division will
be sent to police stations in Suburban Samut Prakan, Nonthaburity
and Pathum Thani provinces later Saturday for stepped-up security.
</P>
<P>
Pol. Gen. Pracha said the culprits of the recent spate of
bombings could be politically motivated opportunists wanting to
cause confusion, or they could be acting out of personal wrath.
</P>
<P>
He said police arrested suspects in two recent bomb hoaxes who
wanted to threaten their adversaries, but were not political
terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Thai Navy Denies Reports of Tension on Andaman Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Navy spokesman Rear Adm. Sathiraphan Geyanonda also denied
reports that Thailand had dispatched more frigates to a disputed
area in the sea following the clash, the second in less than a
month, The Nation newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the latest clash, four Myanmar navy officers were killed.
There was no report about the casualties on the Thai side. The
first clash on December 19 claimed the lives of two Thai navy
officers.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the latest skirmish, both Thailand and Myanmar
promptly protested to each other, claiming that the clash had
taken place in their respective territorial waters, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Ministry officials and military officers
maintained that the shooting on Tuesday occurred in Thai waters.
They said the Thai boat had fired on a "modified armed vessel"
which bore no flag to identify its country of origin.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here from Myanmar said Myanmar's Tatmadaw
(military) patrol vessel Yan Naing 510 had been on a routine
patrol when it was attacked.
</P>
<P>
There had been reports about the mobilization of more patrol
and naval boats on the Andaman Sea following the incident.
Thailand has warned fishing vessels in Ranong Province bordering
Myanmar to be extremely careful.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sawanit Khongsiri, the Thai Foreign Ministry's
deputy permanent secretary, is scheduled to meet Myanmar
Ambassador to Thailand U Hla Maung next week. Sawanit will
reiterate Thailand's call for a joint patrol operation, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Sawanit will also propose that Myanmar station a representative
at the Thai-Myanmar Border Coordination Center in Ranong to
coordinate with Thai officials so that future conflicts could be
prevented. Sawanit will suggest that the two countries establish
telephone hotlines for prompt contact.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
Friday called on the Zapatista National Liberation Army to meet
with its representatives over the dialogue about the conflict in
the southeastern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
Emilio Rabasa, the government coordinator for the dialogue,
said that the Mexican army is not in Chiapas to attack civilians,
instead its presence is necessary for the eradication of illicit
cultivation, a task it cannot renounce.
</P>
<P>
The official middleman said that the federal government "does
not want to see that the enforcement of law to prevent the
increase of these cultivation will cause conflicts with the
inhabitants of the communities that could result in violent
actions."
</P>
<P>
The government will not get involved in any provocation that
will hinder it from solving the conflict in Chiapas through
dialogues and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels rose in armed
uprising on January 1, 1994, demanding greater democracy and
better living conditions for the Zapatistas and respect for the
human rights of Indians in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than a hundred people have been killed in
sporadic clashes between pro-government and pro-rebel factions.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's new Foreign
Minister Syed Hamid Albar has urged China, Japan and South Korea
to actively play their roles in helping establish a new, better
and balanced world order.
</P>
<P>
There should be a better and balanced world order, said Syed,
who was appointed foreign minister on January 8, said in an
exclusive interview with the leading local daily Sin Chew Jit Poh
which was published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Syed said the Asia-Pacific region and even the world should not
be dominated only by the United States, but by world bodies or
bilateral and multilateral mechanisms in order to create a better
world order.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations should not be used by an individual
country as a tool to achieve its self interests, but should look
after the interests of the whole world and the mankind.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Japan are important powers politically,
economically and geographically in the region, hoping they make
effective contributions in the region to the formation of the new
world order. South Korea should also actively participate, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On Malaysia's foreign policy, the minister said that though
faced with pressure, Malaysia will not change its foreign policy
to try to please any country and will speak out its opinions and
stand on the issues that have impacts on world justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia always adheres to the policy of maintaining friendly
relations with other countries and on bilateral issues, Malaysia
seeks solutions through friendly means such as consultations and
understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will actively take part in multilateral affairs, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to continue and deepen such a foreign policy during

<HEADLINE> India Allows Foreign Firms to Do Domestic Wholesale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to allow foreign-owned trading companies to undertake
wholesale domestic trading in manufactured products, official
sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The condition is that the items are manufactured by a company
in which the foreign-owned firm has an equity stake or is a joint
venture partner.
</P>
<P>
While no other form of trading would be permitted by such
trading companies on the domestic market, exceptions will be made
in trading of items required for a project. Retail trading would
also remain out of bounds for the foreign trading companies
setting up shop in the country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, foreign-owned trading companies were not allowed to
sell their products on the domestic market, but could only export
Indian products. The relaxation followed Mitsubishi Corporation of
Japan seeking permission to broaden its activity in India. The
Japanese firm was allowed to set up an Indian arm, primarily to
coordinate procurement and supply of material and equipment to its
various projects.
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, Mitsubishi sought permission to market goods
and services, besides local procurement of material for its joint
ventures. It also wanted to provide other support functions to its
various projects.

CHONGQING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A leading county Party
official has been fired today following the arrest of three other
local officials for their involvement in the collapse on January
4 of a new steel bridge in southwestern Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaike, secretary of the Qijiang county Party Committee,
was removed from his post, and further investigation will be
conducted about his involvement in the tragedy, which killed at
least 40 people and injured 14.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was the county magistrate between February 1993 and
March 1997, and has been the secretary of the county's Party
Committee since then.
</P>
<P>
Built in February 1996, the 100-meter-long bridge in Qijiang
County collapsed because of poor quality and shocked the whole
nation with the heavy death toll.
</P>
<P>
Three county officials were earlier detained and charged with
dereliction of duty so far, including the deputy secretary of the

Fei Shangli, who is unqualified for building the bridge. The
other two officials are both deputy directors of the county's
Urban and Suburban Construction Commission.

the government fiscal deficit in a bid to revive economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The false belief ... that we would be incapable of carrying
through the fiscal adjustment program ... prompted Brazilians and
foreigners to start withdrawing their funds from Brazil,"
President Cardoso said in a nationally televised address Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision on allowing the currency to float
freely is designated to stem the flight of capital, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"In this way we are maintaining our reserves. The change in
the exchange rate band renews confidence in the economy and, in a
second phase, creates the conditions to cut interest rates," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president promised to reduce fiscal deficit, saying this
is the only way to promptly revive the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Brazil will continue to "rigorously" live up
to its international commitments, for it is important to have
support from the international community to shore up confidence
in Brazil
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed his support for new Finance
Minister Pedro Malan's efforts to lead Brazil out of the current
financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso addressed the nation as the market experienced
upheavals. The Brazilian currency plunged to 1.55 reals to the
U.S. dollar, before steadying at 1.45.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro made impressive
gains Friday by rising 33.4 percent and 30.3 percent
respectively, setting a new record ever since February of 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, back on Thursday, the stock indexes of the two
markets registered a drop of more than 9 percent, the sharpest
ever this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Defers Plan for Eurobond Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
deferred its plan for a 500 million U.S. dollar eurobond issue due
to the deterioration of the financial crisis in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"We will postpone it until market conditions improve," Finance
Undersecretary Joel Banares was quoted as saying by The Manila
Bulletin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the decision to drop the bond will not affect
the launch of a separate 500 million dollar euro-denominated bond
planned for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Philippines had originally planned a roadshow next month in
preparation for the launch of the bond issue in March following
its success of a 1 billion dollar global bond float earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Brazil plunged into financial turmoil Wednesday after its
currency, the real, was devalued by 8 percent against the dollar
and its central bank chief resigned.
</P>
<P>
Despite the eurobond offer postponement, 250 million dollars of
bonds convertible to shares in Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) will
still be launched next month, Banares said.
</P>
<P>
"We will concentrate first on the Meralco bonds because it is
insulated from the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meralco is partly owned by the government. The amount is
equivalent to the government's 10-percent equity in the
corporation.

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Wholesale Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) will not allow the building of any new
commodities wholesale markets and will upgrade existing ones,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official of the commission's Market
Department as saying that a lack of overall planning and
standardized management of the country's wholesale markets had
resulted in haphazard and poorly planned construction of new
markets and chaos in some regions.
</P>
<P>
As a countermeasure, the commission is formulating a national
commodities wholesale market construction and development
program, to guide the sound growth of the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The design and layout of a wholesale market in a region should
match the economic development conditions and the actual needs of
local agricultural and industrial production, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are more than 100,000 wholesale markets, but
only a few of them are modernized, according to incomplete
statistics from the commission.
</P>
<P>
The SETC circular urged the economic and trade commissions at
all levels to put the brakes on building new wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
Without approval from the State Council, no new market can
include in its name these words: China, national, or State, and
the new markets already approved by the State Council, should
register with the State Economic and Trade Commission prior to
January 31 this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The SETC official also said that the commission will highlight
transforming the existing wholesale markets, pushing them to
expand their transaction scales, enhance market functions and
develop an operating mechanism that conforms to the global market
practice.
</P>
<P>
The commission will collaborate with trade, price, quality
supervision, public security and taxation departments to improve
the order in the market, and crack down on fake and shoddy
products, price fraud and random charges of fees, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks 5 Billion U.S. Dollars in New Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia expects to secure 5
billion U.S. dollars from the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank and Japan to help finance the 1999/2000 budget deficit, The
Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the 1999/2000 state budget calls for some 10.32
billion dollars in foreign loans to plug a deficit projected to
reach 4.8 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The 1999/2000 fiscal year will begin April 1.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reporters on Friday that the Japanese
aid would come from the so-called Miyazawa Plan.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar is expected to meet with Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and other officials next week in Japan to discuss the
terms and conditions of the 30 billion dollar Miyazawa Plan, which
was promised by Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last year
to help revive crisis-hit Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has said that it would seek 3 billion
 dollars of the Japanese aid.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar also said that during his visit to Japan he would
request the loans promised by Japan as part of the Paris Club
agreement reached in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Under a sovereign debt rescheduling agreement reached between
Indonesia and the Paris Club creditor nations, the Japanese
government promised to provide Indonesia with 1.3 billion dollars
in new untied loans to compensate for the loan repayment of the
same amount that Indonesia must make to Japan during the 1998/99
fiscal year ending in March.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the government would keep a close eye on the
development of the rupiah, the local currency, and expected that
the Brazilian crisis would not spread to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Although the rupiah ranged between 7,000 and 8,000 to the U.S.
dollar during the last three months of last year, the currency
plunged to 9,300 rupiah on Friday before closing at 8,975 rupiah
following an 8-percent effective devaluation of the Brazilian
currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, said the currency crisis in Brazil, the
world's eight largest economy, might send Indonesia into a deeper
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The most damaging external factor to the Indonesian economy is
the occurrence of the second contagion effect," said Gadjah Mada
University economist Tony Prasetiantono.
</P>
<P>
The first contagion effect was the devaluation of Thailand's
baht in July 1997, which sent the rupiah along with other regional
currencies into a free fall.

<HEADLINE> More Beijing Residents to Travel Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing Exit and Entry Management Division of the Beijing
Municipal Public Security Bureau has handled about 1,000
applications for private passports for travel overseas daily
since the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 private passports were issued to applicants on
January 4 alone, senior officer Liu Chengshe said, adding that
the previous normal daily workload was only 500 to 600
applications.
</P>
<P>
The surging number of travelers overseas at holiday is
attributed to higher average family incomes, and changes in
lifestyles and uses of disposable income.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourist agencies also offered highly competitive
prices for overseas travel to attract Beijing residents.
</P>
<P>
The simplified procedures for the application for private
passports and shortened time for application were also important
factor in the increase of overseas travels by Beijing residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Beijing Municipal Exit and Entry division
approved 103,700 applications for private passports for overseas
travel, 11 percent more than 1997, figures released by the
division indicate.
</P>
<P>
The number was 2,500 for 1983 and 22,200 for 1988, the figures
show.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Crisis To Affect Oil Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Crisis could
cause a drop in the Latin American demand of energy, Claus Graf,
Vice President of Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Graf said that the PDVSA, the most important supplier to the
United States, is examining the demand of its customers to draft
a plan of emergency, as the company sells 70 percent of its
production to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Latin American countries reduce their oil
purchases, especially Brazil, the state oil company would have to
increase its sales to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Graf said that the PDVSA has planned a production target of
3.021 million barrels a day for this year, fewer than the
previously estimated target of 3.4 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela committed itself last month in the meeting of the
energy ministers from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico, for
reducing even more their output, from 525,000 barrels a day to
400,000 barrels a day, said Graf.

<HEADLINE> Albania Condemns Yugoslav FM's Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Defense Ministry
issued a statement Friday, condemning an accusation by Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic that Albania was a shelter of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic reportedly said, during his visit to Spain Thursday,
that Albania was a training ground for terrorists entering
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Jovanovic's accusation was a libel against
Albania and part of Yugoslavia's strategy aiming to make Albania
guilty before the international public opinion over the issue of
Kosovo, which is "on the verge of a bloody war plotted by the
Serb regime."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Belgrade and Tirana became constrained
because of the Kosovo crisis. Belgrade accuses Tirana of backing
the independence claim of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the
majority in the province, while Tirana condemns Belgrade for
violently treating these people.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the Albanian army is ready to
defend the country's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian daily newspaper Koha Jone said on Friday that the
Albanian army's tanks moved to the northeastern part of the
country, closer to the Yugoslav border in Kosovo, on Thursday
night "after reports that (Jovanovic) had threatened to attack
Albania".

<HEADLINE> China Deals with Plane-related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation sector
has vowed to step up crackdown on plane-related crimes to better
safeguard passengers and planes.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring airplane safety -- including preventing hijackings
and bombings -- will still be the first priority for civil
aviation police, said Liu Haoyang of CAAC's Public Security
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Intercepting drug traffic -- which has grown steadily in
recent years -- is another major job for police, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country's 23 airlines, with about 500
aircrafts, are carrying more passengers by the year, and
occurrence of plane-related crime is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Last year, airport police seized 44 kilograms of heroin, 4.7
kilograms of heroin melted into solution and 5.8 kilograms of
ice, a powerful stimulant, in 57 drug cases involving 105
suspected traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Hijacking occurred only once last year, when a Boeing 737 was
seized last October by flight captain Yuan Bin and his wife
between Beijing and Kunming in southwest China, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu also revealed that although CAAC's police fortified
protection measures in China's 140 civil airports, plane-related
crimes still number at least 400 each year.
</P>
<P>
The cases include hijackings, murder, transporting weapons or
hazardous goods, stealing airline property or passengers'
belongs.
</P>
<P>
CAAC's police received 595 criminal complaints, a rise of 22
percent over the 1997 figure. These included 352 serious ones, a
jump of 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the process, 379 cases were cracked, and 529 offenders were
seized, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that they have come up with effective ways to
deal with the drug traffickers who are so canny that they even
carry drugs in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu acknowledged that as China's air fleet and number
of passengers expand, the small number of airport police and
insufficient expenditures leave them really hard pressed to cope
with the rising number of crimes.
</P>
<P>
The climbing numbers of crimes, in which passengers illegally
interfered with flight or played jokes saying they brought bombs
with them are a thorny problem for air police, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than 20 such cases were reported and forced the
airplanes to come back or be rechecked.
</P>
<P>
Liu said CAAC needs to better publicize the law and rules to
raise public awareness.

HAVANA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's newly-appointed
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel arrived here on Friday to
make preparations for the visit of President-elect Hugo Chavez
starting on Saturday.
</P>

Cuba are neighbors of Colombia.

<P>
"The contributions will be decisive, without meddling in the
Colombian domestic affairs" Rangel said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson said he is going
to come right after Francois Botha and expect to beat his rival
down.
</P>
<P>
The former heavyweight champion said he knows only two things
about Botah. "He's white, and he can't beat me," Tyson said of
the South African he will face Saturday night in a 10-round fight
in the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was a 6-1 favorite to beat Botha, who won the IBF
heavyweight title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I expect him to go down, be out of cold," said Tyson, who
weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds, 10 short of Botha. It will be
Tyson's first fight after a layoff of 19 months.
</P>
<P>
"You never know until a guy is actually fighting," said Tommy
Brooks, Tyson's new trainer. "From what I've seen in the sparring
sessions, there is no ring rust."
</P>
<P>
Botha, 30, said he has made himself ready for an early attack.
"My strategy is the way Holyfield fought him. I will tie him up
when I have to and not stand still in front of him."
</P>
<P>
Tyson (45-3, with 39 knockouts) is getting $10 million for the
pay-per-view match. Botha's purse is $1.85 million.
</P>
<P>
Before the fight, organizers will stage a 12-round lightweight
bout between Goyo Vargas of Mexico and Ben Tackie of Ghana, and
an IBF junior lightweight title defense by Roberto Garcia of
United States and John Molina of Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- After six months waiting,
the Chicago Bulls officially named Tim Floyd their head coach
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a daunting task," said Floyd who dropped the
cap of the coach-in-waiting after arriving in Chicago for half a
year. "So if anybody wants to trade positions, come on."
</P>
<P>
Floyd will have to face a tough situation now. Michael Jordan
retired two days ago, Scottie Pippen is leaving. The Bulls have
just four players under contract.
</P>
<P>
"I do recognize the tradtion and I recognize what's at stake,
and I know there's a great deal at stake," he said. "But I'm
looking forward to this task. This is an incredible opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Floya, 44, has no NBA experience, but he has a good recored as
a college coach. He joined the Bulls in July under the name of
director of basketball operations, because Jordan had swore he
wouldn't play for anyone but Jackson.
</P>
<P>
"The same goal will remain in place, and that's to win a
championship at some point," Floyd said. "Whether it's a
patchwork type of situation or whether it's a long-term process
still remains to be seen. You just hope you can have a little fun
along the way with that journey, regardless of what it is."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gold Jewelry Exports Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's gold jewelry
exports have recorded a significant increase during the country's
18-month economic crisis as many traders have shifted their
markets overseas due to low demand at home, national newspapers
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 total domestic demand for gold jewelry reached 130 tons
while exports stood at zero. In 1997 domestic demand dropped by 30
percent to 92 tons while exports increased to 25 tons.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998 domestic demand reached only around 40 tons while
exports increased to 30 tons," said Leo Hadi Loe, country manager
of the World Gold Council.
</P>
<P>
Many people have even sold their gold jewelry to benefit from
the sharp increase in the price of gold from the impact of the
collapse of the local currency, the rupiah, against the U.S.
dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leo predicted that jewelry sales will increase this year by 10
percent in the domestic market and by 10 to 20 percent in the
export market.
</P>
<P>
Dubai and other Middle East countries were the biggest
importers of Indonesian gold jewelry, followed by Hong Kong,
Singapore and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Leo said the World Gold Council's recent survey in four
crisis-racked Asian countries -- Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea
and Malaysia -- shows that people still considered gold a good
investment during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Demand for gold in the crisis-hit Asian economies is predicted
to revive this year as it played an important role during the
economic crisis for people in those countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Affected Long Term Health of Veterans, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in the Gulf War has hit
the long term health of veterans, but there is no evidence that a
unique Gulf War syndrome does exist, studies into the UK veterans
have concluded.
</P>
<P>
Gulf veterans are three times more likely to show signs of
chronic fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorder than ordinary
troops, the London-based Gulf War Illness Research Unit reported
Friday in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The epidemiological research, the first of its kind in the UK,
studied the health of a random sample of around 3000 British
servicemen who served in the 1991 Gulf War and who completed a
detailed health questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
The results show that men who served in the Gulf War feel their
health to be significantly worse than comparable military
personnel who were not deployed there or who served in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Most, but not all, of them have relatively mild disorders and
complaints but all symptoms such as headache, fatigue, chest pain,
poor concentration were more common.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that our data constitute firm evidence that service
in the Gulf War has affected the health of servicemen," the
report's authors concluded.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot exclude possible unique biological mechanisms that
link Gulf War service and later ill health." the researchers
admitted.
</P>
<P>
They suggest anxiety over the long-term effects of chemical
attack, and the vaccinations taken as a precaution against them,
could have caused later illness.
</P>
<P>
However, the researchers reported that pattern of symptoms,
when analyzed, was the same in the Gulf, Bosnia and control
groups, suggesting that there is no specific "Gulf War Syndrome".

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sean Dundee has been told that
his Liverpool career is over and he is free to sign for
Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
However, the South African-born German said he is unlikely to
join the French club, who have offered 1.8 million pounds (2.98
million U.S. dollars) for him.
</P>
<P>
Dundee, who will meet Strasbourg director Claude De Roy on
Saturday, said: "Liverpool have allowed me to talk to them and I
will make a decision over the weekend, but I am 80 percent
certain that I will stay with Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay in England. I have had a lot of fun in this
country and I want a chance to play regular football here and
show what I can do."
</P>
<P>
Dundee, who was on the verge of a German cap last year only to
miss out through injury, has made only two substitute appearances
for Liverpool after his two million pounds summer move from
Bundesliga club Karlsruhe.
</P>
<P>
Recently he has been out of action due to a knee operation.
</P>
<P>
Dundee could now be a target for West Ham United who have been
monitoring his situation over the past few months and need a
striker following the 7.5 million pounds sale of John Hartson to
Wimbledon.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Coalminers' Strike Declared Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The court of Petrosani city
Friday declared the coalminers' strike in the Jiu Valley illegal,
and the miners threated to come to Bucharest unless their claims
are met.
</P>
<P>
Petrosani is the most important city in Romanian biggest
coalfield Jiu Valley area, 350 km west of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, at the call of their leader Miron Cozma, the
miners there went on a general strike to protest at the
government's measures for the restructuring of the coal mines
which caused huge losses despite substantial state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to close down the most unprofitable
mines in the area and to lay off their employees on substantial
redundancy pays to allow them subsistence until new jobs may be
found.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the proposal, the miners refused to go underground
and sent the government a list with 30 claims, among which
redundancy pay worth 10,000 U.S. dollars for each laid-off miner
and the grant of a 2-hectare plot of land. They also asked for the
dismissal of the Industry and Commerce Minister.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the delegation of miners, led by deputy
president of the Miners' Trade Unions Confederation Victor Badarca
and Governmental delegation led, on behalf of Prime Minister Radu
Vasile, by Secretary of State in the Industry and Commerce
Ministry Nicolae Staiculescu yielded no results.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Gavril Dejeu announced that he had taken
necessary steps to prevent the miners' travel to Bucharest.

UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday rejected Russian proposal to lift the oil embargo against
Iraq and abolish the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Peter Burleigh, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told
the press after the closed-door Security Council consultations on
Iraq that "We think both IAEA (the international Atomic Energy)
and UNSCOM have to continue functions in regard to disarmament of
Iraq. The question is how to get them into Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, down the road there is a need for a monitoring
system. But in the short-time and the medium term we reject the
proposal." Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
 The United States on Thursday proposed to allow Iraq to sell
as much as oil as it wants to purchase food and medicine for its
people.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Kanu Signs for Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League
champions Arsenal completed the signing of Inter Milan's
Nigeria striker Nwankwo Kanu on Friday after exhaustive medical
tests on the player.
</P>
<P>
The fee for the 22-year-old centre-forward, who already has a
European Cup and Olympic Games gold medal in his trophy cabinet,
is believed to be around 4.5 million pounds (7.46 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kanu finally signed after a transfer saga that has lasted
several months -- and after stringent medical tests which
included a specialist check-up from a cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
Kanu was discovered to have a heart valve defect shortly after
captaining Nigeria to the Olympic Games title in 1996 and missed
the following season.
</P>
<P>
But after tests Arsenal are happy the condition will not recur
and were also satisfied that a recent knee operation would not
have long-term effects on the player.
</P>
<P>
Kanu's arrival at Highbury ends the long search for a striker
by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.
</P>
<P>
His resources have been stretched this season following the
sale of Ian Wright to West Ham and injuries to both Dennis
Bergkamp and Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
Kanu came to prominence when, as a teenager, he helped Nigeria
win the World Under-17 Cup in Japan in 1993 and signed for Ajax
the following year.
</P>
<P>
He helped Ajax win the Dutch title in 1994 and the European
Cup in 1995 when he came on as a second half substitute for
Clarence Seedorf.
</P>
<P>
The following year, he scored the golden goal as Nigeria beat
Brazil 4-3 in the semi-finals of the Atlanta Olympics, before
they
went on to win the gold medal with a 3-2 victory over Argentina
in the final.
</P>
<P>
Kanu returned from a long lay-off caused by his heart problem
to make a belated Italian League debut for Inter last February
and then played for Nigeria in the 1998 World Cup in France.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Monitor Canada Agriculture Pact Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
announced plans on Friday to make sure that Canada lives up to a
recent farm trade accord to allow U.S. products to have more
access to Canada.
</P>
<P>
A new interagency team would monitor implementation of the
December 4 agreement, which calls on Canada to take a number of
steps to lower technical barriers to U.S. farm goods.
</P>
<P>
The decision came in a joint statement by U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman.
</P>
<P>
The interagency task force set up to monitor Canada's
compliance includes representatives from USTR, USDA, the National
Economic Council, the State Department, the Commerce Department
and the Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
A special subgroup will scrutinize imports of Canadian wheat to
find out more about the pricing practices of the Canadian Wheat
Board, a secretive state trading enterprise that has monopoly
control over Canadian wheat exports.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad we have seen some progress in December, but we view
the agreement and the results to date as a work in progress,"
Barshefsky said. "We are going to continue to work with our
agricultural industries to address their concerns."
</P>
<P>
The December 4 pact sprang out of protests last year by angry
U.S. farmers along the border with Canada.
</P>
<P>
The producers complained that regulatory differences in the two
countries gave Canadian farmers an unfair advantage and
contributed to a flood of imports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since the agreement, more than 25.5 million pounds of North
Dakota wheat and barley has been allowed to travel on the Canadian
rail system, providing U.S. shippers with an important new
transportation alternative, Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
That program will be expanded to include Montana and Minnesota
grain shipments in the coming days, she said.
</P>
<P>
Canada also implemented a new program on January 4 that will allow
North Dakota and Montana to truck wheat to Canadian primary
elevators for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of a quarantine requirement on U.S. hogs will
also enable U.S. producers to ship hogs to Canadian slaughter
facilities, "once market conditions and other factors are
conducive to trade," Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
In early February, the U.S. will also begin requiring importers
to list quality factors, such as grade, moisture content and
dockage levels on "end-use certificates" for imported Canadian
wheat.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture department will also require that importers
submit those certificates within 10 days of entry, instead of
15 days currently.
</P>
<P>
As part of the follow-up to the agreement, Glickman is expected
to meet with Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief in
February.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farmers have complained that Canadian producers have
access to certain farm chemicals not allowed for use in the United
States, and pay less for others because of differences in national
patent laws.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Arrangement for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Friday announced the approval of 1999 Pakistan's second
annual program under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF also completed the second review under the Extended
Arrangement and approved a purchase under the Compensatory and
Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF) in respect of a shortfall in
export earnings during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under these facilities, some 575 million U.S. dollar loans
which is about 409.48 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) will be
disbursed following the approval. Additional assistance of SDR 417
million under the EASF and SDR 379.1 million under the Extended
Arraangement will be made available during the remainder of the
program period.
</P>
<P>
The policies initiated by the current government in early 1997
and supported by the IMF under the ESAF and Extended Arrangements
were aimed at improving economic growth and reducing macroeconomic
imbalances. in 1997/98, Pakistan achieved real GDP growth of 5.4
percent while inflation was contained to less than 8 percent.
Meanwhile, the external current account deficit narrowed
substantially.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan government sets the macroeconomic objectives for
1998-2001 program of recovery in real GDP annual growth from 3-4
percent to 5-6 percent over the medium term, reduction in annual
inflation to about 6 percent in 2001/2002 and reduction of the
external current account deficit from about 3 percent of GDP in
1998/99 to less than 1.5 percent in 2001/2002.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Start "Baseball Diplomacy" with Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. delegation, including
the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, will travel to Cuba this
weekend for talks aimed at getting the ball rolling on U.S.-Cuba
"baseball diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Team owner Peter Angelos and officials from Major League
Baseball and Catholic Relief Services are due to meet Cuban
officials in Havana to discuss a possible two-game exhibition
series between the American League's Orioles and the Cuban
national team this Spring.
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball was to be represented by Sandy
Alderson, executive vice president for baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
"This is basically a fact-finding mission. They're going to see
what the Cubans have in mind. Everyone will discuss the
possibilities," said baseball spokesman Richard Levin in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
The administration granted the Orioles permission to make a
goodwill trip to Cuba last week as part of a larger initiative to
expand contact with the Cuban people and partially ease the
37-year U.S. economic embargo against Havana.
</P>
<P>
"They've been very open to the idea," said delegation member
Tom Garofalo, Cuba program director for Catholic Relief Services,
adding the group would probably return to the United States next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a positive reaction to this kind of interaction
because baseball is such a humanizing thing. And what we want to
do is humanize relations between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Catholic Relief Services, based in Baltimore, is the overseas
aid organization of the U.S. Roman Catholic Bishops. The group has
humanitarian program operating in 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the Orioles give the Catholic charity baseball
equipment, including balls, bats, gloves, uniforms and catchers'
gear, which gets distributed in several Latin American countries
including Cuba.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement could be reached in Cuba, the Orioles would
become the first major-league team to play on Cuban soil since the
Brooklyn Dodgers held Spring training in Havana in 1947.

<HEADLINE> Venables Set for New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Terry Venables is expected to
have his new consultative role at Crystal Palace ratified by a
board meeting on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The former England manager spoke of his admiration for
chairman Mark Goldberg after being locked in talks for four day
to resolve his future at the cash-strapped club.
</P>
<P>
Steve Coppell took training on Thursday and Friday and is
expected to be appointed temporary manager while Goldberg looks
for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
Venables said: "It has been a very difficult week because so
much has happened. So far we are just trying to make some sense
of it.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is very concerned about the financial position. The
talks have been very amicable.
</P>
<P>
"We have all got on very well and from moment one we were t
rying to decide what we shall do.
</P>
<P>
"My relationship with Mark Goldberg is good. There is no
danger to our friendship over this.
</P>
<P>
"From the first time I met him he had great plans for the club
and knew what he was after and that has not changed.
</P>
<P>
"If hard work has got anything to do with it he will get
there. I will give him as much support as possible."
</P>
<P>
Venables is still regarded as one of the finest coaches in
Europe and made no secret of his desire to continue in club
management despite standing down at Palace after just seven
months.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I definitely still want to coach. I have enjoyed
working with the players this year.
</P>
<P>
"Being in international football was wonderful experience but
I missed the day-to-day running of the club," he added.

<HEADLINE> Study Explains Why Stress Mother May Have Smaller Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Reduced blood flow through the
uterine arteries could partially explain why women who are anxious
during pregnancy tend to have smaller babies, British scientists
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This finding suggests that the psychological state of the
mother may affect fetal development and therefore birth weight,
the researchers from Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, west
London, reported in the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
They studied 100 pregnant women and found that women who were
more anxious during pregnancy had significantly abnormal patterns
of blood flow though the uterine arteries.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that the most likely explanation for the
mechanism is that high levels of adrenaline in the blood restrict
blood flow to the uterus and other organs to ensure a maximum
supply for the muscles.
</P>
<P>
"It may be that in times of stress the mother has evolved to
protect herself at the expense of her foetus," they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Swoop for Hartson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Welsh international John
Hartson was given a warm welcome by his new Wimbledon teammates
after completing a 7.5m pound move from West Ham.
</P>
<P>
The players lived up to the club's 'Crazy Gang' nickname by
hanging his designer tracksuit out of a dressing room window at
their training ground and setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old is believed to have signed a six-year contract
and could go straight into the first team against Tottenham at
White Hart Lane on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon owner Sam Hammam said Hartson would not receive any
superstar treatment from the club.
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is always to try to be stronger and that's it. We
are not looking for any special results. He's an addition to make
Wimbledon stronger than we were the day before. It's as simple as
that.
</P>
<P>
"The money is not an issue at all. It's football - we are a
football club. . I'm not a city man or a yuppie, I'm a football
man," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"I want the situation where I can dream of being in the top
three even though I'm almost certain we will not succeed. But I
want to give it a good bash. I don't want to reach old age and
look back and think I chickened out," Hammam added.
</P>
<P>
The deal smashes Wimbledon's previous transfer record of 2m
for Port Vale winger Gareth Ainsworth.
</P>
<P>
Manager Joe Kinnear, who has been chasing Hartson for some
time, admitted: "I'm delighted. John is a smashing lad and a
top-quality striker who has proved himself with 24 goals last
season. He's only 23 but he is experienced and skilful.
</P>
<P>
"People might wonder at the size of the fee for a club like
Wimbledon but I have half a dozen worth that much in my squad."
</P>
<P>
Hartson said: "This is a great move for me.
</P>
<P>
"Joe has worked wonders and I know Wimbledon's style needs
someone like me - a strong target man who can score goals," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rebound Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rebounded
sharply Friday after the Brazilian government decided to stop
defending its troubled currency, the real, with the federal
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 219.62 at 9,340.55
in closing session. The financial turmoil in Brazil drove the Dow
index down 353.75 to 9,120.93 in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Central Bank reversed its pledge Friday to
defend its currency and let the real to float freely on foreign
exchange markets. The currency immediately plunged about 15
percent to 1.55 reals against the U.S. dollar in trading.
</P>
<P>
The move got a positive response from the stock market in
Sao Paolo, the Latin America's largest exchange, pushing the
market up 20 percent in early trading as Brazilian shares
became cheaper for foreign investors. The market closed up 33.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision to float the real came two days after Brazil
announced the devaluation of its currency by 8 percent, which
triggered the financial turmoil in the country because world
markets feared a further devaluation of the real and investors
pulled their money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Broad indexes on Wall Street were also pleased with the
development in Brazil. The technology heavy Nasdaq was up 71.38
at 2,348.20 while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 31.07
at 1,243.26.
</P>

NYSE was up 12.32 at 593.39 and the American Stock Exchange
Index up 11.13 at 709.29.

promotional activities is 15 million euros per year.
</P>
<P>
The EU agriculture is facing great challenges in the years to
come, the commission said, so the EU should improve its
agricultural competitiveness on world marketplace in order to take
up these challenges and to penetrate the potential world market.
This will entail exports increasingly without refunds, while at
the same time putting emphasis on the quality and safety of its
products.
</P>
<P>
To date, the EU has conducted promotion campaigns in non-member
countries in a very small number of sectors, in particular olive
oil and fibre flax, the commission said. The results obtained are
very satisfactory and the use of these products outside the EU is
developing. This, the EU believed, should be considered as an
indicator to go on with similar activities for other agricultural
products.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Waste Decreases in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The annual production of all
radioactive waste in the European Union (EU) is approximately
50,000 cubic meters, which represents a dramatic reduction
compared with the previous figure of 80,000 cubic meters per year,
the European Commission said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commission just published its fourth report on the
situation of radioactive waste management in the EU member states.
However, the previous figure did not include those of Austria,
Finland and Sweden because the three countries were not EU member
States when the commission published its third report.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive arm, said the reasons for
the reduction are: first, construction of new power plants has all
but halted (except for France); second, a number of older plants
have been closed down definitively; third, nuclear power plant
operators have made tremendous efforts to reduce waste production
at source and fourth, advanced waste volume reduction techniques
are being applied.
</P>
<P>
So far, all EU member states with a nuclear power plant program
have practized radioactive waste disposal. Until the end of 1994,
a total of 1,640,000 cubic meters had been disposed of, either by
ocean disposal (until 1982), by surface and shallow disposal, or
by deep geological disposal.
</P>
<P>
However, long-lived heat-generating waste is stored on the
surface until deep facilities for their disposal become available.
Currently, a number of member states, the European Commission
said, are involved in preparatory work for disposal of this type
of waste, such as operating underground laboratories, seeking
sites or preparing licencing.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
met with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Friday in the
Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Tang positively evaluated the good development of
bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the results of
cooperation in all fields between France and China.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that there exist some common stands between France
and China, and that it is a fixed policy of the French authorities
to develop and strengthen relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is ready to work with China to seek new
progress of the relations, especially in the field of economic
cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that in 1999, China and France will mark the 35th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China pays great importance to its relations with
France, and recalled that the declaration on establishing a
comprehensive partnership signed by President Jiang Zemin of China
and President Chirac in May 1997 has fixed the framework and
direction for bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China appreciates the efforts made by Chirac in
developing bilateral relations, which have seen a good momentum of
development in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Tang agreed that the international situation is
experiencing a major and deep change and that the world is moving
toward a multipolar structure and is experiencing economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
They noted that crises still exist in the world, although the
forces in favor of peace are growing.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the role and authorities of the United Nations
and in particular the U.N. Security Council should be strengthened
in international cooperation aimed at maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that China and France should strengthen
coordination and consultation over international issues and work
together for establishing a new, just and fair international order
in the political and economic fields.

<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- France condemned on Friday the
attack on the verifiers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Two OSCE verifiers were injured by several isolated gunshots
apparently from a zone controlled by the Albanian separatist force
the UKC.
</P>
<P>
"This new act of violence is the more unacceptable as it was
aimed at the unarmed verifiers of the Mission of Verification in
Kosovo, whose only mission is to support a pacific solution," said
a French Foreign Ministry spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Friday that the
UKC wants to impose a solution which only they themselves prefer
-- independence of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community and Europe don't
support such a solution which will again destabilize the whole
Balkans and which is not necessary.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investors Lured to Eye Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has proposed tax credits and other measures aimed at increasing
investments in the country's inner city and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The White House, in a statement issued on Friday, said the
move, to be included in Clinton's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal,
would spur an estimated 15 billion U.S. dollars in new investments
in targeted areas.
</P>
<P>
The major point of the idea is a 25 percent tax credit on
investments in community development banks, venture funds and
other financial institutions that serve the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The tax credit scheme, costing some 1 billion dollars over five
years and aimed at generating 6 billion dollars in investments,
could benefit businesses such as small technology firms, shopping
centers or manufacturers in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include the setting-up of a domestic
organizaiton similar to the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation whose function is to promote growth in emerging
markets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Send Patriot Missile Battery to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Amid heightened tensions in
the northern no-fly zone in Iraq, the United States is sending a
Patriot missile battery to Turkey at the request of the Turkish
government, the Pentagon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday told reporters
a decision on the Patriots had been made but details remained to
be settled. The formal order to send the Patriot battery had not
been signed Friday, although the final go-ahead was likely soon.
</P>
<P>
But specialists from U.S. European Command in Germany were now
at Incirlik, Turkey, where there is a U.S. Air Force base for
warplanes to conduct monitoring mission over the northern no-fly
zone, U.S. officials said. They are making final arrangements for
the deployment of the Patriot missile battery.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also told a briefing
that the United States had agreed in principle to send the Patriot
missile battery to Turkey in case of an escalation of the conflict
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed in principle to send a Patriot battery to
Turkey," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said there was no specific Iraqi threat against
Turkey, but that Ankara's request was deemed reasonable in light
of the recent no-fly zone clashes.
</P>
<P>
Rubin echoed their comments, saying, "we see no immediate
threat to Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Four clashes took place between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air
defense radar sites in the northern no-fly zone this week, but no
incident has occurred Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, as all the U.S warplanes fly their mission from
Turkey's air force base of Incirlik, the Turkish government has
feared to be retaliated by Iraq's Scud missiles, which were used
during the Gulf War in 1991 when Iraq used to attack Israel's
target.
</P>
<P>
Patriots, operated by U.S. Army crews, originally were designed
to shoot down aircraft, but they have been modified for use
against shorter-range missiles. During the Gulf War, Israel used
the Patriots to counter-attack Iraqi Scuds.
</P>
<P>
Patriot batteries already are deployed in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Not for Extension of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos said here Friday that he believes U.N. chief Kofi Annan
will not ask for the extension of the mandate of U.N. observer
mission in Angola in his report to the Security Council, given the
series of mistakes the mission made in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in a speech delivered at the New
Year reception given for foreign envoys in Angola.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Africa, he said the turmoil in southern
Africa and renewed war in Angola marked a recession in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos admitted U.N.'s significant contribution to world
peace, but noted that the international organization failed to
effectively use its authorities in resolving conflicts in Africa
in terms of turning the authority into action.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. has made a mistake in treating an
illegitimate political party which has an army of its own equally
with the elected Angolan government.  Meanwhile, he accused the
U.N. of too lenient and sympathizing toward the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The biased attitude, said the president, has encouraged UNITA
Chairman Jonas Savimbi, who by despising the Lusaka Protocol
signed in 1994, finally launched a new and bigger war against the
government.
</P>
<P>
Taking this into account, dos Santos expressed his hope that
the mandate of the U.N. mission will not be extended.
</P>
<P>
Angola's national unity and reconciliation government is
capable of restoring law and order on its territories, he said,
adding that the Angolan people can and will overcome the enemy of
peace.
</P>
<P>
The current term of the U.N. mission in Angola will expire on
February 26. Annan is preparing for a report on the present
situation in Angola to submit to the Security Council for decision
on whether the U.N. mission should be withdrawn from the southern
African country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges India, Pakistan Not to Do Missile Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
urged India and Pakistan not to go ahead with missile tests as
some regional newspapers had predicted, the State Department said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have raised in the last day with both India and Pakistan
directly our concerns on this matter," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said many other countries had also urged both sides not to
take such actions.
</P>
<P>
"We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and to avoid
inflammatory actions that would heighten tensions and fuel a
missile arms race," Rubin said. "Missile tests would not be
helpful to efforts to reduce tensions and build confidence
through dialogue in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. embassies in the two countries have raised
concerns on the issue. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
will be visiting both later in the month to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
He stressed increased nuclear and missile capabilities by the
two sides also raised the possibility of related technologies
spreading to countries avowedly hostile to the United States.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan carried out underground nuclear tests last
year, challenging the U.S. policy of stopping the proliferation
of powerful weapons. Successful missiles would enable the two
countries to deliver nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Speed Up Clearance for Iraq Oil Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Friday it will speed up the process of clearing Iraq's requests
for oil spare parts through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to remove over half our holds on oil spare parts. We
will begin the process by lifting some holds today in New York,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United States will monitor the contracts for the parts to
make sure that they cannot be used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to enable Iraq to increase its oil production and
exports so that it can earn more money to buy food from abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to go the extra mile to ensure we do all we can
to improve the plight of the Iraqi people," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had set aside money for oil industry
parts during the last six-month period of the "oil-for-food"
program but some of the parts which Iraq ordered had tenuous or no
links with oil exports.
</P>
<P>
"In the current phase of the program, this set-aside for
equipment is continued, so it is now a more regular part of the
program. And since more money should be available we can be more
lenient about what is charged to this account," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Law Lords Explain U-Turn on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The five Law Lords, who handed
former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet a stunning procedural
victory last month, explained Friday why they decided to overturn
a ruling which denied Pinochet sovereign immunity.
</P>
<P>
They said one of the peers who made the first decision, Lord
Hoffmann, could not be seen to be impartial due to his close links
with the Amnesty International, a world-known human rights body
which insists that Pinochet should be tried.
</P>
<P>
"Public confidence in the integrity of the administration of
justice would be shaken if his decision were allowed to stand,"
one of the judges, Lord Hutton, wrote Friday.
</P>
<P>
The panel formed by the five Lords on December 17 overturned an
earlier ruling by the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
because of Lord Hoffmann's link with the Amnesty International.
The later ruling was regarded as a victory for 83-year-old
Pinochet, who is still in his battle to escape extradition to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Lord Hoffmann was part of a Lords panel who ruled by 3 to 2 on
November 25 that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution, dashing
his hopes of a speedy return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
The 25 pages of legal reasoning published Friday made no
accusation of bias against Hoffmann, but the judges were unanimous
that his links with Amnesty through a charitable subsidiary were
close enough to disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's immunity case will be reheard all over again before
a new panel of seven senior judges next Monday. This time Chile
will have the right to be represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The retired general was house-arrested on October 16 in a
London hospital where he was recovering from minor surgery. A
Spanish judge accused him of responsibility to the deaths and
disappearances of 3,000 people during his 1973-1990 rule over
Chile and requested for his extradition to face charges in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who became a Chilean senator for life after stepping
down as commander-in-chief of the army last March, is living under
police guard in a rented mansion in the suburb of London.
