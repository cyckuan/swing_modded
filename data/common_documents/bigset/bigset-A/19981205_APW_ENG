 &UR; Hong Kong crime boss executed in China

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung
was executed in China early Saturday in a kidnapping and
gun-running case _ immediately after losing his appeal, according
to China's official news agency.
	   Cheung, 45, alias ``Big Spender,'' was put to death just a day
after he got his final wish, a final visit from his two young sons.
	   Cheung was convicted in a sensational trial that focused on the
kidnappings of two top Hong Hong tycoons. The case raised troubling
issues about legal jurisdiction between Hong Kong and the mainland.
	   Four accomplices _ Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and
Chin Hon-sau _ also were executed after a court hearing that lasted
an hour and a half, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Henchmen Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan were given two-year suspended
death sentences, which might later be converted to prison terms,
while another 29 gang members lost their appeals on convictions
that carried jail terms of up to life imprisonment, Xinhua said.
	   Cheung and his mainland lawyers appealed his convictions after
the death penalty was handed down on Nov. 15, on grounds that
included Cheung's ``meritorious cooperation during the
investigation,'' Xinhua said.
	   Cheung's mainland lawyers had also questioned the jurisdiction
of mainland courts over crimes committed in Hong Kong _ which has a
more open court system and imposes no death penalty.
	   But the Guangdong Higher Court upheld the verdicts, saying
Cheung and his gang used mainland Chinese bases ``to plot, plan,
and prepare for crimes later committed in Hong Kong,'' according to
the Xinhua report.
	   Human rights campaigners from Amnesty International blasted the
court's decision as ``dubious,'' saying little evidence had been
presented to prove that the crimes were ``plotted, planned, and
prepared'' in China.
	   Amnesty expressed concerns over ``undue haste in rushing for
convictions,'' adding that some defendants may have been
``ill-treated or tortured'' by authorities seeking confessions.
	   Only Cheung's lawyer and some of his relatives were allowed
inside the mainland court 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the
border. The hearing was conducted amid heightened security,
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Cheung had fulfilled his last wish to see his two sons on
Friday. After a 30-minute meeting with the 4- and 7-year-old
children, Cheung told his father-in-law: ``Take care of my boys,''
the South China Morning Post reported.
	   Cheung and his gang members were tried behind closed doors for
spectacular crimes including smuggling of dynamite and guns from
China into Hong Kong, armed robbery of gold stores, and the theft
of 277 tons of steel. At least one person was killed in the crime
spree, during the steel heist.
	   The case riveted attention in Hong Kong, where the tycoons
reportedly were kidnapped and released only after the payment of
some U.S. dlrs 210 million in ransom.
	   Legal experts raised questions about the jurisdiction, noting
that some crimes committed in Hong Kong, which does not execute
people, were prosecuted in China as capital offenses in a trial
that had been closed to reporters.
	   ``The mainland does not place the same emphasis on the rights of
defendants as Hong Kong,'' the South China Morning Post said in an
editorial Saturday.

Thailand's King Bhumibol turns 71, clarifies stand on economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the
world's longest reigning monarch, celebrated his 71st birthday
Saturday, as the populace studied his national address advising
them on how to overcome the country's economic crisis.
	   King Bhumibol, the ninth king of the Chakri Dynasty, is revered
as a demigod by most Thais. Although he is a constitutional
monarch, his words carry great weight with the government and the
public.
	   In his address, delivered Friday evening to Thailand's top
politicians and bureaucrats at Chitrlada Palace, the king said the
country could not cut itself off from the global economy.
	   His words came at a time when xenophobia is on the rise as
various elements of society are fomenting a backlash against
economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund, which
is overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout package for the economy.
	   Pro-democracy groups, state enterprise workers and wealthy
businessmen have all been criticizing the government for allegedly
allowing the IMF to violate Thai sovereignty.
	   A foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged on Friday that Thais
are extremely sensitive to foreign pressure at the moment because
of the IMF reform requirements.
	   ``We are a country without foreigners coming as gold diggers,
but even if they do come, they will dig for us as well,'' the king
said.
	   The king, however, reiterated his message that Thais become more
economically self sufficient as a means of overcoming the economic
crisis.
	   In words laced with Buddhist influences, the king urged his
subjects to turn away from greed and intense desire for material
possessions.
	   ``If we know how to say `enough', we will not suffer from greed
and we will not exploit resources at the expense of others,'' King
Bhumibol said.
	   Thailand's environment has been ravaged by poorly-planned,
over-development. Farmers and other groups have protested,
complaining that development has benefited a wealthy clique and not
the general public.
	   The king has urged the country to put less emphasis on becoming
an industrial powerhouse and focus more on agriculture as a means
of self sufficiency because the majority of Thais are farmers.
	   With Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and his political adversary
former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh sitting in the front
row, King Bhumibol said: ``Quarrelling is dictated by emotions,
while discussion requires wisdom. We need to cooperate.''
	   King Bhumibol spent Saturday in private celebrations with his
family, but the public was able to send him birthday messages
through an internet website. The king is an avid student of
information technology.
	   Most businesses and government offices were closed, as his
birthday is a national holiday.
	   The coming year will be filled with special celebrations as the
king approaches his 72nd birthday in 1999. That would mark the
completion of his sixth 12-year cycle, an auspicious event for
Buddhists.

Report: Defense Ministry under fire for lax budget control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A government watchdog has warned of lapses and
lack of control in financial matters within Singapore's Defense
Ministry, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   In a report submitted this week to Parliament, the Public
Accounts Committee has singled out the ``laxity'' in tender and
procurement procedures, mistakes in the payment of in-camp training
pay and other lapses in accuracy and control, The Straits Times
said.
	   ``The number of instances taken together and their recurrence
convey a disturbing picture of the lack of control-consciousness in
the ministry,'' the report said.
	   ``This is dangerous as it increases exposure to fraud and
corruption,'' it added.
	   The report said that officers involved in procurement should
understand that sensitive price information could be leaked if fax
machines which receive competitive bids are placed in an open area.
	   Another example cited is that monies raised by the ministry for
charity and other projects ``were not diligently or scrupulously
accounted for.''
	   The committee urged better internal controls, in order to
prevent fraud and abuse in the ministry, whose annual budget runs
into billions of Singapore dollars (U.S. dollars).
	   The report also criticized the Land Office, which comes under
the Ministry of Law, for incomplete and inaccurate records of land
parcels and buildings.
	   This 3.1 million city-state prides itself of being free of
corruption, and imposes heavy penalties on transgressing officials.

Korean cinemas screen Japanese movie for first time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo SEL101

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An award-winning Japanese movie went
on release in South Korea on Saturday, marking the country's first
public screening of a movie imported from its former colonial ruler
in half a century.
	   ``Hana-Bi,'' or Fireworks, were screened with Korean subtitles
in 14 theaters in Seoul and 21 others in provincial cities. South
Korea has 300 cinemas.
	   The Piccadilly Theater in central Seoul, which had 1,019 seats,
said it sold 120 tickets for the film's first screening Saturday
morning. First viewers ranged from college students to older
Koreans who learned to understood Japanese during their
colonial-era education.
	   The cinema said the crowd would increase in the afternoon but
did not expect it to match big crowds attracted to Hollywood films.
	   In October, South Korea lifted the ban on importing Japanese
comic books, magazines and international award-winning movies in
the first phase of what it called a ``gradual'' opening to Japanese
pop culture.
	   Japan ruled Korea from 1910-45 as a colony. Japanese music,
movie and other pop culture items had officially been banned for a
half-century because of Korea's deep animosity toward its island
neighbor.
	   Despite the ban, however, Japanese pop culture has been making
inroads here for years, aided by satellite TV and smugglers.
	   After visiting Tokyo in October, President KIm Dae-jung urged
his nation to bury old animosities and embrace Japan, with which it
will play co-host to 2002 World Cup soccer finals, the first ever
in Asia.
	   ``Hana-Bi,'' directed by Takeshi Kitano, won the grand prize at
the Venice international film festival last year.
	   Another Japanese film, ``Kagemusha,'' or Shadow Warrior, was to
be released here later this month.
	   During the Japanese colonial rule, Korean men were forced to
work in coal mines in Siberia and elsewhere, Korean women were
conscripted as sexual slaves for the World War II Japanese Army,
and children were prohibited from using their Korean names and
language in school.

Official: Traffic to decline this year at Singapore's Changi
</HEADLINE>
Airport

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Changi Airport is expecting a
decline in passenger traffic this year for the first time since its
opening in 1981, reports said Saturday, quoting a government
official.
	   More than 25 million passengers and 1.3 million tons of cargo
have been passing through Changi annually in recent years.
	   But in 1998 the traffic could shrink as the economic crisis
takes its toll on the tourist industry in Singapore and the region,
Peter Chen, Senior Minister for Education, was quoted as saying.
	   Responding to the crisis, Singapore recently cut aircraft
landing fees at Changi by 10 percent for a one year period. It also
slashed rentals of shops, warehouses and offices at the airport.

Congo cease-fire to be signed at Dec. 14-15 summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The countries at war in Congo are expected
to sign a formal cease-fire at a summit in Zambia on Dec. 14-15 and
the rebels are talking about how they can be brought on board, a
senior U.N. official said Friday.
	   A cease-fire agreement will hopefully be followed by deployment
of an African or U.N. peacekeeping force in the Congo with at least
15,000 personnel, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Paris last week, leaders of Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and
Congo made a commitment to end the war, to strive for an immediate
cessation of hostilities, and to sign a cease-fire agreement.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who attended the Paris
summit, has been working for months to try to avert an all-out war
in the Congo, which could lead to a regional conflagration.
	   The U.N. official said some of the Paris commitments were
already starting to be implemented.
	   Congo rebels, who didn't participate in the Paris talks and
initially reacted negatively to the outcome, traveled to Uganda
three days ago and are talking to President Yoweri Museveni ``about
how they could be brought aboard for the cease-fire,'' the official
said.
	   Rwanda has ordered a halt to military action unless its forces
are attacked and a summit has been scheduled in the Zambian
capital, Lusaka, on Dec. 14-15, he said.
	   ``We expect that during that summit, a formal cease-fire would
be signed by all the concerned countries,'' the official said.
	   The secretary-general has been talking to Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba and participants at the Paris conference ``to
encourage them to attend the Lusaka summit with a spirit of
openness and compromise,'' the official said.
	   During the summit, the rebels will be in Lusaka, just as they
were in Paris, but it's doubtful that they will attend the meeting
or sign the cease-fire because that would set a precedent which
countries like Uganda and Rwanda probably could not accept, the
official said.
	   The rebels are trying to overthrow Congo's President Laurent
Kabila, who came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy
in his renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say
his regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   After the cease-fire is signed, the United Nations will be
involved in its implementation and efforts to bring peace to the
Congo. But the scope of the involvement will depend on the Security
Council and other U.N. organs.
	   ``Many are thinking that this time the U.N. should deploy a
peacekeeping force, or a U.N. peacekeeping force together with an
Organization of African Unity observation force,'' the U.N.
official said.
	   That will be determined at an OAU meeting in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, on Dec. 17-18.
	   To deploy a U.N. peacekeeping force would require a formal
cease-fire and its implementation, agreement of all governments
concerned, adequate security, a clear mandate from the Security
Council and sufficient resources, the official said.
	   According to the current evaluation, a ``near minimum'' force
should have at least 15,000 personnel, he said.
	   U.N. officials recognize that such a large peacekeeping
operation will be costly.
	   ``I hope the U.N. will evaluate both the pros and cons of having
a peacekeeping force and not having it, because ... this is the
center, the heart of Africa geographically and geopolitically. You
have nine countries all around that can be affected by
disintegration of the Congo,'' the U.N. official said.

Asian Games open Sunday with everything from archery to wushu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For cricket and American football, look
elsewhere. Just about any other sport you might think of _ and some
you might not _ is on display over the next two weeks in Asia's
version of the Olympics.
	   Although Asia's financial crisis has led to shrinking teams and
headaches for Thai organizers, there still will be some 6,000
athletes from 41 nations, competing for a total of 377 gold medals.
	   The first will be decided Sunday morning, in the women's
marathon, hours before King Bhumibol Adulyadej formally declares
the Asian Games open. Soccer preliminary rounds among 23 teams
already have been under way for a week.
	   China, which overtook Japan at the 1982 games as Asia's dominant
sports power, was a runaway winner in the 1994 games in Hiroshima,
Japan, winning 135 gold medals. The biggest rivalry is between
Japan and South Korea for second place. In 1994, South Korea won 63
golds and 179 medals in all, to 59 golds and 207 in all for Japan.
	   Among additions to the program this time is ballroom dancing,
labeled ``dancesport,'' although it is just for demonstration.
Among other things, the Asian dancers will be judged on how well
they move to a Latin American beat.
	   The 36 medal sports include everything from archery to
wrestling, from beach volleyball to billiards _ another new
addition.
	   Some are strictly Asian _ the tag-like sport of kabaddi, the
no-hands volleyball-type sport of sepak takraw, the Chinese martial
arts called wushu, and an Asian variant of tennis played with a
soft rubber ball. Regular tennis is also on the program.
	   Some have spread from Asia _ judo, karate, taekwondo.
	   In sports such as track and field, Asians generally lag behind.
But they have world class athletes in archery, badminton, baseball,
softball, gymnastics, shooting, squash, swimming, diving, table
tennis and weightlifting.
	   While some of the athletes are Thailand's neighbors in the
tropics _ including the small teams from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia
and Myanmar _ the Mongolians have arrived from winter temperatures
of minus 25 Celsius (minus 13 F).
	   The lineup also ranges from amateur canoeists and horse riders
to professional baseball, soccer and basketball players. South
Korea's baseball team has the services of Park Chan-ho, a Los
Angeles Dodgers pitcher who won player of the month honors in July
in the U.S. National League.
	   For the first time at an Asian Games, the riders can bring their
own horses. Thailand is taking steps to see that no animal
illnesses are spread.
	   China has made strenuous efforts to avoid the scandal that arose
at the 1994 games, where 11 of its athletes, including seven
swimmers, failed drug tests. Another four were caught at the world
swimming championships in Perth, Australia, in January this year.
	   In the month before these games, Chinese officials said, they
carried out more than 500 drug tests. At least one athlete tested
positive, they added, but they refused to give any details.
	   Thai organizers have been working strenuously too, trying to
make sure everything was ready on time after a slow start that led
to threats at one point to move the games elsewhere.
	   Bangkok is host for the fourth time. It had to organize 14
sports in 1966, 13 in 1970 _ when it stepped in after South Korea
had to withdraw as host, and 19 in 1978.
	   Just as it tried to accelerate preparations for the 36-sport
1998 games, Asia was hit with a financial crisis that started in
Thailand. Currency and stock values plunged, while costs and
unemployment soared.
	   Organizers now believe they have solved most of their problems,
and hope that spending by games visitors will help lift the
economy.
	   There still were last-minute bugs to be dealt with _ literally.
A special team has been assigned to keep out insects that had
covered the swimming pool.
	   Traffic is always a problem. A bus ride from downtown to the
nearest sports complex can take 25 minutes in off hours _ and more
than two hours at peak travel time.
	   Some teams also worry about the attractions of Bangkok night
life.
	   Sri Lanka has an army general, Upali Bandaratillaka, watching
over its athletes.
	   ``Even if they want to go to shopping, one of us will accompany
them,'' he said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India's contingent at the Asian Games
already has a plateful of problems _ injuries, angry letters from
coaches, and petty squabbling. But some dark horses may come to the
rescue.
	   India's brightest hope for gold, tennis ace Leander Paes, has
pulled out with a heel injury.
	   Veteran female runner P.T. Usha, nursing an injury, hasn't
arrived yet, a day before the formal opening.
	   And as many as five foreign coaches hired by India for the
Bangkok games have complained that meddling officials are undoing
their work.
	   ``In an event of this proportion, there are always some loose
ends,'' said G.S. Mander, leader of the Indian contingent.
	   ``But this does not mean that we are not going to perform well.
We will indeed,'' Mander, a retired senior police officer, said in
an interview.
	   Heading India's track and field medal chase among the men are
Bahadur Prasad at 1,500 meters, Gulab Chand at 5,000 and 10,000,
Paramjeet Singh at 400, shot putters Shakti Singh and Bahadur
Singh, and discus throwers Anil Kumar and Ajit Bhaduriya.
	   Among women, the best prospects are runners Usha and Jyotirmoyee
Sikdar, discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh and the 4x400 relay
team.
	   The Indians fell to an all-time low in medals at the 1994
Hiroshima games, collecting only 22 _ four gold, three silver and
15 bronze. That was a sharp fall from the high of 57 medals that
the nation of 980 million people garnered at home in the 1982 games
in New Delhi.
	   Runner Paramjeet Singh, with a best of 45.70 seconds at 400
meters, is a dark horse to challenge Japan's Masayoshi Kan, who has
run 45.33.
	   Bahadur Prasad ran the 1,500 in 3:41.90 at a recent home meet,
and could challenge South Korean Kim Soon-hyung and Qatar's
Mohammed Suleiman.
	   Gulab Chand will face tough competition from Qatar's Ahmed
Ibrahim Warsama and Japan's Toshinarti Takaoka.
	   Shot putter Shakti Singh's 19.73 meters and Bahadur Singh's
19.59 at home meets are two top performances in Asia this season,
raising hopes for Indian medals here.
	   Anil Kumar, cricketer-turned-discus thrower, is confident of
doing well. He has thrown 58.95 meters at a home meet, but needs to
exceed 60 to gain a medal from his first foray into the Asian
arena.
	   Usha, who won four gold medals at the 1986 games, is back from a
retirement started in 1991. At the Asian Track Championship in
Japan in July, she anchored India's 4x100-meter relay team to a
gold.
	   But in Bangkok, injuries and lack of practice may force her to
choose just one of her two favorites races the 200 and 400 meters.
	   Team leader Mander declined to discuss off-field problems facing
his contingent, saying some are being blown out of proportion. Some
of the remarks attributed to Indian athletes and coaches in Bangkok
media about not having enough money to eat were pickups from old
interviews.
	   But other Indian officials admitted that morale was not high
among the Indians. Five foreign coaches from Cuban, Uzbekistan,
Ukraine, Mongolia and Bulgaria have complained that they have not
received enough support from Indian officials for the Asian meet.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The last main fighting force of the
Khmer Rouge, the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two
million Cambodians, surrendered to the government in a ceremony
broadcast on national television Saturday.
	   Khem Nuon, chief of staff of the remaining band of guerrillas,
negotiated the deal with representatives of the Phnom Penh
government on Friday at Preah Vihear temple near the border with
Thailand.
	   ``We ask for permission from the Royal Government of Cambodia to
rejoin society and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces,'' Khem Nuon
said in Friday's surrender statement, broadcast Saturday.
	   The Khmer Rouge laying down their arms brings to an end more
than 30 years of civil war in Cambodia that began with the Marxist
guerrillas' insurgency against the government in Phnom Penh in the
late 1960s.
	   Not included in the surrender deal, however, were the fighters'
three top surviving leaders, Tak Mok, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
	   Khem Nuon, who served as their chief of staff, indicated the
rank and file had broken with the three.
	   ``All of us are committed to not believing and following Ta Mok,
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the criminals, anymore,'' he said.
	   In a telephone interview with Nate Thayer of the Far Eastern
Economic Review, who first broke news of the surrender, Khem Nuon
said the three were ``retired'' and refused to give more details.
	   Although the three no longer command any troops, their former
followers apparently did not want to give them up.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States has expressed a
desire to capture all three and make them stand trial for genocide
and crimes against humanity.
	   Khem Nuon claimed he was negotiating on behalf of 5,000
remaining ragtag troops and 15,000 civilians living under Khmer
Rouge control.
	   Thayer said, however, that he believed the estimate of fighting
men was inflated, and that many of the civilians are living in the
Phu Noi refugee camp in Thailand.
	   Thayer, who in 1997 became the first journalist to interview the
late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, is one of few outsiders trusted by
the guerrillas. Pol Pot hadn't been seen in public in nearly two
decades until Thayer's interview. The former leader died in April
this year after his men had turned against him.
	   ``There must be unity. There is no other way. There is no way
for a military solution. No weapons. Only political struggle,''
Thayer said Khem Nuon told him in a telephone interview.
	   The government was represented at the negotiations by Meas
Sopheas, deputy chief of staff of the Cambodian military.
	   Under the agreement, the remaining guerrillas will join the
government army and the civilians will return to Anlong Veng, the
guerrillas' former stronghold in the north.
	   While it is possible there are some tiny bands of guerrillas
still wandering the jungles, Thayer said he knew of no sizable
Khmer Rouge fighting force that could pose a viable threat to the
government.
	   Any remaining bands that might exist are isolated and not
operating under central leadership or support.
	   The surrender comes less than a month after Cambodian strongman
Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom he ousted as co-prime
minister in a bloody 1997 coup, struck their own deal to end the
country's deadlocked political conflict.
	   There are still tensions between the two, but they have
succeeded in forming a working government recognized by the United
Nations and the international community for the first time in more
than a year and a half.
	   Although Cambodia still faces many problems, with the Khmer
Rouge laying down their arms and Hun Sen and Ranariddh working
together, the country is poised to begin perhaps its most
potentially stable period in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge came to power in April 1975 by overthrowing the
U.S.-backed Lon Nol government.
	   Under the leadership of Pol Pot, they emptied out the cities and
attempted to turn the country into an agrarian utopia by herding
the population on to collective farms.
	   The experiment was a disaster economically and in human terms.
Famine soon affected many parts of the country. Those suspected of
harboring opposing views, or merely of being educated, were put to
death.
	   Nearly two million people died of execution, overwork,
starvation or disease under the Khmer Rouge until they were ousted
from power by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
	   They fought a guerrilla war against successive governments ever
since, but wings of their movement began defecting to the
government starting in 1996, leaving only the hardliners in the
north left carrying on their struggle.
	   That struggle ended Friday.

 &UR; Hong Kong crime boss executed in China

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung
was executed in China early Saturday, immediately after losing his
appeal in a kidnapping and gun-running case, China's official news
agency reported.
	   Cheung, 45, alias ``Big Spender,'' had been convicted in a
sensational trial that focused on the kidnappings of two top Hong
Hong tycoons. The case raised troubling issues about legal
jurisdiction between Hong Kong and the mainland.
	   Cheung was put to death just a day after he got his final wish,
a visit from his two young sons. The state-run Xinhua News Agency
provided no details of the execution, but capital punishment in
China is normally carried out with a single bullet to the back of
the head.
	   Four accomplices _ Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and
Chin Hon-sau _ also were executed after a court hearing that lasted
an hour and a half, Xinhua reported.
	   Henchmen Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan were given two-year suspended
death sentences, which might later be converted to jail terms.
Another 29 gang members lost appeals on convictions that carried
prison sentences of up to life, Xinhua said.
	   Cheung and his mainland lawyers appealed after the death penalty
was handed down on Nov. 15, on grounds that included Cheung's
``meritorious cooperation during the investigation,'' Xinhua said.
	   But the human rights group Amnesty International expressed
concerns that some of the defendants might have been ``ill-treated
or tortured'' so they would confess.
	   Cheung's mainland lawyers also questioned the jurisdiction of
mainland courts over crimes committed in Hong Kong _ which has a
more open court system and imposes no death penalty. Cheung's case
was the first high-profile cross-border trial since the territory
reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last year.
	   ``The mainland does not place the same emphasis on the rights of
defendants as Hong Kong,'' the South China Morning Post said in an
editorial Saturday.
	   Cheung's lawyers wanted the case transferred to Hong Kong, but
authorities here had no evidence.
	   The alleged kidnappings of the two tycoons _ identified in
newspapers as Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing; and
Walter Kwok, chairman of the big developer Sun Hung Kai Properties
_ were never reported to Hong Kong police.
	   Cheung's gang was said to have netted the equivalent of U.S.
dlrs 210 million in ransom payments.
	   The Guangdong Higher Court upheld the verdicts, saying Cheung
and his gang used mainland Chinese bases ``to plot, plan, and
prepare for crimes later committed in Hong Kong,'' according to the
Xinhua report.
	   Amnesty International blasted the ``dubious'' court ruling,
saying little evidence had been presented about any conspiracy
carried out on the mainland.
	   Security was tight at Saturday's appeals hearing in the the
provincial capital of Guangzhou, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north
of the border, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Television footage showed relatives of the defendants leaving
the courtroom, some crying, others angry.
	   ``The verdict was unjust. They did not commit the crimes,'' said
a male relative who appeared on Hong Kong-based Asia Television but
was not identified by name.
	   Cheung fulfilled his wish to see his two sons on Friday. After a
30-minute visit with the 4- and 7-year-old children, Cheung told
his father-in-law: ``Take care of my boys,'' the South China
Morning Post reported.
	   Cheung and his gang members were tried behind closed doors for
spectacular crimes that also including the smuggling of dynamite
and guns from China into Hong Kong, armed robberies of gold stores,
and the theft of 277 tons of steel. At least one person was killed
in the crime spree, during the steel heist.

Chinese army hands over businesses to Beijing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's military has handed over 68 enterprises
in Beijing to the city government as part of a Communist
Party-ordered housecleaning, the official Beijing Daily reported
Saturday.
	   The People's Liberation Army transferred the 68 enterprises,
with total assets of 1.4 billion yuan (dlrs 170 million), to the
Beijing government on Friday, the newspaper said. It added that the
businesses covered real estate, pharmaceuticals, trade and
transportation.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin in July ordered the military and
the armed police to divest their vast business holdings. The order
sought to combat corruption and force the military to concentrate
on national defense, instead of making money.
	   A senior government official last week said the military would
be able to meet a Dec. 20 deadline. Other government departments
and the judiciary have been given until the end of the year to
sever their ties with their commercial enterprises.
	   The army ventured more and more into private enterprise over the
course of China's 20-year reform drive to balance off a drop in
state funding.

Court delays hearing to free Anwar on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim's
hearing on an appeal to free him on bail was adjourned Saturday
after a court debated whether it had the right to hear the case.
	   The three-member Court of Appeal delayed ruling on Anwar's case
a second time after asking lawyers from both sides to present
arguments on an earlier ruling that says that not all appellate
cases are to be heard by the court.
	   The higher court moved the hearing to Dec. 12.
	   Last Saturday, the three appeal judges postponed the bail
hearing for similar reasons. A decision by them not to hear Anwar's
case could potentially thwart any further attempts to free Anwar on
bail.
	   Anwar's bail application has been turned down by a lower court
once and an appeal against it also failed. Trial Judge Augustine
Paul said Anwar's lawyers weren't able to prove that he would not
tamper with witnesses if released on bail.
	   Anwar currently is facing trial on 10 charges of abuse of power
and sexual misconduct, charges he denies and calls politically
motivated.
	   He was arrested Sept. 20 under a special security law only hours
after organizing a mammoth rally in the capital. During that
protest, he called for sweeping government reforms and the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after deeming him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.

	   UJUNGPANDANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Weeping Roman Catholics consoled
and hugged each other Saturday in the ashes of their church that
was burned down by angry Muslim mob.
	   Hundreds of troops and police patrolled the city of Ujungpandang
on Sulawesi island. Civilian guards stood watch over other places
of worship in the city, 840 miles (1,350 kilometers) east of
Jakarta.
	   Friday's attack on the Kare Catholic Church was the latest in a
series of tit-for-tat violence between the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority in Indonesia.
	   Social tensions are on the rise in the world's fourth most
populous nation amid political turmoil, student protests and the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The sectarian attacks come atop of a dramatic climb in
Indonesia's crime rate and sporadic outbreaks of riots and looting
in some parts.
	   During the past two weeks at least 25 churches and 18 mosques
have been set afire or ransacked by the followers of rival faiths
in five cities and towns across the sprawling island nation of more
than 300 ethnic groups.
	   ``I saw brutality and cruelty. I don't really understand why
devoted religious followers attack other places of worship,'' said
Rev. Van Rooy, a Dutch-born priest assigned to the Kare Church.
	   ``The mob came in through the front. They jumped over the fence
and climbed through the windows.
	   ``I wanted to defend my church. But we are Christian, we are
just a minority compared with the crowd,'' he said of Friday's
attack.
	   A mass of mourning will be held in the ruins on Sunday, he said.
	   Other witnesses said the mob of several thousand shouted ``God
is great'' and ``burn'' as some carried cans of kerosene inside.
	   Pews and prayer books were placed in heaps and set on fire.
Statues and other holy ornaments were smashed. The church's walls
and roof collapsed.
	   Police said the attacks took place after weekly prayers ended at
nearby mosques and appeared to be an act of revenge for assaults
against Muslim places of worship earlier.
	   On Monday Christian rioters in the city of Kupang, southeast of
Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques in retaliation for the
Nov. 22 burning of churches in Jakarta.
	   Police said 22 churches had been attacked in the capital,
including four that were burned.
	   Many of Indonesia's Christians are ethnic Chinese, who are often
targeted when social unrest flares because of their relative
wealth. Residents said most Chinese shops in Ujungpandang remained
shut Saturday.
	   ``I feel so sad and angry. But we not able to do anything
because we are the minority,'' said a 45-year-old Chinese Christian
woman too scared to give her name.
	   Islam arrived in the 7th century. Now 90 percent of Indonesia's
202 million people are Muslim, making it the world's biggest
Islamic nation. Others are Christian, Buddhist and Hindu.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The attacks come despite repeated calls for calm by Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie as well as Muslim and Christian religious
leaders.
	   Indonesia's security problems have worsened since May when
deadly riots and protests helped oust Habibie's predecessor and
onetime mentor, President Suharto, to quit.
	   For 32 authoritarian years Suharto used iron fisted methods to
keep a lid on the archipelago's social and ethnic rivalries, often
at the expense of human rights.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung
was executed in China early Saturday, immediately after losing his
appeal in a kidnapping and gun-running case, China's official news
agency reported.
	   Cheung, 43, alias ``Big Spender,'' had been convicted in a
sensational trial that focused on the kidnappings of two top Hong
Hong tycoons. The case raised troubling issues about legal
jurisdiction between Hong Kong and the mainland.
	   Cheung was put to death just a day after he got his final wish,
a visit from his two young sons. The state-run Xinhua News Agency
provided no details of the execution, but capital punishment in
China is normally carried out with a single bullet to the back of
the head.
	   Four accomplices _ Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and
Chin Hon-sau _ also were executed after a court hearing that lasted
an hour and a half, Xinhua reported.
	   Henchmen Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan were given two-year suspended
death sentences, which might later be converted to jail terms.
Another 29 gang members were convicted and sentenced to prison
terms of up to life, but two had their jail time reduced on appeal,
Xinhua said.
	   Cheung and his mainland lawyers appealed after the death penalty
was handed down on Nov. 15, on grounds that included Cheung's
``meritorious cooperation during the investigation,'' Xinhua said.
	   But the human rights group Amnesty International expressed
concerns that some of the defendants might have been ``ill-treated
or tortured'' so they would confess.
	   Cheung's mainland lawyers also questioned the jurisdiction of
mainland courts over crimes committed in Hong Kong _ which has a
more open court system and imposes no death penalty. Cheung's case
was the first high-profile cross-border trial since the territory
reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last year.
	   ``The mainland does not place the same emphasis on the rights of
defendants as Hong Kong,'' the South China Morning Post said in an
editorial Saturday.
	   Cheung's lawyers wanted the case transferred to Hong Kong, but
authorities here had no evidence.
	   The alleged kidnappings of the two tycoons _ identified in
newspapers as Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing; and
Walter Kwok, chairman of the big developer Sun Hung Kai Properties
_ were never reported to Hong Kong police.
	   Cheung's gang was said to have netted the equivalent of U.S.
dlrs 210 million in ransom payments.
	   The Guangdong Higher Court upheld the verdicts, saying Cheung
and his gang used mainland Chinese bases ``to plot, plan, and
prepare for crimes later committed in Hong Kong,'' according to the
Xinhua report.
	   Amnesty International blasted the ``dubious'' court ruling,
saying little evidence had been presented about any conspiracy
carried out on the mainland.
	   Security was tight at Saturday's appeals hearing in the the
provincial capital of Guangzhou, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north
of the border, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Television footage showed relatives of the defendants leaving
the courtroom, some crying, others angry.
	   ``The verdict was unjust. They did not commit the crimes,'' said
a male relative who appeared on Hong Kong-based Asia Television but
was not identified by name.
	   Cheung fulfilled his wish to see his two sons on Friday. After a
30-minute visit with the 4- and 7-year-old children, Cheung told
his father-in-law: ``Take care of my boys,'' the South China
Morning Post reported.
	   Cheung and his gang members were tried behind closed doors for
spectacular crimes that also including the smuggling of dynamite
and guns from China into Hong Kong, armed robberies of gold stores,
and the theft of 277 tons of steel. At least one person was killed
in the crime spree, during the steel heist.

 &UR; Appleby takes third-round lead &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with end of play Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian golfer Stuart Appleby
fought the Royal Adelaide wind and rough Saturday to shoot an
even-par 72 and take a one-stroke lead into the final round of the
Australian Open.
	   Appleby, the first-round leader, has a one-stroke lead over
England's Nick Faldo and Australian Greg Chalmers (74). Faldo and
Appleby played in the same pairing Saturday, with Faldo also
shooting 72 after starting off with three consecutive birdies.
	   The Australian has a three-round total of 1-over 217. Two
Australians are tied for fourth with 3-over 219 totals _ Peter
Senior (76) and Rodney Pampling (77) _ a stroke back of Faldo and
Chalmers.
	   Australians Rodger Davis and Robert Allenby, each with 75s
Saturday, are three off the lead.
	   There are 23 golfers within six shots of the lead, including
Nick O'Hern of Australia, who had the day's best round with a
2-under 70, putting him on 221, four strokes back.
	   Appleby would have had a 2-stroke cushion if not for a bogey on
18 _ and it could have been worse. His approach shot skipped over
one bunker and landed in the second to the right of the flag.
	   His shot out of the bunker just cleared the lip, settling on the
fringe of the green and leaving him a difficult 25-footer for par.
He missed the par attempt but tapped in for bogey.
	   ``It doesn't get much more difficult than this,'' Appleby said
of the gusty winds. ``I told my caddie today that playing this
course is like handcuffing Mike Tyson and then trying to get as
many putts away as you can in 10 seconds before you have to get out
of his way.''
	   Appleby said it didn't matter who he was paired with on Sunday
for the final round _ he'll concentrate on playing his own game and
trying to find some luck among the difficult shots.
	   ``This golf course is bigger than any one competitor,'' said
Appleby.
	   Faldo's round followed a 69 on Friday and comes just days after
experimenting with a new grip,
	   ``I'm on a learning curve again,'' said Faldo, adding that
playing 18 on Royal Adelaide was like playing 30 holes elsewhere.
``But everything was solid all day.''
	   Overnight leader Paul Gow of Australia had a horror day,
bogeying six of the first seven holes, had 44 on the front nine and
finished with 85.
	   Earlier Greg Norman, teeing off in the third group of the day
after nearly missing the cut Friday following a 10-over 82, was 2
over after the front nine Saturday but had three birdies on the
back nine for a 72.
	   They included 3s on each of the par-4 14th and 15th holes that
have caused him and other golfers so much grief this week. There
were seven triple-bogeys on each of the holes in the first two
rounds.
	   Norman, who is seven shots off the lead, and Fred Couples, who
will both play in the Presidents Cup next week at Royal Melbourne,
scraped in on the cut of 8-over 152 on Friday, Couples after his
second consecutive 76.
	   On Saturday, Couples had three back-nine bogeys, including on
15, en route to a 75, leaving him 11-over. His U.S. Presidents Cup
teammate, John Huston, had an 81 and sits at 16-over par.
	   Couples said a combination of jet lag and the toughness of Royal
Adelaide was responsible for his poor performance, but promised
better things next week at Melbourne.
	   ``My game isn't ready for this wind and this course,'' Couples
said. ``But I've had four rounds here, I'll play three practice
rounds at Royal Melbourne, and I'll be ready by Friday.''
	   Peter Thomson, who redesigned the Royal Adelaide course, will
also captain the International team for the Presidents Cup.
	   He said Saturday he was not concerned by Norman's 82.
	   ``That was an aberration,'' Thomson said. ``It can happen to
anyone.''
	   ``But I think he was too aggressive. I followed him around for
nine holes until I got sick of watching what was happening to
him.''

Tired Couples contemplates life outside golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The long flight from the United
States to Australia made U.S. President's Cup team wildcard pick
Fred Couples sick this week, and so tired he ``fell asleep'' during
the Australian Open.
	   The 1992 Masters winner said Saturday he lost his concentration
for a moment at the Royal Adelaide course's toughest hole, the
15th, during his disappointing second round of 76 on Friday.
	   ``I was a little sick on Tuesday night and went to bed at 2 in
the afternoon which was a huge mistake,'' Couples said.
	   The jetlag had continued, combining with the toughness of the
Adelaide course, to affect his play.
	   ``On 15 I just fell asleep for a second,'' he said. ``Next thing
I knew, I had two double (bogeys) in a row.''
	   Couples almost failed to make the cut on Friday. On Saturday, he
had three back-nine bogeys, including on 15, en route to a 75,
leaving him 11-over par at 227 after the third round.
	   ``It's hard coming so far,'' he said. ``I'm not nearly as good
as I used to be on flying and getting ready to play golf.''
	   One of U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus' two personal selections for
the U.S. President's Cup team, Couples said he would be ready for
the team matchplay competition which begins in Melbourne on Dec.
11.
	   He said that in the past few years he has reduced the number of
tournaments he is playing. Since the Tour Championship, he has
played in the Shark Shootout, the Skins Game and in Adelaide.
	   Recently married, Couples said the grind of traveling and
separation from
	   his new family had helped quell his enthusiasm for non-stop
touring.
	   ``It's not nearly as exciting to play golf _ a lot of
tournaments,'' Couples said.
	   ``Don't get me wrong, I'm not bored playing golf. But I just
don't care to get on a plane every other week and go play.''
	   He said he could relate to Greg Norman's new appreciation for
life outside golf after an injury-enforced layoff earlier this
year.
	   ``I never had kids until I married into two so I learned what
that's all about real quickly,'' he said. ``To spend time at home
is really a treat.''
	   The British Open is one trophy he'd like to add to his
collection.
	   ``It is a truly great test,'' he said. ``I would love to win a
British Open.'' (rs)

 &UR; Appleby takes third-round lead
 &UR; EDs: CORRECTS quote in 8th graf, makes it punches instead of putts &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian golfer Stuart Appleby
fought the Royal Adelaide wind and rough Saturday to shoot an
even-par 72 and take a one-stroke lead into the final round of the
Australian Open.
	   Appleby, the first-round leader, has a one-stroke lead over
England's Nick Faldo and Australian Greg Chalmers (74). Faldo and
Appleby played in the same pairing Saturday, with Faldo also
shooting 72 after starting off with three consecutive birdies.
	   The Australian has a three-round total of 1-over 217. Two
Australians are
	   tied for fourth with 3-over 219 totals _ Peter Senior (76) and
Rodney Pampling (77) _ a stroke back of Faldo and Chalmers.
	   Australians Rodger Davis and Robert Allenby, each with 75s
Saturday, are three off the lead.
	   There are 23 golfers within six shots of the lead, including
Nick O'Hern of Australia, who had the day's best round with a
2-under 70, putting him on 221, four strokes back.
	   Appleby would have had a 2-stroke cushion if not for a bogey on
18 _ and it could have been worse. His approach shot skipped over
one bunker and landed in the second to the right of the flag.
	   His shot out of the bunker just cleared the lip, settling on the
fringe of the green and leaving him a difficult 25-footer for par.
He missed the par attempt but tapped in for bogey.
	   ``It doesn't get much more difficult than this,'' Appleby said
of the gusty winds. ``I told my caddie today that playing this
course is like handcuffing Mike Tyson and then trying to get as
many punches away as you can in 10 seconds before you have to get
out of his way.''
	   Appleby said it didn't matter who he was paired with on Sunday
for the final round _ he'll concentrate on playing his own game and
trying to find some luck among the difficult shots.
	   ``This golf course is bigger than any one competitor,'' said
Appleby.
	   Faldo's round followed a 69 on Friday and comes just days after
experimenting with a new grip,
	   ``I'm on a learning curve again,'' said Faldo, adding that
playing 18 on Royal Adelaide was like playing 30 holes elsewhere.
``But everything was solid all day.''
	   Overnight leader Paul Gow of Australia had a horror day,
bogeying six of the first seven holes, had 44 on the front nine and
finished with 85.
	   Earlier Greg Norman, teeing off in the third group of the day
after nearly missing the cut Friday following a 10-over 82, was 2
over after the front nine Saturday but had three birdies on the
back nine for a 72.
	   They included 3s on each of the par-4 14th and 15th holes that
have caused him and other golfers so much grief this week. There
were seven triple-bogeys on each of the holes in the first two
rounds.
	   Norman, who is seven shots off the lead, and Fred Couples, who
will both play in the Presidents Cup next week at Royal Melbourne,
scraped in on the cut of 8-over 152 on Friday, Couples after his
second consecutive 76.
	   On Saturday, Couples had three back-nine bogeys, including on
15, en route to a 75, leaving him 11-over. His U.S. Presidents Cup
teammate, John Huston, had an 81 and sits at 16-over par.
	   Couples said a combination of jet lag and the toughness of Royal
Adelaide
	   was responsible for his poor performance, but promised better
things next week at Melbourne.
	   ``My game isn't ready for this wind and this course,'' Couples
said. ``But I've had four rounds here, I'll play three practice
rounds at Royal Melbourne, and I'll be ready by Friday.''
	   Peter Thomson, who redesigned the Royal Adelaide course, will
also captain the International team for the Presidents Cup.
	   He said Saturday he was not concerned by Norman's 82.
	   ``That was an aberration,'' Thomson said. ``It can happen to
anyone.''
	   ``But I think he was too aggressive. I followed him around for
nine holes
	   until I got sick of watching what was happening to him.''

With eye on Olympics, China breaks in youngsters at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For China, staying atop the Asian Games
gold medals standings is not the issue. Its eyes are set down the
road on a bigger target: the 2000 Olympics.
	   In gymnastics, diving and other events, China aims to use the
Asian Games starting Sunday in Bangkok to hone future stars. It
hopes giving young athletes the vital experience of big competition
will pay off in medals at the Sydney Olympics.
	   The ability of the Chinese sporting machine to churn out a
seemingly endless supply of fresh talent has long made China Asia's
sporting powerhouse. But regional dominance is not enough. Chinese
sports officials and athletes want to take on and beat the world's
best.
	   China, the runaway winner at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima,
Japan, in 1994, again expects to lead the medals table in Bangkok.
But, officials say, it's the quality, not quantity, of gold that
will count in the long run.
	   ``It's not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a
result that is close or at world standards,'' said Li Furong,
deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. ``The main target is
the 2000 Olympics.''
	   For China, doing well is also a matter of politics and national
pride. China views sporting prowess as a way to showcase _ both to
the world and its own people _ the huge economic strides the
country has made under two decades of market reforms that have
lifted millions out of poverty. The government works to channel
pride generated when Chinese athletes do well into support for the
difficult reform process.
	   ``We want to display the new face of China, the new spirit of
our people that has sprung up under 20 years of reform,'' Li said
in an interview.
	   For Bangkok, China's athletes have been issued with a smart
uniform _ gray suits for men, yellow for women _ with the red
national emblem displayed prominently on the chest. Athletes are
under instructions to leave a good impression, not to stay out
overnight, and not to stay up late.
	   For most Chinese athletes, this is their first Asian Games. Just
69 of the 596 athletes are veterans of both Hiroshima and the 1996
Atlanta Olympics, officials say. The athletes' average age is 23.
	   Two of China's four women divers _ Yang Lan and 14-year-old Li
Na _ have never attended a major international competition before,
team manager Xue Li said. On the men's side, 16-year-old diver
Huang Qiang is also in his first big international meet, she said.
	   In gymnastics, a Chinese strength, three men _ Yang Wei, Xing
Aowei and Zhao Sheng _ have never attended a major international
competition, team manager Zhang Jian said. Among the women
gymnasts, 16-year-old Xu Jing is a newcomer.
	   ``Through the Asian Games, we want to train our young
athletes,'' said Li, the delegation official. ``This way we can
better prepare for the Olympics in 2000.''
	   The crop of new faces means some famous stars have been left
behind. They include table tennis players Wang Tao and Deng Yaping,
a three-time world champion. In the pool, world record holders Le
Jingyi and He Cihong also are missing the games, as is top
butterfly swimmer Liu Limin.

	   UJUNGPANDANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Weeping Roman Catholics consoled
and hugged each other Saturday in the ashes of their church that
was burned down by angry Muslim mob.
	   Hundreds of troops and police patrolled the city of Ujungpandang
on Sulawesi island. Civilian guards stood watch over other places
of worship in the city, 840 miles (1,350 kilometers) east of
Jakarta.
	   Friday's attack on the Kare Catholic Church was the latest in a
series of tit-for-tat violence between the Muslim majority and the
Christian minority in Indonesia.
	   Social tensions are on the rise in the world's fourth most
populous nation amid political turmoil, student protests and the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is trying to introduce political
change after decades of authoritarian rule under former President
Suharto, called for calm.
	   ``In the midst of euphoria of reform, many people have been
carried away by a stream of fury, hatred, revenge and enmity,'' he
said in a speech to a Muslim group in Jakarta on Saturday.
	   The sectarian attacks come atop of a dramatic climb in
Indonesia's crime rate and sporadic outbreaks of riots and looting
in some parts.
	   During the past two weeks at least 25 churches and 18 mosques
have been set afire or ransacked by the followers of rival faiths
in five cities and towns across the sprawling island nation of more
than 300 ethnic groups.
	   ``I saw brutality and cruelty. I don't really understand why
devoted religious followers attack other places of worship,'' said
Rev. Van Rooy, a Dutch-born priest assigned to the Kare Church.
	   ``The mob came in through the front. They jumped over the fence
and climbed through the windows.
	   ``I wanted to defend my church. But we are Christian, we are
just a minority compared with the crowd,'' he said of Friday's
attack.
	   A mass of mourning will be held in the ruins on Sunday, he said.
	   Other witnesses said the mob of several thousand shouted, ``God
is great,'' and ``Burn,'' as some carried cans of kerosene inside.
	   Pews and prayer books were placed in heaps and set on fire.
Statues and other holy ornaments were smashed. The church's walls
and roof collapsed.
	   Police said the attacks took place after weekly prayers ended at
nearby mosques and appeared to be an act of revenge for assaults
against Muslim places of worship earlier.
	   On Monday Christian rioters in the city of Kupang, southeast of
Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques in retaliation for the
Nov. 22 burning of churches in Jakarta.
	   Police said 22 churches had been attacked in the capital,
including four that were burned.
	   Many of Indonesia's Christians are ethnic Chinese, who are often
targeted when social unrest flares because of their relative
wealth. Residents said most Chinese shops in Ujungpandang remained
shut Saturday.
	   ``I feel so sad and angry. But we not able to do anything
because we are the minority,'' said a 45-year-old Chinese Christian
woman too scared to give her name.
	   Islam arrived in the 7th century. Now 90 percent of Indonesia's
202 million people are Muslim, making it the world's biggest
Islamic nation. Others are Christian, Buddhist and Hindu.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The attacks come despite repeated calls for calm by Habibie as
well as Muslim and Christian religious leaders.
	   Indonesia's security problems have worsened since May when
deadly riots and protests helped oust Habibie's predecessor and
onetime mentor, Suharto.
	   For 32 authoritarian years Suharto used iron fisted methods to
keep a lid on the archipelago's social and ethnic rivalries, often
at the expense of human rights.

Call to countries to prevent repeat of anthem error
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian Games organizers apologized
Saturday for playing a wrong national anthem at a preliminary
soccer match but warned a similar mistake could occur again.
	   The Saudi Arabian anthem was played instead of the anthem of the
United Arab Emirates before the UAE's match against North Korea
last week.
	   Games spokeswoman Valerie McKenzie said apologies had been made,
but the incident showed urgent action was needed by team officials
to prevent a repeat.
	   ``Only 20 of the 41 countries have come in to reconfirm their
anthems,'' McKenzie said Saturday.
	   The organizers have faced concerns over ticketing, traffic, even
insects in the swimming pool.
	   ``We are trying our best but it is difficult for us,'' McKenzie
said. ``The countries could help by coming in to reconfirm their
details.''
	   Saudi Arabia withdrew its team from the games and that was a
likely reason for the anthem snafu, McKenzie said.
	   ``I believe under the original draw, the Saudis would have been
playing North Korea in that match,'' she said.
	   Playing the wrong anthem is not new in international sport. The
band messed up the tune for Brazil's anthem before the team lost
its World Cup preliminary match against Norway at France 98. And
Nagano Olympic organizers put out a souvenir CD with the wrong song
for rival South Korea's anthem.

	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Markus Naslund scored three
goals and Garth Snow stopped 36 shots as Vancouver snapped a
six-game winless streak.
	   Mark Messier had two assists and Donald Brashear added a goal as
the Canucks won for the first time since Nov. 19 after going 0-5-1.
The win was also Vancouver's first in nine straight meetings
against opponents with plus-.500 records this season.
	   The win was the 501st of Canucks coach Mike Keenan's 14-year NHL
career, moving him alone into fifth place _ one ahead of Montreal
Canadiens coaching great Toe Blake _ on the all-time list. As well,
Keenan was coaching his 975th game, tying him for sixth with
Florida Panthers general manager Bryan Murray.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung
was executed in China early Saturday, immediately after losing his
appeal in a kidnapping and gun-running case, China's official news
agency reported.
	   Cheung, 43, alias ``Big Spender,'' had been convicted in a
sensational trial that focused on the kidnappings of two top Hong
Hong tycoons. The case raised troubling issues about legal
jurisdiction between Hong Kong and the mainland.
	   Cheung was put to death by gunshot just a day after he got his
final wish, a visit from his two young sons.
	   Four accomplices _ Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and
Chin Hon-sau _ also were executed after a court hearing that lasted
an hour and a half, Xinhua reported.
	   Henchmen Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan were given two-year suspended
death sentences, which might later be converted to jail terms.
Another 29 gang members were convicted and sentenced to prison
terms of up to life, but two had their jail time reduced on appeal,
Xinhua said.
	   Cheung and his mainland lawyers appealed after the death penalty
was handed down on Nov. 15, on grounds that included Cheung's
``meritorious cooperation during the investigation,'' Xinhua said.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International expressed concerns
that some of the defendants might have been ``ill-treated or
tortured'' so they would confess.
	   Cheung's mainland lawyers also questioned the jurisdiction of
mainland courts over crimes committed in Hong Kong _ which has a
more open court system and imposes no death penalty.
	   Cheung's case was the first high-profile cross-border trial
since the territory reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last
year.
	   ``The mainland does not place the same emphasis on the rights of
defendants as Hong Kong,'' the South China Morning Post said in an
editorial Saturday.
	   Cheung's lawyers wanted the case transferred to Hong Kong, but
authorities here had no evidence.
	   The alleged kidnappings of the two tycoons _ identified in
newspapers as Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing; and
Walter Kwok, chairman of the big developer Sun Hung Kai Properties
_ were never reported to Hong Kong police.
	   Cheung's gang was said to have netted the equivalent of U.S.
dlrs 210 million in ransom payments.
	   The Guangdong Higher Court upheld the verdicts, saying Cheung
and his gang used mainland Chinese bases ``to plot, plan, and
prepare for crimes later committed in Hong Kong,'' according to the
Xinhua report.
	   Amnesty International blasted the ``dubious'' court ruling,
saying little evidence had been presented about any conspiracy
carried out on the mainland.
	   Security was tight at Saturday's appeals hearing in the the
provincial capital of Guangzhou, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north
of the border, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Television footage showed relatives of the defendants leaving
the courtroom, some crying, others angry.
	   On Friday, Cheung saw his two, 4 and 7. After the 30-minute
visit, Cheung was quoted by the the South China Morning Post as
saying to his father-in-law, ``Take care of my boys.''
	   Cheung and his gang members were tried behind closed doors for
spectacular crimes that also including the smuggling of dynamite
and guns from China into Hong Kong, armed robberies of gold stores,
and the theft of 277 tons of steel. At least one person was killed
in the crime spree, during the steel heist.

Chinese police detain two more democracy campaigners in crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have questioned or detained seven
dissidents in a widening crackdown on organizers of a political
opposition party, a human rights group reported Saturday.
	   Police took Wang Zechen and Wang Wenjiang from their homes in
Anshan city in the northeast Friday night and their whereabouts
Saturday were not known, family members and the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Wang Zechen organized a petition signed by Wang Wenjiang and 188
other dissidents Wednesday demanding police release Xu Wenli and
Qin Yongmin, two of the most influential members of the dissident
community.
	   Xu and Qin were arrested Monday night and along with a third
dissident, Wang Youcai, were accused of endangering state security,
apparently for spearheading a five-month campaign to form the China
Democracy Party.
	   The accusations were the most serious leveled against
campaigners lobbying to register the party legally and challenge
the ruling Communist Party's 49-year ban on opposition politics.
	   Wang Zechen was taken away for questioning by members of the
State Security Bureau, China's secret police, his family members
said in a telephone interview.
	   Police in Beijing and Wuhan also questioned three other
dissidents on Friday, veteran activist Ren Wanding, and Chen
Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
said.
	   Ren had already been warned on Wednesday to stop working for the
China Democracy Party. Chen and Xiao had been arrested along with
Qin Yongmin on Monday but were released after two days.
	   They and the two Wangs had been among dozens of dissidents
trying to organize the China Democracy Party in at least nine
provinces and major cities.
	   Two other dissidents interrogated Friday in two separate
provinces had been taking part in fasts to pressure authorities to
release Wang Youcai.
	   The arrests of Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai have
brought an outpouring of condemnation from dissidents in China and
abroad, an indication of the esteem the three are held in.
	   In addition to the 190-signature petition organized by Wang
Zechen, some of the most prominent dissidents in exile were among
the 139 people who signed a letter Friday protesting the arrests.
	   Four elderly human rights campaigners have urged Chinese leaders
to release Wang Youcai, saying his actions did not violate the
constitution nor endanger state security.
	   ``Not long ago, the Chinese government signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Now again it is violating
civil rights,'' said the letter signed Friday and released Saturday
by New York-based Human Rights in China.

Court delays hearing to free Anwar on bail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar filing affidavit. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim on
Saturday challenged the constitutionality of his firing as deputy
prime minister on grounds that the Malaysian king had not given his
consent.
	   Anwar, who is on trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges, made the challenge in an affidavit he filed in court
Saturday. Also Saturday, a ruling on his appeal for release on bail
was delayed. Anwar says he is innocent of all charges.
	   Last month, Anwar filed a lawsuit saying that only Malaysia's
king could dismiss a Cabinet minister and Mahathir had flouted the
constitution by dismissing him.
	   On Tuesday, the Malaysian government said the king had agreed to
Anwar's Sept. 2 sacking. It asked the High Court to dismiss Anwar's
lawsuit as ``frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the court
process.''
	   The next hearing was set for Jan. 25.
	   Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal debated whether it had the right
to hear Anwar's bail appeal, then decided to delay its ruling. That
court moved the next hearing to Dec. 12.
	   Last Saturday, the three appeal judges postponed the bail
hearing for similar reasons. A decision not to hear the case could
thwart any further attempts to free Anwar on bail.
	   Anwar's bail application has been turned down by a lower court
once and an appeal against it also failed.
	   Judge Augustine Paul said Anwar's lawyers couldn't prove that he
would not tamper with witnesses, if released on bail.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, only hours after organizing a
mammoth rally in the capital. During that protest, he called for
sweeping government reforms and the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after deeming him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.

Stewart hits century in four-day match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart
returned to batting form with a century against Victoria state on
the opening day of the four-day cricket match at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground on Saturday,.
	   Stewart struck 126 to guide England to 308-5 at stumps.
	   The English skipper had made just 101 runs at 12.63 since
arriving in Australia in late October but blossomed Saturday
against an inexperienced Victorian team.
	   He finally ran himself out after a 243-minute innings that
included 11 fours.
	   Stewart received support from opener Michael Atherton (46), Mark
Ramprakash (61 not out) and Graeme Hick (37 not out) after being
sent in to bat on a grassy pitch.
	   Key batsman Graham Thorpe made 19 in his return from a back
injury that prevented him playing against Australia in the second
test in Perth.
	   Tall paceman Ashley Gilbert had a successful debut in
first-class cricket,
	   dismissing Nasser Hussain for five.
	   Fellow fast bowlers Brad Williams and Matthew Inness each
claimed a wicket, as did offspinner John Davison. (djp)

Military plans to arm East Timorese against rebel attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military chief in East
Timor plans to arm civilians in more than 440 villages as
protection against rebels fighting for independence.
	   Col. Suhartono Suratman, East Timor's military chief, said
Saturday that weapons would be issued to volunteers who join a
``people's defense force,'' known as Wanra.
	   ``I will equip those volunteers with guns in order to protect
villages that are prone to rebel attacks,'' Suratman said in Dili,
East Timor's capital.
	   Suratman, however, refused to specify the kind and number of
weapons to be provided.
	   East Timorese rebels have been fighting for independence since
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed
it a year later.
	   After years of bloody guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses,
Indonesia softened its stance on East Timor after former President
Suharto's authoritarian rule ended in May.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has offered a measure of
autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over
the land of 800,000 people.
	   The United Nations has been sponsoring talks between Indonesia
and Portugal over the autonomy plan.
	   Despite the search for a peaceful solution to East Timor's
problems, violence continues.
	   On Friday, Guilherme Albino Soares Gusmao, a former chief of
Makadiki village, 190 kilometers (118 miles) east of Dili, was shot
and killed by rebels, police said.
	   Guilherme was abducted from his home and murdered about one
kilometer (half a mile) away, said police chief Col. Timbul Silaen.
	   A day earlier, a group of unidentified youths abducted another
man, Natanil Tumonglo, in Licuica district, about 28 kilometers (17
miles) west of Dili.
	   His whereabouts remain unknown, Silaen said.
	   Also in Viqueque Wednesday, two rebels shot an elementary school
teacher to death as he taught in a classroom, the official Antara
news agency reported.

Myanmar releases three tourists arrested for illegal entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Three tourists arrested three weeks
ago when they strayed across the Thai border into Myanmar, have
been released and are back in Thailand, a Thai security official
said on Saturday.
	   The three men _ an American, Canadian and German _ were set free
by the Myanmar military and re-entered Thailand Friday afternoon at
Mae Hong Son Province, 650 kilometers (404 miles) north of Bangkok,
said the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The U.S. embassy in Myanmar, also known as Burma, was never
given access to the American, identified as Michael John Raedeke,
40, said an embassy official in Yangon who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States has strained relations with Myanmar's military
government over its repression of political opponents and an
alleged failure to curb the drug trade.
	   The other tourists were identified as Joseph Frank, 34, a
Canadian resident of Hong Kong, and Dirk Rommeswinkel of Germany,
according to the Thai officer.
	   Rommeswinkel told Thai security officials that he was no more
than five meters (4.5yards) over the border demarcation before two
Myanmar soldiers detained him at gunpoint.
	   The Myanmar military suspected them of being CIA or U.S. drug
agents, the Thai officer said.
	   Rommeswinkel said they were separated and interrogated at eight
different command posts.
	   Upon his return to Thailand, Rommeswinkel called his wife in the
United States and told her that he has been under heavy stress.
	   Myanmar officials confirmed last week that the trio had been
found inside Myanmar and brought for questioning to Taunggyi, 175
kilometers (110 miles) and detained.

Taiwan chooses national Legislature, top mayors

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ After weeks of nasty campaigning,
Taiwanese turned out Saturday to choose a mayor for the capital and
a new Legislature that will guide the island beset by precarious
relations with mainland China.
	   Attention focused on the tight Taipei mayoral race, where the
ruling Nationalist Party hoped challenger Ma Ying-jeou could unseat
the top politician from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, incumbent Chen Shui-bian.
	   While the campaigners talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   The Nationalists banked on citizens being scared by the DPP's
platform calling for a formal declaration of independence from
China _ seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the
mainland.
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign but his
camp had raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland but moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   Turnout appeared heavy among the island's nearly 15 million
eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast
ballots in Taipei.
	   Polls closed in the late afternoon with no immediate reports of
any problems. Police had been guarding the more than 10,000 polling
stations across the island _ with huge barbed wire barriers on hand
in some spots _ to try to avoid repeats of violence that has marred
past elections.
	   Businessman David Wu in Taipei said he voted for Ma because of
his ``clean image.''
	   ``His support is unprecedented,'' Wu said. ``He must win or the
Nationalists' morale will be badly damaged.''
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who will retire in early 2000, quietly
cast his ballot along with his wife, Tseng Wen-hui, but he declined
offers to appear at polling stations with other candidates hoping
for some last-minute publicity.
	   The Nationalists were expected to maintain control of the
Legislature, which is being expanded to 225 seats. They claimed the
first victory of the evening, picking up an uncontested seat
representing the tiny constituency of the Matsu islands.
	   Voters were directly choosing 176 of the legislators, and the
remaining seats were to be assigned to parties based on how many
votes they get.
	   Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern city of
Kaohsiung and city councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   The outcome is being closely watched by Beijing, which claims
Taiwan as a part of China although the two have been politically
separated since a 1949 civil war.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and put aside the issue of reunification or permanent independence
_ at least for now.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people have been reported missing at sea in
the Russian Far East, a news agency reported Saturday.
	   A ferryboat passenger was reported missing Friday while the
vessel Sakhalin-7 crossed the Tatar Strait in the Khabarovsk
territory, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   A search for the missing passenger was called off after 24
hours, the Vladivostok marine rescue center said, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   A seaman on the fishing trawler Oboyan disappeared Friday while
the craft was en route to Russia from Japan, the news agency said.
A search was being conducted by other fishing boats in the region.

Watts catches up with Miyamoto for top spot in third day of play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INAGI, Japan (AP) _ American Brian Watts shot a one-under-par 69
and advanced to a first-place tie with Katsumasa Miyamoto of Japan
on Saturday, the third day of the 100 million yen (dlrs 833,000)
Golf Nippon Series JT Cup tournament.
	   Watts sank two birdies and bogeyed once. That was enough to give
him a four-under 206 so far in the four-day tournament, attended by
the year's top golfers on the Japan circuit.
	   Miyamoto held a five-stroke lead going into Saturday's play but
hit a disappointing five-over 75. The 26-year-old struggled the
entire day, finishing with a double-bogey on the 18th hole.
	   Scores were high all around as rain fell and temperatures hit a
chilly 6.8 degrees Celsius (44 F) on the 6,960-yard, par-70 Tokyo
Yomiuri Country Club course on the outskirts of Tokyo.
	   ``My hands, ears, head, everything is frozen and soaking. It's
impossible to play golf in these conditions. Today's one-under was
a very lucky score,'' Watts said.
	   Teeing off were 26 of the best golfers on the Japanese
professional circuit, made up of this year's tournament winners,
the defending champion and the top 20 on the Japan PGA money
earning list.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who leads the Japan PGA money ranking
list with 166.63 million yen (dlrs 1.4 million) in winnings this
season, regained second place after shooting a 69. He is one-stroke
behind the leaders with a three-under 207 for the tournament.
	   Nobuhito Sato, who had been in the No. 2 spot, hit seven bogeys
and one double-bogey as he finished with a seven-over 77. He fell
to eighth place with a three-over 213 total score.
	   American Todd Hamilton, who finished the previous day with a
stellar five-under 65, also dropped to eighth place after hitting
74.
	   Another American, Brandt Jobe, second only to Ozaki on the Japan
circuit with 95.17 million yen (dlrs 793,000) in prize money this
year, was stuck in second to last place with a 10-over 220 for the
tournament.
	   Frankie Minoza of the Philippines and Colombian Eduardo Herrera
tied for seventh with a two-over 212.
	   Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama shot a 68 and advanced to
fifth place and a par 210.
	   The winner takes home 30 million yen (dlrs 250,000).

Lawyer denies he will defend Indonesian ex-leader in graft case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS anti-Suharto protests, graf 16

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Doubt was cast over assurances by
ex-President Suharto that he's ready to be questioned over
corruption allegations Saturday when a noted Jakarta lawyer denied
he was willing to defend the old leader.
	   Several analysts also questioned the resolve of Suharto's former
protege and successor President B.J. Habibie to investigate fully
the affairs of his former boss and file charges.
	   On Friday government investigators said they plan to question
Suharto next week and officials warned the former autocrat might be
placed under house arrest if he fails to cooperate.
	   Suharto denied any wrongdoing and was quoted by executives from
the Dharmais monthly newsmagazine as saying that he was prepared to
face the new inquiry by Attorney General Andi Muhamad Ghalib.
	   ``This is not a challenge. I realize that as an Indonesian
citizen, I cannot free myself from my legal obligations,'' Suharto
was quoted as saying on Friday. ``But everyone should know that
this is a state based on law and every citizen is entitled to legal
protection.''
	   The magazine executives, who interviewed Suharto at his heavily
guarded home, quoted Suharto as saying at least 22 lawyers had
offered to represent him.
	   However, one of those mentioned, Adnan Buyung Nasution, a high
profile Jakarta lawyer, denied other reports that he would be
prepared to defend Suharto against charges of corruption.
	   Nasution, a longtime human right advocate during Suharto's
autocratic rule, said the reports ``were untrue, misleading and
have the potential to damage my reputation.''
	   The lawyer said he would consider helping Suharto only if the
ex-president's human rights were threatened.
	   However, he would not defend the old leader in a graft case.
	   Suharto quit the presidency last May after 32 autocratic years
following a wave of deadly riots and student protests.
	   Since his resignation, he has denied allegations that he has
stashed billions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
	   Opponents claim that Suharto had abused his power and had acted
corruptly to amass a fortune for himself, his family and a clique
of cronies.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion.
	   Student activists, who helped bring him down, have staged almost
daily protests demanding he be tried on charges of corruption and
human rights abuses. Troops have regularly stopped them from
marching on his home.
	   On Saturday, security personnel blocked about 1,000 students
from marching on the presidential palace after a smaller group of
protesters held an anti-Suharto rally near the National Monument.
	   Suharto said during the interview that he only held 22 million
rupiah (dlrs 3 billion) in three Indonesian bank accounts.
	   He said this money had been saved from his salary as president
and had been supplemented from rent income from two Jakarta houses
he has leased to foreigners.
	   Ghalib has questioned Suharto before. But an earlier
investigation failed to find any evidence.
	   Critics have accused Ghalib, an army general, of going soft on
Suharto, and had criticized an earlier probe as a whitewash.
	   Although Habibie has said that Ghalib's new probe will be
conducted fully, some observers remain skeptical, the Jakarta Post
reported.
	   ``I have always doubted the government's sincerity in launching
an investigation. They were never serious,'' said Arbi Sanit, a
political science professor at the University of Indonesia.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security forces blocked about 1,000
protesting students from marching on the presidential palace
Saturday after a smaller group reached the nearby National
Monument.
	   The larger group caused a major traffic jam after they sat down
in a busy street lined with troops and riot police.
	   Earlier police allowed about 200 students from a state-run
college to hold a rally at the monument, just south of the place.
	   Both groups of students demanded that former President Suharto
be tried on corruption charges and that the powerful military get
out of politics.
	   Meanwhile, national police chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi said that
17 students will be questioned after they organized a protest by
about 1,500 protesters in front of the palace on Wednesday.
	   The military have banned protests near the ornate mansion. The
students managed to slip by what should have been tight security.

Lawyer denies he will defend Indonesian ex-leader in graft case

 &UR; RETRANSMITS to correct slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Doubt was cast over assurances by
ex-President Suharto that he's ready to be questioned over
corruption allegations Saturday when a noted Jakarta lawyer denied
he was willing to defend the old leader.
	   Several analysts also questioned the resolve of Suharto's former
protege and successor President B.J. Habibie to investigate fully
the affairs of his former boss and file charges.
	   On Friday government investigators said they plan to question
Suharto next week and officials warned the former autocrat might be
placed under house arrest if he fails to cooperate.
	   Suharto denied any wrongdoing and was quoted by executives from
the Dharmais monthly newsmagazine as saying that he was prepared to
face the new inquiry by Attorney General Andi Muhamad Ghalib.
	   ``This is not a challenge. I realize that as an Indonesian
citizen, I cannot free myself from my legal obligations,'' Suharto
was quoted as saying on Friday. ``But everyone should know that
this is a state based on law and every citizen is entitled to legal
protection.''
	   The magazine executives, who interviewed Suharto at his heavily
guarded home, quoted Suharto as saying at least 22 lawyers had
offered to represent him.
	   However, one of those mentioned, Adnan Buyung Nasution, a high
profile Jakarta lawyer, denied other reports that he would be
prepared to defend Suharto against charges of corruption.
	   Nasution, a longtime human right advocate during Suharto's
autocratic rule, said the reports ``were untrue, misleading and
have the potential to damage my reputation.''
	   The lawyer said he would consider helping Suharto only if the
ex-president's human rights were threatened.
	   However, he would not defend the old leader in a graft case.
	   Suharto quit the presidency last May after 32 autocratic years
following a wave of deadly riots and student protests.
	   Since his resignation, he has denied allegations that he has
stashed billions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
	   Opponents claim that Suharto had abused his power and had acted
corruptly to amass a fortune for himself, his family and a clique
of cronies.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion.
	   Student activists, who helped bring him down, have staged almost
daily protests demanding he be tried on charges of corruption and
human rights abuses. Troops have regularly stopped them from
marching on his home.
	   On Saturday, security personnel blocked about 1,000 students
from marching on the presidential palace after a smaller group of
protesters held an anti-Suharto rally near the National Monument.
	   Suharto said during the interview that he only held 22 million
rupiah (dlrs 3 billion) in three Indonesian bank accounts.
	   He said this money had been saved from his salary as president
and had been supplemented from rent income from two Jakarta houses
he has leased to foreigners.
	   Ghalib has questioned Suharto before. But an earlier
investigation failed to find any evidence.
	   Critics have accused Ghalib, an army general, of going soft on
Suharto, and had criticized an earlier probe as a whitewash.
	   Although Habibie has said that Ghalib's new probe will be
conducted fully, some observers remain skeptical, the Jakarta Post
reported.
	   ``I have always doubted the government's sincerity in launching
an investigation. They were never serious,'' said Arbi Sanit, a
political science professor at the University of Indonesia.

Fukuoka beats Sapporo, keeps top division spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MURORAN, Japan (AP) _ Avispa Fukuoka defeated Consadole Sapporo
3-0 on Saturday in a game to determine which team would be allowed
to stay in Japan's downsizing professional soccer league.
	   After a scoreless first half, striker Yusaku Ueno connected from
19 meters (yards) eight minutes after the break for Fukuoka's first
goal.
	   Midfielders Fernando of Brazil and Kiyotaka Ishimaru scored in
the 39th and 44th minutes to seal the victory at Muroran municipal
stadium.
	   The win lets Fukuoka stay in Japan's first division professional
league, the J-League, which will trim its member teams to 16 from
18.
	   Sapporo will drop to the second-tier Japan Football League.

Gabon's president expects election victory, but problems await
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ President Omar Bongo smiles broadly in
his campaign posters, a sometimes-benevolent autocrat reaching out
to the people he has ruled for more than three decades.
	   ``The way of the future,'' thousands of posters proclaim.
	   Bongo, who faces presidential elections Sunday, has plenty of
reasons to smile _ at least for now. With a fractured opposition,
overwhelming finances and a sprawling patronage system that
guarantees him tens of thousands of votes in this oil-rich West
African nation, Bongo's re-election is widely expected. The only
question for most observers is whether he'll get the 51 percent
needed to avoid a second round of voting.
	   ``Bongo will be elected again, we all know that,'' shrugged
Narcisse Abessole, a young photographer attending a recent
opposition political rally.
	   But if Bongo appears set to win Sunday's vote, what comes
afterward may not be so easy.
	   Libreville shook with rioting after Gabon's 1993 elections _ the
first multiparty presidential voting after 26 years of one-party
rule _ when Bongo claimed victory and protesters took to the
streets saying the vote had been rigged.
	   This time Bongo faces a different set of problems.
	   With fears growing that Gabon's oil reserves are running dry and
the price of oil plummeting, this petroleum-fed nation may have to
cope with the crippling of it's greatest money earner.
	   ``With 40 percent of the budget dependent on petrol ... they're
facing something very serious,'' said Toon Visser, the resident
coordinator for United Nations programs in Gabon. While Visser
believes Bongo has the political abilities to weather the coming
economic storm, other observers aren't so sure.
	   The government is in such increasingly dire straits that it may
not have enough cash on hand to pay January salaries for civil
servants, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Bongo insists, though, that he holds the key to stability.
	   ``We have one chance,'' Bongo said in a televised round table
with Gabonese journalists, ``and we must preserve that chance _ the
stability, the peace.''
	   Bongo's opponents, though, lash out at him for his autocratic
rule and corruption.
	   Bongo, who took power in 1967 and held tightly to control
through his feared presidential guards, has relaxed his rule
somewhat since pro-democracy protests forced him to allow multiple
parties in 1990. These days, Bongo is openly criticized in the
newspapers and by his opponents.
	   Still, nearly all roads to power in this heavily forested nation
lead to Bongo.
	   ``This government is just one man,'' said Paul Mba Abessole, a
Roman Catholic priest who, with former postal executive Pierre
Mamboundou, is one of Bongo's two main opponents.
	   Opposition politicians say Bongo's regime has rigged voter
registration lists and kept the National Electoral Commission weak
to make sure the president wins the seven-year term.
	   But Bongo does have a degree of genuine support, despite his
history of autocratic rule and the rampant corruption widely
believed to infect his regime.
	   Gabon, with a population of just 1.2 million, has an average per
capita income of about dlrs 4,200 a year, a small fortune compared
to many African nations.
	   If much of the wealth is at the top of the socio-economic ladder
and poverty remains widespread, there has at least been an
expectation among many Gabonese that getting ahead is possible.
	   With an oil crunch coming, though, those expectations could soon
come to an end.

Computer entrepreneur pleads innocence in China's Internet trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with rights group report on Lin's trial,
wife's detention; no pickup.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A computer entrepreneur charged with
subversion told judges that business, not politics, drove him to
provide Chinese e-mail addresses to an on-line democracy magazine,
a rights group reported Saturday.
	   A Shanghai court gave Lin Hai a four-hour trial on Friday in the
first legal collision between exploding Internet use in China and
the government's determination to suppress dissent.
	   Lin's trial was closed to the public. Only he, his two lawyers,
one prosecutor and a stenographer were allowed in the courtroom
with the judges, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Even his wife was barred. Xu Hong expected to wait outside the
courtroom for word from Lin's lawyers.
	   Instead two men burst into a restaurant near the courthouse
where she was eating lunch and accused her of theft, the
Information Center said.
	   She was taken to a local police station and released six hours
later in a case of mistaken identity, the group said. It was a
maneuver typical of the harassment police use against dissidents
and their families.
	   After the trial's end, courthouse guards also followed one of
Lin's lawyers for several blocks.
	   Lawyer Wang Wenjiang said it could take up to a week for the No.
1 Intermediate Court to issue a verdict.
	   ``I think he's going to be found guilty,'' he said.
	   Lin, a 30-year-old software company owner, is accused of giving
addresses for 30,000 Chinese computer users to ``VIP Reference,'' a
pro-democracy journal published on the Internet by Chinese
dissidents in the United States.
	   Arrested in March, he was charged in April with ``inciting the
overthrow of state power'' _ a crime usually leveled against
dissidents.
	   Lin and his two lawyers argued in court that he hoped to
exchange e-mail addresses with ``VIP Reference'' to get some
overseas accounts for his business, the Information Center said.
	   He was not a subscriber to the magazine and there was no
political motive, it added.
	   China's Communist Party leaders have closely monitored the
Internet, hoping to harness it for business while keeping it free
of the subversive and the pornographic. They have set up special
police task forces and used technological filters to block
politically sensitive sites.
	   Lin's case was tried as the government intensifies a crackdown
against dissidents trying to set up an opposition political party
and break the communist's monopoly on power.
	   Two prominent dissidents arrested Monday used computers,
facsimiles and e-mail to coordinate efforts to set up the China
Democracy Party.

Russia's second city holds election marred by violence, dirty
</HEADLINE>
tactics &QL; 
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ St. Petersburg was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it heads into city elections Sunday, its politics are now
considered as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg, a city that has failed to meet
its high expectations in the post-Soviet era.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by several contract
killings of politicians and leading businessmen, beatings and
drive-by shootings against candidates and frequent reports of dirty
tricks by campaigners.
	   ``Five years ago we could hardly imagine that elections to the
St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly would include threats,
blackmail and assault,'' the head of Russia's Federal Security
Service, Vladimir Putin, said in an interview with the newspaper
Peterburgsky Chas Pik.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   In this atmosphere, 587 candidates are competing for 50 seats in
the city assembly. Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city
legislature has little power, this body could be quite influential.
	   A new city charter, introduced this year after a bitter battle,
calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with extensive
powers.
	   Gov. Alexander Yakovlev _ the city's mayor despite his title _
strongly opposed the new charter, which curtails his clout.
	   Yakovlev is not on the ballot and has not been actively
campaigning for individual candidates. But critics say the powerful
Yakovlev has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Prominent liberal politicians opposed to Yakovlev have found
that people who share the same name were mysteriously proposed as
candidates. This has been done in an attempt to confuse voters and
take away votes from liberals.
	   For example, when voters go to the polls, there will be two
``Sergei Belyayevs'' on the ballot. Voters may be hard-pressed to
determine which one is the well-known liberal and which one is the
anonymous decoy candidate.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   Pensioners have reportedly been taken on ``free excursions'' _
bus rides with presents and free vodka _ which end at a polling
station where the retirees are told that the trip was sponsored by
a certain candidate whom they were asked to vote for.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, but it's
not clear that they will turn out in large numbers.
	   St. Petersburg, which is Russia's second-largest city after
Moscow, had seemed a likely candidate for prosperity in the
post-Soviet era.
	   It's been a liberal, Westward-leaning city ever since the
Russian Czar Peter the Great built it from scratch at the beginning
of the 18th century and dubbed it the country's ``window on the
West.''
	   St. Petersburg produced many of the country's democratic
reformers and free-market economists in the late 1980s and early
1990s, but the city has languished since then.
	   The murder of Starovoitova seemed to symbolize much of what's
gone wrong. No one has been arrested for the Nov. 20 killing of
Starovoitova, who was a member of the national legislature and was
not on Sunday's ballot.
	   But her movement, Northern Capital, was based in St. Petersburg
and is expected to make a solid showing. She was an outspoken
critic of political corruption, and the Russian media has
speculated that she was killed by political opponents.

Fire officials say truck overheated in responding to orphanage

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A fire truck overheated and stalled
while trying to pump water to fight a blaze at an orphanage that
killed 25 children and five adults, Manila fire officials said on
Saturday.
	   Investigators found the remains of a 1-year-old boy Saturday as
they sifted through the charred ruins of the Settlement House in
Manila's slum district of Paco.
	   Twenty-eight bodies have been recovered so far. The orphanage
staff has said that 30 people, including babies, died in Thursday's
blaze.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he will call a meeting
next week of mayors in metropolitan Manila to look into any
deficiencies in fire-fighting capabilities.
	   Capt. Bienvenido Escoto, deputy operations chief of the Manila
Fire Department, acknowledged that all the fire trucks in the
capital were secondhand and that most needed repairs, with only 15
of about 40 in working condition.
	   Escoto said two of the city's fire trucks also immediately
responded, but one overheated while refilling its tank with water
from a fire hydrant.
	   Volunteer fire brigades funded by Chinese-Filipino business
groups _ which responded to the orphanage fire by sending 16 fire
trucks _ have about 100 fire trucks, better radio communication and
are often quicker to respond to fires, he said.
	   Acting Paco fire station chief, Carlos Cuchon, and other fire
officials defended the former Paco fire chief, who was temporarily
removed from his job Friday.
	   No reason was given for the action against Romeo Almero, but
Philippine media reports say he has been blamed for firemen
arriving late at the scene.
	   ``This is unfair. I was not given a chance to explain,'' Almero
said.
	   Fire officials say the problem was that the call came late.
There were no phones in the area, and the first call came in from a
neighbor several blocks away, they said.
	   Paco firefighters arrived at the scene within minutes of the
call. The fire station was just 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) away from
the orphanage.
	   ``The delay was not in the response but in the call,'' said Maj.
Fennimore Jaudian, Manila's chief arson investigator.
	   The mostly wooden orphanage was already a ``raging inferno'' by
the time residents called a volunteer fire station two blocks away,
Escoto said.
	   The orphanage, built 85 years ago and run by a women's group,
also housed children of unwed mothers and those of working parents.
	   Jaudian said it would take up to 15 days after investigators
gather physical evidence and testimonies from witnesses before the
cause of the fire can be determined.
	   ``We are still considering all possible causes,'' Jaudian said.
``We are considering everything _ all angles, including
intentional, including negligence, including accidental.''

Women's marathon yields first gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese marathon runners Pan Jinhong
and Wang Yanfang will look to get the undisputed giant of Asian
sport off to a flying start when the first gold medal of the 13th
Asian Games is decided Sunday.
	   While China is expected to break three figures for gold medals
for the third straight games, the oldest runner in the field will
be seeking a first gold in any Asian Games for Kyrgyzstan.
	   Irina Bogacheva, 37, is nine years older than the next eldest
competitor in the 13-runner field, and that experience may prove
crucial Sunday.
	   Kyrgyzstan, a nation of 4.7 million people, made its Asian games
debut in 1994, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, and won four
silvers and five bronze.
	   Bogacheva is her nation's best hope for winning a gold medal
here.
	   The biggest question mark is her decision to run the Chicago
marathon less than two months ago. She placed sixth in 2 hours, 30
minutes, 34 seconds but may not have had enough time to recover for
a race in sapping heat despite an early morning start.
	   But Bogacheva knows how to win, having claimed the past two
Belgrade titles and victories in Cleveland, San Francisco and
Minnesota.
	   Japan is missing most of its top runners, including last year's
world champion Hiromi Suzuki, and its challenge will be led by
Naoko Takahashi.
	   Takahashi became the first Japanese woman to win a race on the
international Grand Prix circuit when she claimed the 5,000 meters
at the Osaka Grand Prix earlier this year.
	   Takahashi also has the best entry time of the field _ 2 hours,
25 minutes, 48 seconds.
	   Pan is ranked second on entry times but has more big race
experience than her Japanese rival. She was 11th in this year's
London Marathon after finishing 17th in 1997.
	   Wang also ran in London this year, finishing 13th.
	   North Korean Kim Chang is also experienced, running 26th in
difficult conditions at the Atlanta Olympics.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria came to an abrupt halt on Saturday
as people snaked through polling stations to vote in Nigeria's
local elections, a key first step in the transition of Africa's
most populous country from military rule to democracy.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and grinding
exhaust-choked traffic jams, on Saturday shops were closed while
streets and highways were empty of all cars, trucks or even
motorcycles. All motorized traffic was banned to prevent protests
or traffic jams and children played soccer in silent streets while
adults filed by on their way to vote.
	   Nigeria sealed its borders late Friday and thousands of riot
police were patrolling the major cities and rural villages amid
fears of elections violence.
	   Voters began churning through polling stations, where officials
took peoples' names and gave out special identity cards around 8
a.m. (0700 GMT). The actual casting of ballots was not expected to
begin until shortly before noon and voters were not allowed to
leave the polls before 2:30 p.m. (1330 GMT), when some polls would
officially close.
	   Other voting stations, predominantly in rural areas of this
sprawling West African country, were expected to continue until
7:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) or later. Results are not expected until
Sunday at the earliest.
	   More than 50 million people are registered to vote for some
8,800 municipal government posts. Nine parties have registered and
three have fielded candidates nationwide.
	   Although there was no sign of upheaval, authorities were playing
it safe. More than 100,000 police officers were sent to polling
stations across the country.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians next May
after presidential elections on February 15.
	   Saturday's poll is a key test run. The national electoral
commission is inexperienced and the political parties have vague
platforms and are relatively unknown.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Abubakar, who took control in June following the death of the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, has promised the military will not
intervene in the transition.
	   Nigeria, a country of more than 100 million people which has
failed to tackle grinding poverty despite fabulous oil wealth that
has made it the world's 6th largest producer, has a history of
armed coups and military meddling in politics. The country has been
ruled by civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar has warned that parties which campaign on divisive
ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria,
including several communities near the oil port town of Warri,
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Lagos, where fighting
between Ijaw and Itsekiri youths continued.
	   However, elections officials insisted that voting would go ahead
as planned in other towns where Ijaw leaders had threatened
bloodshed on election day. There was no immediate reports of
fighting.
	   Since official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation have quickly filled radio and
television airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring
election promises on loudspeakers.
	   No firm favorites have emerged for the presidential poll,
although former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has sought
the leadership of the Peoples' Democratic Party, whose members also
include Nigeria's last civilian vice-president Alex Akueme.
	   Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a failed coup attempt
took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
relinquished power and retired in 1979.

Annan headed for Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan left for
Libya Saturday to hold talks aimed at putting two suspects on trial
for the 1998 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie.
	   Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi came amid reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no
authority to hand over the suspects.
	   Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort
island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee to make the flight.
	   It was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but
diplomats said Friday that the meeting will likely take place in
the northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up
a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec.
21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on
ground were killed.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Dutch authorities say they have made arrangements at Camp Zeist,
a former air force base near Utrecht, to hold the trial.
	   On Friday, Annan said the U.N. team ``has done some good work on
the Lockerbie dossier.''
	   ``We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions
together _ once and for all,'' Annan said.
	   But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a
decision on the suspects, Libya's official news agency JANA said
Friday that Gadhafi ``is neither president nor prime minister nor
foreign minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution.''
	   ``As such, Col. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement,''
the report said.
	   JANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspects
would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national
committees before being approved by the Parliament.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue for the trial after Libya
itself proposed the two be tried in a third country.
	   Since then a new hurdle has been the question of imprisonment of
the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them to be jailed in the
Netherlands or Libya but the United States and Britain say they
should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya does not cover an embargo on oil
exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. It covers air travel to and
from the country and an arms embargo. Some Libyan assets abroad
have also been frozen. But many African countries have defied the
air ban and their leaders have flown in and out of Libya.

Sudan to resume sorghum exports to Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The government has authorized the export
of 100,000 tons of sorghum to Eritrea for the first time in more
than three years, an official daily newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The decision was in response to applications by a number of
exporters following a lifting of ban on sorghum exports in view of
the expected bumper crop this season, the al-Anba'a newspaper said.
	   It gave no other details.
	   The sorghum export is the latest sign of easing tensions between
the two countries, which severed ties in 1995 after accusing each
other of supporting armed insurgents.
	   Last month, the foreign ministers of Eritrea and Sudan signed a
memorandum of understanding pledging to try to peacefully settle
their disputes.
	   Eritrea, a mountainous east African state with little arable
land, has for years depended on Sudanese agricultural products,
such as sesame, sugar and sorghum, a staple in both countries.
	   Sudan which consumes some 3.3 million tons of sorghum annually,
is expected to produce over 6 million tons this year.

Women's marathon yields first gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese marathon runners Pan Jinhong
and Wang Yanfang will look to get the undisputed giant of Asian
sport off to a flying start when the first gold medal of the 13th
Asian Games is decided Sunday.
	   While China is expected to break three figures for gold medals
for the third straight games, the oldest runner in the field will
be seeking a first gold in any Asian Games for Kyrgyzstan.
	   Irina Bogacheva, 37, is nine years older than the next eldest
competitor in the 13-runner field, and that experience may prove
crucial Sunday.
	   Kyrgyzstan, a nation of 4.7 million people, made its Asian games
debut in 1994, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, and won four
silvers and five bronze.
	   Bogacheva is her nation's best hope for winning a gold medal
here.
	   The biggest question mark is her decision to run the Chicago
marathon less than two months ago. She placed sixth in 2 hours, 30
minutes, 34 seconds but may not have had enough time to recover for
a race in sapping heat despite an early morning start.
	   But Bogacheva knows how to win, having claimed the past two
Belgrade titles and victories in Cleveland, San Francisco and
Minnesota.
	   Japan is missing most of its top runners, including last year's
world champion Hiromi Suzuki, and its challenge will be led by
Naoko Takahashi.
	   Takahashi became the first Japanese woman to win a race on the
international Grand Prix circuit when she claimed the 5,000 meters
at the Osaka Grand Prix earlier this year.
	   Takahashi also has the best entry time of the field _ 2 hours,
25 minutes, 48 seconds.
	   Pan is ranked second on entry times but has more big race
experience than her Japanese rival. She was 11th in this year's
London Marathon after finishing 17th in 1997.
	   Wang also ran in London this year, finishing 13th.
	   North Korean Kim Chang is also experienced, running 26th in
difficult conditions at the Atlanta Olympics.

Pakistan says it has no `mega' star, but has `mega' team
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Banking on recent signs of
resurrection, Pakistan predicted Saturday it will win gold in the
Asian Games field hockey tournament.
	   ``We do not have mega stars any more, but we have a mega team,''
said Pakistani hockey manager Khawaja Zakauddin, as his team
practiced on Bangkok's outskirts for the 12-nation tournament
beginning Monday.
	   Pakistan's confidence stems from its recent performance. It lost
to the Netherlands 3-1 after taking the lead in the 20th Champions
Trophy tournament in the Pakistani city of Lahore in November.
	   ``Though we lost, mind you we lost to a country which was
holding two top field hockey titles _ World Cup and Olympics,''
said Zakauddin. The Netherlands won the 1996 Olympics title and
then the World Cup earlier this year, at home in at Utrecht. It
added the Champions Trophy at Lahore.
	   ``We have a much younger team and we have a tremendous team
spirit,'' coach Shahnaz Sheikh said as he instructed his players to
practice penalty corners and flicks _ a match-winning technique
that Pakistan is famous for.
	   In fact, against the Netherlands, Atif Bashir, who is now the
captain, had opened the scoring off a penalty corner rebound.
Pakistani penalty corner specialist Sohail Abbas' attempt was
stopped by the Dutch keeper, but Bashir pounced on the rebound and
flicked the ball home.
	   Coach Sheikh said he expects tough battles from reigning Asian
gold medalist South Korea and long-time rival India.
	   ``The Koreans worry us, but we have a game plan for them,''
Sheikh said, but declined to elaborate.
	   The South Koreans, who have remained a force in field hockey
since winning the gold in the 1986 Asian Games at home, are the
favorite to triumph again.
	   ``We have studied the Koreans very closely and we know their
weaknesses,'' Sheikh said.
	   ``India has a very good team, but they somehow fail,'' he said
of his neighbor.
	   Since winning the last Asian Games gold in Hiroshima in 1994,
the Koreans have figured in two World Cups, two Champions Trophy
events and the Atlanta Olympics.
	   The Indians were silver medalists at Hiroshima, but since then
have suffered a downward swing. They placed eighth at the 1996
Olympics and one step lower in the Utrecht World Cup. At this
year's Commonwealth Games, India was out of the medals.

Estrada to hold talks with Hun Sen in Hanoi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
will hold talks with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on the
sidelines of the ASEAN summit later this month in Vietnam, the
government said Saturday.
	   Estrada will ask Hun Sen to establish an embassy in Manila ``as
a way of strengthening the ties between the two countries,'' the
Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said.
	   Hun Sen had requested the meeting with Estrada, it added.
	   Hun Sen will make a state visit Vietnam on Dec. 13-14 and hopes
to stay for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.
Cambodia's entry into ASEAN was postponed last year following
Premier Hun Sen's ouster of Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in
a violent coup.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said last week that
it was unlikely that Cambodia would become a member of ASEAN in
time for the Dec. 15-16 summit.
	   Philippine officials said Manila will not block Cambodia's
membership but will not push for it either because a coalition
government has not yet been formed in Cambodia.
	   A resolution of the crisis and the formation of a viable
government were set as preconditions before ASEAN would consider
admitting Cambodia as its 10th member.
	   The European Union and Indonesia have asked the Philippines to
support Cambodia's entry during the summit, a foreign office
official said.
	   ``Indonesia hopes that the process for admitting Cambodia as a
full member of ASEAN will be forthwith so that the admission could
take place during the 6th ASEAN summit,'' Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said in a letter to the Philippine Department
of Foreign Affairs.
	   Ernst Sucharin, the European Union representative to the United
Nations, told the Philippine foreign mission in New York recently
that the EU supports Cambodia and will ``consider the full
resumption of aid to Cambodia to assist the country in its
reconstruction.''
	   Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said Cambodia will be admitted
into ASEAN once there is a consensus among its current members.
	   He said Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia have
expressed support for Cambodia's membership, while Thailand,
Singapore and the Philippines still had ``reservations.'' Brunei
has been silent about the issue.
	   The Philippines established an embassy in Phnom Penh in 1994,
and Manila has been sending agricultural experts to help train
Cambodians. About 300 Cambodians undergo further training yearly in
the Philippines.

Fisherman wounded by Israeli naval fire in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli coast guards fired on Lebanese
fishing boats in the southern port city of Tyre Saturday, slightly
wounding a fisherman, security officials said.
	   The Israeli navy routinely patrols southern Lebanese waters to
guard against sea attacks by Lebanese guerrillas. The activity
increases with the escalation of guerrilla operations against
Israelis and their allied South Lebanese Army on the ground.
	   Lebanese security officials said a fisherman, Hassan Seknani,
27, was hit in his right arm and taken to a Tyre hospital for
treatment.
	   Tyre, on the Mediterranean, 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of
the Israeli border, has been under ``virtual siege'' by Israeli
gunboats since Friday, said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The firing on the fishing boats came as Israeli warplanes flew
low over several villages in the western Bekaa Valley just north of
the Israeli-occupied enclave in southern Lebanon.
	   Lebanese army and guerrilla anti-aircraft positions fired on the
Israeli aircraft, said the officials.
	   Also Friday, guerrillas of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah group
attacked an SLA outpost, wounding one of its fighters.
	   The attack came in the wake of bombings by Israeli jets of
suspected guerrilla bases in the south where the Israelis have been
targeting suspected guerrilla location from the air almost daily
since Nov. 8.
	   Hezbollah is engaged in a guerrilla war to oust 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the south Lebanon security
enclave that Israel established in 1985 to protect its northern
border towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Egyptian president arrives in Turkey for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak arrived in
Ankara on Saturday for a two-day official visit to discuss Turkey's
often strained ties with the Arab world.
	   Mubarak helped mediate between Ankara and Damascus after Turkey
threatened military action against Syria unless it stopped
sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Turkey and Syria signed a security cooperation deal following
Egyptian mediation in October, which resulted with Syria's
expulsion of the rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``I could see that the Arab world would be forced to side with
Syria,'' daily Milliyet quoted Mubarak in an interview published on
Thursday.
	   Turkey is still reportedly uneasy about Syria's reluctance to
extradite all Kurdish rebels.
	   But Mubarak said: ``What is important is that we have prevented
a war.''
	   Pre-dominantly Muslim Turkey's relations with the Arab world has
already been tense because of its close economic and military
cooperation with Israel.
	   Arab countries and Iran accuse Turkey of tipping the balance in
the volatile region by getting closer with the Jewish state. Turkey
says its cooperation with Israel does not threat any country.
	   During his talks, Mubarak is also expected to discuss ways to
improve bilateral trade.

Tax office bombed, linked to wine-growers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NARBONNE, France (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a tax office in this
southern French town overnight, causing some damage but no
injuries, authorities said Saturday. They linked the attack to
wine-growers demanding disaster aid.
	   The bomb exploded late Friday night inside the meeting room on
the main floor of the building, ripping through the ceiling,
destroying some furniture and shattering windows.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, though police said the
office walls were found with the inscription CRAV, the French
initials for the Wine-growers' Regional Action Committee.
	   The group last week criticized the government as being slow to
provide aid for a frost that occurred last April.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ South Korean Kang Wook-soon fired a 4-under-par
66 Saturday to extend his lead to four strokes over Taiwan's Hsieh
Chin-sheng after the third round of the U.S. dlrs 500,000 Omega PGA
Championship.
	   Kang, who won the Hong Kong Golf Open last Sunday, carded four
birdies over the 6,096-yard Clear Bay Golf and Country Club for a
three-round 13-under-par 197.
	   ``I am hitting the ball better than ever at the moment.'' said
Kang, who is favorite to win this year's Omega Order of Merit.

of Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit and China's Zhang Lianwei. The Thai
returned a 66 on Saturday, while Zhang had a 68.
	   Another stroke behind were Australian Brad Andrews and Carlos
Espinosa of Mexico.
	   Andrews had a 68 and Espinosa carded a 69 to tie for joint 5th

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians on Saturday launched a
protest campaign to demand the freeing of hundreds of prisoners
held for anti-Israeli activity, a dispute that has threatened to
derail the new peace accord.
	   Meanwhile, a week before President Clinton is to arrive for a
three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction burned
U.S. flags Saturday in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the
Wye River land-for-security agreement.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
During it, some two dozen masked marchers burned American and
Israeli flags and waved banners vowing to ``continue the
struggle.''
	   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, the Palestinians' top
negotiator on prisoners expressed regret over a statement by the
Clinton administration a day earlier siding with Israel in the
escalating dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do...concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' said Kadoura Faris,
who is representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the
Israelis on the issue.
	   Without resolution of the issue, he told a rally of about 500
prisoner relatives and their supporters, ``there can be no peace.''
	   Also Saturday, about 2,500 Palestinian prisoners began a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last month it
freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord _ including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled later this month _ until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.
	   The prisoner issue is a highly emotional one, because it touches
nearly all Palestinian families. Almost everyone in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip has had a relative _ a father, a brother, a son, an
uncle, a cousin _ arrested at some point during the 30-year Israeli
occupation.
	   At Saturday's rally in Ramallah, families demanded that the
Palestinian Authority make the release of security prisoners a top
priority.
	   ``The Israelis ... did not release the ones who deserved to be
released,'' said Bahia Jabara, 44, who has husband and brother in
Israeli jail.
	   In another development, the first commercial Palestinian
Airlines flight from the newly inaugurated Gaza airport took off
Saturday morning.
	   But in a sour note, the flight to Amman, the capital of
neighboring Jordan, was delayed for more than three hours by an
argument between Palestinians and the Israelis over airport
security.
	   Meanwhile, a fresh dispute loomed over a meeting that is to take
place during Clinton's visit to reaffirm pledges that the
Palestinians no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   At the Dec. 14 meeting, participants _ members of the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and
various Palestinian groups _ are to ``reaffirm'' a letter to
Clinton in which Arafat declares clauses of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction null and void.
	   The Palestinians say the Wye agreement does not call for an
actual vote, only an acceptance by acclamation. However, Israel
maintains the PNC is required to vote by a show of hands.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Friday the handover of land scheduled
to take place after the meeting would not occur unless there was an
actual vote.
	   ``It has been made clear that Israel will not withdraw troops if
the Palestinians do not adhere to their commitments under the Wye
agreement,'' Bar-Illan said.

U.S. financier's remarks irk Malaysian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Top government officials on
Saturday berated billionaire financier George Soros after he called
for the ouster of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the release
of his jailed former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Soros harbors a long-term plan ``to destroy the
democratically-elected government of this country,'' Works Minister
Samy Vellu told the national news agency Bernama.
	   ``In view of his selfish motives to enrich himself, he has
chosen to destroy the economy of the developing nations,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``Malaysia is one of the victims of the economic
wounds inflicted by him.''
	   Mahathir has not reacted publicly to Soros' comments.
	   In a speech Thursday, Soros told a U.S. audience that Malaysians
should turn against their prime minister because his policies were
aimed at benefiting himself and his cronies.
	   ``I think what needs to happen is he needs to be removed from
power,'' he said at the Johns Hopkins University's School of
Advanced International Studies.
	   Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2, after Mahathir said his former
protege was too immoral to rule. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, and
is on trial on charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Mahathir, 72, has repeatedly accused Soros and other speculators
of using highly speculative investments to move markets and destroy
Malaysia's once-booming economy.
	   On Saturday, the chief minister of Perak state, Ramli Ngah
Talib, told Malaysians to ignore Soros, whom he accused of making
statements that were equally as obtuse as those made by U.S.
Vice-President Al Gore during his recent visit here.
	   ``Any person making such announcements is impaired,'' Ramli
said, referring to Soros. ``It is totally useless for us to listen
to them, and it is best just to ignore it.''
	   Last month, Gore angered his Malaysian hosts at a summit of
Pacific Rim leaders with a speech praising the ``brave people of
Malaysia'' who support Anwar, the country's former deputy prime
minister and finance minister.

French NATO back-up forces to leave for Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Around 700 French NATO troops will
leave for Macedonia on Sunday as part of a back-up force for
international peace monitors in neighboring Kosovo.
	   A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, NATO
ambassadors gave the activation order late Friday to send the
so-called extraction forces to Macedonia.
	   ``The French have to move first since they have to constitute
headquarters,'' the NATO official said.
	   A NATO statement said the force will comprise about 1,500
troops. Around 300 British troops, and about 200 or so each from
Germany, Italy and the Netherlands will join their French
counterparts over the next two weeks, the NATO official said.
	   About 180 people, part of the back-up force, are already in
Macedonia, doing preparatory work for the deployment.
	   Under a U.S.-led initiative and warnings of NATO air strikes,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic recently agreed to pull out
some of his government forces from Kosovo, the violence-torn
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Milosevic also agreed to allow personnel of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify compliance on the
ground.
	   The NATO-led force to be stationed in Macedonia would evacuate
the verifiers, should they run into trouble.
	   But the NATO statement released Saturday warned Belgrade that
its back-up force 'in no way relieves the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia government of its primary responsibility for the safety
and security of the OSCE verifiers deployed in Kosovo.'

Russia's foreign trade shrinking after crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign trade is shrinking as a result of
the economic crisis it could take up to four years to return to
last year's level, the minister for trade said Saturday.
	   Trade Minister Georgy Gabunia told an international economic
forum that Russia's foreign trade turnover was currently at the
1995 level, and will amount to 83-84 percent of the trade level of
1997, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He blamed the decline on the economic crisis, which hit Russia
in August and has clogged the banking system, and the crisis in
Asian economies last year.
	   Gabunia said even when the situation stabilizes, foreign trade
will grow at just 3-4 percent a year, and return to the 1997 levels
only in 2002 or 2003.
	   He said that in order to strengthen Russia's role in world
trade, the government must change customs legislation and simplify
import and export procedures to attract investors.

Chinese detained, another wanted in connection with double murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ A Chinese man has confessed to the
murder of a young Chinese couple in Cyprus, and police are looking
for another Chinese suspect, police told a court Saturday.
	   The court ordered Wang Yiang, 21, to remain in custody for eight
days pending a full investigation into his admission that he
committed the double murder that has shocked the normally placid
Cyprus.
	   Police prosecutor Andreas Kariolemos also told the Limassol
Court that Yiang implicated a compatriot, Hua Cheng Bu, 21, as the
mastermind of the murder.
	   The bodies of the victims, a man and and a woman both aged 23,
were found Wednesday at the bottom of a remote cliff in the central
mountains, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Limassol.
	   Police said they had been battered on the head with an iron bar
and strangled with leather thongs, apparently a couple of days
earlier.
	   The victims' names have not been released pending intimation to
their next of kin in China.
	   The couple had arrived in Cyprus two months ago and had
registered as students at a local college where the two suspects
are also registered.
	   Limassol police chief Miltiades Neocleous said the victims had
been killed in their Limassol apartment, which had been ransacked.
The motive appeared to be robbery as the culprits believed the
couple had a large amount of money stashed in their apartment, he
added.
	   Neocleous had earlier described the crime as ``most unusual for
Cyprus.'' Violent crimes are rare in Cyprus, an island nation of
650,000 people that records less than 10 murders a year.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians on Saturday launched a
protest campaign to demand the freeing of hundreds of prisoners
held for anti-Israeli activity, a dispute that has threatened to
derail the new peace accord.
	   Meanwhile, a week before President Clinton is to arrive for a
three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction burned
U.S. flags Saturday in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the
Wye River land-for-security agreement.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
During it, some two dozen masked marchers burned American and
Israeli flags and waved banners vowing to ``continue the
struggle.''
	   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, the Palestinians' top
negotiator on prisoners expressed regret over a statement by the
Clinton administration a day earlier siding with Israel in the
escalating dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do ... concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' said Kadoura Faris,
who is representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the
Israelis on the issue.
	   Without resolution of the issue, he told a rally of about 500
prisoner relatives and their supporters, ``there can be no peace.''
	   Also Saturday, about 2,500 Palestinian prisoners began a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last month it
freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord _ including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled later this month _ until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine Airlines jet struck
turbulence Saturday, injuring 11 passengers when it suddenly
plunged 1,000 feet (300 meters), airline officials said.
	   After the plane landed in Manila, one passenger emerged wearing
a neck brace and was rushed to a hospital with a suspected fracture
in the upper body, the airline said in a statement.
	   The other passengers suffered bruises, cuts and burns from hot
coffee or tea being served at the time.
	   The PAL Airbus 330-300, carrying 259 passengers, was cruising at
37,000 feet (11,212 meters) when it hit turbulence about 11:15 a.m.
(0315 GMT), two hours after departing from Singapore, the airline
said.
	   Helen Tecson Gamboa told reporters she was preparing to eat her
dessert when the plane shook.
	   ``I saw my friend tossed into the air and hit the ceiling. The
plates were flying. The food trolley also was tossed in the air and
hurt some people when it came down,'' she said.
	   ``I just closed my eyes and stayed in my seat and prayed.''

Taiwan chooses national Legislature, top mayors

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Early election results Saturday showed the
ruling Nationalist Party candidate leading in its challenge to
regain the Taipei mayoral seat, a race that could influence
Taiwan's delicate relations with mainland China.
	   The Nationalists were expected to maintain control of the
Legislature, and they picked up the first two of 176 seats that
were directly chosen by voters in peaceful balloting.
	   Attention focused on the Nationalist candidate Ma Ying-jeou's
campaign to unseat the capital's mayor, Chen Shui-bian, the top
figure in the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which calls
for formal independence from China.
	   Early results with about 12 percent of the votes counted showed
Ma leading, with 51 percent, compared to 46 percent for Chen.
	   A longshot candidate from the tiny New Party, Wang Chien-shien,
trailed with just 3 percent in the race that had been viewed as too
close to call.
	   While the campaigners talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   The Nationalists banked on citizens being scared by the DPP's
platform calling for a declaration of independence from China _
seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the mainland.
	   Beijing is closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, although the two
separated politically in a 1949 civil war.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and postpone the question of whether to pursue reunification or
permanent independence.
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, but his
camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   Ma's party backs eventual reunification with the mainland,
though he did not emphasize this during the race.
	   Turnout appeared heavy among the island's nearly 15 million
eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast
ballots in Taipei.
	   Police had been guarding the more than 10,000 polling stations
across the island _ with huge barbed wire barriers on hand in some
spots _ to try to avoid repeats of violence that has marred past
elections. There were no immediate reports of trouble on Saturday.
	   Businessman David Wu in Taipei said he voted for Ma because of
his ``clean image.''
	   ``His support is unprecedented,'' Wu said. ``He must win or the
Nationalists' morale will be badly damaged.''
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who will retire in early 2000, quietly
cast his ballot with his wife, Tseng Wen-hui, but he declined
offers to appear at polling stations with other candidates hoping
for some last-minute publicity.
	   Voters were directly choosing 176 national legislators, and a
remaining 49 seats were to be assigned to parties based on how many
votes they get.
	   Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern city of
Kaohsiung and city councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Replica of biblical Nazareth aims to bring Jesus' times alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos; Graphic NAZARETH &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) _ Kneeling on a slope in Jesus' hometown,
volunteers from an American church gently fitted rock on limestone
rock and filled in cracks with a mortar of mud.
	   The result of a day's labor was a ragged knee-high wall lining
an agricultural terrace _ a common sight in the Middle East, where
farmers since biblical times have had to plant on rocky hills.
	   But this wall was special.
	   It marked the start of a dlrs 64 million project, largely
financed by American donations, to build a replica of a
biblical-era village and farm in the heart of Nazareth, where
tradition says Christ spent much of his life.
	   In time for the millennium, visitors will be able to stroll
along donkey paths into an ancient village of one-room stone houses
and courtyards, and mingle with actors playing 1st century
housewives and farmers.
	   Or they can follow a ``parable walk,'' accompanied by
storytellers in period costume who will relay news of Jesus as a
contemporary. For the devout, there will be a holy communion, a
foot washing or a reading from the Bible.
	   Project organizers say they want to bring Jesus and his
teachings to life in historical context, something a standard tour
of the Holy Land often fails to deliver.
	   ``You can see only so many archaeological sites before you don't
know anymore what you are seeing and are not moved by it,'' said
Joel Kauffmann, program director of Nazareth Village, a
not-for-profit association of professionals and business people
whose honorary chairman is former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
	   In modern Nazareth _ a noisy, congested city of 60,000 whose
main attraction is the 1950s Church of the Annunciation _ that
connection to the biblical past is especially difficult to make.
	   Jackhammers are tearing up the city center as dlrs 80 million is
being spent on widening streets and building 1,000 hotel rooms in
preparation for an expected 4 million tourists in 2000.
	   But the work is behind schedule and ambitious plans for a large
stadium, a civic auditorium and an additional 1,500 hotel rooms
have been dropped.
	   A new snag arose after November municipal elections. In the
mainly Arab town that is 70 percent Muslim and 30 percent
Christian, the Islamic movement for the first time won a majority
on the city council. The Christian mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, was barely
re-elected.
	   Topping the Islamists' agenda is the construction of a mosque
right next to the Church of the Annunciation, on a spot where city
planners had hoped to build a Venetian-style plaza for tourists.
The dispute is in court and the plaza is on hold.
	   The election outcome worries some Nazarenes, who fear a new
emphasis on religious alignment is emerging in a town that has long
prided itself on tolerance.
	   Mindful of the tensions, the planners of Nazareth Village
decided to get the community involved from the start.
	   ``We're not high-powered Westerners coming in and creating a
theme park, a place whose sole purpose is to make money,'' said
Michael Hostetler, the executive director of Nazareth Village and
an employee of the Mennonite Board of Missions in Elkhart, Indiana.
	   On a recent Saturday, 360 local volunteers launched the project
by clearing thorny bushes covering the 12-acre (5-hectare) plot
that is part of the grounds of a hospital run by the Edinburgh
Medical Missionary Society of Scotland.
	   Muslim girls wearing traditional headscarves worked alongside
Christian teen-agers in jeans and T-shirts and a dozen volunteers
from the United Methodist Church in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Local
grocers donated food for a picnic lunch.
	   By the end of the day, the brush was cleared, laying bare the
terraces of a 1st century farm. Later will come orchards of olive,
fig and plum trees.
	   An earlier archaeological dig yielded a quarry, watch tower
bases, stone irrigation channels and a wine press _ a level area
cut from limestone for squeezing grapes and a vat below for
collecting juice.
	   Frieda Brothers, a 67-year-old retired nurse dusty from hauling
underbrush, said the work helped strengthen her faith.
	   ``It was a joy to get something started that the rest of the
world will see someday and know this is where Jesus walked and
lived,'' she said.
	   It is believed that biblical Nazareth, where Jesus spent much of
his life, consisted of only about 35 homes spread over six acres
(about 2.5 hectares).
	   By 2000, Hostetler hopes to have the first six or seven homes
built and open the site to visitors. The work will then become part
of the attraction, with builders in biblical dress transporting
materials _ all strictly 1st century _ on donkeyback.
	   A ``parable walk'' will weave through the village and the farm
and use existing sites to illustrate New Testament stories.
	   For example, visitors might pause at a terrace and hear the
parable of the farmer who saw some of his seeds go to waste because
they fell on rocky ground.
	   The story might make little sense to visitors used to vast
stretches of fertile land in other parts of the world, Hostetler
said.
	   ``But when you come here, you see the narrow terraces, and it's
not a stretch of the imagination that some of the seeds would
naturally fall on rocks,'' he said.
	   In the later stages, there will be a multimedia exhibit
detailing Jesus' life. At night, visitors might don period dress
themselves and participate in a village celebration.
	   A biblical Disneyland?
	   ``I don't think we should deny the entertainment aspect of
this,'' Kauffmann said. ``But this will not be garish, this will
not be pumped up.''

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes erupted near
three West Bank towns Saturday as Palestinians launched a protest
campaign to demand the freeing of hundreds of prisoners held for
anti-Israeli activity.
	   Dozens of demonstrators on the outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah
and Nablus threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   At least two protesters and two Palestinian police, who were
trying to keep the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, were
hit by rubber bullets in the Ramallah clash. Outside Nablus, two
protesters were hit by rubber bullets and another 10 were sickened
by tear gas as they marched toward a Jewish settlement.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine Airlines jet struck
turbulence Saturday, injuring at least 11 passengers when it
suddenly plunged 1,000 feet (300 meters), airline officials said.
	   After the plane landed in Manila, one passenger emerged wearing
a neck brace and was rushed to the hospital with a suspected
fracture in the upper body, the airline said in a statement.
	   The other passengers of Flight PR502 suffered bruises, cuts and
burns from hot coffee or tea being served at the time.
	   The PAL Airbus 330-300, carrying 259 passengers, was cruising at
37,000 feet (11,212 meters) when it hit turbulence about 11:15 a.m.
(0315 GMT), two hours after departing from Singapore, the airline
said.
	   Helen Tecson Gamboa told reporters she was preparing to eat her
dessert when the plane shook.
	   ``I saw my friend tossed into the air and hit the ceiling. The
plates were flying. The food trolley also was tossed in the air and
hurt some people when it came down,'' she said.
	   ``I just closed my eyes and stayed in my seat and prayed.''
	   The airline said officials from the Air Transport Office have
been called to inspect the plane.

 &UR; Annan in Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan arriving; CORRECTS date in lead to 1988;
EDITS throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived
in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no
authority to hand over the suspects. This position would indicate
that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event
he decides against giving up the suspects.
	   Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort
island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee to make the flight.
	   A Libyan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Annan had arrived in the country but refused to give details.
Libyan media, controlled by the government, did not report on the
visit in a sign that the subject is of great sensitivity.
	   It was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but
diplomats said Friday the meeting will likely take place in the
northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up
a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec.
21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on
ground were killed.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Dutch authorities say they have made arrangements to hold the
trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base near Utrecht.
	   On Friday, Annan said the U.N. team ``has done some good work on
the Lockerbie dossier.''
	   ``We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions
together _ once and for all,'' Annan said.
	   But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a
decision on the suspects, Libya's official news agency JANA said
Friday that Gadhafi ``is neither president nor prime minister nor
foreign minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution.''
	   ``As such, Col. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement,''
the report said.
	   JANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspects
would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national
committees before being decided by the Parliament.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue for the trial after Libya
itself proposed the trial be held in a third country.
	   Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment of
the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them jailed in the
Netherlands or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they
should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's
economic lifeblood. They ban air travel to and from the country and
arms sales. Some Libyan assets abroad have also been frozen. But
many African countries have defied the air ban and their leaders
have flown in and out of Libya.

Saudi Arabia denies seeking dlrs 5 billion loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Finance Minister Ibrahim
al-Assaf has denied that his country is trying to borrow dlrs 5
billion from the United Arab Emirates, the Asharq Alawsat newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Al-Assaf said that although the budget had swelled beyond the
government's expectations, authorities will continue to cover the
budget gap by borrowing from local banks.
	   The London-based Financial Times reported Friday that Saudi
Arabia is looking for a dlrs 5 billion loan from the Emirates to
help cover its budget deficit.
	   Saudi Arabia had originally projected a dlrs 4.8 billion deficit
but analysts predict the deficit to reach dlrs 15 billion by the
end of the year.
	   Saudi Arabia has been hit hard by low prices of oil, its
economic mainstay.

Jordan and Palestinians launch air link

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The first Palestinian commercial flight
landed at Amman's Marka Airport on Saturday, inaugurating an air
route between Jordan and the autonomous Gaza Strip.
	   The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, mostly
Palestinian businessmen and students. The plane will return later
in the day.
	   Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport in the
Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord
which envisages Israel ceding more lands to the Palestinians in
return for security guarantees.
	   Jasser Ziyyad, director-general of the Jordanian Civil Aviation
Authority, said Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the
week on four weekly flights between them _ two by the Palestinian
airline and two for Jordan.
	   Meanwhile, Jordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian
aviation officials as saying one more passenger plane will be added
to the Palestinian fleet of three short-haul aircraft.
	   It said the addition was necessary to transport an estimated
3,600 Palestinian Muslims who wish to travel to Saudi Arabia in
early March to perform the annual pilgrimage to holy shrines in
that country.

Government asks censors to review film on lesbian love
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS : RECASTS with film being sent back to censors for review. No
pick up. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An internationally acclaimed Indian film
about lesbian love has been pulled from theaters and sent back to
cinema censors after Hindu right-wing protesters stormed theaters,
shredded posters and disrupted screenings, a minister said
Saturday.
	   ``The film has been sent back for recertifying to the censor
board. We will wait for their comments,'' junior Information and
Broadcasting Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was quoted as saying by
Press Trust of India.
	   Naqvi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party leads the
federal coalition. The protesters belonged to its right-wing ally
Shiv Sena, which governs the western Maharashtra state.
	   Shiv Sena activists stormed into theaters in Bombay, capital of
Maharashtra, New Delhi and other cities over the past week, trying
to stop showings of ``Fire.'' They call its sexual content an
affront to Hindu values.
	   ``I am not supporting or justifying the violence. The
perpetrators of the violence will be punished,'' minister Naqvi was
quoted as saying.
	   Leading theater and cinema figures Friday petitioned President
K.R. Narayanan against the attacks, and activists said they had
more to do with politics than protecting Indian values.
	   ``I think ``Fire'' is being used by different people for
different ends,'' the film's director, Canada-based Deepa Mehta,
told the private STAR television network Saturday.
	   Its lead actress Shabana Azmi, also a left-leaning social
activist, is a lawmaker in the upper house of parliament, where
opposition members made noisy protests this week about the attacks.
	   ``Fire'' is the story of women in unhappy marriages to two
brothers living in New Delhi in what is called a joint family _ the
brothers, both their wives and their mother under one roof. The
sisters-in-law, seeking comfort, develop a lesbian relationship.
	   The film tackles issues rarely addressed in India, including the
unhappiness of women in traditional families who are expected to
suppress their desires while serving their men and their elders.
	   The film, with its scenes of two women kissing and a brief
full-frontal nude shot, was expected to create ripples in
conservative India.
	   But ``Fire'' ran to packed houses for three weeks, causing only
a smattering of protests from social organizations and women's
groups, before the Shiv Sena began its violent campaign against the
film.

Uzbekistan routs Mongolia, Iran easy winner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Uzbekistan scored 10 goals in the first
half in a 15-0 Asian Games record rout of Mongolia Saturday, while
favorite Iran also advanced to the second round of the games'
soccer tournament.
	   Iran beat Laos 6-1, India edged Nepal 1-0 and Qatar defeated
Maldives 4-0, with Mohammed Al-kawari scoring all four goals as the
23-team first round ended.
	   The top two teams in each of the eight groups advanced to the
second round starting Monday.
	   From there, four groups of four teams will determine the eight
quarterfinalists.
	   Uzbekistan's big win over Mongolia was not unexpected. Kuwait
topped Mongolia 11-0 earlier in the week, equaling the Asian Games
mark that South Korea set in a romp over Nepal in 1994.
	   Then Uzbekistan was tied by Kuwait 3-3 in the final seconds of
its game Thursday.
	   Against Mongolia, Sergei Ubedev scored four times and Igor
Shkvirin three in the 10-goal first half.
	   Mirdjadai Kasimov scored three times in the second half for the
winners.
	   The Mongolian goalie, Per Jargaisaikhan, was almost constantly
in action, deflecting, diving to block and rushing to grab other
shots as the Mongolian defense allowed numerous Uzbek chances.
	   Uzbekistan and Kuwait ended up tied at a victory and a draw
apiece, with the goals scored determining the leader of Group G.
Uzbekistan had a total of 18 with its 15 against Mongolia. Kuwait
was stuck at 14.
	   The Uzbek victory allows it to open up against North Korea in
the second round. North Korea advanced from a two-team group with
the United Arab Emirates after Saudi Arabia's withdrawal caused a
shakeup in the soccer groupings.
	   Iran, with a club full of World Cup veterans that beat Australia
to advance to the final round in France this past summer, topped
Group H with two victories.
	   It meets Oman to start the next round.
	   Striker Ali Daei, who plays for Bundesliga leader Bayern Munich,
scored twice in the second half.
	   Ali Reza Mosavi-Hasanzadeh put the Iran side ahead 2-0 with his
first-half goals, on a chip after 30 minutes and a hard drive from
20 meters about eight minutes later.
	   Laos stunned Iran when Soubinh Keophet scored just before
halftime after weaving his way through three defenders.
	   In the second half, Ali Reza Mansourian upped the count to 3-1.
Daei scored twice in the last 10 minutes to reach the final 6-1.
	   India had a 46th-minute goal from Carlton Chapman to make it
1-0, which stood up through the rest of the second half.
	   In Group C, Japan had already beaten both to take first place
while India also advances as the runner-up.
	   Qatar knocked out Maldives in Group D. Qatar took the group with

Opposition calls for release of police report on Anwar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Bail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An opposition leader on Saturday
demanded the immediate release of a police investigation on the
alleged police brutality against jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, has said that he was
beaten by police officers when he was arrested Sept. 20.
	   He appeared in court with a black eye and bruises on his face
for his trial Sept. 29, where he is facing charges of corruption
and sexual misconduct. He says he is innocent of all charges.
	   His condition shocked the court and an independent police
investigation was ordered.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition legislator, said he was impatient
that the report on the investigation was not out.
	   Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said he had received the report
on Nov. 19 from the special team investigating the alleged beating.
	   But Mohtar said he and other senior prosecutors were still
studying the report.
	   Casting questions on how independent the police investigation
was turning out to be, Lim demanded the report be released
immediately.
	   An article Saturday in the Star newspaper quoted Mohtar as
saying that he had asked a forensic expert in the Kuala Lumpur
Hospital for help to better understand the report's findings.

Gymnast Zhao arrives for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese gymnastics backup Zhao Sheng
arrived Saturday to replace injured world champion Lu Yufu on the
Asian Games team.
	   Lu, 20, is in doubt for the Sydney 2000 Olympics after tearing
knee ligaments in training Wednesday. Head coach Huang Yubing said
he expected the team still would dominate the games.
	   ``Without Lu we'll still win eight to 10 gold medals here. What
I'm really worried about is whether he could recover in time for
the 2000 Olympics,'' Huang said.
	   Zhao, 20, was the winner of the all-around and parallel bars
events at the World Student Games last year. He went straight into
action Saturday afternoon, joining the team for practice about an
hour after his flight landed.

Turkish premier-designate secures ally, but needs more
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's premier-designate made progress
Saturday in putting together a coalition government that excludes
the nation's Islamic party, winning the support of a key
center-right party.
	   Even with the Motherland Party's backing, however, Bulent Ecevit
needs still more allies to form a viable coalition among Turkey's
deeply divided pro-secular parties.
	   ``We trust Mr. Ecevit and we are giving full support. We think
his proposal is the best model that would take the country to
elections in harmony,'' Mesut Yilmaz of Motherland said after his
talks with Ecevit.
	   Ecevit, a veteran politician of the left, was asked by Turkey's
president to try his hand at forming a government to replace
Yilmaz's 17th-month-old coalition, which collapsed last month amid
mafia and corruption scandals.
	   Ecevit has made clear that he would not resort to seeking an
alliance with the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, the largest bloc
in Parliament. Virtue is the successor of the pro-Islamic Welfare
party, which the military pressured out of power last year to stop
the party's push to increase the influence of Islam in daily life.
	   Turkey has a 99.8 percent Muslim population but a strictly
secular constitution. The military sees itself as the protector of
the republic's secular principles.
	   On Friday, the center-right True Path party of former Premier
Tansu Ciller rebuffed Ecevit's proposal for a pro-secular alliance,
saying it would not join any coalition that includes Yilmaz.
	   Yilmaz appeared to chide Ciller on Saturday in announcing his
party's agreement to join a new coalition: ``We expect the same
constructive attitude from other parties concerned.''
	   Ecevit is scheduled to meet with Mrs. Ciller on Monday. If she
sticks to her refusal to join the three-party team proposed by
Ecevit, virtually the only government that could be formed without
the Islamic forces would be a minority coalition with outside
support in Parliament _ weakening the new government from the
outset.
	   The Yeni Yuzyil daily said Saturday that Yilmaz would agree to
extend outside support to a minority coalition of Ecevit's
Democratic Left Party and True Path until scheduled elections in
April.
	   Ecevit said he does not want to consider other alternatives at
the moment. ``This model is the healthiest one,'' he said.

Passengers, pilot survive plane crash in remote Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A plane chartered by Doctors Without
Borders has crash-landed into a rice field shortly after taking off
from a remote provincial airport, and everyone aboard survived.
	   All five passengers and the pilot survived the Friday crash,
Maurits van Pelt, country director of Doctors Without Borders
Holland-Belgium-Switzerland, said Saturday.
	   Two passengers sustained head wounds and required stitches, but
there were no serious injuries.
	   Van Pelt, who was a passenger on the plane, said the engine of
the Cessna 206 stalled after taking off from Stung Treng airport,
245 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Phnom Penh.
	   As the plane slowly dropped, the pilot was able to direct the
plane into a rice field.
	   ``The tail hit the ground first and then the front hit, breaking
the nose wheel off. We bounced and the airplane flew about 20
meters (66 feet) in the air and landed on its back,'' he said.
	   Farmers tending the field assisted the plane's shaken occupants,
loaning them an ox cart to carry their luggage for the 3 kilometer
(1.8 mile) walk to the nearest town.
	   Doctors Without Borders is a Paris-based aid group.

U.N.: current large ozone hole the longest-lasting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ This year's hole in the ozone layer over
Antarctica has stayed over a large area for longer than in any
recent year, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
	   Over the second half of November, the area covered by the hole
stayed at 13 million square kilometers (5 million square miles),
the U.N. weather agency's latest Antarctic Ozone Bulletin said.
	   ``This is the first time in the last 20 years that ozone-hole
values occurred over an area greater than 10 million square
kilometers continuously for nearly 100 days,'' it said.
	   In September, WMO said scientists said expect this year's hole _
which allows the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation to reach the
Antarctic _ to be about as big as the largest gaps that have been
detected in the protective ozone layer since international
measurements began in 1991.
	   It said the hole was off to a strong beginning because the
whirlpool-like wind that develops in the stratosphere above the
South Pole annually is very strong this year.
	   The agency added that the hole will not enlarge out of the
Antarctic, but may reach the southern tip of South America as it
has at times previously.
	   It is expected to stay over the Antarctic from August until
December, as in other years.
	   ``Parts of the Antarctic coastal regions have been both in and
out of the ozone hole,'' the latest WMO bulletin said.

Iraqi deputy prime minister leaves for visit to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz left
Saturday for Russia, a country that is sympathetic to Iraq's
attempts to lift eight years of U.N. sanctions.
	   Aziz departed for Amman, Jordan, about a 12-hour drive by car,
since the sanctions ban flights to or from Iraq, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported. He is expected to arrive in Moscow Sunday.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that Aziz will meet
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov during the four-day visit.
	   Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Iraq,
while urging it to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The
Iraqi government credited Russian diplomacy for helping end
peacefully last month's crisis over U.N. inspections.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift sanctions
imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.

Mobil Oil executive meets with Habibie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobil Vice President for Asia and
Pacific Lance Johnson on Saturday emphasized his company's
commitment to Indonesia remains unchanged by the recent merger with
Exxon.
	   Johnson expressed the promise during a meeting at the state
office with President B.J. Habibie, where he briefed the Indonesian
leader on the recent merger between the two giant oil companies.
	   ``It is very important to emphasize ... that our commitment in
the long term to Indonesia remain as strong as it has been,''
Johnson said after the meeting.
	   Exxon agreed Tuesday to buy Mobil for a record dlrs 73.7
billion, combining the biggest U.S. oil companies.
	   Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
welcomed the merger.
	   ``Mobil Oil will maintain its operation in Aceh and other areas
while Exxon will remain as it has been,'' Kuntoro said.
	   In 1994, Exxon signed a deal with the Indonesian government,
under which both sides agreed to spend some dlrs 40 billion to
develop the Natuna natural gas field in the South China Sea.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Hungarian Airlines passenger died
Saturday after the crew tied him to his seat to stop his abuse of
other passengers and crew members, the state news agency MTI
reported.
	   The Finnish national, who was not identified, was confined while
the Malev, Hungarian Airlines flight was en route to Budapest from
Bangkok. The captain decided to make an emergency landing in
Istambul but the man died before the plane touched down, said MTI.
	   The cause of death and circumstances of the incident are being
investigated by Turkish police and the crew, MTI said. The captain
ordered the passenger bound after he allegedly became intoxicated
and started harassing others in the aircraft.

Malinina wins women's title

<TEXT>
	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ Tatyana Malinina of Uzbekistan took the
women's title, her first international victory ever, at the NHK
Trophy figure skating competition Saturday.
	   Also sharing victories were world champions Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze of Russia, who won the pairs event, and ice
dancing winners Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France.
	   The men's singles competition ends with Sunday's free skating.
	   NHK Trophy is the sixth and last event in the International
Skating Union's Grand Prix series. Under a points-scoring system,
the series lead to the Grand Prix Final, this time in Russia in
March, two weeks before the world championships in Finland.
	   ``I didn't expect to win,'' said the 25-year-old Malinina, whose
best finish in four previous tries at NHK Trophy was seventh place
last year.
	   ``I thought my performance today was perfect, but I wouldn't
rate it 100 percent because I'm hoping to do better and better,''
said a jubilant Malinina. ``I haven't done anything different this
year.''
	   She placed a distant eighth in the Olympics in February, but it
gave her confidence and motivation to continue skating, she added.
	   Malinina took the advantage of error-prone skating in the more
important free program by overnight leader Elena Liashenko of
Ukraine and Russian Irina Slutskaya, and vaulted ahead into the
lead and the victory.
	   Slutskaya, who was second overnight, won the silver medal, while
Fumie Sugiri of Japan edged Liashenko for the bronze.
	   Malinina, skating right after Slutskaya and Liashenko, started
with a beautiful combination of jumps and went on to do more jumps,
spins and spirals cleanly and with sureness.
	   In the pairs event, Olympic silver medalists Berezhnaya and
Sikharulidze held their lead to win the gold. After having already
qualified for the Grand Prix Final with two previous Grand Prix
victories, NHK Trophy was a non-points competition for them.
	   ``As world champions, we're always under pressure to skate well
and perform well each time we're competing. But we're done a good
job,'' said Sikharulidze. Berezhnaya nodded in agreement.
	   Sikharulidze said he feels confident enough to win even if
Olympic gold medalists Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev, also of
Russia, would have competed in the world championships and again at
NHK Trophy.
	   ``Yes, I'm sure we could have won anyway,'' he said.
	   Chinese pair Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo overcame a shaky landing
on the throw jump at the start to place second. When they did
another throw jump in a four-minute performance, Zhao made it look
as easy as throwing a ball.
	   With the silver medal, the Chinese pair qualified for the Grand
Prix Final.
	   Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, with an error-free
performance, moved from fourth to third past the American sister
and brother pair of Danielle and Steve Hartsell, the world junior
champions in 1996.
	   In ice dancing, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France _
second in the world championships and Olympic bronze medalists _
won the gold, receiving scores ranging from 5.6 and 5.8 of a
possible 6.0 for technical merit and 5.8 and 5.9 for presentation.
	   Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia edged Margarita
Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas of Lithuania for second place.
	   ``We worked hard for better results and we also tried something
new'' to improve technical elements as well as artistic
presentation, said Anissina, a former Russian who has skated in
Paris for five years.
	   ``Some people told us last year that our program was full of
emotion but lacked techniques,'' said Peizerat.
	   ``So, we changed a lot with the point in mind ... It's a lot
faster now and has a lot more difficult moves. So I think we have a
chance to win the world title.''

Child starves to death in Transylvania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A 19-month-old girl has starved to
death because her mother couldn't afford to feed her, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Maria Vadeanu weighed less than 9 pounds (4 kilograms) when she
died on Tuesday of malnutrition, an autopsy report said. Her
mother, Ionela Vadeanu, said she fed the girl bean soup and bread _
when she had the money.
	   ``She came crying to me a few days ago, saying she wanted to die
because she couldn't bear to see her child tortured by hunger,''
neighbor Ana Bamber was quoted as saying by the daily National.
	   Neighbors built a coffin out of a few planks of wood and donated
clothes for the little girl's funeral Friday.
	   Mrs. Vadeanu lived with her two children in a temporary shelter
in the Transylvanian town of Fagaras. Her husband was serving a
30-month prison sentence for stealing potatoes from a field.
	   The family's only income was child allowance of 130,000 lei
(dlrs 13) a month. A 3-year-old son, who has rickets, managed to
survive from begging.
	   She could face up to 12 years in prison for allowing the child
to die, the paper reported.
	   In Romania, social welfare and financial help from the state
which poorer people rely on, is inadequate for survival.
	   Since communism ended in 1989, many people spend almost all
their income on food. The average salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs
120) but many people make less than that.

	   The Nationalists also were expected to keep control of the
Legislature in some of Saturday's other elections.
	   Early results showed them taking 54 of 176 seats chosen directly
by voters, compared with 29 for the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and two for the tiny New Party.
	   With about 48 percent of the votes counted in the closely
watched mayoral race in the capital, Ma Ying-jeou, the Nationalist
candidate, led with 51 percent, compared to 46 percent for
encumbent Chen Shui-bian _ the top figure in the DPP, which calls
for formal independence from China.
	   Ma's party backs eventual reunification with the mainland,
although he did not emphasize this during the race.
	   Ma's supporters began celebrating early, setting off fireworks
and cheering as they watched the numbers roll in.
	   An exit poll conducted by the TVBS cable network showed broad
support for Ma among many types of voters but gave no overall
percentage for the balloting.
	   A New Party candidate, Wang Chien-shien, trailed with just 3
percent in the race that had been viewed as too close to call.
	   While the campaigners talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into the presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   The Nationalists banked on citizens being scared by the DPP's
platform calling for a declaration of independence from China _
seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the mainland.
	   Beijing is closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, although the two
separated politically in a 1949 civil war.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and postpone the question of whether to pursue reunification or
permanent independence.
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, but his
camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, has a squeaky clean image and
youthful good looks and charm that earned him the nick-name ``Sonny
Boy Ma.''
	   Turnout appeared heavy among the island's nearly 15 million
eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast
ballots in Taipei.
	   Police had guarded more than 10,000 polling stations _ with huge
barbed wire barriers on hand in some spots _ to try to avoid
repeats of violence that has marred past elections. There were no
immediate reports of trouble on Saturday.
	   Businessman David Wu in Taipei said he voted for Ma because of
his clean image.
	   ``His support is unprecedented,'' Wu said. ``He must win or the
Nationalists' morale will be badly damaged.''
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who will retire in early 2000, quietly
cast his ballot with his wife, Tseng Wen-hui, but he declined
offers to appear at polling stations with other candidates hoping
for some last-minute publicity.
	   Voters were directly choosing 176 national legislators, and a
remaining 49 seats were to be assigned to parties based on how many
votes they get.
	   Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern city of
Kaohsiung and city councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Government set to submit budget to parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government is set to submit its draft budget
for 1999 to parliament next week along with a package of tax bills,
the legislature's speaker said Saturday.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, said he had been
told by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that the government will
submit the draft budget to the lower house of parliament next
Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The new budget will encompass the government's approach to
tackling the worst economic crisis since the Soviet era. Primakov
has previously said that the long-awaited 1999 budget would have to
include unspecified measures to cushion the blows suffered by the
economic setbacks of August.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses.
	   The government announced plans last week to cut taxes as part of
its overall economic strategy. The cuts will serve as a foundation
for the 1999 budget, according to Primakov.
	   The proposed budget has already come under attack, with the
military saying that trimmed military spending could prove fatal to
the Russian army.
	   The Defense Department newspaper, Krasnaya Svezda, said Friday
that the budget envisaged 93 billion rubles (dlrs 5.1 billion) for
the military, or 2.6 of the Gross Domestic Product.
	   ``The minimum level of defense expenses has been set by
President Boris Yeltsin at 3.5 percent of the GDP,'' the newspaper
said in a front-page article. ``The army needs 133 billion rubles
(dlrs 7.4 billion).''
	   ``Such a budget will be fatal for the army,'' the newspaper
said. ``There will be enough money for food and salaries,'' it
said, but not enough to buy new weapons or carry military maneuvers
or to provide the military with vital necessities.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria came to an abrupt halt on Saturday
as people snaked through polling stations to vote in Nigeria's
local elections, a key first step in the transition of Africa's
most populous country from military rule to democracy. In stark
contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and grinding exhaust-choked
traffic jams, shops were closed Saturday and streets and highways
were empty of all cars, trucks and even motorcycles. All motorized
traffic was banned to prevent protests and traffic jams. Children
played soccer in silent streets while adults filed by on their way
to vote. Nigeria sealed its borders late Friday and about 100,000
riot police were patrolling the major cities and rural villages
amid fears of violence. (NIGERIA-ELECTIONS)
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived
in Libya on Saturday for talks on bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no
authority to hand over the suspects. Gadhafi is apparently giving
himself room in the event he decides against giving up the
suspects. Libya's official news agency suggested that a decision
that a decision would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots
national committees before being decided by the Parliament. Annan
flew in from the Tunisian resort island of Jerba after receiving
clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. (LIBYA-ANNAN)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The last main fighting force of the
Khmer Rouge, the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly 2
million Cambodians, surrendered to the government in a ceremony
broadcast on national television Saturday. Khem Nuon, chief of
staff of the remaining guerrillas, negotiated the deal with
representatives of the Phnom Penh government on Friday at Preah
Vihear temple near the border with Thailand. ``We ask for
permission from the Royal Government of Cambodia to rejoin society
and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces,'' Khem Nuon said in Friday's
surrender statement, broadcast Saturday. Not included in the deal
were the fighters' three top surviving leaders, Tak Mok, Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea. Khem Nuon, who served as their chief of
staff, said the rank and file had broken with them. (CAMBODIA-KHMER
ROUGE SURRENDER)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ruling Nationalist Party appeared
victorious in the Taipei mayoral race Saturday, after challenger Ma
Ying-jeou fought to oust the opposition's top politician in a race
that highlighted Taiwan's precarious relations with China. The
Nationalists were poised to keep control of the Taiwanese
Legislature in Saturday's elections. Early results showed them
taking 70 of 176 seats chosen directly by voters, compared with 33
for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and 18 for smaller
parties. While the campaigners talked mainly about tackling the
urban problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning
party would go into presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing. (TAIWAN-ELECTIONS)
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes erupted in two
West Bank towns Saturday as Palestinians launched a protest
campaign to demand the freeing of hundreds of prisoners held for
anti-Israeli activity. Dozens of demonstrators in Bethlehem and
Ramallah threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. At least two protesters and two Palestinian
police, who were trying to keep the demonstrators away from Israeli
positions, were hit by rubber bullets. The clashes broke out as
Palestinians marched to demand the release of so-called security
prisoners _ an escalating dispute that has threatened to derail the
new Mideast peace accord. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)

Nigerians begin the march to democracy with municipal elections

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria came to an abrupt halt on Saturday
as people snaked through polling stations to vote in local
elections that are a key first step in the transition of Africa's
most populous country from military rule to democracy.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and grinding
exhaust-choked traffic jams, on Saturday shops were closed while
streets and highways were empty of all cars, trucks or even
motorcycles. All motorized traffic was banned during voting to
prevent protests or traffic jams and children played soccer in
silent streets while adults filed by on their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria sealed its borders late Friday and about 100,000 riot
police were patrolling the major cities and rural villages amid
fears of election violence.
	   But the mood in many parts of the country was buoyant. At one
police station in Lagos, officers released prisoners awaiting trial
so they could vote. It was unclear if the move had been approved by
senior authorities or if the prisoners would be sought to return
behind bars.
	   ``Even detainees are entitled to vote,'' said a police sergeant
on duty who asked to remain anonymous. ``I will also go vote when I
leave duty.''
	   Voters began churning through polling stations, where officials
took peoples' names and gave out special identity cards around 8
a.m. (0700 GMT). The actual casting of ballots did not begin until
shortly before noon and voters were not allowed to leave the polls
before 2:30 p.m. (1330 GMT), when some polls would officially
close.
	   Other voting stations, predominantly in rural areas of this
sprawling West African country, were expected to continue until
7:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) or later. Results are not expected until
Sunday at the earliest.
	   More than 50 million people are registered to vote for some
8,800 municipal government posts. Nine parties have registered and
three have fielded candidates nationwide.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians next May
after presidential elections on February 15.
	   Saturday's poll is a key test run. The national electoral
commission is inexperienced and the political parties have vague
platforms and are relatively unknown.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Some voters said they did not know who the candidates in their
constituencies were and said they were voting for whoever
represented their favorite party.
	   Others chose individuals who took a strong anti-military stance
during the unpopular rule of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,
who summarily detained, tortured and occasionally killed his
opponents.
	   ``I voted for the Alliance for Democracy,'' said Lanre Komolafe,
an engineer in Lagos. ``Their members fought Abacha under very
difficult circumstances.''
	   Femi Olayemi, a civil servant in Lagos said he was voting for
his children's future.
	   ``If we do not vote, we will not have any reason to tell the
military that they should leave power,'' he said.
	   Abubakar, who took control in June following Abacha's death, has
promised the military will not intervene in the transition.
	   Nigeria, a country of more than 100 million people which has
failed to tackle grinding poverty despite fabulous oil wealth that
has made it the world's 6th largest producer, has a history of
armed coups and military meddling in politics. The country has been
ruled by civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar has warned that parties which campaign on divisive
ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria,
including several communities near the oil port town of Warri,
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Lagos, where fighting
between Ijaw and Itsekiri youths continued.
	   There was no immediate reports of fighting.
	   Since official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation have quickly filled radio and
television airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring
election promises on loudspeakers.

Government asks censors to review film on lesbian love
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD background. CORRECTS byline. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ An internationally acclaimed Indian film
about lesbian love was sent back to censors for review after Hindu
right-wing protesters stormed theaters, shredded posters and
disrupted screenings, a minister said Saturday.
	   ``The film has been sent back for recertifying to the censor
board. We will wait for their comments,'' junior Information and
Broadcasting Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was quoted as saying in
New Delhi by Press Trust of India, adding, ``The perpetrators of
the violence will be punished.''
	   The film was pulled from two theaters in New Delhi and Bombay,
where attacks took place, but it was still being screened at
several other theaters. The government can use bar screening of the
film if it finds it objectionable.
	   Activists from the right-wing Shiv Sena party have stormed into
theaters in several cities over the past week, trying to stop
showings of ``Fire.'' They call its sexual content an affront to
Hindu values.
	   Indian movies usually rely on mushy tales of romance, with lots
of songs and endless dances thrown in. Producers say their audience
wants fantasies, not reminders of the drudgery and misery of their
daily lives.
	   ``Fire'' is different. It's the story of women in unhappy
marriages to two brothers living in New Delhi in what is called a
joint family _ the brothers, both their wives and their mother
under one roof. The sisters-in-law, seeking comfort, develop a
lesbian relationship.
	   The film tackles issues rarely addressed in India, including the
unhappiness of women in traditional families who are expected to
suppress their desires while serving their men and their elders.
Homosexuality also is rarely discussed in India.
	   Leading theater and cinema figures petitioned President K.R.
Narayanan on Friday to stop the attacks, and activists said they
had more to do with politics than protecting Indian values.
	   ``I Think ``Fire'' is being used by different people for
different ends,'' the film's director, Canada-based Deepa Mehta,
told the private STAR television network Saturday.
	   Lead actress Shabana Azmi, a left-leaning social activist, is a
lawmaker in the upper house of parliament, where opposition members
staged noisy protests against the attacks this week.
	   The film, with its scenes of two women kissing and a brief
full-frontal nude shot, was expected to create ripples in
conservative India.
	   But ``Fire'' ran to packed houses for three weeks, causing only
a smattering of protests from social organizations and women's
groups, before Shiv Sena began its violent campaign.
	   Shiv Sena activists have used violence to get their way on other
issues as well. In the past, Shiv Sena members have attacked movies
made by actors or producers critical of their leader, Bal
Thackeray.

Annan in Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN BENEDYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled
to Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no
authority to hand over the suspects. Such a report indicated that
Gadhafi was giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he
decides against giving up the suspects.
	   The official news agency, JANA, said Gadhafi is neither the
prime minister nor the president of the country. It suggested that
a decision on handing over the suspects would have to be approved
by some 500 grassroots national committees before being decided by
the Parliament.
	   A Libyan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Annan had arrived in the country but refused to give details.
Libyan media, controlled by the government, did not report on the
visit.
	   But ordinary Libyans were aware of the developments, and many
said they opposed handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' said Ahmed Abdel-Salam, a fisherman in Tripoli.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the two men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we
have law,'' he said.
	   The Annan-Gadhafi meeting is expected to take place in the
northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
the capital, Tripoli. Reporters were barred from going to Sirte and
ordered to stay in Tripoli.
	   Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort
island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee to make the flight.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up
a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec.
21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on
ground were killed.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Dutch authorities say they have made arrangements to hold the
trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base near Utrecht.
	   On Friday, Annan said he ``will try to resolve some problems and
to find solutions together _ once and for all.''
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue for the trial after Libya
proposed the trial be held in a neutral country.
	   Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment of
the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them jailed in the
Netherlands or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they
should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's
economic lifeblood. They ban air travel to and from the country and
arms sales. Some Libyan assets abroad have also been frozen. But
many African countries have defied the air ban and their leaders
have flown in and out of Libya.

Bob Dole visits Bosnia to review progress on the missing persons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Former U.S. Senator Bob Dole
arrived Saturday to review progress on the missing persons issue in
Bosnia.
	   During his one-day visit to the Bosnian capital, Dole, a
chairman of the International Commission on Missing Persons will
meet with Bosnian leaders, representatives of the international
community, and members of the Muslim, Serb and Croat commissions
for missing persons.
	   Bad roads and wintry weather forced a cancellation of plans to
visit forensic facilities in Tuzla and Banja Luka, where much of
the work of trying identify exhumed persons killed in the Bosnian
war is being conducted.
	   Between 1992 and 1995, about 200,000 people were killed. An
additional 20,000 went missing and are feared dead.
	   Exhumations have been conducted by all three sides_Muslims,
Serbs and Croats_since 1995 in an effort to track down the fate of
the missing.
	   According to the press release issued by the ICMP, in 1996 and
1997 total of 500 remains were exhumed. In 1998, through the joint
efforts of the local commissions and the international community,
almost 1,700 remains have been found.

Russian patriarch calls for abolition of death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church
Saturday called for the abolition of the death penalty in Russia.
	   Patriarch Alexy II told the Interfax news agency that Russia
``must finally arrive at the rejection of the death sentence.''
	   He said the church had always opposed the death penalty, despite
a surge in crime and ``the horrible sadistic murders which sometime
occur here.''
	   Russia promised to scrap the death penalty in January 1996 when
it joined the Council of Europe, a human rights organization.
Nonetheless, 92 people were executed before Yeltsin imposed a
moratorium on executions later that year.
	   Officials said this week that Russia may rescind its pledge to
ban capital punishment because of the country's soaring lawlessness
and crime.
	   Alexy, responding to the suggestion that the death penalty be
restored, said, ``it would be impermissible to return to the tragic
past which we went through in the 20s and 30s,'' the Interfax
report said.
	   With only a moratorium on executions, Russian courts have
continued handing down death sentences and about 1,000 people are
now on death row, according to the Amnesty International human
rights group.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes erupted near
three West Bank towns Saturday as Palestinians marched to demand
the release of hundreds of prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli
activity. About two dozen people were hurt.
	   On the outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, scores of
Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli troops, who responded
with rubber bullets and tear gas. The fighting went on for several
hours before protesters dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The clashes came as Palestinians launched a campaign of protests
to call for the release of so-called security prisoners _ an
escalating dispute that has threatened to derail the new Mideast
peace accord.
	   In addition to the street protests, about 2,500 Palestinian
prisoners began a hunger strike Saturday to press for their early
release.
	   In the Ramallah clash, two protesters and two Palestinian police
were hit by rubber bullets, and three demonstrators suffered
tear-gas inhalation. Five protesters in Bethlehem were shot with
rubber bullets.
	   Outside the northern town of Nablus, three protesters were hit
by rubber bullets and another 10 were sickened by tear gas as they
marched toward a Jewish settlement.
	   Meanwhile, a week before President Clinton is to arrive for a
three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction burned
U.S. flags in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
During it, some two dozen masked marchers burned American and
Israeli flags and waved banners vowing to ``continue the
struggle.''
	   In Ramallah, the Palestinians' top negotiator on prisoners
expressed regret over a statement by the Clinton administration
siding with Israel in the prisoner dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do...concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' Kadoura Faris, who is
representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the Israelis
on the issue, told about 500 protesters at a rally in Ramallah.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last month it
freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals such as car
thieves.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord _ including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled later this month _ until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.
	   The prisoner issue is highly emotional, because it touches
nearly all Palestinian families. Almost everyone in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip has had a relative _ a father, a brother, a son, an
uncle, a cousin _ arrested at some point during the 30-year Israeli
occupation.
	   At Saturday's rally in Ramallah, families demanded that the
Palestinian Authority make the release of security prisoners a top
priority.
	   ``The Israelis ... did not release the ones who deserved to be
released,'' said Bahia Jabara, 44, who has husband and brother in
Israeli jail.
	   In another development, the first commercial Palestinian
Airlines flight from the newly inaugurated Gaza airport took off
Saturday morning.
	   But in a sour note, the flight to Amman, the capital of
neighboring Jordan, was delayed for more than three hours by an
argument between Palestinians and the Israelis over airport
security.

Imelda Marcos to sue husband's associates to recover his wealth:
</HEADLINE>
Report

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The widow of dictator Ferdinand
Marcos claims her family owns much of the country and plans to sue
her husband's former associates who have refused to turn over the
wealth, a Manila newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Mrs. Imelda Marcos and her lawyers are planning to sue to try to
recover up to 1 trillion pesos (dlrs 25.3 billion) in equity in
more than 100 top Philippine corporations that were allegedly
entrusted by Marcos to his associates, the Philippine Daily
Inquirer said.
	   ``We practically own everything in the Philippines,'' Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as saying.
	   She said her family had interests, among others, in electricity,
telecommunications, airlines, banking, beer, newspaper publishing,
oil, hotels and beach resorts.
	   Mrs. Marcos and her lawyers were unavailable for comment. But a
source close to her confirmed her plans to sue.
	   According to the Inquirer, Mrs. Marcos claims that the money
used by Marcos' cronies to acquire majority stakes in Philippine
blue-chip companies came from ``legitimate earnings'' of the
Marcoses.
	   A senior official, however, scoffed at Mrs. Marcos' plans.
	   ``I cannot imagine how she can file such a case,'' said Ronaldo
Zamora, President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary.
	   ``It's very difficult for anybody to say that we own everything
in the Philippines because then the next question would be, `How
did you get that,' '' Zamora said.
	   The report quoted Mrs. Marcos as saying that her family had
controlling interests in such companies as the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co., the biggest telecommunications firm in the
country, in which Hong Kong-based First Pacific recently acquired
controlling interest; as well as San Miguel Corp., the largest food
and beverage conglomerate in the nation.
	   She was also quoted as including in the companies United Coconut
Planters Bank and Allied Bank and Asia Brewery _ both owned by
business tycoon Lucio Tan, who is also chairman and majority owner
of the ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   Mrs. Marcos told the Inquirer she held various deeds of trust,
deeds of assignment and stock certificates showing her husband's
ownership of these companies.
	   ``There is such a principle in law that the person who is not
entitled to the assets, the property or the funds, holds it in
trust for the real owners,'' the report quoted Mrs. Marcos' lawyer,
Rey Dario, as saying.
	   ``Mrs. Marcos wants to recover everything that had been forcibly
taken from her by the government as well as those that the cronies
refused to turn over to her,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The Philippine government has made its own claims on Marcos'
wealth, including about dlrs 570 million in his Swiss deposits now
held in an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   The government says Marcos illegally enriched himself during his
20-year administration.
	   His Swiss accounts are also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who
won a class-action lawsuit for human rights violations against the
Marcos estate and were awarded dlrs 2 billion in damages.
	   Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile
in Hawaii three years later. He had denied any wrongdoing.

Report: BMW expects more resignations over Rover Group losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ BMW expects three more top managers to
resign over the crisis in Rover Group, which could post losses this
year of 1.1 billion marks (dlrs 650 million), a news magazine
reported Saturday.
	   The Die Spiegel report, issued just days after the resignation
of Rover Group chairman Walter Hasselkus, said Rover executives in
charge of quality and finance were to leave their posts as well as
a Bayerische Motoren Werke AG executive.
	   The report, based on an interview with BMW chief Bernd
Pischetsrieder, did not identify the executives.
	   Hasselkus announced his resignation Wednesday, a week after the
company and leaders of its unions reached agreement on a plan to
trim 2,500 jobs from the current work force of 39,000. BMW hopes to
save dlrs 250 million per year due to the job cuts and the
introduction of new working practices.
	   In addition to high losses in Rover Group, BMW expects to lose
300 million marks this year in its subsidiary Rolls Royce. The BMW
brand, however, expects record profits this year of 3.3 billion
marks, according to the report.

Sri Lanka calls off civil war's bloodiest offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's military has called off
its bloodiest offensive in the 16-year civil war against Tamil
rebels, a failed attempt to capture a vital highway in the northern
war zone which has cost more than 7,000 lives, officials said
Saturday.
	   The military has admitted losing more than 2,500 troops in
Operation Certain Victory, which started on May 13, 1997, and
claimed to have killed at least 3,500 Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
	   The military did not give any reason for calling off the fight.
In a tersely worded statement, the military said it had
successfully completed three phases of its offensive but it did not
say if it would resume the fighting later. The military now
controls 40 kilometers (24 miles) of the 70 kilometer (45 mile)
highway.
	   The government had come under increasing criticism from
newspapers and opposition politicians over the offensive,
especially after it postponed local elections in July, saying it
could not provide security for the polls since so many troops were
engaged in the fight for the highway.
	   Capture of the highway would link the isolated Jaffna Peninsula
with the rest of the government-held area. Jaffna, the Tamil
heartland, was wrested from the rebels in May 1996, but its 500,000
people have since been supplied by sea.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast for
the country's minority ethnic Tamils, who say they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and military. More than 56,000 people have been killed
in the war.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat came
to Sweden Saturday amid expectations that he will use the visit to
lay out his vision of a permanent peace with Israel.
	   The official purpose of Arafat's visit is to mark the 10th
anniversary of his statement in Stockholm recognizing Israel's
right to exist.
	   But officials said Friday that unofficial talks between Israeli
and Palestinian representatives have been taking place in Stockholm
since 1994 and Arafat's speech is expected to build on those talks.
	   ``Arafat will, in his talk ... put forward principles for final
negotiations and they can be expected to get wide support,'' Sten
Andersson, chairman of the Olof Palme Center that arranged the
meeting, was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Israel is to be represented at the Stockholm meeting by Yossi
Beilin, one of the architects of the 1993 Oslo peace accord between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Meir
Sheetrit, the parliamentary whip for the governing Likud coalition.
	   A decade after recognizing Israel's right to exist, the question
of whether an independent Palestinian state has the right to exist
is one of the most serious matters troubling the Mideast peace
process.
	   Israel this week suspended the withdrawal of troops from
portions of the West Bank that had been called for under the
U.S.-brokered Wye agreement, and said the withdrawals would not
resume until the Palestinians met several conditions, including a
public declaration that they will not declare an independent state
in May.
	   Arafat claims that the terms of the 1993 Oslo Accord between
Israel and the PLO allow for such a declaration as of May 4, but
Israel disagrees.
	   Israel also says it will not resume troop withdrawals unless
Palestinian authorities accept Israeli criteria for prisoner
releases. The Wye agreement calls for the release of 750
Palestinian prisoners; about 250 have been freed so far and
Palestinians complain that most of those released were criminals
rather than political prisoners.
	   The United States on Friday said it believed Israel was living
up to the terms of the Wye agreement, but stone-throwing clashes
erupted near three West Bank towns on saturday as Paestinians
stepped up demands for the release of more political prisoners.
	   With those clashes, and the ambush beating of a soldier this
week that prompted Israel to suspend the troop withdrawals, the
brief period of optimism after the Wye accord has deteriorated.
	   Arafat originally had planned to go to Oslo, Norway, on Sunday
but has cancelled that leg of his Scandinavian trip, apparently
concerned that tensions were spiraling just a week before the
planned visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton.

New order aims to limit police corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ In a bid to limit corruption within
police ranks, the interior ministry issued an order banning traffic
officers from stopping drivers who have not committed an offense,
the daily Trud reported Saturday.
	   The order, issued by Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev, also is
meant to improve Bulgaria's image as a transit country in the
center of the Balkans.
	   Foreign tourists and truck drivers have often complained about
being halted by police and being asked for money.
	   Under the ban, police can only stop drivers who are suspected of
an offense, and drivers are being asked to report police violating
the order.
	   Interior Ministry officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the new regulation seeks to minimize police
corruption and harassment of drivers.

Annan in Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled
to Libya on Saturday for talks on bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no
authority to hand over the suspects. Such a report indicated that
Gadhafi was giving himself room in case he decides against giving
up the suspects.
	   The official news agency, JANA, said Gadhafi is neither the
prime minister nor the president. It suggested that a decision
would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national
committees before being decided by Parliament.
	   A Libyan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Annan had arrived in the country but refused to give details.
Libyan media, controlled by the government, did not report on the
visit.
	   But ordinary Libyans were aware of the developments, and many
said they opposed handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed Abdel-Salam said.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the two men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we
have law,'' he said.
	   The Annan-Gadhafi meeting was expected to take place in the
northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
the capital, Tripoli. Reporters were barred from going to Sirte and
ordered to stay in Tripoli.
	   Annan flew in aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort
island of Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up
a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec.
21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on the
ground were killed.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law and using Scottish
judges.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue for the trial after Libya
proposed that the trial be held in a neutral country.
	   Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment of
the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them jailed in the
Netherlands or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they
should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's
economic lifeblood. They ban air travel to and from the country and
arms sales. Some Libyan assets abroad have been frozen. But many
African countries have defied the air ban and their leaders have
flown in and out of Libya.

Takahama takes third amateur sumo world straight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Middleweight Tatsuro Takahama of Japan shoved
Germany's Eduard Grams out of the ring Saturday to become the first
wrestler to win three straight titles at the amateur Sumo World
Championships.
	   Bulgarian Svetoslav Binev won the lightweight title match by
throwing down Atsuhiro Ibata of Japan. Binev is the first Bulgarian
ever to win a sumo championship.
	   Wrestlers from 32 countries gathered at Tokyo's Ryogoku
Kokugikan Sumo Arena for the seventh annual tournament.
	   Despite weighing in at a light _ by sumo standards _ 115
kilograms (253 pounds), Takahama has now won 12 individual sumo
titles.
	   The Nippon University student told Kyodo News he was considering
going pro after he graduates.
	   ``I felt an obligation as the Japanese representative. I'm glad
I wrestled well,'' Takahama was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   The heavyweight and openweight title matches and the team
competition will take place Sunday, the tournament's second and
final day.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The countries at war in Congo are expected
to sign a formal cease-fire at a summit in Zambia on Dec. 14-15 and
the Congolese rebels are talking about how they can be brought on
board, a senior U.N. official said.
	   A cease-fire agreement will hopefully be followed by deployment
of an African or U.N. peacekeeping force in the Congo with at least
15,000 personnel, the official said Friday, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   In Paris last week, leaders of Congo and Zimbabwe, which has
sent troops to boost Congo's government, and leaders of Rwanda and
Uganda, which back the rebels, made a commitment to strive for an
immediate cessation of hostilities, sign a cease-fire agreement and
work toward ending the war.

Asian council can't punish late withdrawals from Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Teams whose late withdrawals disrupted
planning for the Asian Games cannot be punished by Asia's governing
sports council because it lacks the rules to do so, the council's
leader said Saturday.
	   But the cases of countries that withdrew from some events or
from the entire games will be referred to the international
federations of the sports concerned for possible punishment,
Olympic Council of Asia President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah
said.
	   The Thai organizers of the games, which begin Sunday, have faced
considerable logistical problems because of late withdrawals.
	   Some countries, citing the strains of Asia's economic crisis,
announced early they would not be competing in some events.
	   Others, however, announced their withdrawals in the last month
before the games, disrupting scheduling and causing other problems.
Soccer was especially hard hit by withdrawals, and the draw for the
competition had to be done over.
	   Thai organizers were particularly upset with Saudi Arabia, which
announced less than two weeks before the games' start that it would
not send a team. It cited the need to prepare for a national
holiday and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Many Thais believe the action was actually a political move to
retaliate for the failure of Thai police to solve a number of
serious crimes against Saudi citizens.
	   Sheikh Ahmad said that a meeting Saturday, the OCA executive
board discussed with its rules committee and the Bangkok games
organizers how they should report details of the cases so that
rules and bylaws can be adopted to deal with such cases in the
future.
	   Sheikh Ahmad said he was very happy with Bangkok's preparations
for the games.
	   ``Of course there are small problems but this is always the case
everywhere,'' he said at a news conference.
	   He described the marketing program for the games as successful
and even exceeding targets despite the economic crisis.
	   He said dlrs 78 million had been realized from the games
corporate partners, and another dlrs 10 million from the sales of
television broadcast rights.
	   He also emphasized hopes for drug-free competition here.
	   He noted that 11 athletes, all from the Chinese team, tested
positive in doping tests at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima,
Japan, in 1994.
	   ``I hope for good results, new records and no doping,'' he said.
	   He said the OCA signed a formal memorandum Saturday confirming
that the 2002 Winter Asian Games would be held in Aomori, Japan.
	   He also gave further details of the Afro-Asian Games planned for
New Delhi, India, in 2001. In talks since the go-ahead for such
games was given a year ago, it was agreed that the event would
include six sports, he said. Swimming, track and field and soccer
would be on the program, host India had proposed tennis, Asian
countries had added shooting, and Africa was believed to want
boxing, said Sheik Ahmad.

Cat faces six-month sentence after flight to Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A cat is serving a six-month sentence in
quarantine after hitching a ride to Canada in her owner's suitcase.
	   John Pearson, a purser with British Airways, discovered his cat,
Katie, in his suitcase after he checked into a hotel in Montreal
following a seven-hour flight from London.
	   ``When I first saw her I thought she was three-legged because
she had a paw caught in her collar. She was limping round like a
three-legged pirate,'' Pearson said Friday, after he and the cat
returned to London.
	   ``Katie must have been in the bottom part of the suitcase which
is in two halves. She must have climbed into the deep half and must
have fallen asleep.
	   ``There was no danger of it being cold for her on the flight
because on the Boeing 777 the air is recirculated through the hold.
She had also wrapped herself up in a jumper (sweater) and big down
jacket which is perhaps why I did not notice her,'' Pearson said.
	   Because of British quarantine laws governing all animals
entering from foreign soil, the 4-year-old black-and white cat
faces a six-month stay in quarantine. British Airways said it would
pay the boarding fees of 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,650).

Taiwan's Nationalist Party has strong showing in key election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more results; nearly 80 percent of votes counted;
analysts' comments; DELETES dated material &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ruling Nationalist Party was leading
in the Taipei mayoral race Saturday, early results showed in a
contest highlighting Taiwan's precarious relations with mainland
China.
	   The Nationalists also were poised to keep control of the
Taiwanese Legislature in Saturday's elections.
	   Early results showed them taking 85 of 176 seats chosen directly
by voters, compared with 40 for the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and 18 for smaller parties.
	   With nearly 80 percent of the votes counted in the closely
watched mayoral race in the capital, Ma Ying-jeou, the Nationalist
candidate, led with 52 percent, compared to 45 percent for
incumbent Chen Shui-bian _ the top figure in the DPP, which calls
for formal independence from China.
	   Ma supporters began celebrating early, setting off fireworks and
cheering as they watched the numbers roll in.
	   Ma's party backs eventual reunification with the mainland,
although he did not emphasize this during the race.
	   While the campaigners talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into the presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   The Nationalists banked on citizens being scared by the DPP's
platform calling for a declaration of independence from China _
seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the mainland.
	   The economic slump that has started to hit Taiwan, as well as
China's threats, may have put voters in a conservative mood that
brought them back to the ruling party, analysts said.
	   ``Despite people's complaints against the Nationalists, they
feel they need the party at the time of financial turmoil,'' said
Lee Hsi-kun, a professor of political science at National Taiwan
University.
	   ``As long as the Chinese threats remain, we can't expect voters
to entrust the DPP to rule the island.''
	   Earlier, the ruling party had appeared to be disenchanting
voters worried about corruption.
	   An exit poll conducted by the TVBS cable network showed broad
support for Ma among many types of voters. A candidate from the
tiny New Party, Wang Chien-shien, trailed far behind.
	   Beijing is closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, although the two
separated politically in a 1949 civil war.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and postpone the question of whether to pursue reunification or
permanent independence.
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, although
his camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, has a squeaky clean image and
youthful good looks and charm that earned him the nickname ``Sonny
Boy Ma.''
	   Turnout appeared heavy among the island's nearly 15 million
eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast
ballots in Taipei.
	   Police had guarded more than 10,000 polling stations _ with huge
barbed wire barriers on hand in some spots _ to try to avoid
repeats of violence that has marred past elections. There were no
immediate reports of trouble on Saturday.
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who will retire in early 2000, quietly
cast his ballot with his wife, Tseng Wen-hui, but he declined
offers to appear at polling stations with other candidates hoping
for some last-minute publicity.
	   Voters were directly choosing 176 national legislators. A
remaining 49 seats were to be assigned to parties based on how many
votes they get.
	   Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern city of
Kaohsiung and city councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.

U.N.: current large ozone hole the longest-lasting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ This year's hole in the ozone layer over
Antarctica has stayed over a large area for longer than in any
recent year, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
	   Over the second half of November, the area covered by the hole
stayed at 13 million square kilometers (5 million square miles),
the U.N. weather agency's latest Antarctic Ozone Bulletin said.
	   ``This is the first time in the last 20 years that ozone-hole
values occurred over an area greater than 10 million square
kilometers continuously for nearly 100 days,'' said the bulletin,
released Friday.
	   In September, WMO said scientists said expect this year's hole _
which allows the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation to reach the
Antarctic _ to be about as big as the largest gaps that have been
detected in the protective ozone layer since international
measurements began in 1991.
	   It said the hole was off to a strong beginning because the
whirlpool-like wind that develops in the stratosphere above the
South Pole annually is very strong this year.
	   The agency added that the hole will not enlarge out of the
Antarctic, but may reach the southern tip of South America as it
has at times previously.
	   It is expected to stay over the Antarctic from August until
December, as in other years.
	   ``Parts of the Antarctic coastal regions have been both in and
out of the ozone hole,'' the latest WMO bulletin said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung
and four of his henchmen were executed by gunshot in China Saturday
after a court upheld their sentences on charges of kidnapping and
gun-running.
	   Cheung, 43, alias ``Big Spender,'' had been convicted in a
sensational trial that focused on the kidnappings of two top Hong
Hong tycoons. The case raised troubling issues about legal
jurisdiction between Hong Kong and the mainland.
	   Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency said Cheung was executed
just a day after he got his final wish, a visit from his two young
sons.
	   His accomplices _ Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and Chin
Hon-sau _ also were executed after a hearing that lasted an hour
and a half, Xinhua reported.
	   Henchmen Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan were given two-year suspended
death sentences, which might later be converted to jail terms.
Another 29 gang members were convicted and sentenced to prison
terms of up to life, but two had their jail time reduced on appeal,
the agency reported.
	   Cheung and his mainland lawyers appealed after the death penalty
was handed down on Nov. 15, on grounds that included Cheung's
``meritorious cooperation during the investigation,'' Xinhua said.
	   Cheung and his gang members were tried behind closed doors on
charges that included the smuggling of dynamite and guns from China
into Hong Kong, armed robberies of gold stores, and the theft of
277 tons of steel. At least one person was killed in the crime
spree, during the steel heist.
	   Cheung's mainland lawyers questioned the jurisdiction of
mainland courts over crimes committed in Hong Kong _ which has a
more open court system and imposes no death penalty.
	   But the Hong Kong government reiterated Saturday after Cheung's
execution that China had the right to try the mobsters and that the
territory respected ``the independence of the judicial systems of
other jurisdictions.''
	   A statement said it was not the first time that Hong Kong
residents were convicted and sentenced on the Chinese mainland for
serious crimes comitted there.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International expressed concerns
that some of the defendants might have been ``ill-treated or
tortured'' so they would confess.
	   Cheung's case was the first high-profile cross-border trial
since the territory reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last
year.
	   His lawyers wanted the case transferred to Hong Kong, but
authorities here had no evidence.
	   The alleged kidnappings of the two tycoons _ identified in
newspapers as Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing; and
Walter Kwok, chairman of the big developer Sun Hung Kai Properties
_ were never reported to Hong Kong police.
	   Cheung's gang was accused of netting the equivalent of U.S. dlrs
210 million in ransom payments.
	   The Guangdong Higher Court upheld the verdicts, saying Cheung
and his gang used mainland Chinese bases ``to plot, plan, and
prepare for crimes later committed in Hong Kong,'' according to
Xinhua.
	   Amnesty International blasted the ``dubious'' court ruling,
saying little evidence had been presented about any conspiracy
carried out on the mainland.
	   Security was tight at Saturday's appeals hearing in the the
provincial capital of Guangzhou, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north
of the border, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Television footage showed relatives of the defendants leaving
the courtroom, some crying, others angry.
	   On Friday, Cheung saw his two sons, 4 and 7. After the 30-minute
visit, Cheung was quoted by the the South China Morning Post as
saying to his father-in-law, ``Take care of my boys.''

Two dozen injured in Israeli-Palestinian clashes over prisoners

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes erupted near
three West Bank towns Saturday as Palestinians marched to demand
the release of hundreds of prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli
activity. About two dozen people were injured.
	   On the outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, scores of
Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli troops, who responded
with rubber bullets and tear gas. The fighting went on for several
hours before protesters dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The clashes came as Palestinians launched a campaign of protests
to call for the release of so-called security prisoners _ an
escalating dispute that has threatened to derail the new Mideast
peace accord.
	   In addition to the street protests, about 2,500 Palestinian
prisoners began a hunger strike Saturday to press for their early
release.
	   Under the Wye peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last
month it freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals such
as car thieves.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it will hold up implementing provisions of the
accord, including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled for later this month, until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted that the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.
	   The prisoner issue is highly emotional because it touches nearly
all Palestinian families. Almost everyone in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip has had a relative _ a father, a brother, a son, an uncle, a
cousin _ arrested at some point during the 30-year Israeli
occupation.
	   In the Ramallah clash, two protesters and two Palestinian police
were hit by rubber bullets, and three demonstrators suffered
tear-gas inhalation. Five protesters in Bethlehem were shot with
rubber bullets.
	   Outside the northern town of Nablus, three protesters were hit
by rubber bullets and another 10 were sickened by tear gas as they
marched toward a Jewish settlement.
	   And a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive for
a three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction
burned U.S. flags in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the
Wye River land-for-security agreement.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Some two dozen masked marchers burned American and Israeli flags
and waved banners vowing to ``continue the struggle.''
	   In Ramallah, the Palestinians' top negotiator on prisoners
expressed regret over a statement by the Clinton administration
siding with Israel in the prisoner dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do ... concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' Kadoura Faris, who is
representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the Israelis
on the issue, told about 500 protesters at a rally in Ramallah.
	   ``The Israelis ... did not release the ones who deserved to be
released,'' Bahia Jabara, 44, who has a husband and brother in
Israeli jails, said at the Ramallah rally.
	   In another development, the first commercial Palestinian
Airlines flight from the newly inaugurated Gaza airport took off
Saturday morning.
	   But in a sour note, the flight to Amman, the capital of
neighboring Jordan, was delayed for more than three hours by an
argument between Palestinians and the Israelis over airport
security.

Vajpayee brings nuclear negotiator, two others into cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ India's negotiator at nuclear talks with the
United States, a whip-cracking former governor of rebellion-torn
Kashmir, and a troubleshooter for Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee joined the federal government Saturday in a cabinet
expansion.
	   The first government expansion since Vajpayee took over at the
head of an unwieldy ruling coalition earlier this year had been
expected for months, but it is also seen as Vajpayee's reply to
charges of weak leadership in the wake of a stunning defeat at the
hands of the opposition Congress Party in last month's provincial
elections.
	   Jaswant Singh, who has held multiple rounds of discussions with
senior U.S. officials over India's signature on the nuclear test
ban treaty, will be the new foreign minister, a portfolio Vajpayee
had kept for himself.
	   Jagmohan, the tough former governor of the northern
Jammu-Kashmir state, will be minister of communications, and Pramod
Mahajan, Vajpayee's former political adviser, was given the
information and broadcasting portfolio. Jagmohan uses only one
name.
	   All three ministers belong to Vajpayee's Hindu-nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party.

Lawyer denies he will defend Indonesian ex-leader in graft case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ghalib's statements 3rd-4th grafs; minor edit
thruout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Doubt was cast over assurances by
ex-President Suharto that he's ready to be questioned over
corruption allegations Saturday when a noted Jakarta lawyer denied
he was willing to defend the old leader.
	   Several analysts also questioned the resolve of Suharto's former
protege and successor President B.J. Habibie to investigate fully
the affairs of his former boss and file charges.
	   Attorney General Andi Muhamad Ghalib said Saturday that Suharto
would be interrogated Wednesday, but stressed that he was not a
defendant.
	   ``The investigation is smooth and there is no obstacle,'' Ghalib
said. ``But we have to recheck with 72 banks where Suharto is
believed to have accounts.''
	   On Friday, government investigators said they plan to question
Suharto next week and officials warned the former autocrat might be
placed under house arrest if he fails to cooperate.
	   Suharto denied any wrongdoing and was quoted by executives from
the Dharmais monthly newsmagazine as saying that he was prepared to
face the new inquiry by Ghalib.
	   ``This is not a challenge. I realize that as an Indonesian
citizen, I cannot free myself from my legal obligations,'' Suharto
was quoted as saying on Friday.
	   ``But everyone should know that this is a state based on law and
every citizen is entitled to legal protection.''
	   The magazine executives, who interviewed Suharto at his heavily
guarded home, quoted Suharto as saying that at least 22 lawyers had
offered to represent him.
	   One of them, Adnan Buyung Nasution, a high-profile Jakarta
lawyer, denied reports he was prepared to defend Suharto against
corruption charges.
	   Nasution, a longtime human rights advocate during Suharto's
autocratic rule, said the reports ``were untrue, misleading and
have the potential to damage my reputation.''
	   The lawyer said he would consider helping Suharto only if the
ex-president's human rights were threatened.
	   Suharto quit the presidency last May after 32 autocratic years
following a wave of deadly riots and student protests.
	   Since his resignation, he has denied allegations that he has
stashed billions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
	   Opponents claim that Suharto had abused his power and had acted
corruptly to amass a fortune for himself, his family and a clique
of cronies.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion.
	   Student activists, who helped bring him down, have staged almost
daily protests demanding he be tried on charges of corruption and
human rights abuses. Troops have regularly stopped them from
marching on his home.
	   On Saturday, security personnel blocked about 1,000 students
from marching on the presidential palace after a smaller group of
protesters held an anti-Suharto rally near the National Monument.
	   Suharto said during the interview that he only held 22 million
rupiah (dlrs 3 billion) in three Indonesian bank accounts.
	   He said this money had been saved from his salary as president
and had been supplemented from rent income from two Jakarta houses
he has leased to foreigners.
	   Ghalib has questioned Suharto before. But an earlier
investigation failed to find any evidence.
	   Critics have accused Ghalib, an army general, of going soft on
Suharto, and say the earlier probe was a whitewash.
	   Although Habibie has said that Ghalib's new probe will be
conducted fully, some observers remain skeptical, the Jakarta Post
reported.
	   ``I have always doubted the government's sincerity in launching
an investigation. They were never serious,'' said Arbi Sanit, a
political science professor at the University of Indonesia.

Prime minister denounces attacks on Christians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee Saturday denounced attacks on the minority Christian
community that religious leaders say have increased since a Hindu
nationalist-led government took over eight months ago.
	   ``There have been some condemnable acts in recent months by
antisocial elements,'' Vajpayee said in a statement.
	   The prime minister was reacting to a peaceful protest march to
parliament by thousands of Christians Friday, when community
leaders alleged that those involved in the attacks are members of
right-wing affiliates of his Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   ``Neither the government nor my party, the BJP, has anything to
do with the perpetrators of these acts,'' Vajpayee said in a
statement. ``I strongly denounce them.''
	   Since the Hindu nationalist BJP took power as head of a 19-party
governing coalition earlier this year, it has been accused of
fanning religious tension.
	   ``India is a secular nation. Equal respect for all faiths has
been the cornerstone of our culture and our nationhood,'' the
statement said.
	   ``My government reassures all our Christian brethren that they
are as valued citizens of the country as everybody else,'' it
added. Christians make up about 2 percent of India's nearly 1
billion people.
	   The United Christian Forum for Human Rights, a group of lay
Christians who helped organize Friday's rally, said it had compiled
a list of almost 90 incidents of violence against Christians since
January. It said the figure was more than the total for the first
50 years of Indian independence in 1947.
	   Among the most serious of the attacks was the Sept. 24 rape of
four nuns by armed men in a village convent in central India, in
which seven people were arrested.

Pre-Ramadan violence rises to 45 dead, Ouyahia to speak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Attacks blamed on Muslim militants ahead
of the holy month of Ramadan have killed 45 people in four days,
including 31 reported Saturday by security forces and hospital
sources.
	   The new wave of violence, barely two weeks before the holy
month, also came before a state-of-the-nation speech planned Sunday
by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, who was expected to announce his
resignation ahead of early elections.
	   Among the latest attacks, a group slashed the throats of eight
villagers overnight Friday in the mountain village of El Kadiria
near Blida, 50 kms (30 miles) south of Algiers, security forces
said.
	   Authorities confirmed earlier reports of a bombing Thursday in a
farmers' market in the mountain town of Khemis-Miliana, 110 kms (70
miles) southwest of the capital, and the death toll rose by one to
a total of 15.
	   The area around Khemis-Miliana, still an area with widespread
militant activity, has been targeted every two weeks in recent
months.
	   In Mascara, in the hills near Tlemcen 400 kms (240 miles) west
of the capital, a bomb Friday killed four people and injured 31
others. Hospital sources said about 60 were hurt.
	   Militants ambushed a police patrol Friday morning in the
mountain region around Bouira, 120 kms (75 miles) east of Algiers,
killing three policemen and wounding five others, official sources
said on customary anonymity.
	   Authorities managed to defuse bombs in Mascara and in the
Algiers neighborhood of Hydra.
	   Security forces have markedly stepped up their security in
recent days, setting up new roadblocks on the southern outskirts of
Algiers along highways leading into the mountains. Hospital
visitors in Algiers have been increasingly searched in recent days.
	   The latest wave of violence began early Wednesday when militants
attacked a mountain village in the Sidi Rached region 100 kms (60
miles) west of Algiers and killed a 12 people in their sleep,
official and hospital sources said.
	   The insurgency broke out after the military-backed government
canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was
expected to win. Since then, at least 75,000 people have been
killed. The insurgency has intensified every year around Ramadan.
	   Reports of the eventual resignation of Ouyahia, in office since
January 1996, have circulated since President Liamine Zeroual
announced in September that he would cut short his term.
	   Early presidential elections are set for April and Ouyahia's
name is among those circulating as potential presidential
candidates.
	   Algerian media have reported that Smail Hamdani, a senator and
former ambassador to Paris, is expected to succeed Ouyahia.

Syria, Iraq trying to join hands on water dispute with Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria and Iraq are trying to reach a
common strategy in their dispute with Turkey over their diminishing
share of water from the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, a top Syrian
official said Saturday.
	   ``We want to reach an agreement that guarantees the three
countries' needs. There should be certain principles so that we can
use water in a logical way and not randomly,' Syrian Irrigation
Minister Abdul-Rahman Al-Madani said.
	   He was addressing a news conference with his Iraqi counterpart,
Mahmoud Al-Ahmed, who arrived here Wednesday. Al-Ahmed is expected
to return Sunday.
	   Al-Madani said Syria and Iraq have a right to fair share of the
two rivers according to international laws.
	   Iraq and Syria share a common problem with Turkey which controls
the flow of the water of the Euphrates river. The two Arab nations
accuse Ankara of building huge dams and depriving them of their
rightful share of the water.
	   Although Turkey has agreed to give Syria some water, Syria says
the quantity is not enough.
	   Al-Madani said that Syria and Iraq have agreed to ``continue
consultation and coordination because ... two rivers should be used
as a weapon of peace among the three neighborly countries.''
	   He, however, ruled out joint irrigation projects with Iraq.
	   Relations between Syria and Iraq began to mend only recently
after 17 years of animosity. They still don't have diplomatic ties.
Turkey also has unfriendly relations with Syria and Iraq.

GCC summit to discuss oil prices, U.S. missile shield plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Gulf Arab leaders
meet here Monday for a summit expected to focus on their countries'
falling oil revenues and a request to finance a U.S. missile
``shield'' for the region.
	   The leaders _ who collectively control nearly 45 percent of the
world's oil reserves and 15 percent of its natural gas reserves _
are also expected to discuss their relations their big neighbors,
Iran and Iraq.
	   For the first time, the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council will be attended by leaders from outside the grouping.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, South African President
Nelson Mandela, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
and the secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, Azeddine Laraki, will attend the three-day meeting.
	   Annan and Mandela were apparently invited to add luster to the
meeting of the GCC, a loose economic and political alliance of
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates that was founded in 1981.
	   Annan will brief the statesmen on Security Council sanctions
against Iraq and ask them to boost their national contributions to
United Nations agencies, U.N. sources said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Some GCC members, such as the Emirates, favor lifting the
sanctions to end the suffering of Iraq's people.
	   But Kuwait, whose invasion by Iraq triggered the sanctions in
1990, and Saudi Arabia, which Iraq attacked during the subsequent
Gulf War, insist that the sanctions remain until Baghdad has
complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. These call for
Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Perhaps the most vexing issue for the GCC states will be how to
rebound from the collapse of the oil price. On Dec. 1, the
benchmark Brent futures hit dlrs 10.42 per barrel _ a 12-year-low.
	   The Gulf oil producers have been hit hard by the sharp drop in
prices. For example, Saudi Arabia had originally projected a dlrs
4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998, but analysts predict the
deficit will reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   According to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who
insisted on anonymity, the summit also will discuss American and
British efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to
set up a ``shield'' of missile batteries in the region.
	   One diplomat said that the GCC reaction to the plan was not as
negative as first believed when U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen promoted the shield plan and asked for funds during his
October tour of Gulf states.
	   The diplomat also said the summit might appoint an envoy to
Iran, with the job of crafting a common policy toward Iran aimed at
thwarting Tehran's attempts to move closer to individual GCC

GCC summit to discuss oil prices, U.S. missile shield plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Gulf Arab leaders
meet in Abu Dhabi on Monday for a summit expected to focus on their
countries' falling oil revenues and a request to finance a U.S.
missile ``shield'' for the region.
	   The leaders _ who collectively control nearly 45 percent of the
world's oil reserves and 15 percent of its natural gas reserves _
were also expected to discuss relations with their big neighbors,
Iran and Iraq.
	   For the first time, the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council will be attended by leaders from outside the grouping.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, South African President
Nelson Mandela, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
and the secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, Azeddine Laraki, were to attend the three-day meeting.
	   Annan and Mandela were apparently invited to add luster to the
meeting of the GCC, a loose economic and political alliance of
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates that was founded in 1981.
	   Annan was to brief the statesmen on Security Council sanctions
on Iraq and ask them to boost their national contributions to U.N.
agencies, U.N. sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Some GCC members, such as the Emirates, favor lifting the
sanctions to end the suffering of Iraq's people.
	   But Kuwait, whose invasion by Iraq triggered the sanctions in
1990, and Saudi Arabia, which Iraq attacked during the subsequent
Gulf War, insist that the sanctions remain until Baghdad has
complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. These call for
Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Perhaps the most vexing issue for the GCC states will be how to
rebound from the collapse of oil prices. On Dec. 1, the benchmark
Brent futures hit dlrs 10.42 per barrel _ a 12-year-low.
	   The Gulf oil producers have been hit hard by the sharp drop in
prices. For example, Saudi Arabia had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion
budget deficit for 1998, but analysts predict the deficit will
reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   According to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who
insisted on anonymity, the summit was also to discuss American and
British efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to
set up a ``shield'' of missile batteries in the region.
	   One diplomat said that the GCC reaction to the plan was not as
negative as first believed when U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen promoted the shield plan and asked for funds during his
October tour of Gulf states.
	   The diplomat also said the summit might appoint an envoy to
Iran, with the job of crafting a common policy toward Iran meant to
thwart Tehran's attempts to move closer to individual GCC members.
Iran enjoys good relations with Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.
	   But the GCC remains wary of Iran's growing military power and
its revolutionary brand of Islam. The council has repeatedly urged
Tehran to withdraw from three tiny islands in the Gulf. The
Emirates claim ownership of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser
Tunb islands, which Iran annexed in 1992.

Taiwan's Nationalist Party has strong showing in key election

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ruling Nationalist Party was leading
in the Taipei mayoral race Saturday, early results showed in a
contest highlighting Taiwan's precarious relations with mainland
China.
	   The Nationalists also kept control of the Taiwanese Legislature
in Saturday's elections.
	   With results still coming in, Nationalists already had 97 of the
176 seats chosen directly by voters, compared with 40 for the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party and 18 for smaller parties.
	   Attention focused on the campaign by Ma Ying-jeou, the
Nationalist candidate, to unseat the capital's incumbent mayor,
Chen Shui-bian _ the top figure in the DPP, which calls for formal
independence from China.
	   With more than 80 percent of Taipei's votes counted, Ma had 51
percent of the votes, compared to 46 percent for Chen.
	   A candidate from the tiny New Party, Wang Chien-shien, trailed
far behind.
	   Chen has not conceded, but Ma supporters had been celebrating
for hours, setting off fireworks and cheering as they watched their
candidate's lead grow as the numbers rolled in.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, has a squeaky clean image and
youthful good looks and charm that earned him the nickname ``Sonny
Boy Ma.''
	   Ma's party backs eventual reunification with the mainland,
though he did not emphasize this during the race.
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, although
his camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   While the campaigners had talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   President Lee Teng-hui plans to retire in early 2000.
	   The Nationalists banked on citizens being scared by the DPP's
platform calling for a declaration of independence from China _
seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the mainland.
	   Beijing is closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, although the two
separated politically in a 1949 civil war.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and postpone the question of whether to pursue reunification or
permanent independence.
	   The economic slump that has started to hit Taiwan may have put
voters in a conservative mood that brought them back to the ruling
party, which had previously been hurt by widespread concerns about
corruption.
	   ``Despite people's complaints against the Nationalists, they
feel they need the party at the time of financial turmoil,'' said
Lee Hsi-kun, a professor of political science at National Taiwan
University.
	   ``As long as the Chinese threats remain, we can't expect voters
to entrust the DPP to rule the island.''
	   Turnout appeared heavy among the island's nearly 15 million
eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast
ballots in Taipei.
	   Police had guarded more than 10,000 polling stations _ with huge
barbed wire barriers on hand in some spots _ but they avoided any
repeats of violence that had marred past elections.
	   After the voters chose 176 national legislators, another 49
seats were to be assigned to parties based on how many votes they
got.
	   The Nationalists appeared to have substantially improved their
popular support across the island.
	   With most of the legislative votes in, they had won almost 52
percent, compared to 46 percent in the race three years ago.
	   Many of the gains represented former Nationalist voters
returning from the New Party, which broke away from the
Nationalists to take a stronger stand for unification.
	   The New Party's popular support plunged to 7 percent from 13
percent, while the DPP's support held at 32 percent, compared with
33 percent before.
	   Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern city of
Kaohsiung _ where the DPP's Frank Hsieh was leading _ and city
councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Experts fear accidental use of nuclear weapons in South Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An accidental nuclear war between
hostile neighbors, India and Pakistan, was cited Saturday as a key
concern of participants at an international conference on peace and
security in South Asia.
	   ``Nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have brought a qualitative
change in the relationship of the two countries,'' Zafar Iqbal
Cheema, conference chairman and chairman of the Department of
Defense and Strategic Studies at Quaid-i-Azam University told
reporters.
	   ``It is now the question of the survival of humanity in this
region. . . Each and every citizen will be affected (in case of a
nuclear war),'' Cheema said.
	   India and Pakistan conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May
generating international fears of a nuclear confrontation in a
volatile region that already has gone to war three times in the
past 51 years.
	   The three-day conference was co-sponsored by a German foundation
called Hanns-Seidel Stiftung and the United States Embassy in
Islamabad.
	   Participants at the conference came from India, China, Russia,
Germany and the United States as well as Pakistan.
	   ``The international trend is for the reduction of nuclear
weapons. It is unfortunate that this region is going against it,''
said Richard Hoagland, counselor for public affairs of the U.S.
Embassy.
	   Cheema said the Kashmir dispute which has caused two previous
wars between India and Pakistan remains a flash point for a nuclear
confrontation if it remains unresolved.
	   Kashmir was divided between Pakistan and India in 1947 but both
nations lay claim to a unified Kashmir.
	   Conference participants agreed nuclear weapons could not be
used.
	   However they also appeared to accept the fact that both
countries would induct nuclear weapons into their arsenals by
suggesting both Pakistan and India develop effective command and
control systems as well as an early warning system.

Angola president calls for rebel leader's isolation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ In a hawkish speech to his governing
party's annual congress on Saturday, President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos called on the Angolan people and the international community
to ostracize rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   ``The only path to peace today is the internal and external
isolation of Dr. Savimbi, and his military hard-liners,'' Dos
Santos told the MPLA congress.
	   The government has severed all contact with Savimbi and his
UNITA rebel group and expelled Savimbi's supporters from the
government of national unity, further weakening the fragile 1994
peace pact.
	   Dos Santos described Savimbi as ``a man who knows only how to
kill, destroy and divide.'' The government has accused Savimbi of
keeping an army hidden in the bush.
	   Dos Santos' opening address at the four-day congress followed
Friday's reports that the army was attacking Savimbi's remaining
rural strongholds, Andulo and Bailundo, where 14 U.N. peacekeepers
are based.
	   Under the peace deal, UNITA has handed back to the government
most of the areas under its control, but has refused to surrender
its central highland strongholds despite pressure from the United
Nations.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Friday reiterated U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call on Savimbi to allow an aircraft
into his strongholds to evacuate the peacekeepers.
	   The U.N.-brokered pact ended a two-decade civil war between the
governing MPLA, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,
and Savimbi's UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.
	   Souring relations between both sides and mutual accusations of
military action have stymied the peace process since.

Hariri's vision gives way to pragmatic search for prosperity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ After a week of dizzying political
change, the grandiose vision of postwar Lebanon as a Middle East
business hub has given way to the pragmatic search for solutions to
mounting economic problems.
	   While the new Prime Minister Salim Hoss has pledged to continue
his predecessor Rafik Hariri's pet program to rebuild the country
devastated by the 1975-90 civil war, he has also vowed to control
the nation's purse strings tightly.
	   The new Cabinet, which held its first meeting Saturday, is also
more interested in cleaning up corruption in government and
bringing down the 40 percent to 50 percent budget deficit.
	   Hariri, a billionaire businessman, quit unexpectedly last week
in an apparent power struggle with new President Emile Lahoud.
	   While no one is suggesting that reconstruction should stop, it
is clear that the new Cabinet will concentrate on practical
spending and prudent investment in productive projects.
	   Hariri's theme of build, build and build has been replaced by
Hoss' ``austerity in the extreme,'' meaning the tenacious business
spirit nurtured by Hariri has gone with him.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist, is widely respected for his
modesty and calculating moves. But he lacks the flamboyant style
and international connections of the globe-trotting Hariri, a
construction magnate.
	   ``We should not forget that Hariri's stature in the country, the
region and on the international scene is quite big,'' political
analyst Sarkis Naoum said in a television interview.
	   He credited Hariri with building the infrastructure _ roads,
telephones, water and electricity _ all necessary to attract
business and investment.
	   But Hariri's amassing of real estate and businesses in Lebanon
has attracted criticism, eroding the admiration he had won for
charity work before plunging into politics.
	   Resentment also grew over his lifestyle: weekend trips to Paris
and frequent visits abroad even if at his own expense, including
one to Iran from where he carted back a dlrs 1 million load of
Persian carpets.
	   This lavish picture contrasted painfully with stories of
Lebanese struggling to make ends meet as the spiraling cost of
living made Beirut one of the most expensive cities in the Middle
East.
	   ``He gave the country concrete structures and many kilometers of
roads but no plan or scheme for where they were leading,'' the
independent English-language Daily Star wrote in an editorial.
	   Hariri's government borrowed from local banks and on the
international market to finance projects, pushing the national debt
to an unprecedented dlrs 16 billion in just a few years.
	   Critics have argued that some projects, like the dlrs 475
million new airport terminal and a planned palace of congresses,
are unnecessary when the country faces such serious resource
crunch.
	   But as Hariri bowed out, he took credit for leaving a country
prepared to take care of itself.
	   The fact that the Lebanese pound remained stable despite his
resignation is a ``a sign that I have succeeded with distinction,''
he said.

Italian held for drugs dies in police station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Italian who was arrested this week for
carrying illegal drugs was found dead Saturday in a Cairo police
station, security officials said.
	   Angleo Maria Michaeli, 38, who owns an alcohol shop in Cairo,
was found dead by his cell mates in the Giza police station, said
the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They said it was not clear how he died and an autopsy has been
ordered.
	   The Italian embassy was closed for the weekend and diplomats
were not available outside for comment.
	   Police said Michaeli and an Egyptian friend of his were detained
Monday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik after they were
found in possession of 140,000 pills of Rohypnol, a synthetic drug.
	   Rohypnol is a prescribed hypnotic and muscle relaxant that has
been widely sold to youngsters as a pleasure-giving agent. In the
United States it is called the ``date-rape drug.''
	   After his arrest, Michaeli was kept in police custody for four
days pending further investigations, and the term was extended by
15 days, said the officials. It was not clear since when Michaeli
had been living in Egypt.
	   No charges had been filed against Michaeli but smuggling of
drugs is usually punished by death in Egypt.

Croats disappointed at international reluctance to give aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An international donors' conference meant
to bankroll Croatian reconstruction ended Saturday with commitments
of only about dlrs 25 million _ approximately 10 percent of the
target.
	   Government officials were disappointed. Foreign Minister Mate
Granic expressed regrets that there was not ``more significant
support from the international community.''
	   Almost 50 countries and 27 organizations took part in the
two-day event designed to finance reconstruction of war-damaged
regions and revive the stagnating economy.
	   The pledges fell far short of the estimated dlrs 2.5 billion
needed to cover the fundamental costs of reconstruction.
	   Most benefactors pledged to continue aid programs already in
place through the European Community and other institutions rather
than directly earmark new funds for housing, infrastructure or
mine-clearance.
	   Some of the reluctance appeared tied to the perception that
Croatia continues to discriminate against its ethnic Serb minority.
	   The government earlier this week agreed to rescind legislation
criticized as discriminatory towards minority Serbs in their
attempts to reclaim homes and get state financial and other help.
	   Croatia's Serbs rebelled and took control of a third of the
country in 1991, but were defeated by the Croatian army in 1995.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians were left homeless, and more
than 170,000 dwellings were destroyed, along with other property.
	   The government has already rebuilt about half the homes
destroyed in the war but says it needs a further dlrs 1.2 billion
to complete the project.
	   Another dlrs 1.3 billion are required to repair roads and
bridges and restore power, water and telecommunication networks,
according to Jure Radic, the minister of reconstruction.
	   More than 10 percent of the country remains littered with mines
and other explosive ordinance. The cost of removal is estimated at
some dlrs 2.6 billion.
	   The United States and the World Bank are Croatia's most
important aid sources. Between them, they account for up to dlrs
350 million a year in donations and loans.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The death toll from almost three weeks of
sub-zero temperatures has reached 83, after a homeless man froze to
death in a Warsaw park.
	   The man, identified only as Adam S., 47, was discovered Friday
night, police said.
	   Poland's extreme cold began Nov. 16, with temperatures dropping
to minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Police say the number of
cold-related deaths in recent weeks is 29 more than the number for
all of last winter, with most victims homeless or passed out from
alcohol.

 &UR; Russia's second city holds election marred by violence, dirty
tactics &QL; 
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ St. Petersburg was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it heads into city elections Sunday, its politics are now
considered as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg, a city that has failed to meet
its high expectations in the post-Soviet era.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by several contract
killings of politicians and leading businessmen, beatings and
drive-by shootings against candidates and frequent reports of dirty
tricks by campaigners.
	   ``Five years ago we could hardly imagine that elections to the
St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly would include threats,
blackmail and assault,'' the head of Russia's Federal Security
Service, Vladimir Putin, said in an interview with the newspaper
Peterburgsky Chas Pik.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   In this atmosphere, 587 candidates are competing for 50 seats in
the city assembly. Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city
legislature has little power, this body could be quite influential.
	   A new city charter, introduced this year after a bitter battle,
calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with extensive
powers.
	   Gov. Alexander Yakovlev _ the city's mayor despite his title _
strongly opposed the new charter, which curtails his clout.
	   Yakovlev is not on the ballot and has not been actively
campaigning for individual candidates. But critics say the powerful
Yakovlev has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Prominent liberal politicians opposed to Yakovlev have found
that people who share the same name were mysteriously proposed as
candidates. This has been done in an attempt to confuse voters and
take away votes from liberals.
	   For example, when voters go to the polls, there will be two
``Sergei Belyayevs'' on the ballot. Voters may be hard-pressed to
determine which one is the well-known liberal and which one is the
anonymous decoy candidate.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   Pensioners have reportedly been taken on ``free excursions'' _
bus rides with presents and free vodka _ which end at a polling
station where the retirees are told that the trip was sponsored by
a certain candidate whom they were asked to vote for.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, but it's
not clear that they will turn out in large numbers.
	   St. Petersburg, which is Russia's second-largest city after
Moscow, had seemed a likely candidate for prosperity in the
post-Soviet era.
	   It's been a liberal, Westward-leaning city ever since the
Russian Czar Peter the Great built it from scratch at the beginning
of the 18th century and dubbed it the country's ``window on the
West.''
	   St. Petersburg produced many of the country's democratic
reformers and free-market economists in the late 1980s and early
1990s, but the city has languished since then.
	   The murder of Starovoitova seemed to symbolize much of what's
gone wrong. No one has been arrested for the Nov. 20 killing of
Starovoitova, who was a member of the national legislature and was
not on Sunday's ballot.
	   But her movement, Northern Capital, was based in St. Petersburg
and is expected to make a solid showing. She was an outspoken
critic of political corruption, and the Russian media has
speculated that she was killed by political opponents.

Prime minister denounces attacks on Christians

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee Saturday denounced attacks on the minority Christian
community that religious leaders say have increased since a Hindu
nationalist-led government took over eight months ago.
	   ``There have been some condemnable acts in recent months by
antisocial elements,'' Vajpayee said in a statement.
	   The prime minister was reacting to a peaceful protest march to
parliament by thousands of Christians Friday, when community
leaders alleged that those involved in the attacks are members of
right-wing affiliates of his Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   ``Neither the government nor my party, the BJP, has anything to
do with the perpetrators of these acts,'' Vajpayee said in a
statement. ``I strongly denounce them.''
	   Since the Hindu nationalist BJP took power as head of a 19-party
governing coalition earlier this year, it has been accused of
fanning religious tension.
	   ``India is a secular nation. Equal respect for all faiths has
been the cornerstone of our culture and our nationhood,'' the
statement said.
	   ``My government reassures all our Christian brethren that they
are as valued citizens of the country as everybody else,'' it
added. Christians make up about 2 percent of India's nearly 1
billion people.
	   The United Christian Forum for Human Rights, a group of lay
Christians who helped organize Friday's rally, said it had compiled
a list of almost 90 incidents of violence against Christians since
January. It said the figure was more than the total for the first
50 years of Indian independence in 1947.
	   Among the most serious of the attacks was the Sept. 24 rape of
four nuns by armed men in a village convent in central India, in
which seven people were arrested.
	   Community leaders welcomed the prime minister's statement.
	   ``Your words are very encouraging and we assure you of our
prayers so that God may help you in your great work for the good of
our nation,'' the Rev. Alan de Lastic, Archbishop of Delhi, said in
a statement.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Top government officials on
Saturday berated billionaire financier George Soros after he called
for the ouster of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and for the
release of his jailed former deputy, the national news agency
reported.
	   Soros harbors a long-term plan ``to destroy the democratically
elected government of this country,'' Works Minister Samy Vellu was
quoted as saying by Bernama.
	   ``In view of his selfish motives to enrich himself, he has
chosen to destroy the economy of the developing nations,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``Malaysia is one of the victims of the economic
wounds inflicted by him.''
	   In a speech Thursday, Soros told a U.S. audience that Malaysians
should turn against their prime minister because his policies were
aimed at benefiting himself and his cronies.
	   ``I think what needs to happen is he needs to be removed from
power,'' Soros said at the Johns Hopkins University.
	   Mahathir fired popular politician, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2,
declaring his former protege as too immoral to rule. Anwar was
arrested Sept. 20, and is on trial on charges of corruption and
illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar, who started a reform movement opposing Mahathir's
financial policies, has denied all charges and has accused Mahathir
of being threatened by his growing popularity.
	   Mahathir said Soros was free to express his opinion. ``I don't
wish to make any comments on the matter,'' he said.
	   Previously, Mahathir, 72, has repeatedly accused Soros and other
speculators of using highly speculative investments to move markets
and destroy Malaysia's once-booming economy.
	   On Saturday, the chief minister of Perak state, Ramli Ngah
Talib, told Malaysians to ignore Soros.
	   ``Any person making such announcements is impaired,'' Ramli
said. ``It is totally useless for us to listen to them, and it is
best just to ignore it.''
	   Last month, U.S. Vice President Al Gore angered his Malaysian
hosts at a summit of Pacific Rim leaders with a speech praising the
``brave people of Malaysia'' who support Anwar.

<SLUG> Iraq denies barring U.N. inspectors from weapons site </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Saturday denied that it barred
weapons experts in October from entering a suspected weapons site
inside an area controlled by exiled Iranian opposition activists.
	   They wanted to enter a site ``belonging to one of the foreign
parties residing in Iraq'' over which Iraq has no control, the
official Iraqi News Agency said, quoting Hussam Mohammed Ameen, the
head of an Iraqi office that deals with the U.N. inspectors.
	   In a letter to the U.N. Security Council dated Dec. 3, deputy
chief inspector Charles Duelfer said a U.N. team could not obtain
access to a site because it was under the control of an exiled
Iranian opposition group.
	   Ameen said Iraq cannot get officially involved when the United
Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming
Iraq, wants to inspect a site occupied by foreigners.
	   He said the rules of disarmament in Iraq require that the head
of the inspection team and the foreign official in charge of the
area work out an arrangement between themselves for entering the
site.
	   Ameen said some U.N. inspectors did want to enter the site
administered by Iranian exiles of the Mujahideen Khalq on Oct. 25.
But the Iraqi side ``strictly adhered'' to the procedures and did
not interfere in the negotiations between the exiled Iranians and
the inspectors, he said.
	   Finally, after almost three hours of discussions, the head of
the inspection team decided not to go in and withdrew his members,
Ameen said
	   The Mujahideen Khalq, which opposes the Islamic government in
Iran, operates about a dozen military camps in Iraq, most of them
close to the Iranian border.
	   Ameen said the same U.N. team had carried out surprise visits to
15 weapons sites including government buildings on the same day.
	   UNSCOM is responsible for destroying Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. Until the mission is complete, the U.N. Security
Council will not lift the economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can
now participate in NATO strategy planning, because all NATO member
states have approved their joining the alliance, German defense
minister Rudolf Scharping said Saturday.
	   The Netherlands early this week became the last country to
ratify NATO expansion to include the three former Warsaw Pact
nations.
	   The three are expected to join in April, as part of marking
NATO's 50th anniversary. With their membership secure, they also
can participate in planning for the NATO summit in April.
	   Scharping, ending a two-day visit, said Poland was well prepared
to join the alliance. Germany has been a strong advocate of
Poland's access to NATO, saying it will serve European security and
stability.

Monument to Lenin unveiled in Murmansk region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A monument to Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin was
unveiled in a northern Russian town Saturday, a news agency
reported.
	   The ceremony in the central park of Polyarnye Zori, a town in
the Murmansk region, reversed the usual post-Soviet pattern of
tearing such statues down.
	   Mikhail Antropov, head of the local Communist Party, told the
Interfax news agency that the monument would ``remind future
generations of the great accomplishments of the leader of the world
proletariat.''
	   Every town in the Soviet Union had a Lenin monument _ and
usually more than one _ but thousands were toppled following the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
	   The unveiling of the new monument may be an effort by the
Communist Party to take advantage of disgust with the current
government and nostalgia for the relative economic stability of the
Soviet era. Aside from the elderly, however, few Russians want to
see a restoration of the Soviet state.
	   In Moscow, the State Duma on Friday recommended the restoration
of a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, head of the first secret police
organization in the Soviet era.
	   The statue loomed before the KGB headquarters in central Moscow
until it was toppled by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991.

Fisherman wounded by Israeli naval fire in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli coast guards fired on Lebanese
fishing boats off this southern port on Saturday, slightly wounding
a fisherman, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Separately, the accidental explosion of a hand grenade killed a
member of a pro-Israeli militia and his girlfriend in a house in
Rmeish village in the Israeli-occupied zone of south Lebanon, the
security officials said.
	   In fishing boat incident, Hassan Seknani, 27, was admitted to a
hospital in Tyre for a bullet wound in his right arm.
	   ``I was out at sea when a gunboat started flashing its lights
toward us,'' Seknani told a local television channel from his
hospital bed.
	   Without warning, the gunboat ``opened heavy fire on us.
	   ``Before I knew it, I felt that I was hit,'' he said.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli military declined to
comment on the incident.
	   The Israeli navy routinely patrols southern Lebanese waters to
guard against sea-borne attacks by Lebanese guerrillas. The patrols
tend to increase as skirmishes escalate between guerrillas and
Israeli forces in the occupied zone.
	   The Mediterranean port of Tyre, 30 kilometers (18 miles) north
of the Israeli border, has been under ``virtual siege'' by Israeli
gunboats since Friday, said Lebanese officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Also Saturday, Israeli warplanes flew low over several villages
in the western Bekaa Valley just north of the Israeli-occupied
zone.
	   Lebanese army anti-aircraft guns and guerrillas fired on the
Israeli aircraft, said the officials.
	   On Friday, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group
attacked an outpost of a pro-Israeli militia, wounding one
militiaman.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon almost daily since early November.
	   Hezbollah is engaged in a guerrilla war to oust 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 militiamen from the zone that Israel established
in 1985 to protect its northern border towns from guerrilla
attacks.

Taiwan's Nationalist Party claims win in Taipei mayoral race
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ruling Nationalist Party scored a
major win Saturday as its candidate Ma Ying-jeou declared victory
over the top opposition politician in the Taipei mayor's race, a
critical contest that highlighted Taiwan's precarious relations
with China.
	   ``It's not my personal victory, but a victory for all of
Taipei's citizens,'' Ma told cheering supporters.
	   Ma said his win would help heal old ethnic wounds between the
native Taiwanese majority and those who emigrated from China after
a 1949 civil war.
	   The Nationalists also kept control of the Taiwanese Legislature
in Saturday's elections.
	   With results still coming in, Nationalists had 97 of the 176
seats chosen directly by voters, compared with 40 for the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party and 18 for smaller parties.
	   Attention focused on Ma's campaign to unseat the capital's
incumbent mayor, Chen Shui-bian, the top figure in the DPP, which
calls for formal independence from China.
	   With more than 80 percent of Taipei's votes counted, Ma held a
commanding lead at 51 percent, compared to 46 percent for Chen.
	   A candidate from the tiny New Party, Wang Chien-shien, trailed
far behind.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, has a squeaky clean image and
youthful good looks and charm that earned him the nickname ``Sonny
Boy Ma.''
	   Chen did not immediately concede, although many of his
supporters were weeping.
	   Ma's fans had been celebrating for hours, setting off fireworks,
cheering and waving flags as they watched their candidate's lead
become insurmountable.
	   Ma's party backs eventual reunification with the mainland,
though he did not emphasize this during the race.
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, although
his camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   While the campaigners had talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   President Lee Teng-hui plans to retire in early 2000.
	   The economic slump that has started to hit Taiwan may have put
voters in a conservative mood that brought them back to the ruling
party, which had previously been hurt by widespread concerns about
corruption.
	   ``Despite people's complaints against the Nationalists, they
feel they need the party at the time of financial turmoil,'' said
Lee Hsi-kun, a professor of political science at National Taiwan
University.
	   ``As long as the Chinese threats remain, we can't expect voters
to entrust the DPP to rule the island,'' Lee said.
	   The Nationalists had banked on citizens being scared by the
DPP's platform calling for a declaration of independence from China
_ seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the
mainland.
	   Beijing is closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and postpone the question of whether to pursue reunification or
permanent independence.
	   Turnout appeared heavy among the island's nearly 15 million
eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast
ballots in Taipei.
	   Police had guarded more than 10,000 polling stations _ with huge
barbed wire barriers on hand in some spots _ but they avoided any
repeats of violence that had marred past elections.
	   After the voters chose 176 national legislators, another 49
seats were to be assigned to parties based on how many votes they
got.
	   The Nationalists appeared to have substantially improved their
popular support across the island.
	   With most of the legislative votes in, they had won almost 52
percent, compared to 46 percent three years ago.
	   Many of the gains represented former Nationalist voters
returning from the New Party, which broke away from the
Nationalists to take a stronger stand for unification.
	   The New Party's popular support plunged to 7 percent from 13
percent, while the DPP's support held at 32 percent, compared with
33 percent before.
	   Voters also chose a mayor for the southern city of Kaohsiung _
where the DPP's Frank Hsieh declared victory _ and city councils in
Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Iraq denies barring U.N. inspectors from weapons site

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Saturday denied that it barred
weapons experts in October from entering a suspected weapons site
inside an area controlled by exiled Iranian opposition activists.
	   They wanted to enter a site ``belonging to one of the foreign
parties residing in Iraq'' over which Iraq has no control, the
official Iraqi News Agency said, quoting Hussam Mohammed Ameen, the
head of an Iraqi office that deals with the U.N. inspectors.
	   In a letter to the U.N. Security Council dated Dec. 3, deputy
chief inspector Charles Duelfer said a U.N. team could not obtain
access to a site because it was under the control of an exiled
Iranian opposition group.
	   Ameen said Iraq cannot get officially involved when the United
Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming
Iraq, wants to inspect a site occupied by foreigners.
	   He said the rules of disarmament in Iraq require that the head
of the inspection team and the foreign official in charge of the
area work out an arrangement between themselves for entering the
site.
	   Ameen said some U.N. inspectors did want to enter the site
administered by Iranian exiles of the Mujahideen Khalq on Oct. 25.
But the Iraqi side ``strictly adhered'' to the procedures and did
not interfere in the negotiations between the exiled Iranians and
the inspectors, he said.
	   Finally, after almost three hours of discussions, the head of
the inspection team decided not to go in and withdrew his members,
Ameen said
	   The Mujahideen Khalq, which opposes the Islamic government in
Iran, operates about a dozen military camps in Iraq, most of them
close to the Iranian border.
	   Ameen said the same U.N. team had carried out surprise visits to
15 weapons sites including government buildings on the same day.
	   UNSCOM is responsible for destroying Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. Until the mission is complete, the U.N. Security
Council will not lift the economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Croats disappointed at international reluctance to give aid

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An international donors' conference meant
to bankroll Croatian reconstruction ended Saturday with commitments
of only about dlrs 25 million _ approximately 10 percent of the
target.
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed regret that there was not
``more significant support from the international community.''
	   Almost 50 countries and 27 organizations took part in the
two-day event meant to finance reconstruction of war-damaged
regions and revive the stagnating economy.
	   The pledges fell far short of the estimated dlrs 2.5 billion
needed to cover the fundamental costs of reconstruction.
	   Some of the reluctance appeared tied to the perception that
Croatia continues to discriminate against its ethnic Serb minority.
	   Croatia's Serbs rebelled and took control of a third of the
country in 1991, but were defeated by the Croatian army in 1995.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians were left homeless, and more
than 170,000 dwellings were destroyed, along with other property.
	   The United States and the World Bank are Croatia's most
important aid sources. Between them, they account for up to dlrs
350 million a year in donations and loans.

Vision gives way to pragmatic search for prosperity in Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ After a week of dizzying political
change, the grandiose vision of postwar Lebanon as a Middle East
business hub has given way to the pragmatic search for solutions to
mounting economic problems.
	   While new Prime Minister Salim Hoss has pledged to continue
predecessor Rafik Hariri's pet program to rebuild the country
devastated by the 1975-90 civil war, he has also vowed to control
the nation's purse strings tightly.
	   The new Cabinet, which held its first meeting Saturday, is also
more interested in cleaning up corruption in government and
bringing down the 40 percent to 50 percent budget deficit.
	   Hariri, a billionaire businessman, quit unexpectedly last week
in an apparent power struggle with new President Emile Lahoud.
	   While no one is suggesting that reconstruction should stop, it
is clear that the new Cabinet will concentrate on practical
spending and prudent investment in productive projects.
	   Hariri's theme of build, build and build has been replaced by
Hoss' ``austerity in the extreme,'' meaning that the tenacious
business spirit nurtured by Hariri has gone with him.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist, is widely respected for his
modesty and calculating moves. But he lacks the flamboyant style
and international connections of the globe-trotting Hariri, a
construction magnate.
	   ``We should not forget that Hariri's stature in the country, the
region and on the international scene is quite big,'' political
analyst Sarkis Naoum said in a television interview.
	   He credited Hariri with building the infrastructure _ roads,
telephones, water and electricity _ necessary to attract business
and investment.
	   But Hariri's amassing of real estate and businesses in Lebanon
has attracted criticism, eroding the admiration he won for charity
work before plunging into politics.
	   Resentment also grew over his lifestyle: weekend trips to Paris
and frequent visits elsewhere abroad, even if at his own expense,
including one to Iran, when he carted back a dlrs 1 million load of
Persian carpets.
	   This lavish picture contrasted painfully with stories of
Lebanese struggling to make ends meet as the spiraling cost of
living made Beirut one of the most expensive cities in the Middle
East.
	   ``He gave the country concrete structures and many kilometers of
roads but no plan or scheme for where they were leading,'' the
independent English-language Daily Star wrote in an editorial.
	   Hariri's government borrowed from local banks and on the
international market to finance projects, pushing the national debt
to an unprecedented dlrs 16 billion in just a few years.
	   Critics have argued that some projects, like the dlrs 475
million new airport terminal and a planned palace of congresses,
are unnecessary when the country faces such a serious resource
crunch.
	   But as Hariri bowed out, he took credit for leaving a country
prepared to take care of itself.
	   The fact that the Lebanese pound remained stable despite his
resignation is a ``a sign that I have succeeded with distinction,''
he said.

25 hurt, 7 arrested in Israel-Palestinian clashes

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A week before the scheduled start of
President Clinton's visit, Palestinian stone-throwers battled
Israeli troops in scattered clashes that left 25 Palestinians
injured. Seven protesters were arrested.
	   The clashes came as Palestinians launched a campaign of protests
to call for the release of so-called security prisoners _ those
held for anti-Israeli activity. The escalating dispute has
threatened to derail the new Mideast peace accord.
	   On the outskirts of the West Bank towns of Bethlehem, Ramallah
and Nablus, scores of Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli
troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The
fighting went on for several hours before protesters dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Police said seven Palestinians, mostly minors, were arrested.
	   In addition to the street protests, about 2,500 Palestinian
prisoners began a hunger strike Saturday to press for their early
release.
	   In the Ramallah clash, two protesters and two Palestinian police
were hit by rubber bullets, and three demonstrators suffered
tear-gas inhalation. Five protesters in Bethlehem were shot with
rubber bullets.
	   Outside the northern town of Nablus, three protesters were hit
by rubber bullets and another 10 were sickened by tear gas as they
marched toward a Jewish settlement.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction burned
U.S. flags in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the Wye River
land-for-security agreement. Clinton's visit is meant to help keep
up momentum on implementing the accord.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
During it, some two dozen masked marchers burned American and
Israeli flags and waved banners vowing to ``continue the
struggle.''
	   In Ramallah, the Palestinians' top negotiator on prisoners
expressed regret over a statement by the Clinton administration
siding with Israel in the prisoner dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do...concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' Kadoura Faris, who is
representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the Israelis
on the issue, told about 500 protesters at a rally in Ramallah.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last month it
freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals such as car
thieves.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord _ including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled later this month _ until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   Washington has insisted the troop pullback proceed despite the
disagreement.
	   The prisoner issue is highly emotional, because it touches
nearly all Palestinian families. Almost everyone in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip has had a relative _ a father, a brother, a son, an
uncle, a cousin _ arrested at some point during the 30-year Israeli
occupation.
	   At Saturday's rally in Ramallah, families demanded that the
Palestinian Authority make the release of security prisoners a top
priority.
	   ``The Israelis ... did not release the ones who deserved to be
released,'' said Bahia Jabara, 44, who has husband and brother in
Israeli jail.

	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Lee Westwood shot a 6-under par 66
to overtake leader Nick Price and grab a two-stroke lead with a
combined 203 after the third round of the Million Dollar Challenge
Saturday.
	   After an even-par first round, the European tour sensation has
gained 13 strokes in the past two rounds. Justin Leonard also
pulled himself up with a 68 to stand in second place (205) in the
field of 12 of golf's top players.
	   The main attraction at this 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player
Country Club course, Tiger Woods, was hanging in there with a 207
after Saturday's 67 -- a score which would have been lower without
a half-dozen nearly missed puts.
	   Price fell even with Woods following a third round 72, which
included three bogeys and a double-bogey on the par-4 11 when he
put a chip shot on the road.
	   Westwood and Leonard played a twosome and had a birdie duel
going. They each saved strokes on holes 2, 6 and 14; Westwood also
birdied on the 1st, 16th and 17th. He just missed birdies on the
9th and 10th when he suffered Tiger's luck with balls lipping the
holes.
	   Mark O'Meara, this year's two-time major winner, lost his chief
challenger status. He fell to five off the lead with par round for
a 208 total.

Berlin's main train station shuts for repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The German railway's vow to improve service and
punctuality faced its first test Saturday with a day-long shutdown
of the Zoo station, the bustling nexus of train travel through
Berlin.
	   The closing for the installation of improved signal and security
technology caused few delays as regional trains were diverted to
other stations, Deutsche Bahn officials said.
	   The railway provided shuttle buses and vouchers for taxis and
public transportation so passengers could make connections at the
city's three other main stations _ East, Nauen and Lichtenberg.
	   Critics had predicted travel chaos, such as the hours of delays
in May when the railway installed its new summer schedules.
Nevertheless, about 400 trains ran on schedule, serving 72,000
passenger, rail officials said.
	   Earlier this week, Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig unveiled
an ambitious program for better service, security and punctuality.
Ludewig has been under pressure to improve the railway's image
since the June crash of a high-speed train in Eschede in which 101
people died and 87 were injured.

North Korea fears U.S. attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A senior North Korean diplomat
Saturday denied reports that his country helped Islamabad develop
medium-range missiles.
	   Brig. Kim Rak Hun, Defense Attache at the North Korean embassy
in Islamabad told a news conference that the United States was
behind accusations of North Korean aid to Pakistan.
	   Pakistan's privately-run News Network International quoted Hun
as saying that the United States was seeking a reason to attack
North Korea and impose a war on it.
	   ``Nowadays, the U.S. imperialists are loudly crying that
tensions have been heightened because of North Korea's underground
nuclear facility and its launch of an artificial satellite,'' Hun
was quoted as saying.
	   ``I want to convey my message to them that the valiant people of
Korea will defend their geographical frontiers at all cost. . . if
our people are targeted, we will follow the Americans across the
earth, sky and sea,'' he said.
	   He denied accusations that North Korea possess chemical weapons
and urged their friends to take notice of the ``United States'
aggressive designs.''
	   It wasn't immediately clear why Hun called the news conference
held in the federal capital. There have been no fresh accusations
against North Korea. Previously North Korea was said to have
provided missile technology as well as material needed to build
nuclear weapons, charges both Pakistan and North Korea have denied.

scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Versace, Armani and other top design firms were
victims rather than culprits in Italy's bribery scandals, the
nation's highest appeals court agreed in upholding a ruling
absolving the fashion houses.
	   In a trial starting in 1996, prosecutors in Milan accused the
designers of bribing tax police to go easy on them in audits.
	   The designers said any bribes were extorted, leaving them no
choice but to pay or see their businesses suffer.
	   A Milan court ruled for the designers in January. The high court
on Friday rejected an appeal by prosecutors.
	   The verdict ``confirmed the faith I have always had in the
justice system,'' designer Gianfranco Ferre said in a statement.
	   Bribery investigations earlier in the 1990s brought down
hundreds of Italy's leading figures in politics and industry.

	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Mobil Oil's Qatar subsidiary Saturday signed
a final agreement Saturday with the state-owned Qatar General
Petroleum Corp. to develop part of the tiny Gulf country's natural
gas reserves.
	   The production-sharing agreement calls for the development of a
enhanced gas utilization project, beginning next year.
	   Last year the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on
the project.
	   The project will eventually produce 1 billion cubic feet of gas
per day.
	   The gas will be used as fuel in chemical, petrochemical and
other industries at Ras Laffan Industrial city and other places.
	   By-products _ such as condensate, butane, propane and ethanes _
will be extracted from the gas to feed local oil and petrochemical
ventures. They will also be exported to overseas markets.
	   The project will be constructed in phases, with initial gas
sales planned for 2002.
	   The latest agreement expands Mobil's position in Qatar, where it
already has stakes in the major liquefied natural gas facilities at
Ras Laffan.
	   Qatar sits atop the world's third-largest reserves of natural
gas after Russia and Iran.

	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is advising
Iran on its economy, but is not yet talking about a bailout
package, a top IMF official said Saturday.
	   The IMF is giving Iran advice and technical assistance, IMF
Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said on the sidelines
of the Oman International Economic Conference.
	   ``We're always prepared to give whatever support they need,'' he
said, ``that's why we're in close contact.''
	   Along with other major oil producers, Iran's economy is
suffering from the sharp drop in the price of oil, its main source
of revenue.
	   Sugisaki said Iran is running a deficit in public financing as
well as in its external accounts. The country is also plagued by
high inflation, unemployment and a rapidly growing population.
	   But he praised the administration of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami for its ``liberal approach to economic development'' and
efforts to boost foreign investment.

approved four projects worth a total of around 60 million dinars
(dlrs 198.67 million). He said the ventures involved health,
educational and consulting services, in addition to manufacturing
and marketing petrochemical products. Al-Rashed would not
elaborate.
	   The company is issuing new stocks and hopes to raise the capital
by the end of the year. It was established in 1975 and is listed on
the Kuwait Stock Exchange.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The National Oil Company plans to increase
its natural gas production by 66 percent to 55 million cubic feet
to supply electricity turbines, a company official said Saturday.
	   The gas will be used to generate 135 megawatt of electricity, or
19 percent of Jordan power, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said the increase stems from greater extraction at the
al-Risheh field on Jordan's eastern border.
	   Jordan is believed to have vast amounts of natural gas in the
al-Risheh area. But the government says it has little money to
spend on extraction.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government plans to spend 600 million
dinars (dlrs 845 million) on energy projects in the kingdom in the
next two years, an energy ministry official said Saturday.
	   The government will spend 500 million dinars (dlrs 704 million)
on the generation and distribution of electric power, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The remaining 100 million dinars (dlrs 141 million) will be
spent on constructing bunkers to store crude oil and derivatives
near Jordan's sole refinery in Zarqa, 27 kilometers (17 miles)
northeast of Amman, he said.
	   Jordan has no known oil reserves. It depends on Iraq for its
daily requirement of 90,000 barrels of crude and fuel oil.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes erupted in the
West Bank on Saturday as Palestinians marched to demand the release
of hundreds of prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activity. About
two dozen people were injured and seven protesters were arrested.
	   On the outskirts of the West Bank towns of Bethlehem, Ramallah
and Nablus, scores of Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli
troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The
fighting went on for several hours before protesters dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Police said seven Palestinians, mostly minors, were arrested.
	   The clashes came as Palestinians launched a campaign of protests
to call for the release of so-called security prisoners _ those
held for anti-Israeli activity. The escalating dispute has
threatened to derail the new Mideast peace accord.

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Guests were given an
extra-warm welcome by tourism officials at the airport Friday and
Saturday in an effort to erase the impact of an incident in which
workers held resort guests hostage.
	   The Club Med resort in the town of Sainte-Anne reopened its
doors Friday, a month after workers went on strike and refused to
allow the 373 guests to leave the grounds. Police eventually
stormed the hotel and ended the standoff with no significant
injuries.
	   The resort was temporarily closed after the incident and the
management and employees reached an agreement on Nov. 18 to settle
the strike.

Parliament furor over report on sale of women, probe ordered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police have been ordered to investigate
a newspaper report about the alleged sale of women for prostitution
in a southern Indian village after angry protests from lawmakers in
parliament, officials said Saturday.
	   Chandrababu Naidu, top elected official of the Andhra Pradesh,
ordered the state's police chief to take tough action over the
alleged auction of eight women in Eluru village to bidders for
prices ranging from 5,000 rupees (dlrs 120) to 30,000 rupees (dlrs
720), officials said. The women were said to be between 16 and 30
years old.
	   Nearly 1,250 kilometers (775 miles) north in New Delhi,
lawmakers in parliament angrily waved copies of The Indian Express
newspaper Friday, which had front-paged the story with a
secretely-taken photograph of the village gathering.
	   The newspaper said it was customary among the members of the
Dommara and Bhogam tribes of the region to hold similar auctions
four times a year, when young women were sold off for a one-year
prostitution contract.
	   Officials in Hyderabad said police had conducted raids Friday
and Saturday on brothels in the region where poor women are forced
to become sex workers after being bought from villages. Naidu urged
village councils to report such incidents to the police.
	   Women rights activists alleged police and politicians were also
involved in the scandal. There was no immediate reaction on the
accusation from the government.

Soccer fans block highway after club punished
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Hundreds of soccer fans, angry over
their team's punishment, blocked Greece's main highway for an hour
Saturday outside this northern port city.
	   It was the latest protest against a decision to penalize
Salonica's PAOK soccer team for crowd violence during a Nov. 1 game
at home against Olympiakos of Piraeus. PAOK fans invaded the pitch
and wounded an assistant referee after a controversial decision to
disallow a goal. The team was stripped of three points and ordered
to play five home-games away.
	   Last month, more than 10,000 angry fans demonstrated in downtown
Salonica against what they say is favoritism shown toward Athens'
teams by referees and soccer league organizers.
	   ``This is just a small sample of the things to come,'' protest
organizer Christos Papanikolaou said Saturday, but did not
elaborate.
	   The roadblock along the Athens-Salonica highway was held before
PAOK players traveled by bus to play in the northern town of Verria
against the team of that name.
	   For many sports fans in northern Greece, PAOK's punishment has
become an issue of regional pride.
	   Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos, who represents a Salonica
constituency as a member of parliament, said Monday that PAOK fans'
protests were justified. He charged that ``gangsters'' have a
strong grip on the Greek football league.
	   PAOK is currently placed fifth in the 18-team standing.

	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Lee Westwood shot a 6-under par 66
to overtake leader Nick Price and grab a two-stroke lead with a
combined 203 after the third round of the Million Dollar Challenge
Saturday.
	   After an even-par first round, the European tour sensation has
gained 13 strokes in the past two rounds. Justin Leonard pulled
himself into second place with a 68, for a combined 205.
	   ``Everything was spot on,'' said the 25-year-old Westwood. He
said he was inspired by the field of 11 other of the sport's top
golfers. ``It's very civilized out there. We've been laughing and
chatting and joking all around,'' he said.
	   Westwood and Leonard played a twosome and had a birdie duel
going. They each saved strokes on holes 2, 6 and 14; Westwood also
birdied on the 1st, 16th and 17th. He just missed birdies on the
9th and 10th when the ball lipped the holes.
	   One of Westwood's socializing partners is Tiger Woods, the main
attraction at the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club
course. Woods was hanging in there with a 207 after Saturday's 67
-- a score which would have been lower without a half-dozen nearly
missed putts.
	   ``I never thought I'd say this, but I'm really disappointed
shooting a 67,'' he said. ``If you look at it today, it could
really have been a 62, even a 61. I just didn't get any breaks.''
	   Maybe his best hole was not one of his five birdies but the 8th
he hit for par. Woods had double bogeys in the previous two rounds
on the 431-meter (471-yard) hole. It bends to the right and runs
uphill to the green, which has sand traps on each side.
	   Woods said his drive was off the first two tries. ``I've hit one
on the left, on the right. I'm lucky to hit one down the middle''
this time, he said.
	   Woods said he felt no pressure from the large crowds -- which
include many blacks rooting for their hero -- following him around
the course.
	   ``Obviously it's very nice people come out to see me,'' he said.
``But I live up to my own expectations, not anybody else's.''
	   Price fell even with Woods following a disastrous third round
72, which included three bogeys and a double-bogey on the par-4 11
when he put a chip shot on the road.
	   Price, the defending champion, two-time winner and owner of the
24-under course record, said he was just trying to stay within a
stroke or two of the leaders.
	   ``I've had some really good times around here. It's about time
something caught up with me,'' he said.
	   Mark O'Meara, this year's two-time major winner, lost his chief
challenger status. He was a shot back of Price going into the
round, but fell to five off the lead with a par round for a 208
total.

Milk cows suffering post-hurricane stress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ It seems even cows can suffer from
on-the-job stress.
	   The production of fresh milk dropped by eight percent in recent
months compared to last year, and the general manager of the Tres
Monjitas dairy blames the stress suffered by cows following
Hurricane Georges, which raked Puerto Rico with 100 mph (162 kph)
winds on Sept. 21 and 22.
	   But manager Juan Corrada said production would still be
sufficient to supply Puerto Rico's needs and he expected by the
middle of December the ``emotional state'' of the cows would have
returned to normal.

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ President Omar Bongo smiles broadly in
his campaign posters, a sometimes-benevolent autocrat reaching out
to the people he has ruled for more than three decades.
	   ``The way of the future,'' thousands of posters proclaim.
	   Bongo, who faces presidential elections Sunday, has plenty of
reasons to smile _ at least for now. With a fractured opposition,
enormous finances and a sprawling patronage system that guarantees
him tens of thousands of votes in this oil-rich Central African
nation, Bongo's re-election is widely expected.
	   The only question for most observers, including many supporters
of his opponents, is whether he'll get the 51 percent needed to win
outright and avoid a second round of voting later in December.
	   ``Bongo will be elected again, we all know that,'' shrugged
Narcisse Abessole, a young photographer attending a recent
opposition political rally.
	   But if Bongo appears set to win Sunday's vote, what comes
afterward may not be so easy.
	   Libreville shook with rioting after Gabon's 1993 elections _ the
first multiparty presidential voting after 26 years of one-party
rule _ when Bongo claimed victory and protesters took to the
streets saying the vote was rigged. Similar accusations are already
being made by Bongo's opponents, though no violence has been
reported.
	   And other problems are also looming.
	   Gabon's oil reserves are feared to be running dry and the price
of oil is plummeting, meaning this petroleum-nourished nation may
have to cope with the crippling of it's greatest money earner.
	   ``With 40 percent of the budget dependent on petrol ... they're
facing something very serious,'' said Toon Visser, the resident
coordinator for United Nations programs in Gabon. While Visser
believes Bongo has the political abilities to weather the economic
storm, other observers aren't so sure.
	   The government is in such increasingly dire straits that it may
not have enough cash to pay January salaries for civil servants,
according to a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   As the situation worsens, Bongo's complex patronage system _
through which he has long helped keep himself in power _ could
completely collapse, the diplomat added.
	   But Bongo insists that he holds the key to stability _ and thus
to prosperity as well.
	   ``We have one chance,'' Bongo said in a televised round table
with Gabonese journalists, ``and we must preserve that chance _ the
stability, the peace.''
	   Bongo's opponents, though, lash out at him for his autocratic
rule, his corruption and the electoral meddling they say is
rampant.
	   ``The government wants to make sure that the candidate Omar
Bongo is elected before the vote count is done,'' said Pierre
Mamboundou, a former postal executive who with Roman Catholic
priest Paul Mba Abessole, is one of Bongo's two main opponents.
	   Mamboundou accused Bongo's regime Saturday of tampering with
voter lists and keeping the National Electoral Commission weak to
ensure the president wins another seven-year term.
	   Diplomats and journalists have also said the election has, at
the very least, faced serious organizational problems, with
questions about the size of the voter lists and the whereabouts of
missing voter cards.
	   The government insists the elections will be free and
transparent.
	   Bongo, who took power after his predecessor's death in 1967 and
kept control with his feared presidential guards, was forced to
relax his rule and allow opposition parties following pro-democracy
protests in 1990. These days, Bongo is openly criticized in the
newspapers and by his opponents.
	   Still, nearly all roads to power in this heavily forested nation
lead to Bongo.
	   ``This government is just one man,'' said Abessole, who faced
the president in the 1993 vote.
	   But Bongo does have a degree of genuine support, rooted in this
country's oil wealth and his skill at building coalitions among
Gabon's ethnic groups.
	   With a population of just 1.2 million, Gabon has an average per
capita income of about dlrs 3,900 a year, a small fortune compared
to many other African nations.
	   Although much of the wealth is at the top of the socio-economic
ladder and poverty remains widespread, many Gabonese have had
expectations that getting ahead is possible.
	   With an oil crunch coming those expectations could soon come to
an end.

Taiwan's Nationalist Party claims win in Taipei mayoral race

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ruling Nationalist Party scored big
Saturday when its candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, ousted Taipei's
opposition mayor in a race that highlighted Taiwan's precarious
relations with China.
	   ``It's not my personal victory, but a victory for all of
Taipei's citizens,'' Ma told cheering supporters.
	   The Nationalists also kept control of the Taiwanese Legislature
while dramatically increasing their popular support.
	   Ma has styled himself as a ``New Taiwanese,'' and said his win
over Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian would help heal old ethnic wounds
between the native Taiwanese majority and those who fled China
after the 1949 civil war.
	   Chen, the leading figure in the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, conceded defeat, calling on supporters to
``respect this decision'' in a democracy barely a decade old.
``Democracy is about people making a decision, whether in choosing
a mayor or deciding the country's future,'' he said.
	   The voting went peacefully, minus the violence and with less of
the vote buying that has marred earlier contests.
	   Ma won with 51 percent of the vote, compared to 46 percent for
Chen, according to results more than 95 percent complete.
	   On the surface, the mayoral race focused on mundane urban issues
such as crime and roadwork.
	   But many Taiwanese viewed the contest as a barometer for
elections 16 months away, when voters will choose a successor to
President Lee Teng-hui. And the delicate issue of mainland
relations was barely below the surface.
	   Chen's DPP party backs formal independence from China, while
Ma's Nationalists support eventual unification.
	   Most Taiwanese prefer the status quo, so both candidates stayed
away from the question during a campaign that degenerated into much
mudslinging. The voters' decision appears to reflect concerns that
a drive for independence could provoke a Chinese military attack.
	   Beijing was closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, despite a half
century of political separation.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, has a squeaky clean image and
youthful good looks and charm that earned him the nickname ``Sonny
Boy Ma.''
	   Chen's supporters were left weeping, or defiant.
	   ``It's very bad,'' said Jean Wong, an accountant. Wong said Ma
was less corrupt than other Nationalist politicians, ``but the
problem will come if the party starts putting pressure on him.''
	   ``This is a setback for our party and for our democratic
movement,'' lamented Lin Yih-hsiung, the DPP chairman. ``We will
learn from this and make a new start.''
	   The economic slump that has started to hit Taiwan, as well as
China's threats, may have put voters in a conservative mood that
brought them back to the ruling party even though many had
abandoned the Nationalists amid widespread worries about
corruption.
	   ``Despite people's complaints against the Nationalists, they
feel they need the party at the time of financial turmoil. They
feel the party is more capable of dealing with China,'' said Lee
Hsi-kun, a professor of political science at National Taiwan
University. ``As long as the Chinese threats remain, we can't
expect voters to entrust the DPP to rule the island.''
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, although
his camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was a
year old.
	   Turnout was heavy among the island's nearly 15 million eligible
voters, with officials estimating 80 percent had cast ballots in
Taipei.
	   Taiwanese directly chose 176 seats for the Legislature, with
another 49 allocated to various parties depending on their levels
of popular support.
	   With results still coming in, Nationalists already had 97 seats,
compared with 40 for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
and 18 for smaller parties.
	   The Nationalists appeared to have substantially improved their
popular support across the island.
	   With most of the legislative votes in, they had won almost 52
percent, compared to their showing of 46 percent in the last such
races three years ago.
	   Many of the gains represented former Nationalist voters
returning from the tiny New Party, which broke away from the
Nationalists to take a stronger stand for unification.
	   The DPP's support held at 32 percent, compared with 33 percent
before.
	   Voters also chose a mayor for the southern city of Kaohsiung _
where the DPP's Frank Hsieh declared victory _ and city councils in
Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Spanish communists change leader at 15th party congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ After nearly 11 years as head of Spain's
communists, Julio Anguita stepped down as general-secretary
Saturday at the opening of the party's 15th Congress.
	   Anguita, 57, a teacher in the southern city of Cordoba who also
leads the United Left coalition, was to be replaced in the next
several days by the party's No. 2, Francisco Frutos.
	   With tears in his eyes, moved by the applause of the party's 700
delegates at Madrid's Palacio de Congresos, Anguita finished his
speech to the Congress saying, ``If you allow me to say, it has
been an honor to be your secretary-general.''
	   Anguita will continue as the leader of United Left, Spain's
third biggest parliamentary group, which won 11 percent of the vote
in the last general elections, in 1996.
	   The Spanish left is dominated by the Socialist party, a
center-left grouping that ruled for nearly 14 years until it was
defeated in the 1996 election by the center-right Popular Party.
	   One of Spain's veteran political leaders, Anguita is considered
controversial for his harsh criticism of the conservative
government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and the monarchy.
	   In the last five years, Anguita has suffered two heart attacks,
one of them in 1993 during an electoral campaign in Barcelona.

Seven Iraqi stowaways found in a container unloaded in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian dockworkers heard knocking inside a
container that had just been unloaded from a ship Saturday.
	   On opening the container, they found seven Iraqi stowaways,
officials in the Mediterranean port of Damietta said.
	   The Iraqis said they had hidden in the container in Beirut,
Lebanon. The ship Corsica brought it to Damietta.
	   Among the stowaways were an aircraft pilot and two doctors, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear how the Iraqis were able to survive in the
container during the trip, which can take three days.
	   Egyptian security officials have begun interrogating the Iraqis.
	   Thousands of Iraqis flee their country each year because of the
financial difficulties resulting from the U.N. trade embargo that
was imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Some Iraqis end up paying large sums of money to operators who
promise to smuggle them into the European Union. In June, a Syrian
ship was towed into a Cypriot port after developing engine trouble.
It was found to be carrying 109 Arabs and Africans who had paid to
be illegally landed in Greece or Italy.

UN committee approves Cambodia's bid for General Assembly seat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Cambodia's new coalition government has
won approval from a key U.N. committee to retake the country's seat
at the U.N. General Assembly, and is expected to return to full
membership soon.
	   The Credentials Committee's decision Friday will end a 15-month
vacancy of Cambodia's seat stemming from strongman Hun Sen's July
1997 ouster of co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a
violent coup.
	   Rival Cambodian diplomats loyal to Hun Sen and Ranariddh
presented competing claims to the committee after the coup. The
panel deferred its decision in September 1997, keeping the seat
vacant.
	   The committee deferred a second time in October, after Ranariddh
and his political allies disputed Hun Sen's narrow victory in a
July election and blocked formation of a new government.
	   Ranariddh bowed to international pressure last month and struck
a coalition deal with Hun Sen. Hun Sen became prime minister and
the prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   Friday's decision must be approved by the General Assembly,
which was to vote in the coming week, U.N. spokesman Manoel De
Alemeida said Saturday. The assembly typically approves the
committee's recommendations, and no objections were expected to be
raised.
	   In Phnom Penh on Saturday, Information Minister Lu Laysreng, a
member of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, welcomed the committee's
move, saying the recognition will help Cambodia's drive to join the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and attract foreign aid
suspended after last year's crisis.
	   ``It's great. A legal government was formed so we deserve our
seat back. We are grateful,'' Lu Laysreng said.
	   Cambodia has been pushing hard to join ASEAN in time for the
regional grouping's Dec. 15-16 summit in Hanoi.
	   Host Vietnam strongly supports Cambodia's bid, but Singapore and
the Philippines have signaled that the troubled nation should prove
that its new government is stable before gaining entry.

Nigerians begin the march to democracy with municipal elections

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Snaking through silent streets, Nigerians
went to the polls Saturday in local government elections seen as a
historic first step from military rule to democracy for Africa's
most populous nation.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing
traffic jams of Nigerian cities, shops were closed and the
government ordered all cars, trucks and even motorcycles off city
streets and country highways to prevent political protests and
traffic jams.
	   Children played soccer in the streets while adults shuffled past
on their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a temporary and joyous halt.
	   Although borders were closed and about 100,000 riot police
patrolled the major cities and rural villages amid fears of
elections violence, the mood was buoyant.
	   At one police station in Lagos, officers released prisoners
awaiting trial so they could vote. It was unclear if the move had
been approved by senior authorities or if the prisoners would be
sought to return behind bars.
	   ``Even detainees are entitled to vote,'' said a police sergeant
on duty who asked to remain anonymous. ``I will also go vote when I
leave duty.''
	   Voters began churning through polling stations, where officials
took peoples' names and gave out special identity cards. The actual
casting of ballots did not begin until shortly before noon. Vote
counting began in some municipalities soon afterwards.
	   Elections organizers said the turnout was high. More than 50
million people are registered to vote for some 8,800 municipal
government posts. Nine parties have registered and three have
fielded candidates nationwide.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians in May after
presidential elections on February 15. Abubakar took power after
the unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June.
	   ``From what we have seen so far, the turnout is commendable,''
Abubakar said after voting in the capital, Abuja. ``The government
has done its part and it is now up to Nigerians and the politicians
to play their own.''
	   Saturday's poll is a test run. The national electoral commission
is inexperienced and the political parties have vague platforms and
are relatively unknown.
	   Abubakar has promised that the military will not intervene in
the transition.
	   Nigeria, a country of more than 100 million people which has
failed to tackle grinding poverty despite fabulous oil wealth that
has made it the world's 6th largest producer, has a history of
armed coups and military meddling in politics. The country has been
ruled by civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar has warned that parties which campaign on divisive
ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria.
	   After official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation quickly filled radio and television
airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring election
promises on loudspeakers.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Although it was too early to say whether the elections would be
judged free and fair by foreign observers, only scattered
logistical problems were reported by officials early Saturday _ a
few people's names were missing from voters' lists in Abuja and
Lagos and polling began late in some stations.
	   The first results were not expected before Sunday.
	   About 10 women fell into a sewage drain filled with human waste
that collapsed beneath a line of voters in the village of Ijegun on
the outskirts of Lagos, the News Agency of Nigeria reported, saying
all were saved.
	   Some voters said they did not know who the candidates in their
constituencies were and said they were voting for whoever
represented their favorite party.
	   Others chose individuals who took a strong anti-military stance
during the unpopular rule of Abacha, who summarily detained,
tortured and occasionally killed his opponents.
	   ``I voted for the Alliance for Democracy,'' said Lanre Komolafe,
an engineer in Lagos. ``Their members fought Abacha under very
difficult circumstances.''
	   Femi Olayemi, a civil servant in Lagos, said he was voting for
his children's future.
	   ``If we do not vote, we will not have any reason to tell the
military that they should leave power,'' he said.

Minister sacked for ordering children to sing Hindu hymn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A minister in India's most populous
state who ordered that students at state-run schools start the day
with a Hindu hymn and a salute to the motherland has been sacked,
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Primary Education Minister Ravindra Kumar Shukla, who had issued
the controversial order in October in Uttar Pradesh state, was
sacked by Chief Minister Kalyan Singh for his ``irresponsible
behavior in promulgating the ... scheme without getting due
approval of the cabinet and keeping the cabinet in the dark about
the details of the scheme,'' The Pioneer newspaper reported.
	   The state government had last week canceled the orders, saying
they were improperly issued.
	   Muslim leaders had advised parents to withdraw their children
from state schools rather than let them be forced to sing a hymn to
Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning.
	   They also objected that singing Vande Mataram _ ``Hail to the
Motherland'' _ a traditional song popularized during India's
independence movement _ amounted to worshipping India, when Muslims
worshipped only Allah.
	   Shukla had said Muslim students had the option to remain silent
during the singing, but that did not quell protests.
	   Shukla's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, in power in
Uttar Pradesh as well as at the federal level, has been accused of
fanning religious tension in India. The country is 80 percent Hindu
and 12 percent Muslim.

Funaki flops, giving Schmitt third win in three World Cups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHAMONIX, France (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmitt benefitted from
double Olympic champion Kazuyoshi Funaki's blunder in the second
round of a ski jumping World Cup Saturday to collect his third win
in as many events this season.
	   Funaki, gold medallist in the K120 and team competition at the
Nagano Olympics, began the competition with a stunning 106.5 meter
jump, breaking the three-year old 95-meter hill record by a meter
and carrying a substantial 11.5 point lead over Schmitt into the
second leg.
	   But the Japanese skier stupified the spectators gathered at the
foot of the snow-capped Mont Blanc, reaching a mere 88 meters on
his second effort, and dropping to third place with 239 points.
	   Schmitt, who jumped 101.5 and 94 meters for a total of 242.5
points, added the victory to a pair of K120 wins in Norway last
week.
	   Reigning world champion Janne Ahonen of Finland finished
runnerup for the third time in three competitions, with jumps of
100.5 and 92 meters and a total of 240 points.
	   It was an identical podium to the one at K120 event in
Lillehammer last Sunday.
	   World junior champion Wolfgang Loitzl of Austria finished fourth
with 224.5 points, jumping a consistent 95 and 90.5 meters.
	   Switzerland's Bruno Reuteler and bleached-blond Noriaki Kasai of
Japan tied for fifth with 221.5 points.
	   Austria's Andreas Goldberger was seventh, jumping 95.5 and 88
for a total of 220 points.
	   Schmitt leads the overall standings with 300 points, ahead of
Ahonen with 240 points. Funaki sits third with 170, followed by
Hannawald, fourth with 114.

Fiorentina defeats Bologna, stays atop Serie A standings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after Sampdoria-Parma night match &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's 16th season goal gave
Fiorentina a hard-fought 1-0 victory against Bologna Saturday and
kept the Florentine team atop the Serie A standings three points
ahead of runnerup Roma which trounced Perugia 5-1.
	   Batistuta, the leading league scorer, tallied the game winner in
the 56th minute with a powerful free kick which sent the ball
through the wall and into Bologna's net.
	   At Rome's Olympic stadium, Roma rallied from a 0-1 deficit on a
second-half spree by its young star-forwards Francesco Totti,
Daniele Conti, Marco Delvecchio and Carmine Gautieri.
	   Batustuta, who has scored 12 goals in league matches and four in
the Cups this season, extended Fiorentina's winning home streak to
six games.
	   However victory of the League leader did not come without risks
as Bologna produced at least three clear scoring chances with
strikers Kennet Andersson and Beppe Signori. Their scoring attempts
were bravely saved by Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo.
	   When Toldo could not reach the ball, it was the post to stop a
shot by Bologna's midfielder Joanathan Binotto, in the 51st minute.
	   With a record of 8-1-3 Fiorentina, coached by Giovanni
Trapattoni and fielding such stars as Batistuta, Edmundo, Rui Costa
and Luis Oliveira, piled up a commanding lead of 25 points.
	   Roma vaulted to 22 points on its sixth home victory at the
Olympic stadium for an overall record of 6-4-2.
	   The yellow-and-red home team, coming from a 3-3 draw with
crosstown rival Lazio in the previous league match, wasted three
scoring chances in the first 30 minutes of play and was punished on
the first counter-attack by Perugia, in the 32nd.
	   Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti fumbled the ball on a powerful
drive by Croat forward Milan Rapajic who gave the visitors a 1-0
lead.
	   Perugia's Japanese striker Hidetoshi Nakata, who scored two
spectacular goals in the previous round against Piacenza, wasted
the opportunity to make it two by the end of the first half.
	   This was the end of Perugia's offensive as the visiting team had
to play the entire second half one player down following the
expulsion of its captain-defender Salvatore Matrecano, who had
overreacted on Brazilian Paulo Sergio.
	   Totti, the young talented captain of the Roman team,tallied the
equalizer with a long-distance shot in the 61st.
	   Another young forward Conti, put Roma in front two minutes
later.
	   Conti headed in his first Serie A goal on a perfect cross by
Russian teammate Dmitri Alenichev.
	   The forward, the son of former Roma's star Bruno Conti, received
a special applause by Roman fans but his joy was short lived as he
was sent off the field four minutes later for rough play.
	   With both teams down to 10 players, Roma kept pressing on the
attack and its agile forward Del Vecchio scored twice in two
minutes (77th and 79th) with precise headers to make it 4-1.
	   Gautieri's goal came in second half injury time, to make Roma
the highest scoring Serie A team with 25 goals in 12 rounds.
	   Batistuta's goal improved Fiorentina's total to 23.
	   Batistuta and Edmundo carried out some impressive offensive
combinations against Bologna, but the Brazilian striker was
inaccurate close to the net.
	   The match between defending league champion Juventus and Lazio
of Rome was the big match among the six scheduled on Sunday.

Yemeni parliament approves budget with dlrs 411 million deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's parliament approved the 1999 budget
on Saturday with a deficit of 41.18 billion riyals (dlrs 411
million), nearly three times that of the current year, officials
said.
	   The budget projects total expenditure of 335.59 billion riyals
(dlrs 3.35 billion) and revenue of 294.41 billion riyals (2.94
billion).
	   Officials said 154 legislators voted for the budget, nine
abstained and two opposed. The remaining 136 deputies were absent.
	   An official of an opposition party, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, accused the ruling General People's Congress Party of
delivering a fait accompli because it enjoys a comfortable majority
in the parliament.
	   Yemen's fiscal year begins Jan. 1. The 1998 budget projected a
deficit of 14 billion riyals (dlrs 140 million).
	   The government said last month the budget would feature
increased allocations for health and educational services.
	   Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. Its
government is implementing a sweeping liberalization program under
the supervision of the International Monetary Fund.

FEMA worker in San Juan tests positive for Legionnaire's Disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Federal Emergency Management
Agency worker helping with the recovery from Hurricane Georges
contracted Legionnaires' disease and the bacteria was found in the
agency's San Juan center, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Officials with the federal Centers for Disease Control told the
San Juan Star that tests of 38 other FEMA workers who had displayed
flu-like symptoms did not find evidence of the bacteria. But CDC
press spokeswoman Kathy Hoskins said workers could still develop
the disease, which sometimes takes several days to appear, and
should be tested if they have symptoms.
	   About 600 FEMA employees work at the San Juan office, said Joe
Stocks, FEMA public relations director. The agency established
temporary offices around the island after Hurricane Georges
destroyed thousands of homes on Sept. 21 and 22.
	   The strain of bacteria which causes the disease was found in two
of the building's air conditioning ducts, which are now being
disinfected, officials said.
	   Stocks said the FEMA employee who was infected is in stable
condition. He refused to identify the employee except to say he was
from California.
	   ``It's hard to determine where this worker got the disease,''
CDC Dr. Richard Besser told the newspaper. ``If so far nobody else
was infected, the building should be pretty safe.''
	   Legionnaires' is a respiratory disease caused by a bacterium
that grows in water and is often found in air conditioning ducts,
storage tanks and rivers. It takes its name from an outbreak at the
Pennsylvania American Legion convention in Philadelphia in July,
1976, where 34 people died.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Crestfallen but defiant, supporters of
defeated Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian stood by their man as the cold
reality sank in Saturday night.
	   As the gap widened between Chen's votes and those of winner Ma
Ying-jeou, the shouts became even louder.
	   ``Chen Shui-bian for president,'' they chanted.
	   ``I'm devastated. I never really thought he could lose,'' said
Pan Chi-yang, standing amid the shocked crowd outside Chen's
campaign headquarters in downtown Taipei.
	   ``The Nationalists bought this election, but they'll never keep
Chen down,'' said Pan, a sales supervisor at an engineering
company.
	   Pan and several friends had come with other Chen supporters in
hopes of celebrating victory, bringing their banners and assorted
election mementos to a grassy traffic circle in front of the
headquarters.
	   Instead, they got heartbreak. They attributed his loss to the
huge amounts that Taiwan's ruling Nationalists allegedly spent on
Ma's campaign.
	   Even Ma, a former justice minister running on a squeaky clean
image, freely admitted to exceeding spending limits.
	   Teary campaign staffers bowed deeply to the crowd as Chen
descended from his office to make his concession speech.
	   ``It's a crying shame,'' said George Yang, a sales director at a
trading company who had volunteered for Chen. ``He took the city to
a new level, and now we have to turn it over to someone who has no
idea what they're doing.''
	   Pan and others said they still see a bright future for the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party's best known politician _
perhaps in the next presidential election, in 16 months.
	   As they see it, Chen's support outside Taipei exceeds that
inside the capital, with its large population of
Nationalist-supporting immigrants from mainland China.
	   Outside Ma's headquarters, the crowd was smaller, but the sense
of elation was enormous.
	   ``I'm thrilled,'' said Martha Wu, who manages a parking lot
business.
	   ``Chen was a little dictator. Ma is talented and he's got the
right image for the people of Taipei,'' she said.
	   Bottle rockets shot into the sky as Ma's win became apparent. A
cheery theme song, ``Our friend Ma Ying-jeou,'' repeated endlessly
over the loudspeakers as the crowd spilled into the road, waving
banners and thumbs-up signs to passing motorists.
	   Lee Chien-kuo was at least willing to give Chen a little credit,
but said the mayor's outspoken style and stubborn drive may have
done him in.
	   ``Chen was a doer, but he gave voters the impression of being
too much of an autocrat. But he has raised expectations about what
a mayor can do, and we'll be expecting a lot from Ma.''

 &UR; Unruly passenger dies aboard Hungarian airliner after injection
with tranquilizer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An unruly passenger died aboard a Malev
Hungarian airliner on Saturday after being strapped to his seat and
injected with tranquilizers.
	   The passenger, identified by Turkey's Anatolia news agency as
Finnish national Mikaeinar Peterson, was dead by the time the jet
made an emergency landing in Istanbul. His hometown was not
available.
	   Anatolia and Hungary's MTI news agency said the man started
harassing others aboard a flight from Bangkok to Budapest. He
allegedly punched a pilot and tried to choke an attendant.
	   The crew and passengers tied him to his seat and a doctor aboard
gave him an injection.
	   An autopsy done later in the day showed he died because of the
mixture of the tranquilizer and some other drug or alcohol.
Witnesses saw the man take a pill before he became violent and
authorities suspected he was drunk, Anatolia said.
	   The crew and the doctor are being interrogated at the airport. A
new crew from Hungary was expected to fly the jet to Budapest with
189 other passengers later Saturday.

England wins 13-7 to end Springboks' record bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TWICKENHAM, England (AP) _ The South African world champions
failed in a bid to complete a world record 18 wins in a row when
they lost 13-7 to England at Twickenham Saturday.
	   The Springboks squandered an early 7-0 lead with Pieter
Roussow's try as England produced its best performance for a year
by replying with a Jeremy Guscott try and two penalties and a
conversion by Matt Dawson.
	   The Springboks, who had beaten Wales, Scotland and Ireland on
their European tour, were outplayed in the pack and were unable to
get past the English defense despite a long period of pressure
early in the second half.
	   Instead they tie New Zealand's mark of 17 wins in a row set
between 1965-69

U.S. health secretary inspects projects, visits Lebanon roots

<TEXT>
	   ZGHORTA, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala, a Lebanese-American on her second visit to
Lebanon in 25 years, said Saturday she was impressed by the changes
in the country of her forefathers.
	   ``For anyone in the world who believes Arabs cannot organize,
let them come to Lebanon,'' Shalala told reporters in this mountain
town in the country's northern province.
	   Shalala, who arrived Friday evening in Lebanon, was accompanied
by her 91-year-old Lebanese-born mother Edna.
	   The secretary said she will work on encouraging U.S. investment
in the country.
	   ``I come from a very large Lebanese family and they pressure me
every day to do more for Lebanon,'' she joked.
	   Shalala said she will report back ``positively'' to U.S.
President Bill Clinton on the situation in this Arab country in the
eastern Mediterranean.
	   ``I will be able to tell the president and the people of the
United States that their investments are improving the economy of
Lebanon,'' she added.
	   The dlrs 47 million U.S. assistance to Lebanon, in the form of
grants and soft loans in recent years, has focused on the
agricultural sector.
	   The American assistance, while welcomed by Lebanon's government,
has come under fire from anti-Israeli Islamic groups who complain
the money is little compared to the dlrs 3 billion Israel receives
annually from the United States.
	   In Zghorta, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northeast of Beirut,
Shalala inspected the Agricultural Center of the North, a private
undertaking for agricultural development which has received about
dlrs 130,000 in U.S. aid.
	   Accompanied by an escort of several bullet-proof vehicles _ the
normal security for U.S. officials in Lebanon _ Shalala earlier
visited a school and a farm in the impoverished region of Akkar in
the country's remote northeast.
	   Shalala's trip also included a stop at her grandfather's
village, Beit Shalala, about halfway between Beirut and Zghorta.
Journalists were not allowed to go on the part of the trip, with
officials saying it was private.
	   Shalala's grandparents emigrated to America around the turn of
the century. She came only once in 1973 to visit relatives.
	   ``I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to ... return
100 years after my grandfathers left Lebanon ... and to see the
rebuilding of Lebanon,'' she said on this trip.
	   Shalala came to Lebanon aboard a U.S. military helicopter that
flew from the neighboring island of Cyprus to the fortified embassy
compound in the hilltop Beirut suburb of Aukar.
	   Beirut airport remains off-limits to American officials. But a
ban on travel to Lebanon _ declared during a series of kidnapings
in the 1980s _ was replaced last year with an advisory warning that
Lebanon remains dangerous.

	   Roussow's try, his 18th in 23 tests, came after nine minutes.
	   A long pass by back row Bobby Skinstad found the winger in
plenty of space. Roussow ran at England's Nick Beal and swerved
around the fullback before racing 25 meters for the line.
	   He crossed in the corner, giving Percy Montgomery a difficult
kick from wide on the left but the left-footed kicked sent the ball
over for the conversion and South Africa lead 7-0.
	   After a spell of strong English pressure in which the Springboks
conceded three penalties close to their pown posts, Mike Catt
kicked high to the corner. Winger Dan Luger caught the ball under
pressure from Stefan Terblanche and fed it to the supporting
Guscott who ran over for the score.
	   Dawson kicked the conversion and the score was level after 12
minutes.
	   With their rampant forwards overpowering the Springbok pack, the
English ignored two chances to take the lead with two close range
penalties and opted for setting up try-scoring opportunities.
	   But the South Africans, regarded as the finest defensive team in
the world, kept them out and had the chance to regain the lead deep
into first half injury time only for Montgomery to kick his penalty
wide.
	   The South Africans looked far more like a world champion team
early in the second half with forwards and backs linking up well to
stretch the English defense in front of the posts.
	   Skinstad, center Andre Snyman, winger Terblanche and hooker
James Dalton were all halted by solid English tackles before the
home team finally got out their own quarter of the field.
	   When the South Africans were penalized at a maul, England at
last decided to kick for goal from 26 meters. But scrum half
Dawson, chosen instead of Catt to take the kicks, pulled the simple
penalty attempt wide to the groans of the home fans.
	   There was a blow to the Springboks 20 minutes from the end when
scrum half Joost van der Westhuizen, making his 50th international
appearance, was helped off with a leg injury. England meanwhile
were forced during the match to make three changes in the backs,
losing two wingers, Tony Underwood and David Rees and center Phil
de Glanville with Catt moving from fly half to center.
	   When Skinstad was penalized 30 meters from his own posts, Dawson
had another chance to put England ahead and this time he got it
right and the home team led 10-7 with 16 minutes to go.
	   And the Northampton scrum half came up with a brilliant follow
up kick from 40 meters five minutes later to stretch the lead to
six points.
	   The two scores brough a big response from the Springboks but
Montgomery amazingly missed a close range penalty from in front of
the posts with seven minutes to go and South Africa still needed a
converted try to win the match.
	   They almost got it in the third minute of injury time when
England was penalized in a maul close to the South African line.
	   Johan Erasmus' quick tap penalty set up a charge down the field
which ended when Snyman dropped the ball within 30 meters of the
England line with the home defense struggling to get back.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ Nick Beal; Tony Underwood, Phil de Glanville, Jeremy
Guscott, Dan Luger; Mike Catt, Matt Dawson; Jason Leonard, Richard
Cockerill, Darren Garforth, Martin Johnson, Tim Rodber, Lawrence
Dallaglio (captain), Neil Black, Richard Hill.
	   South Africa _ Percy Montgomery; Stefan Terblanche, Andre
Snyman, Christian Stewart, Pieter Roussow; Henry Honiball, Joost
van der Westhuizen; Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robbie Kempson,
Mark Andrews, Krynauw Otto, Johan Erasmus, Bobby Skinstad, Gary
Teichmann (captain).
	   Referee _ Paddy O'Brien, New Zealand.

Old mines found at construction site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAVALA, Greece (AP) _ The army sealed off a construction site
outside this northern town Saturday after builders discovered seven
old land mines during work to lay foundations. No one was hurt.
	   Army bomb experts said the mines dated from the 1940s. Six were
German-made and one was American.
	   Farmers and fishermen often find mines laid during World War Two
or the 1946-49 Greek civil war. On Monday a fisherman from the
western island of Lefkada discovered a mine, with 200 kilograms
(440 pounds) of explosives, in his fishing nets. It was disarmed by
navy commandos.

Fiorentina defeats Bologna, stays atop Serie A standings

 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED after Sampdoria-Parma night match &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's 16th season goal gave
Fiorentina a hard-fought 1-0 victory against Bologna on Saturday
and kept the Florentine team atop Italian soccer's Serie A
standings, three points ahead of runner-up Roma, which trounced
Perugia 5-1.
	   Batistuta, the leading league scorer, tallied the game winner in
the 56th minute with a powerful free kick which sent the ball
through the wall and into Bologna's net.
	   At Rome's Olympic stadium, Roma rallied from a 0-1 deficit on a
second-half spree by its young star-forwards Francesco Totti,
Daniele Conti, Marco Delvecchio and Carmine Gautieri.
	   Batustuta, who has scored 12 goals in league matches and four in
the Cups this season, extended Fiorentina's winning home streak to
six games.
	   However victory of the League leader did not come without risks
as Bologna produced at least three clear scoring chances with
strikers Kennet Andersson and Beppe Signori. Their scoring attempts
were bravely saved by Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo.
	   When Toldo could not reach the ball, it was the post to stop a
shot by Bologna's midfielder Joanathan Binotto, in the 51st minute.
	   With a record of 8-1-3 Fiorentina, coached by Giovanni
Trapattoni and fielding such stars as Batistuta, Edmundo, Rui Costa
and Luis Oliveira, piled up a commanding lead of 25 points.
	   Roma vaulted to 22 points on its sixth home victory at the
Olympic stadium for an overall record of 6-4-2.
	   The yellow-and-red home team, coming from a 3-3 draw with
crosstown rival Lazio in the previous league match, wasted three
scoring chances in the first 30 minutes of play and was punished on
the first counter-attack by Perugia, in the 32nd.
	   Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti fumbled the ball on a powerful
drive by Croat forward Milan Rapajic who gave the visitors a 1-0
lead.
	   Perugia's Japanese striker Hidetoshi Nakata, who scored two
spectacular goals in the previous round against Piacenza, wasted
the opportunity to make it two by the end of the first half.
	   This was the end of Perugia's offensive as the visiting team had
to play the entire second half one player down following the
expulsion of its captain-defender Salvatore Matrecano, who had
overreacted on Brazilian Paulo Sergio.
	   Totti, the young talented captain of the Roman team,tallied the
equalizer with a long-distance shot in the 61st.
	   Another young forward Conti, put Roma in front two minutes
later.
	   Conti headed in his first Serie A goal on a perfect cross by
Russian teammate Dmitri Alenichev.
	   The forward, the son of former Roma's star Bruno Conti, received
a special applause by Roman fans but his joy was short lived as he
was sent off the field four minutes later for rough play.
	   With both teams down to 10 players, Roma kept pressing on the
attack and its agile forward Del Vecchio scored twice in two
minutes (77th and 79th) with precise headers to make it 4-1.
	   Gautieri's goal came in second half injury time, to make Roma
the highest scoring Serie A team with 25 goals in 12 rounds.
	   Batistuta's goal improved Fiorentina's total to 23.
	   Batistuta and Edmundo carried out some impressive offensive
combinations against Bologna, but the Brazilian striker was
inaccurate close to the net.
	   The match between defending league champion Juventus and Lazio
of Rome was the big match among the six scheduled on Sunday.

	   Sweden has now captured the Davis Cup seven times, including a

finals appearances.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti kept their two-year Davis Cup winning streak
alive with little trouble, needing just 1 hour, 47 minutes for the
straight-set win.
	   An eventual Swedish triumph seemed certain after Friday's
opening match, when Italy's No. 1 player, Andrea Gaudenzi, dropped
out with a strained shoulder tendon.

duo, which at one junctured lost 41 of 53 points.
	   Gaudenzi had came close to a miracle victory before surrendering
to pain and exhaustion and retiring at 6-6 in the fifth set of a
five-hour marathon against Magnus Norman.
	   A seemingly distracted Sanguinetti then went out and failed to
put up a fight, losing in straight sets to Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson.
	   With Gaudenzi, who's undergo an MRI exam Monday, ruled out for
the rest of the competition, Sanguinetti was forced to take his
place as Nargiso's partner.

Taiwan's Nationalist Party claims win in Taipei mayoral race

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party scored
big Saturday when its candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, ousted Taipei's
mayor, the opposition's biggest politician, in a race that
highlighted Taiwan's precarious relations with China.
	   ``It's not my personal victory, but a victory for all of
Taipei's citizens,'' Ma told cheering supporters.
	   The Nationalists kept control of the Taiwanese Legislature,
where they will hold 55 percent of the seats, according to results
early Sunday, compared with the 52 percent edge they took last
time.
	   Ma has styled himself as a ``New Taiwanese,'' and said his win
over Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian would help heal old ethnic wounds
between the native Taiwanese majority and those who fled China
after the 1949 civil war.
	   Chen, the leading figure in the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, conceded defeat but called on supporters to
``respect this decision'' in a democracy barely a decade old.
``Democracy is about people making a decision, whether in choosing
a mayor or deciding the country's future,'' he said.
	   The voting was peaceful, minus the violence and with less of the
vote buying that marred earlier contests.
	   Ma won with 51 percent of the vote, compared to 46 percent for
Chen, according to final results available early Sunday.
	   On the surface, the mayoral race focused on mundane urban issues
such as crime and roadwork.
	   But many Taiwanese viewed the contest as a barometer for
elections 16 months away, when voters will choose a successor to
President Lee Teng-hui. And the delicate issue of mainland
relations was barely below the surface.
	   Chen's DPP party backs formal independence from China, while
Ma's Nationalists support eventual unification.
	   Most Taiwanese prefer the status quo, so both candidates stayed
away from the issue during a campaign that degenerated into much
mudslinging. The voters' decision appears to reflect concerns that
a drive for independence could provoke a Chinese military attack.
	   Beijing was closely watching the outcome. The Chinese government
claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, despite a half
century of political separation.
	   Ma, a former justice minister, has a squeaky clean image and
youthful good looks and charm that earned him the nickname ``Sonny
Boy Ma.''
	   Chen's supporters were left weeping, or defiant.
	   ``It's very bad,'' said Jean Wong, an accountant. Wong said Ma
was less corrupt than other Nationalist politicians, ``but the
problem will come if the party starts putting pressure on him.''
	   ``This is a setback for our party and for our democratic
movement,'' lamented Lin Yih-hsiung, the DPP chairman. ``We will
learn from this and make a new start.''
	   The economic slump that has started to hit Taiwan, as well as
China's threats, may have put voters in a conservative mood that
brought them back to the ruling party many had abandoned amid
widespread worries about corruption.
	   ``Despite people's complaints against the Nationalists, they
feel they need the party at the time of financial turmoil. They
feel the party is more capable of dealing with China,'' said Lee
Hsi-kun, a professor of political science at National Taiwan
University. ``As long as the Chinese threats remain, we can't
expect voters to entrust the DPP to rule the island.''
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, although
his camp raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was a
year old.
	   Turnout was heavy among the island's nearly 15 million eligible
voters, with officials estimating 80 percent cast ballots in
Taipei.
	   Taiwanese directly chose 176 seats for the Legislature, with
another 49 to be allocated to various parties depending on their
levels of popular support.
	   The Nationalists will end up with 123 seats, while the DPP will
have 70, with smaller parties taking the rest, according to results
early Sunday.
	   Voters also chose a mayor for the southern city of Kaohsiung _
where the DPP's Frank Hsieh declared victory _ and city councils in
Taipei and Kaohsiung.

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The first Palestinian commercial
flight to Amman took off Saturday, inaugurating an air route
between Jordan and the newly opened airport at the autonomous Gaza
Strip.
	   The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, mostly
Palestinian businessmen and students and returned to Gaza
International Airport later in the day with a full plane load of
travelers.
	   Both the takeoff and the landing of the return flight were
delayed due to Israeli security demands. Although the airport is
operated by the Palestinian Authority, security is jointly handled
with the Israelis.
	   The Palestinians consider the airport, which opened last week,
as their first gateway to the world, a strong symbol of fledgling
independence. The airport opened after more than two years of
disputes between Israel and the Palestinians over security
arrangements.
	   Adel Imad Abu Ali, 29, a Palestinian student studying for his
MBA at Amman University said security delays would not dissuade him
from flying on the Palestinian airline.
	   ``When you pay even one penny to the Palestinian airline it
means that you are participating in building your state and you are
guaranteeing a future for yourself and your children,'' Abu Ali
said as he boarded the flight to Amman.
	   Landing at the Gaza International Airport was a dream come true
for Nassar Arriadui, 45, a Palestinian-born businessman who lives
in Jordan.
	   ``When I saw the airport tower as we landed I thought that I was
dreaming,'' Arriadui said.
	   Jasser Ziyyad, director-general of the Jordanian Civil Aviation
Authority, said Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the
week on four weekly flights between them _ two by the Palestinian
airline and two for Jordan.
	   Meanwhile, Jordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian
aviation officials as saying one more passenger plane will be added
to the Palestinian fleet of three short-haul aircraft.
	   It said the addition was necessary to transport an estimated
3,600 Palestinian Muslims who wish to travel to Saudi Arabia in
early March to perform the annual pilgrimage to holy shrines in
that country.

Supreme court verdict goes against divorced women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A divorced Muslim wife is not entitled
to alimony from her former husband till her remarriage or death,
the Bangladeshi Supreme Court has ruled, striking down a lower
court verdict.
	   The full bench of the Supreme Court sought the help of two
eminent religious leaders to interpret the Koran, the Islamic holy
book, before pronouncing the verdict Friday. It restored a law that
requires husbands to pay alimony only till three months after the
divorce.
	   The ruling came on the appeal of a man against a High Court
ruling that his former wife was entitled to maintenance till her
marriage or death.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden clinched its second consecutive Davis
Cup title Saturday when Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti beat
Italy's doubles pair of Diego Nargiso and fill-in Davide
Sanguinetti in straight sets.
	   The 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, 6-3 victory added to wins in both of
Friday's singles matches to give Sweden an insurmountable 3-0 lead
over Italy in the best-of-5 series.
	   Sweden has now captured the Davis Cup seven times, including a
record six since the World Group format was established in 1981.
Italy's lone title came in 1976, and it has lost in six other
finals appearances.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti kept their two-year Davis Cup winning streak
alive with little trouble, needing just 1 hour, 47
	   minutes for the straight-set win.
	   ``They were just too strong,'' Nargiso said.
	   An eventual Swedish triumph seemed certain after Friday's
opening match, when Italy's No. 1 player, Andrea Gaudenzi, dropped
out with a strained shoulder tendon.
	   Even the normally vociferous partisan crowd seemed resigned.
They occasionally jeered and whistled derisively at the Italian
duo, which at one juncture lost 41 of 53 points.
	   On Friday, Gaudenzi had came close to a miracle victory before
surrendering to pain and exhaustion and retiring at 6-6 in the
fifth set of a five-hour marathon against Magnus Norman.
	   A seemingly distracted Sanguinetti then went out and failed to
put up a fight, losing in straight sets to Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson.
	   With Gaudenzi, who's undergo an MRI exam Monday, ruled out for
the rest of the competition, Sanguinetti was forced to take his
place as Nargiso's partner.
	   ``Unfortunately Andrea's injury did not allow us to really fight
to the end for the title,'' Italy's non-playing captain Paolo
Bertolucci said. ``Alas, with it already 2-0 before the doubles,
there was basically no chance for us.''
	   Nargiso and Sanguinetti were rarely in sync, including on one
point with Sweden ahead 4-1 in the second set.
	   With the score 40-30 on Italy's serve, Sanguinetti and Nargiso
nearly collided under a floating lob and Sanguinetti swung and
missed. A Sanguinetti error and a well-placed Bjorkman lob, with
the Italians rooted at the net, gave Sweden a break and a 5-1 lead.
	   Gaudenzi's retirement raised the question of whether Bertolucci
erred in deciding to go with a player who had shoulder surgery in
October. Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy beat
the United States in the cup semifinals in September.
	   Norman officially downed Gaudenzi by the score of 6-7 (9-11),
7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0) in an error-strewn match.
Gustafsson overpowered Sanguinetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-0.
	   With the outcome decided, Sunday's reverse singles matches will
be shortened to best-of-3 sets.

Iran calls for oil cooperation with Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Iran has proposed cooperation with
Saudi Arabia to shore up the plummeting world prices for oil,
Iranian diplomats said here Saturday.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami sent a message to Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah, the official Saudi Press Agency has reported,
without disclosing its contents.
	   Iranian diplomats said the message dealt with ``world oil market
conditions and coordination of efforts between the two countries to
strengthen prices.''
	   The message, delivered by Iranian ambassador Mohammad Reza
Nouri, also said Iran did not hold Saudi Arabia responsible for the
fall in oil prices, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Last week, Iran's hard-line newspaper Jomhuri Islami accused
Saudi Arabia of ``treachery'' toward the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries or OPEC, the cartel to which both Iran and
Saudi Arabia belong.
	   The newspaper said the Saudis were to blame for the current
crisis on the oil markets.
	   Nouri told Abdullah that the paper did not reflect the Iranian
government's view, the diplomats said.
	   Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two largest producers in OPEC, have
been hard hit by falling oil revenues. Last Tuesday the benchmark
Brent futures fell to dlrs 10.42 a barrel _ a 12-year low.
	   Iran and Saudi Arabia have traditionally been rivals in OPEC,
but their relations have been improving, particularly since
Abdullah went to Tehran last year to attend an Islamic summit.
	   Saudi Arabia, the richest country in the Arab world, is
grappling with a budget deficit expected to reach dlrs 15 billion
this year.
	   Iran is trying to reschedule some dlrs 6 billion in foreign
debts. The Iranian Oil Ministry says that a one dollar fall in the
oil price results in an annual loss of dlrs 1 billion in revenue
for the government.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Crestfallen but defiant, supporters of
defeated Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian stood by their man as the cold
reality sank in Saturday night.
	   As the gap widened between Chen's votes and those of winner Ma
Ying-jeou, the shouts became even louder.
	   ``Chen Shui-bian for president,'' they chanted.
	   ``I'm devastated. I never really thought he could lose,'' said
Pan Chi-yang, standing amid the shocked crowd outside Chen's
campaign headquarters in downtown Taipei.
	   ``The Nationalists bought this election, but they'll never keep
Chen down,'' said Pan, a sales supervisor at an engineering
company.
	   Pan and several friends had come with other Chen supporters in
hopes of celebrating victory, bringing their banners and assorted
election mementos to a grassy traffic circle in front of the
headquarters.
	   Instead, they got heartbreak. They attributed his loss to the
huge amounts that Taiwan's ruling Nationalists allegedly spent on
Ma's campaign.
	   Even Ma, a former justice minister running on a squeaky clean
image, freely admitted to exceeding spending limits.
	   Chen was popular for policies boosting government efficiency,
cracking down on the illegal sex trade and imposing a curfew on
minors. But he had an abrasive style developed through years as a
member of the democracy movement under martial law and later as an
opposition politician.
	   Ma has promised to continue some of Chen's policies, but he
hopes to put a friendlier face on local government.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled
to Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   But Libya's official news agency, JANA, said during his one-day
trip the U.N. official ``may not be able to meet'' meet Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, adding that Gadhafi ``is now in the desert
outside the region.''
	   The JANA report said that Annan met with the Libyan foreign
minister, Omar al-Muntasser, in the northern coastal town of Sirte.
It gave no other information on why an expected Annan-Gadhafi might
not take place.
	   Earlier, the Libyan media suggested Gadhafi had no authority to
hand over the suspects. Such a report indicated that Gadhafi was
giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides
against giving up the suspects.
	   JANA said Gadhafi is neither the prime minister nor the
president of the country. It suggested that a decision on handing
over the suspects would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots
national committees before being decided by the Parliament.
	   Libya gave little information on Annan's visit. Libyan officials
reported earlier that he arrived in the country and then flew to
Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli.
Most reporters were barred from going to Sirte and ordered to stay
in Tripoli.
	   But ordinary Libyans were aware of the developments, and many
said they opposed handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' said Ahmed Abdel-Salam, a fisherman in Tripoli.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the two men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we
have law,'' he said.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from the Tunisian
resort island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee to make the flight.

Sweden clinches second straight Davis Cup

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sanguinetti's wallet and phone stolen. Edits. AMs

 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden clinched its second consecutive Davis
Cup title Saturday when Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti beat
Italy's doubles pair of Diego Nargiso and fill-in Davide
Sanguinetti in straight sets.
	   The 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, 6-3 victory added to wins in both of
Friday's singles matches to give Sweden an insurmountable 3-0 lead
over Italy in the best-of-5 series.
	   Sweden has now captured the Davis Cup seven times, including a
record six since the World Group format was established in 1981.
Italy's lone title came in 1976, and it has lost in six other
finals appearances.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti kept their own two-year Davis Cup winning
streak alive with little trouble, needing just 1 hour, 47 minutes
to overpower the Italians.
	   ``They were just too strong,'' Nargiso said.
	   Even the normally vociferous partisan crowd seemed resigned. The
12,000 spectators occasionally jeered and whistled derisively at
the Italian duo, which at one juncture lost 41 of 53 points.
	   An eventual Swedish triumph seemed certain after Friday's
opening match, when Italy's No. 1 player, Andrea Gaudenzi, dropped
out with a strained shoulder tendon.
	   Gaudenzi had came close to a miracle victory before surrendering
to pain and exhaustion and retiring at 6-6 in the fifth set of a
five-hour marathon against Magnus Norman.
	   A seemingly distracted Sanguinetti then went out and failed to
put up a fight, losing in straight sets to Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson.
	   With Gaudenzi, who will undergo an MRI exam Monday, ruled out
for the rest of the competition, Sanguinetti was forced to take his
place as Nargiso's partner for the first time ever.
	   ``Unfortunately, Andrea's injury did not allow us to really
fight to the end for the title,'' Italy's non-playing captain Paolo
Bertolucci said. ``Alas, with it already 2-0 before the doubles,
there was basically no chance for us.''
	   Adding insult to injury for Sanguinetti, the player's wallet and
cellular phone were stolen from his courtside racket bag during the
post-match confusion, when the Swedish team and some spectators ran
onto the court to celebrate.
	   Nargiso _ who lost his serve five times _ and Sanguinetti were
rarely in sync, including on one point with Sweden ahead 4-1 in the
second set.
	   With the score 40-30 on Italy's serve, Sanguinetti and Nargiso
nearly collided under a floating lob and Sanguinetti swung and
missed. A Sanguinetti error and a well-placed Bjorkman lob over the
Italians rooted at the net gave Sweden a break and a 5-1 lead.
	   Gaudenzi's retirement raised the question of whether Bertolucci
erred in deciding to go with a player who had shoulder surgery in
October. Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy beat
the United States in the cup semifinals in September. He had
surgery in October.
	   Norman officially downed Gaudenzi by the score of 6-7 (9-11),
7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0) in an error-strewn match.
Gustafsson overpowered Sanguinetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-0.
	   With the outcome decided, Sunday's reverse singles matches will
be shortened to best-of-3 sets.

Cyprus and Russia sign accord on double taxation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Russia and Cyprus signed a double
taxation accord Saturday that the Cypriot finance minister hailed
as ``the most important event of 1998 for the Cyprus economy.''
	   ``The agreement is undoubtedly significant because it safeguards
the continued investment through Cyprus of billions of dollars in
the Russian economy,'' Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou
said.
	   He said the accord was achieved ``after many months of intensive
and hard negotiations.''
	   Foreign investors have been investing billions of dollars in
Russia through Cyprus in recent years to take advantage of
loopholes which exempted the profits and interest from double
taxation.
	   Russia had demanded a change in Cypriot tax law which would have
enabled Moscow to tax such profits. Cyprus had objected because
this would have placed it at a disadvantage to the United States
and European states, which enjoy such exemptions under their own
agreements with Moscow.
	   Christodoulou said the new agreement, which is valid for five
years, will conform with the terms of Russia's agreements with the
United States and European states.
	   Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Kutrin expressed
satisfaction after the signing ceremony, saying the new agreement
was ``more balanced.''
	   Kutrin said that not all problems had been solved.
	   ``We have before us serious targets which we must achieve in the
next few years,'' he added.

AIDS sufferers starting to come out into the open in SAfrica

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ One after the other, men and women
stepped up to a microphone Saturday in a community center and in
clear voices announced: ``I am HIV positive.''
	   The disclosures were greeted by clapping and cheering. Members
of the crowd of 150 often left their seats to hug the speakers.
	   Most of the 3 million South Africans with AIDS or its precursor,
HIV, would not receive such a warm reception after disclosing that
they are infected. The tiny minority who do are often fired from
their jobs, hounded from their homes, treated as outcasts. Untold
numbers go to the grave with their secret.
	   The reaction was different at the community center because many
in the crowd have HIV or AIDS.
	   The gathering, sponsored by the National Association of People
Living With HIV/AIDS, is meant to help remove the stigma from the
disease and give the unfolding tragedy a human face. It was among
the first of many such gatherings that officials hope to hold
across South Africa.
	   A recent similar gathering in KwaZulu-Natal province, where an
estimated 25 percent of adults are infected, drew 1,000 people.
	   South Africa is only now beginning to confront the disease that
has made its way from central Africa around the world and is now
exploding like a bomb in southern Africa. Every day, 1,500 South
Africans become infected. By the end of the year, 168,000 more
South Africans will have died from AIDS. Often, relatives say the
person died of some other disease.
	   This week, President Nelson Mandela denounced ``the silence that
hangs over our cemeteries when we bury loved ones knowing they died
of AIDS, but not speaking of it.''
	   AIDS sufferers are stigmatized because the disease _ which in
Africa is most commonly transmitted by heterosexual sex _ is
associated with promiscuity and death, and because many people
wrongly believe they can contract AIDS by being near an
HIV-positive person, said Liz Floyd, who runs the Johannesburg area
health department's AIDS program.
	   Sekgametsi More, a social worker at Johannesburg Hospital, said
most people with HIV whom she has counseled have been shunned.
	   Only a few days ago, More told a young woman that her HIV test
was positive.
	   The previous day, the woman had been fired from her job as a
live-in maid because her employer that suspected the woman _ who
had been constantly sick because her immune system was depressed _
had AIDS. The woman had been monogamous and was apparently infected
by her boyfriend. The relationship has ended.
	   ``When we told her she was HIV positive, it was terrible for
her,'' More said. ``Now she knew she had this disease, plus she had
no job and no place to live.''
	   At Saturday's gathering in the black township of Soweto, people
spoke of receiving the double blow of finding out they had HIV,
then being shunned.
	   Joyce Malope, 27, discovered she was HIV positive in 1994, soon
after she was raped.
	   ``My husband dumped me after he kept telling me I was going to
die,'' she told a reporter. ``I tried to commit suicide because I
had no one to turn to.''
	   She was then directed to a counselor, who taught her to ``try to
live with AIDS rather than thinking my life was already over.''
	   After dozens of people had spoken of their illness, the crowd
began dancing to reggae music. Looking on, Floyd said she hoped
many more such encounters could be held, and that more people would
come to them.
	   ``It's absolutely critical for this society to come to grips
with the epidemic,'' she said. ``If people keep it under wraps _ if
you don't meet the people who have it, it's very difficult to
believe it is real.''

Villa stays top after tie with Manchester United

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Julian Joachim's equalizer kept Aston Villa at the
top of the Premier League Saturday after a 1-1 tie with second
place Manchester United.
	   Paul Scholes fired United ahead at Villa Park just after half
time but Joachim leveled eight minutes later to earn a tie that
keeps Villa top by one point. John Gregory's team has 30 points
from 15 games and United has 29 from the same number.
	   Leeds moved up to third on 26 points after a 4-0 crushing of
in-form West Ham with two goals from Lee Bowyer and others by Dutch
stars Robert Molenaar and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.
	   With new manager Brian Kidd watching for the first time after
his move from the No. 2 job at Manchester United, Blackburn climbed
off the bottom of the standings by edging Charlton 1-0 at Ewood
Park and climbed to second from last.
	   Kevin Davies scored the winner 15 minutes from the end for his
long-awaited first goal since his 7.5 million pound (dlrs 12.5
million) move from Southampton, which coincidentally slipped to
last again after a 2-0 loss at Leicester.
	   Arsenal, missing six of its stars through injury, was held to a
0-0 tie at Derby and remained fourth after a fifth scoreless
performance in six games. West Ham is fifth and Chelsea stayed
sixth after a 0-0 tie at Everton where Dennis Wise and the home
team's Richard Dunne were expelled for two yellow cards.
	   Having already knocked Liverpool out of the League Cup last
month, Tottenham gained a 2-1 victory over the Merseyside team at
White Hart Lane with a deflected shot by Ruel Fox and an own goal
by Jamie Carragher. Czech forward Patrik Berger replied for
Liverpool.
	   Jason Euell scored twice as Wimbledon hit back for a 2-1 win
over struggling Coventry which taken taken the lead through Gary
McAllister's penalty.
	   Division one leader Sunderland stayed on course for a return to
the Premier League with a 1-0 victory at home to Stockport while
second place Ipswich edged Birmingham 1-0.
	   Possibly with their minds on Tuesday's UEFA Cup game against
Italy's Parma, Scottish league leader Rangers were surprisingly
held 1-1 at home by last place Dunfermline.
	   Second place Kilmarnock moved level on points but behind on goal
difference by thumping Aberdeen 4-0.
	   In the second round of the FA Cup, semi-pro Yeovil, which upset
Sunderland in the fourth round back in 1949 in one of the biggest
upsets in the long history of the competition, scored a 2-0 victory
over division two Northampton to reach the third round for the 22nd
time.

Spokesman says Yeltsin ready to return, but doesn't say when
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is ready to return to
work, his spokesman said Saturday, nearly two weeks after the
president was hospitalized with pneumonia.
	   What spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin didn't say, however, was exactly
when Yeltsin will return.
	   Since his hospitalization on Nov. 22, Yeltsin has hovered in the
deep background of Russia's political discourse, largely unseen and
unheard. His place at the center of national affairs has been taken
by his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In announcing Yeltsin's imminent return, Yakushkin tried to
restore some luster to the president's image, depicting him as an
active, well-connected executive even from his hospital bed _ an
image few Russians are likely to believe anymore.
	   Speaking on Echo Moscow radio, Yakushkin said Yeltsin ``remains
the most influential politician in the country, no matter what is
said about it.'' He noted that the president remains in control of
the device that would authorize a nuclear strike.
	   He described Yeltsin as someone who is ``full of energy, speaks
very brightly and works a lot.'' A desk in his hospital room is
heaped with working papers, and Yeltsin keeps fully abreast of
events in the country, the spokesman said.
	   He remarked that alcoholic beverages, for which the president is
known to have a weakness, are ``absolutely prohibited'' in the
hospital.
	   ``The president does not think about his early resignation,''
Yakushkin said. He added, that Yeltsin ``is closely watching sharp
or insulting statements made by certain politicians concerning his
actions.''
	   ``The president remembers all of them,'' Yakushkin said.
	   If true, that would attest to a powerful memory, since Yeltsin
has been insulted or slighted by a wide array of political figures
lately, from the Communist opposition to his own former allies in
the political center.
	   Many have urged his resignation, but Yeltsin has remained
adamant that he will remain in office until the end of his term in
2000.
	   The Kremlin had said last week that Yeltsin was expected back at
work on Monday, but Yakushkin has declined to confirm that or say
when the president will be released from the hospital.
	   Primakov visited Yeltsin on Friday and urged him to stay in the
hospital until he was better.

Italian held for drugs dies in police station

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Italian who was arrested this week for
carrying illegal drugs was found dead Saturday in a Cairo police
station, security officials said.
	   Angelo Maria Micali, 38, who owns an alcohol shop in Cairo, was
found dead by his cell mates in the Giza police station, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They said it was not clear how he died and an autopsy has been
ordered.
	   The Italian embassy was closed for the weekend and diplomats
were not available outside for comment.
	   Police said Michaeli and an Egyptian friend of his were detained
Monday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik after they were
found in possession of 140,000 pills of Rohypnol, a synthetic drug.
	   Rohypnol is a prescribed hypnotic and muscle relaxant that has
been widely sold to youngsters as a pleasure-giving agent. In the
United States it is called the ``date-rape drug.''
	   After his arrest, Michaeli was kept in police custody for four
days pending further investigations, and the term was extended by
15 days, said the officials. It was not clear since when Michaeli
had been living in Egypt.
	   No charges had been filed against Michaeli but smuggling of
drugs is usually punished by death in Egypt.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A week before the scheduled start of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, Palestinian stone-throwers
battled Israeli troops Saturday in scattered clashes that left 25
Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers injured. Seven protesters
were arrested.
	   On the outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, and the
Israeli settlement of Ariel, scores of Palestinian youths threw
rocks at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear
gas. The fighting went on for several hours before protesters
dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The clashes came as Palestinians launched a campaign of protests
to call for the release of so-called security prisoners _ an
escalating dispute that has threatened to derail the new Mideast
peace accord.
	   In addition to the street protests, about 2,500 Palestinian
prisoners began a hunger strike Saturday to press for their early
release.
	   In the Ramallah clash, two protesters and two Palestinian police
were hit by rubber bullets, and three demonstrators suffered
tear-gas inhalation. Five protesters in Bethlehem were shot with
rubber bullets.
	   An army officer and two soldiers were injured very lightly in
the Ramallah and Bethlehem clashes, the army said.
	   Outside the northern town of Nablus, three protesters were hit
by rubber bullets and another 10 were sickened by tear gas as they
marched toward a Jewish settlement.
	   Dozens of Palestinians also protested outside of the West Bank
settlement of Ariel and tried to set fire to an electricity pole.
Others threw stones towards homes on the settlement and Israeli
forces on the site. Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear
gas onto the crowd but there were no injuries, the army said.
	   Meanwhile, a week before President Clinton is to arrive for a
three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction burned
U.S. flags in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
During it, some two dozen masked marchers burned American and
Israeli flags and waved banners vowing to ``continue the
struggle.''
	   In Ramallah, the Palestinians' top negotiator on prisoners
expressed regret over a statement by the Clinton administration
siding with Israel in the prisoner dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do...concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' Kadoura Faris, who is
representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the Israelis
on the issue, told about 500 protesters at a rally in Ramallah.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last month it
freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals such as car
thieves.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord _ including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled later this month _ until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.
	   The prisoner issue is highly emotional, because it touches
nearly all Palestinian families. Almost everyone in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip has had a relative _ a father, a brother, a son, an
uncle, a cousin _ arrested at some point during the 30-year Israeli
occupation.
	   At Saturday's rally in Ramallah, families demanded that the
Palestinian Authority make the release of security prisoners a top
priority.
	   ``The Israelis ... did not release the ones who deserved to be
released,'' said Bahia Jabara, 44, who has husband and brother in
Israeli jail.
	   In another development, the first commercial Palestinian
Airlines flight from the newly inaugurated Gaza airport took off
Saturday morning.
	   But in a sour note, the flight to Amman, the capital of
neighboring Jordan, was delayed for more than three hours by an
argument between Palestinians and the Israelis over airport
security.

Solo racers begin second leg of around-alone yacht race

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Thirteen solo sailors began the
second leg of the Around Alone around-the-world race Saturday,
pushed by westerly winds toward New Zealand, their next stop.
	   Giovanni Soldini of Italy on Saturday led the fleet out of Table
Bay under an overcast skies with westerly winds of 10- to 15-knots.
	   The leg takes the racers on a roughly 7,000-mile
(11,200-kilometer) voyage to Auckland, New Zealand, running through
churning waters of the Roaring Forties _ below 40 degrees south
latitude.
	   Mike Golding of Britain won the first leg by just 2 1/2 hours,
arriving in Cape Town on Oct. 31 after 34 days at sea.
	   The second- and third-place finishers were Isabelle Autissier
and Marc Thiercelin, both of France.
	   The racers left Charleston, S.C., on Sept. 27, heading from the
east coast of the United States to Cape Town. The racers will also
stop at Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to Charleston
next spring.
	   Two competitors, Robin Davie and Fedor Konioukhov, remained in
Cape Town sorting out final repairs. Davie, 47, of Charleston, is
in the last stages of fitting a new rudder to his 50-foot yacht
South Carolina.
	   He is expected to begin Leg 2 on Monday.
	   Konioukhov's 60-foot Modern University for the Humanities yacht
needs to sort of problems with his keel-bolt issues and
water-ballast. The Russian also hopes to leave Monday.
	   Soldini started the leg nearly three days in elapsed time behind
Golding, and knows that he must win or place highly on this leg if
he stands any realistic chance of winning the race, which is held
every four years.

Replica of biblical Nazareth aims to bring Jesus' times alive

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add photo number &QL;

 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) _ Kneeling on a slope in Jesus' hometown,
volunteers from an American church gently fitted rock on limestone
rock and filled in cracks with a mortar of mud.
	   The result of a day's labor was a ragged knee-high wall lining
an agricultural terrace _ a common sight in the Middle East, where
farmers since biblical times have had to plant on rocky hills.
	   But this wall was special.
	   It marked the start of a dlrs 64 million project, largely
financed by American donations, to build a replica of a
biblical-era village and farm in the heart of Nazareth, where
tradition says Christ spent much of his life.
	   In time for the millennium, visitors will be able to stroll
along donkey paths into an ancient village of one-room stone houses
and courtyards, and mingle with actors playing 1st century
housewives and farmers.
	   Or they can follow a ``parable walk,'' accompanied by
storytellers in period costume who will relay news of Jesus as a
contemporary. For the devout, there will be a holy communion, a
foot washing or a reading from the Bible.
	   Project organizers say they want to bring Jesus and his
teachings to life in historical context, something a standard tour
of the Holy Land often fails to deliver.
	   ``You can see only so many archaeological sites before you don't
know anymore what you are seeing and are not moved by it,'' said
Joel Kauffmann, program director of Nazareth Village, a
not-for-profit association of professionals and business people
whose honorary chairman is former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
	   In modern Nazareth _ a noisy, congested city of 60,000 whose
main attraction is the 1950s Church of the Annunciation _ that
connection to the biblical past is especially difficult to make.
	   Jackhammers are tearing up the city center as dlrs 80 million is
being spent on widening streets and building 1,000 hotel rooms in
preparation for an expected 4 million tourists in 2000.
	   But the work is behind schedule and ambitious plans for a large
stadium, a civic auditorium and an additional 1,500 hotel rooms
have been dropped.
	   A new snag arose after November municipal elections. In the
mainly Arab town that is 70 percent Muslim and 30 percent
Christian, the Islamic movement for the first time won a majority
on the city council. The Christian mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, was barely
re-elected.
	   Topping the Islamists' agenda is the construction of a mosque
right next to the Church of the Annunciation, on a spot where city
planners had hoped to build a Venetian-style plaza for tourists.
The dispute is in court and the plaza is on hold.
	   The election outcome worries some Nazarenes, who fear a new
emphasis on religious alignment is emerging in a town that has long
prided itself on tolerance.
	   Mindful of the tensions, the planners of Nazareth Village
decided to get the community involved from the start.
	   ``We're not high-powered Westerners coming in and creating a
theme park, a place whose sole purpose is to make money,'' said
Michael Hostetler, the executive director of Nazareth Village and
an employee of the Mennonite Board of Missions in Elkhart, Indiana.
	   On a recent Saturday, 360 local volunteers launched the project
by clearing thorny bushes covering the 12-acre (5-hectare) plot
that is part of the grounds of a hospital run by the Edinburgh
Medical Missionary Society of Scotland.
	   Muslim girls wearing traditional headscarves worked alongside
Christian teen-agers in jeans and T-shirts and a dozen volunteers
from the United Methodist Church in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Local
grocers donated food for a picnic lunch.
	   By the end of the day, the brush was cleared, laying bare the
terraces of a 1st century farm. Later will come orchards of olive,
fig and plum trees.
	   An earlier archaeological dig yielded a quarry, watch tower
bases, stone irrigation channels and a wine press _ a level area
cut from limestone for squeezing grapes and a vat below for
collecting juice.
	   Frieda Brothers, a 67-year-old retired nurse dusty from hauling
underbrush, said the work helped strengthen her faith.
	   ``It was a joy to get something started that the rest of the
world will see someday and know this is where Jesus walked and
lived,'' she said.
	   It is believed that biblical Nazareth, where Jesus spent much of
his life, consisted of only about 35 homes spread over six acres
(about 2.5 hectares).
	   By 2000, Hostetler hopes to have the first six or seven homes
built and open the site to visitors. The work will then become part
of the attraction, with builders in biblical dress transporting
materials _ all strictly 1st century _ on donkeyback.
	   A ``parable walk'' will weave through the village and the farm
and use existing sites to illustrate New Testament stories.
	   For example, visitors might pause at a terrace and hear the
parable of the farmer who saw some of his seeds go to waste because
they fell on rocky ground.
	   The story might make little sense to visitors used to vast
stretches of fertile land in other parts of the world, Hostetler
said.
	   ``But when you come here, you see the narrow terraces, and it's
not a stretch of the imagination that some of the seeds would
naturally fall on rocks,'' he said.
	   In the later stages, there will be a multimedia exhibit
detailing Jesus' life. At night, visitors might don period dress
themselves and participate in a village celebration.
	   A biblical Disneyland?
	   ``I don't think we should deny the entertainment aspect of
this,'' Kauffmann said. ``But this will not be garish, this will
not be pumped up.''

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The death toll from almost three weeks of
sub-zero temperatures reached 85 on Saturday, after two men froze
to death in their unheated homes in northeastern Poland.
	   Both victims, ages 36 and 49, were from towns near the city of
Bialystok. Both drank alcohol before going to sleep, police said.
	   Poland's extreme cold began Nov. 16, with temperatures dropping
to minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Police say the number of
cold-related deaths in recent weeks is 29 more than the number for
all of last winter.
	   Many of the victims were homeless, and most had been drinking
alcohol, which lowers the body temperature. On Friday, a man
identified as Adam S., 47, was found frozen to death in a Warsaw
park.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled
to Libya on Saturday for talks on bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, but possibly not with Moammar
Gadhafi.
	   Libya's official news agency, JANA, said that he ``may not be
able to meet'' Gadhafi on his one-day trip, adding that the Libyan
leader was ``in the desert outside the region.''
	   The JANA report said that Annan met with the Libyan foreign
minister, Omar al-Muntasser, in the northern coastal town of Sirte.
It gave no other information on why the expected Annan-Gadhafi
might not take place.
	   Earlier, the Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no
authority to hand over the suspects, indicating that Gadhafi was
giving himself room in case he decides against giving up the
suspects.
	   JANA said Gadhafi is neither the prime minister nor the
president. It suggested that a decision on handing over the
suspects would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national
committees before being decided by the Parliament.
	   Libya gave little information on Annan's visit. Libyan officials
reported that he arrived in the country and then flew to Sirte, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli. Most reporters
were barred from going to Sirte and ordered to stay in Tripoli.
	   But ordinary Libyans were aware of the developments, and many
said they opposed handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed Abdel-Salam said.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the two men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we
have law,'' he said.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan officials said Saturday that hopes
for an immediate cease-fire in Congo were premature and depended on
whether Congolese President Laurent Kabila will bow to
international pressure and negotiate directly with the rebels.
	   Rwandan military sources said rebels in southeastern Congo had
repelled two days of attacks by government troops and Zimbabwean
allies at Kabalo, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of the
eastern rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   Zimbabwe, Kabila's main ally, lost three armored personnel
carriers in attempts to cross the Nzofu Bridge over the Congo
River, the sources said. The number of casualties was not
immediately known, the sources said, and the rebel positions
remained unchanged.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the rebel leader, said fighting was also
reported around rebel-held Moba on Lake Tanganyika, where his
troops repelled a government counteroffensive.
	   Neither claim could be confirmed independently.
	   In New York, a senior U.N. official said Rwanda, Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Congo were expected to sign a formal cease-fire at a
summit in Lusaka, Zambia on Dec. 14-15, to be enforced by
deployment of at least 15,000 peacekeepers.
	   The agreement follows promises by African leaders in Paris last
week to stop fighting in Congo.
	   Both Wamba and Rwandan officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the cease-fire could be signed only if the rebels
negotiated directly with Kabila _ something the Congolese president
has been rejecting since the revolt began Aug. 2.
	   There has been no reaction from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa.
	   The rebels are trying to overthrow Kabila, who came to power in
May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
He promised reform and democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic
of Congo, but many critics say his regime's 18 months in power has
seen repressive policies and a growing intolerance of criticism.
	   The rebels include ethnic Tutsis, disaffected soldiers and
opposition politicians who accuse Kabila of mismanagement,
corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400 ethnic groups.
	   Kabila says they are the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, and
demands the withdrawal of foreign troops. Both countries say they
intervened to prevent anti-Tutsi massacres and protect their
borders from Rwandan and Ugandan rebels who had been recruited by
the government to fight.
	   Wamba, who was in the Ugandan capital to discuss the Congo
situation with President Yoweri Museveni later Saturday, said the
rebels have been calling for a cease-fire and negotiations _ as
long as they are conducted face-to-face with Kabila.
	   ``We have asked to be included in peace talks at all levels,''
Wamba said. ''We need to know if this has been granted or not.''
	   ``Interpositioning of a neutral force in Congo is also an object
of negotiations. The U.N. may be foreseeing that possibility, but
it depends on too many factors,'' Wamba said.

Priest accused in death of Guatemalan bishop hospitalized
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The priest accused of beating to death a
Catholic bishop has been hospitalized with an ulcer, pneumonia and
stress.
	   The Rev. Mario Najera Orantes was taken to the private Old City
hospital under heavy guard Saturday. An appellate court approved
his transfer from prison.
	   Orantes' lawyer, Jose Toledo Paz, said the priest had an ulcer
in the duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine, and
bronchial pneumonia.
	   Authorities accuse Orantes of bludgeoning Bishop Juan Gerardi in
the garage of the San Sebastian Church parish house on April 26.
	   Two days before his death, the 75-year-old bishop presented a
report charging that the Guatemalan military and pro-military death
squads were responsible for most of the atrocities committed during
the country's civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   Public suspicion initially fell on soldiers or death squad
members and church leaders were shocked when police arrested
Orantes.
	   Investigators exhumed Gerardi's body on Sept. 17 and presented a
report to Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina, who has yet to decide
whether to start judicial proceedings against Orantes.
	   Police seized Orantes' German shepherd, which Spanish
investigators have suggested may have been responsible for what
seem to be bite marks on Gerardi's body.
	   This week, the prosecutor investigating the case announced his
resignation, but gave no specific reason. The church's Human Rights
Office of the Archbishop had called on Otto Ardon Medina to step
down, accusing him of wrongly accusing Orantes.
	   Ardon's replacement has not been named.
	   It is the second time Orantes has been hospitalized since his
July 22 arrest. He was rushed to an emergency room with respiratory
problems on July 29.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes erupted in the
West Bank on Saturday as Palestinians marched to demand the release
of hundreds of prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activity. About
two dozen people were injured and seven protesters were arrested.
	   On the outskirts of the West Bank towns of Bethlehem, Ramallah
and Nablus, scores of Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli
troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The
fighting went on for several hours before protesters dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Police said seven Palestinians, mostly minors, were arrested.
	   Dozens of Palestinians also protested outside of the West Bank
settlement of Ariel and tried to set fire to an electricity pole.
Others threw stones towards homes on the settlement and Israeli
forces on the site. Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear
gas onto the crowd but there were no injuries, the army said.

Replica of biblical Nazareth aims to bring Jesus' times alive

<TEXT>
	   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) _ Kneeling on a slope in Jesus' hometown,
volunteers from an American church gently fitted rock on limestone
rock and filled in cracks with a mortar of mud.
	   The result of a day's labor was a ragged knee-high wall lining
an agricultural terrace _ a common sight in the Middle East, where
farmers since biblical times have had to plant on rocky hills.
	   But this wall was special.
	   It marked the start of a dlrs 64 million project, largely
financed by American donations, to build a replica of a
biblical-era village and farm in the heart of Nazareth, where
tradition says Christ spent much of his life.
	   In time for the millennium, visitors will be able to stroll
along donkey paths into an ancient village of one-room stone houses
and courtyards, and mingle with actors playing 1st century
housewives and farmers.
	   Or they can follow a ``parable walk,'' accompanied by
storytellers in period costume who will relay news of Jesus as a
contemporary. For the devout, there will be a holy communion, a
foot washing or a reading from the Bible.
	   Project organizers say they want to bring Jesus and his
teachings to life in historical context, something a standard tour
of the Holy Land often fails to deliver.
	   ``You can see only so many archaeological sites before you don't
know anymore what you are seeing and are not moved by it,'' said
Joel Kauffmann, program director of Nazareth Village, a
not-for-profit association of professionals and business people
whose honorary chairman is former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
	   In modern Nazareth _ a noisy, congested city of 60,000 whose
main attraction is the 1950s Church of the Annunciation _ that
connection to the biblical past is especially difficult to make.
	   Jackhammers are tearing up the city center as dlrs 80 million is
being spent on widening streets and building 1,000 hotel rooms in
preparation for an expected 4 million tourists in 2000.
	   But the work is behind schedule and ambitious plans for a large
stadium, a civic auditorium and an additional 1,500 hotel rooms
have been dropped.
	   A new snag arose after November municipal elections. In the
mainly Arab town that is 70 percent Muslim and 30 percent
Christian, the Islamic movement for the first time won a majority
on the city council. The Christian mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, was barely
re-elected.
	   Topping the Islamists' agenda is the construction of a mosque
right next to the Church of the Annunciation, on a spot where city
planners had hoped to build a Venetian-style plaza for tourists.
The dispute is in court and the plaza is on hold.
	   The election outcome worries some Nazarenes, who fear a new
emphasis on religious alignment is emerging in a town that has long
prided itself on tolerance.
	   Mindful of the tensions, the planners of Nazareth Village
decided to get the community involved from the start.
	   ``We're not high-powered Westerners coming in and creating a
theme park, a place whose sole purpose is to make money,'' said
Michael Hostetler, the executive director of Nazareth Village and
an employee of the Mennonite Board of Missions in Elkhart, Indiana.
	   On a recent Saturday, 360 local volunteers launched the project
by clearing thorny bushes covering the 12-acre (5-hectare) plot
that is part of the grounds of a hospital run by the Edinburgh
Medical Missionary Society of Scotland.
	   Muslim girls wearing traditional headscarves worked alongside
Christian teen-agers in jeans and T-shirts and a dozen volunteers
from the United Methodist Church in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Local
grocers donated food for a picnic lunch.
	   By the end of the day, the brush was cleared, laying bare the
terraces of a 1st century farm. Later will come orchards of olive,
fig and plum trees.
	   An earlier archaeological dig yielded a quarry, watch tower
bases, stone irrigation channels and a wine press _ a level area
cut from limestone for squeezing grapes and a vat below for
collecting juice.
	   Frieda Brothers, a 67-year-old retired nurse dusty from hauling
underbrush, said the work helped strengthen her faith.
	   ``It was a joy to get something started that the rest of the
world will see someday and know this is where Jesus walked and
lived,'' she said.
	   It is believed that biblical Nazareth, where Jesus spent much of
his life, consisted of only about 35 homes spread over six acres
(about 2.5 hectares).
	   By 2000, Hostetler hopes to have the first six or seven homes
built and open the site to visitors. The work will then become part
of the attraction, with builders in biblical dress transporting
materials _ all strictly 1st century _ on donkeyback.
	   A ``parable walk'' will weave through the village and the farm
and use existing sites to illustrate New Testament stories.
	   For example, visitors might pause at a terrace and hear the
parable of the farmer who saw some of his seeds go to waste because
they fell on rocky ground.
	   The story might make little sense to visitors used to vast
stretches of fertile land in other parts of the world, Hostetler
said.
	   ``But when you come here, you see the narrow terraces, and it's
not a stretch of the imagination that some of the seeds would
naturally fall on rocks,'' he said.
	   In the later stages, there will be a multimedia exhibit
detailing Jesus' life. At night, visitors might don period dress
themselves and participate in a village celebration.
	   A biblical Disneyland?
	   ``I don't think we should deny the entertainment aspect of
this,'' Kauffmann said. ``But this will not be garish, this will
not be pumped up.''

Kirsten overpowering as Leverkusen takes over Bundesliga lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German international Ulf Kirsten was overpowering
Saturday, scoring twice from short-range, as Bayer Leverkusen won
to climb past Bayern Munich to the head of the Bundesliga table.
	   Leverkusen, red-hot with a 13-match unbeaten run that has
yielded 28 points, trounced sixth-place VfL Wolfsburg 3-0 to move
past Munich on goal differential.
	   The victory left the two powerhouses deadlocked at 35 points and
headed to a showdown next Sunday in Munich's Olympiastadium.
	   ``Our victory was good for the league because there's drama
again at the top,'' said Leverkusen coach Christoph Daum, who had
publicly written off the title earlier in the season when Munich
was a runaway leader.
	   Leverkusen weathered an opening blitz from visiting Wolfsburg,
riding a nine-match unbeaten streak of its own, before the bullish
Kirsten's prowress inside the box scrambled around the match.
	   The striker, the Bundesliga's leading marksman the past two
seasons, again grabbed a share of the league lead at nine goals
with his chip in the 21st minute and header off a corner five
minutes later.
	   Brazilian midfielder Ze Roberto scored in the 54th minute as
Leverkusen's mix of Brazilians and talented young German players
proved too clever for Wolfsburg.
	   U.S. international Claudio Reyna reclaimed his starting role for
Wolfsburg for the match. But his team, after some sparkling play
during the first 20 minutes, faded against the aggressive style of
Leverkusen, which tops the table for the first time in two years.
	   Munich helped Leverkusen by being held to a surprise 2-2 draw
Friday by SC Freiburg. Hansa Rostock and FC Nuremberg also played
to 2-2.
	   Snow cancelled three matches Saturday, but VfB Stuttgart won for
the first time in six matches by beating Hamburg 3-0. The team's
coach, Winfried Schaefer, had resigned Friday in the face of a
player rebellion.
	   Nigerian striker Jonathan Akpoborie scored a hat trick, leaving
him with eight season goals, as Stuttgart erased Hamburg's early
lead on a 37th minute goal by Bernd Hollerbach.
	   Schalke, the 1997 UEFA Cup champions, moved out of the
relegation zone with a 2-1 away victory against Eintracht
Frankfurt. Marco van Hoogdalem and Sven Kmetsch scored first-half
goals.
	   Schalke got a lift when striker Marc Wilmonts played his first
match in two months after injury. The Belgium international was the
hero of their UEFA Cup triumph.
	   Jan-Age Fjoertoff, a new acquisition, scored Frankfurt's
consolation goal in the 80th minute.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has extended a planned
visit to his native Poland and may address parliament while in
Warsaw, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The pope's trip will begin June 5 and last until June 14, one
day longer than originally planned, according to the daily
newspaper Zycie. He has added new cities to his itinerary _ Stary
Sacz, Sosnowiec and Gliwice, all in the south _ increasing his
stops to 19.
	   The newspaper also said a parliament address is likely what
government spokesman Jaroslaw Selling meant when he said he
expected a ``political surprise'' during the pope's visit.
	   The trip would be John Paul's eighth to Poland since becoming
pope in 1978. During his stay, he is expected to beatify more than
100 Poles killed under Nazi occupation.
	   Warsaw will be the last leg of a tour that probably will begin
with a mass at the Baltic coast resort of Sopot. Other stops: the
coastal cities of Gdansk and Oliwa, and nearby Pelplin and Elblag;
Bydgoszcz, Torun, Elk and Wigry in the north; Lichen, Lowicz,
Siedlce and Drohiczyn in central and eastern Poland; and Krakow,
Sandomierz, Zamosc in the south.
	   The extra cities were added during a planning visit by Vatican
envoy the Rev. Roberto Tucci. Tucci leaves Poland on Saturday.

Turkish Cypriots vote for new parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Voting starts at 0600 GMT Sunday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu's
center-right party was expected to dominate parliamentary elections
Sunday in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic.
	   Eroglu's party hopes to secure a majority of seats in the
parliament, which presides over the northern third of the divided
Mediterranean island.
	   Eroglu has led the government, made up of his National Unity
Party and a Social Democrat partner, since 1996. His party won a
landslide victory in local elections earlier this year.
	   More than 85 percent of 121,000 eligible voters are expected to
vote for 50 lawmakers from among 352 candidates fielded by seven
political parties, the Cumhuriyet daily said.
	   Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be
dominated by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland
who have been given voting rights.
	   A recent report by the European Union Commission put the number
of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a total population of 200,000.
Opposition parties claim that about half the candidates are
settlers.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Nine
years later, Turkish Cypriots proclaimed the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which has been recognized only by Turkey.
	   The general elections came at a time when President Rauf
Denktash is seeking a nonaggression pact with Greek Cypriots to
ensure peace on the island.
	   Greek Cypriot plans to deploy Russian-made anti-aircraft
missiles on the island have escalated tension. Turkey has
threatened to hit missile batteries if they are deployed.
	   UN-sponsored talks for reunification of Cyprus deadlocked
following Denktash's demands for recognition of his state and the
cancellation of Greek Cyprus' talks on joining the European Union.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The last main fighting force of the
Khmer Rouge, the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two
million Cambodians, surrendered to the government in a ceremony
broadcast on national television Saturday.
	   Khem Nuon, chief of staff of the remaining band of guerrillas,
negotiated the deal with representatives of the Phnom Penh
government on Friday at Preah Vihear temple near the border with
Thailand.
	   ``We ask for permission from the Royal Government of Cambodia to
rejoin society and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces,'' Khem Nuon
said in Friday's surrender statement, broadcast Saturday.
	   The Khmer Rouge laying down their arms brings to an end more
than 30 years of civil war in Cambodia that began with the Marxist
guerrillas' insurgency against the government in Phnom Penh in the
late 1960s.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An unruly passenger died aboard a Malev
Hungarian airliner on Saturday after being strapped to his seat and
injected with tranquilizers.
	   The passenger, identified by Turkey's Anatolia news agency as
Finnish national Mikaeinar Peterson, was dead by the time the jet
made an emergency landing in Istanbul.
	   Anatolia and Hungary's MTI news agency said the man started
harassing others aboard a flight from Bangkok to Budapest. He
allegedly punched a pilot and tried to choke an attendant.
	   The crew and passengers tied him to his seat and a doctor aboard
gave him an injection.
	   An autopsy done later in the day showed he died because of the
mixture of the tranquilizer and some other drug or alcohol.
Witnesses saw the man take a pill before he became violent and
authorities suspected he was drunk, Anatolia said.
	   Police detained two pilots, four attendants and five passengers
along with the doctor and his father.
	   A new crew from Hungary flew the jet to Budapest with its
remaining 183 passengers.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Snaking through silent streets, Nigerians
took a step away from military rule towards democracy Saturday in
local government elections seen as a pivotal test for Africa's most
populous nation.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing
traffic jams of Nigerian cities, shops were closed and the
government ordered all cars, trucks and even motorcycles off city
streets and country highways to prevent political protests and
traffic jams.
	   Children played soccer in the streets while adults shuffled past
on their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a temporary and joyous halt.
	   Although borders were closed and about 100,000 riot police
patrolled the major cities and rural villages amid fears of
elections violence, the mood was buoyant.
	   At one police station in Lagos, officers released prisoners
awaiting trial so they could vote. It was unclear if the move had
been approved by senior authorities or if the prisoners would be
sought to return behind bars.
	   ``Even detainees are entitled to vote,'' said a police sergeant
on duty who asked to remain anonymous. ``I will also go vote when I
leave duty.''
	   Voters began churning through polling stations, where officials
took peoples' names and gave out special identity cards. The actual
casting of ballots did not begin until shortly before noon. Vote
counting began in some municipalities soon afterwards.
	   Elections organizers said the turnout was high. More than 50
million people are registered to vote for some 8,800 municipal
government posts. Nine parties have registered and three have
fielded candidates nationwide.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians in May after
presidential elections on February 15. Abubakar took power after
the unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June.
	   ``From what we have seen so far, the turnout is commendable,''
Abubakar said after voting in the capital, Abuja. ``The government
has done its part and it is now up to Nigerians and the politicians
to play their own.''
	   Saturday's poll is a test run. The national electoral commission
is inexperienced and the political parties have vague platforms and
are relatively unknown.
	   Abubakar has promised that the military will not intervene in
the transition.
	   Nigeria, a country of more than 100 million people which has
failed to tackle grinding poverty despite fabulous oil wealth that
has made it the world's 6th largest producer, has a history of
armed coups and military meddling in politics. The country has been
ruled by civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar has warned that parties which campaign on divisive
ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria.
	   After official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation quickly filled radio and television
airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring election
promises on loudspeakers.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Although it was too early to say whether the elections would be
judged free and fair by foreign observers, only scattered
logistical problems were reported by officials early Saturday _ a
few people's names were missing from voters' lists in Abuja and
Lagos and polling began late in some stations.
	   Later in the day, officials said youths stole election material
and disrupted voting in some communities in the western state of
Osun.

Utility turns on heat after demonstrators block rail line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Utility officials resumed supplying heat and
electricity to a Moscow suburb Saturday after about 50 people
blocked railroad tracks to protest the shutting off of their
utilities, a news agency said.
	   The protest took place in the town of Scherbinka, about 3
kilometers (2 miles) south of Moscow, Interfax said. After reaching
agreement with utility officials, the demonstrators were allowed to
leave, and no arrests were reported.
	   The demonstrators' heat and electricity had been shut off
earlier in the day. During the protest, they allowed long-distance
passenger trains to pass but halted other trains, Interfax said.
	   Utility shutoffs have become common in parts of Russia this
winter, as the country's economic crisis exacerbates an already
serious problem of nonpayment for many utility services.
	   Interfax reported that heating and electricity supplies were
expected to resume Tuesday in the far northeastern Kamchatka
Peninsula if two tankers carrying fuel oil arrive on schedule.
	   Kamchatka has been without heat since Nov. 30.

Sweden clinches second straight Davis Cup

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Sweden clinched its second consecutive Davis
Cup title Saturday when Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti beat
Italy's doubles pair of Diego Nargiso and fill-in Davide
Sanguinetti in straight sets.
	   The 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, 6-3 victory added to wins in both of
Friday's singles matches to give Sweden an insurmountable 3-0 lead
over Italy in the best-of-5 series.
	   Sweden has now captured the Davis Cup seven times, including a
record six since the World Group format was established in 1981.
Italy's lone title came in 1976, and it has lost in six other
finals appearances.
	   ``I knew this weekend there would be five tough matches, but I
also knew we were good enough to win all five,'' Swedish captain
Carl-Axel Hageskog said.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti kept their own two-year Davis Cup winning
streak alive with little trouble, needing just 1 hour, 47 minutes
to overpower the Italians.
	   ``They were just too strong,'' Nargiso said.
	   Even the normally vociferous partisan crowd seemed resigned. The
12,000 spectators occasionally jeered and whistled derisively at
the Italian duo, which at one juncture lost 41 of 53 points.
	   An eventual Swedish triumph seemed certain after Friday's
opening match, when Italy's No. 1 player, Andrea Gaudenzi, dropped
out with a strained shoulder tendon.
	   Gaudenzi had came close to a miracle victory before surrendering
to pain and exhaustion and retiring at 6-6 in the fifth set of a
five-hour marathon against Magnus Norman.
	   A seemingly distracted Sanguinetti then went out and failed to
put up a fight, losing in straight sets to Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson.
	   With Gaudenzi, who will undergo an MRI exam Monday, ruled out
for the rest of the competition, Sanguinetti was forced to take his
place as Nargiso's partner for the first time ever.
	   ``Unfortunately, Andrea's injury did not allow us to really
fight to the end for the title,'' Italy's non-playing captain Paolo
Bertolucci said. ``Alas, with it already 2-0 before the doubles,
there was basically no chance for us.''
	   Adding insult to injury for Sanguinetti, the player's wallet and
cellular phone were stolen from his courtside racket bag during the
post-match confusion, when the Swedish team and some spectators ran
onto the court to celebrate.
	   Nargiso _ who lost his serve five times _ and Sanguinetti were
rarely in sync, including on one point with Sweden ahead 4-1 in the
second set.
	   With the score 40-30 on Italy's serve, Sanguinetti and Nargiso
nearly collided under a floating lob and Sanguinetti swung and
missed. A Sanguinetti error and a well-placed Bjorkman lob over the
Italians rooted at the net gave Sweden a break and a 5-1 lead.
	   ``We were always a step ahead of them,'' Bjorkman said.
	   Gaudenzi's retirement raised the question of whether Bertolucci
erred in deciding to go with a player who had shoulder surgery in
October. Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy beat
the United States in the cup semifinals in September. He had
surgery in October.
	   Norman officially downed Gaudenzi by the score of 6-7 (9-11),
7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0) in an error-strewn match.
Gustafsson overpowered Sanguinetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-0.
	   With the outcome decided, Sunday's reverse singles matches will
be shortened to best-of-3 sets.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Giovanni Soldini and his yacht
FILA led a fleet of 13 boats toward New Zealand on Saturday as the
Around Alone sailors began their second leg of the global regatta.
	   Westerly winds between 10-to-15 knots pushed the boats out of
Table Bay under overcast skies and started them on their
11,200-kilomter (7,000-mile) voyage to Auckland, which will
including the churning waters of the Roaring Forties _ below 40
degrees south latitude.
	   Mike Golding of Britain won the first leg by a 2 1-2-hour
margin, arriving in Cape Town on Oct. 31 after 34 days at sea.
	   The second- and third-place finishers were Isabelle Autissier
and Marc Thiercelin, both of France.
	   The racers left Charleston, South Carolina, on Sept. 27, heading
from the east coast of the United States to Cape Town. The racers
will also stop at Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to
Charleston next spring.
	   Two competitors, Robin Davie and Fedor Konioukhov, remained in
Cape Town sorting out final repairs. Davie, 47, of Charleston, is
in the last stages of fitting a new rudder to his 15-meter
(50-foot) yacht South Carolina.
	   He is expected to get underway Monday.
	   Konioukhov's 18-meter (60-foot) Modern University for the
Humanities boat needs to sort of problems with his keel-bolt issues
and water-ballast. The Russian also hopes to leave Monday.
	   Soldini started the leg nearly three days in elapsed time behind
Golding, and knows that he must win or place highly on this leg if
he stands any realistic chance of winning the race, formerly known
as the BOC Challenge and which is held every four years.

	   Details of Premier League games:
 &UR; Aston Villa 1, Manchester United 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   United striker Dwight Yorke returned to Villa Park where he had
spent nine seasons before transfering to the Reds for 12.6 million
(20.9 million) in August. Most of the Villa fans cheered him before
the kickoff but then booed him every time he touched the ball.
	   Paul Scholes scored his seventh of the season two minutes after
half time when Villa goalkeeper Michael Oakes palmed a cross from
Andy Cole into his path. Julian Joachim equalized seven minutes
later with a 20-meter shot that struck the boot of United defender
Dennis Irwin and looped over the head of goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel.
 &UR; Blackburn 1 Charlton 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Kevin Davies' 75th minute goal had a huge element of luck, the
ball rebounding to him after team-mate David Dunn had been tackled,
and his shot squirming through the hands of Charlton goalkeeper
Sasa Ilic.
 &UR; Derby 0 Arsenal 0 &QC; 
	   With Dennis Bergkamp, Tony Adams, Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel
Petit among those missing, Arsenal again failed to set up chances
at Pride Park although Derby's Estonian goalkeeper, Mort Poom, made
good saves from Nicolas Anelka and Ray Parlour.
 &UR; Everton 0 Chelsea 0 &QC; 
	   Just back from suspension, Chelsea midfielder Dennis Wise was
sent off eight minutes before half time for two yellow cards, both
issued for late tackles on Danny Cadamarteri and Marco Materazzi.
In a low quality game Everton's Irish international defender
Richard Dunne was also sent off for a second yellow 14 minutes from
the end.
 &UR; Leeds 4 West Ham 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Lee Bowyer curled a 20-meter shot into the net in the eighth
minute after a poor clearance by Hammers' Chilean defender Javier
Margas. The England Under-21 midfielder made it 2-0 in the 61st
minute with another distance shot from a layoff by Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink. Seven minutes later Robert Molenaar fired in the third
and, after Neil Ruddock had been sent off for a crude foul on Harry
Kewell, Hasselbaink hit the fourth from 20 meters with his sixth
goal in five games. The Hammers haven't won at Leeds since 1978.
 &UR; Leicester 2 Southampton 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Emile Heskey took a pass from Neil Lennon to fire his eighth
goal of the season in the 61st minute. Two minutes later Saints
goalkeeper Paul Jones punched a Steve Guppy cross against the back
of Leicester defender Steve Walsh and the ball rebounded back into
the net.
 &UR; Tottenham 2 Liverpool 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Ruel Fox fired Spurs' first in the 26th minute when his shot was
deflected into the net off Robbie Fowler following a corner. A
Jamie Carragher own goal made it 2-0 in the 50th when he sliced
Chris Armstrong's cross into his own net. Patrik Berger replied for
Liverpool five minutes later with a free kick.
 &UR; Wimbledon 2 Coventry 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Gary McAllister fired the Sky Blues ahead from the penalty spot
in the 64th minute after Chris Perry's foul on Darren Huckerby.
Seven minutes later Jason Euell equalized after controlling a pass
from Ben Thatcher and shooting home from close range. Euell got the
winner seven minutes from the end with another short-range shot

Caribbean leaders urge Haiti to resolve leadership crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A Caribbean Community delegation will
visit Haiti Monday and add its voice to international calls for a
resolution to Haiti's 18-month-old leadership crisis.
	   Caribbean Community Chairman and St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny
Anthony will lead the delegation on a two-day visit to Haiti, which
is supposed to be the organization's newest and most populous
member. Haiti joined in July of last year, but Secretary General
Edwin Carrington said the country cannot fully participate because
of its virtually paralyzed government.
	   Since June 1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned in
protest over elections allegedly slanted in favor of allies of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the power struggle between
Smarth's majority party and Aristide's parliamentary allies has
blocked installation of a new premier.
	   President Rene Preval has submitted four names to the Haitian
legislature over the past year and a half, but has been unable to
win confirmation of any of the candidates.
	   The standoff has frozen legislation and prevented passage of a
government budget for two consecutive years. Foreign investors have
shied away and millions of dollars in foreign aid are being
withheld.
	   ``We do not wish to butt into their affairs, as it were, but we
want to encourage them as Caribbean brothers and sisters to settle
this,'' Carrington said.
	   Anthony and the rest of the delegation hope to meet with Haitian
parliamentary officials and members of the business community.
	   With its population of more than seven million, Haiti has more
people than the other 14 Community nations combined.
Creole-speaking Haiti and Dutch-speaking Suriname are the only
non-English-speaking member nations.

England wins 13-7 to end Springboks' record bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TWICKENHAM, England (AP) _ The South African world champions
failed in a bid to complete a world record 18 wins in a row when
they lost 13-7 to England at Twickenham Saturday.
	   The Springboks squandered an early 7-0 lead with Pieter
Roussow's try as England produced its best performance for a year
by replying with a Jeremy Guscott try and two penalties and a
conversion by Matt Dawson.
	   The Springboks, who had beaten Wales, Scotland and Ireland on
their European tour, were outplayed in the pack and were unable to
get past the English defense despite a long period of pressure
early in the second half.
	   Instead they tie New Zealand's mark of 17 wins in a row set
between 1965-69.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned we are still the best team in the
world,'' said beaten South African captain Gary Teichmann.
	   ``Our record speaks for itself. We won 17 games before today and
this team still has to reach its full potential.
	   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the best is yet to come.
We've got a six-month break now and we will be back stronger than
ever.''
	   England captain Lawrence Dallaglio saluted his team for a
standout performance that looked unlikely to happen after poor
showings against Italy and Australia and heavy losses during the
summer.
	   ``We have worked so hard over the last four weeks to get this
result,'' Dallaglio said. ``The belief of the squad was that we
were going to get it today. Everyone on the field did their country
proud.''
	   Dawson, a controversial choice as kicker, was one of the stars
of the British Lions squad who won a test series in South Africa
last year.
	   ``It was the most fantastic game to play in an England shirt,''
the scrum half said. ``We knew this was the hardest game in world
rugby and to win it means so much.
	   ``This has to be on a par with the victories on the Lions tour.
To beat the world champions at Twickenham is very special.''
	   Roussow's try, his 18th in 23 tests, came after nine minutes.
	   A long pass by back row Bobby Skinstad found the winger in
plenty of space. Roussow ran at England's Nick Beal and swerved
around the fullback before racing 25 meters for the line.
	   He crossed in the corner, giving Percy Montgomery a difficult
kick from wide on the left but the left-footed kicked sent the ball
over for the conversion and South Africa lead 7-0.
	   After a spell of strong English pressure in which the Springboks
conceded three penalties close to their pown posts, Mike Catt
kicked high to the corner. Winger Dan Luger caught the ball under
pressure from Stefan Terblanche and fed it to the supporting
Guscott who ran over for the score. Guscott also scored a try
against Australia last week in a 12-11 loss.
	   Dawson kicked the conversion and the score was level after 12
minutes.
	   With their rampant forwards overpowering the Springbok pack, the
English ignored two chances to take the lead with two close range
penalties and opted for setting up try-scoring opportunities.
	   But the South Africans, regarded as the finest defensive team in
the world, kept them out and had the chance to regain the lead deep
into first half injury time only for Montgomery to kick his penalty
wide.
	   The South Africans looked far more like a world champion team
early in the second half with forwards and backs linking up well to
stretch the English defense in front of the posts.
	   Skinstad, center Andre Snyman, winger Terblanche and hooker
James Dalton were all halted by solid English tackles before the
home team finally got out their own quarter of the field.
	   When the South Africans were penalized at a maul, England at
last decided to kick for goal from 26 meters. But scrum half
Dawson, chosen instead of Catt to take the kicks, pulled the simple
penalty attempt wide to the groans of the home fans.
	   There was a blow to the Springboks 20 minutes from the end when
scrum half Joost van der Westhuizen, making his 50th international
appearance, was helped off with a leg injury. England meanwhile
were forced during the match to make three changes in the backs,
losing two wingers, Tony Underwood and David Rees and center Phil
de Glanville with Catt moving from fly half to center.
	   When Skinstad was penalized 30 meters from his own posts, Dawson
had another chance to put England ahead and this time he got it
right and the home team led 10-7 with 16 minutes to go.
	   And the Northampton scrum half came up with a brilliant follow
up kick from 40 meters five minutes later to stretch the lead to
six points.
	   The two scores brough a big response from the Springboks but
Montgomery amazingly missed a close range penalty from in front of
the posts with seven minutes to go and South Africa still needed a
converted try to win the match.
	   They almost got it in the third minute of injury time when
England was penalized in a maul close to the South African line.
	   Johan Erasmus' quick tap penalty set up a charge down the field
which ended when Snyman dropped the ball within 30 meters of the
England line with the home defense struggling to get back.

Nobel winner Esquivel sees logic of U.S attitude toward LatAm
</HEADLINE>
dictators &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo
Perez-Esquivel said Saturday that the U.S. at least took a
consistent political stance in supporting Latin American dictators
in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   ``Even the interventionism of the CIA in torture methods and the
disappearance of people cannot be called an error, but it was part
of a political decision,'' said Perez-Esquivel, 66, who opposed the
military dictatorship in his native Argentina and won the Nobel
Prize in 1980.
	   And now, ``it is healthy that the U.S government is modifying
its behavior with regard to the Chilean and Argentine
dictatorships,'' Esquivel told reporters after attending the Forum
on Human Rights in Barcelona.
	   He was responding to comments Friday by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who said that U.S. involvement with Latin
American dictators was a terrible mistake.
	   Esquivel also said that the U.S bears some responsibility for
any crimes committed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet during his 1973-90
rule, because the U.S military helped train Chile's army and aided
Pinochet's ascent to power.
	   Pinochet's detention in Britain and efforts to extradite him to
Spain for trial on genocide charges led the U.S. government to
declassify secret files on abuses under his regime, files that
could embarrass the United States by showing that it put the fight
against leftists ahead of human rights.
	   Esquivel said he hoped that the British government would yield
up the 83-year-old Pinochet for trial.
	   ``Pinochet was never a head of state,'' Esquivel said. ``He is a
power usurper who overthrew a constitutional government and
massacred people.''
	   Esquivel himself was arrested in 1977 and tortured for opposing
the Argentine army's 1976 coup d'etat, then spent 14 months in jail
and another 14 months under house arrest.

World Cup: Scotland wins 85-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Winger Kenny Logan scored five of his
team's 13 tries as Scotland crushed Spain 85-3 in a World Cup
qualifying game Saturday.
	   The Scots, badly in need of morale boosting performances before
the Five Nations starts early next year, matched the total it
scored against Portugal last week.
	   New Zealand-born brothers John and Martin Leslie, Tom Smith,
Bryan Redpath and Gregor Townsend all crossed the Spanish line
before half time at Murrayfield and there were more tries from
Shaun Longstaff, Cammie Murray, and Doddie Weir after the break.
	   Fly half Duncan Hodge kicked 10 conversions while the only
Spanish score was a first half penalty by fly half Andrei
Kovalenko.
	   Despite the loss the Spaniards also are sure of a place in next
October's finals after beating Portugal in an earlier group game.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hundreds of fans went on the rampage
Saturday before and after a soccer match between defending champion
Olympiakos Piraeus and archrival Panathinaikos Athens.
	   Private Mega television showed fans smashing cars, attacking
policemen and ripping up seats inside Athens' Olympic Stadium.
	   At least ten people were injured in the violence, including a
police motorcyclist and passengers in a taxi who were pulled out
and beaten while the cab was smashed and looted, reports said.
	   No arrests were reported.
	   Olympiakos won the tense game 4-2, coming back from an early two
goal deficit.

Turkey seeks better ties with Syria, thanks Egypt for mediation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS with quotes with Turkish president after meeting
Mubarak &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel said Saturday
that Turkey was ready for a new start in relations with Syria after
Syria's expulsion of a Turkish Kurdish rebel leader.
	   ``Now, we want to clear the remnants of the past incidents and
start a new era between Turkey and Syria,'' said Demirel after
talks with visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who helped
mediate a crisis between Ankara and Damascus over the Kurdish
rebels.
	   The crisis ended in October when Syria signed a security
cooperation deal with Turkey and ousted Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan. Turkey had threatened military action against
Syria unless it stopped its alleged sheltering of Turkish Kurdish
rebels.
	   Demirel called Saturday for better implementation of the
Turkey-Syria security agreement and said it was too soon to talk
about a meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Hafez Assad. Turkey
remains uneasy about Syria's reluctance to expel all Kurdish
rebels.
	   Mubarak told Turkey's Milliyet daily earlier this week that his
mediation prevented a war _ and said the Arab world would have been
on Syria's side.
	   Demirel thanked Mubarak for his peacemaking.
	   Turkey, although predominantly Muslim, has had tense relations
with the Arab world because of Turkey's economic and military
cooperation with Israel. Demirel called all Arab countries
``brothers'' of Turkey and said the cooperation with Israel does
not threaten any country.
	   ``We want to see the development of strong, constructive and
productive ties between Turkey and Arab countries,'' Mubarak said.
	   Meanwhile Saturday, Syria and Iraq signaled an alliance in
another dispute involving Turkey: sharing the waters of the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers, which originate in Turkey's Anatolia
region.
	   ``We want to reach an agreement that guarantees the three
countries' needs. There should be certain principles so that we can
use water in a logical way and not randomly,'' Syrian Irrigation
Minister Abdul-Rahman Al-Madani said.
	   Turkey has been refusing to discuss the water issue unless Syria
ended its support to the Kurdish rebels.

Caribbean leaders urge Haiti to resolve leadership crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A Caribbean Community delegation is
adding its voice to international calls for a resolution to Haiti's
18-month-old leadership crisis.
	   Caribbean Community Chairman and St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny
Anthony were to lead a delegation Monday on a two-day visit to
Haiti, which is supposed to be the organization's newest and most
populous member. Haiti joined in July 1997, but Secretary General
Edwin Carrington said the country cannot fully participate because
of its virtually paralyzed government.
	   ``We do not wish to butt into their affairs, as it were, but we
want to encourage them as Caribbean brothers and sisters to settle
this,'' Carrington said.
	   Since June 1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned in
protest over elections allegedly slanted in favor of allies of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the power struggle between
Smarth's majority party and Aristide's parliamentary allies has
blocked installation of a new premier.
	   President Rene Preval has submitted four names to the Haitian
legislature over the past year and a half, but has been unable to
win confirmation of any of the candidates.
	   The standoff has frozen legislation and prevented passage of a
budget for two consecutive years. Foreign investors have shied away
and millions of dollars in foreign aid are being withheld.
	   Anthony and the rest of the delegation hope to meet with Haitian
parliamentary officials and members of the business community.
	   With its population of more than 7 million, Haiti has more
people than the other 14 Community nations combined.
Creole-speaking Haiti and Dutch-speaking Suriname are the only
non-English-speaking member nations.

Poll: Only 30 percent of Germans satisfied with new chancellor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ More than half of Germans are dissatisfied
with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his government after their
first four weeks in office, a recent poll found.
	   Thirty percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied with
the new government; 54 percent said they were not; and 16 percent
said it was too soon to decide, according to a poll reported Friday
by the radio station Westdeutscher Rundfunk.
	   That puts Schroeder's approval rating lower than previous
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whom Schroeder and his party of Social
Democrats defeated in elections Sept. 27.
	   Shortly before the vote, polling found that 68 percent of
Germans were satisfied with Kohl and 31 percent were not, the
station reported.
	   The poll reported Friday questioned 1,300 people between Nov. 26
and Dec. 1. It gave no margin of error, but polls of this size
usually have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage
points.

Monsoon floods kill 39 rare rhinos, 600 other animals in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Floodwaters killed 39 rare one-horned
rhinoceros and more than 600 other animals, including deer and
elephants, this rainy season in a preserve in India's Assam state,
one of the rainiest areas on earth, a state official said Saturday.
	   At least 506 hog deer, 22 wild bear, 15 sambhar deer, 23
buffalo, nine swamp deer, nine porcupines and seven elephants
drowned in the flooding caused by the monsoon rains in the
Kaziranga National Park in eastern India, Assam forest minister
Nagen Sarma was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India.
	   At least 2,500 people were killed in different parts of India
this year in the most devastating floods in decades.
	   The 430 square kilometer (250 square mile) Kaziranga is most
famous as the last major home of the Rhinoceros unicornis, the one
horned rhino. The park is also famous for deer, elephants, tigers,
bears and many water bird species, including the pelican.
	   Sarma said the government had ordered construction of platforms
on high ground and other repair work was underway at Kaziranga to
prevent similar loss of animal life in the future. The Diphaloo
River runs along the reserve's border.
	   Kaziranga is in a remote part of Assam, which experiences some
of the heaviest rainfall on earth.
	   Several rhinos were gunned down by poachers during the floods
when the animals strayed outside the park to escape the floods,
officials say.
	   Rhinos are hunted for their horns, which many people wrongly
believe is an aphrodisiac. Indian law bans killing the rhinos.

Palestinian leader lays out vision of how to negotiate final peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with speech, news conference. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Saturday laid out his vision for final negotiations on Middle East
peace, striking a notably conciliatory tone but avoiding specifics
on the issues that have stalled the current peace process.
	   Referring frequently to ''the logic of peace,'' Arafat said both
Palestinians and Israel must refrain from violence.
	   ''There can be no alternative to resolving the disputed issues
between the two sides except through negotiations,'' he said, and
cautioned against ''unilateral actions that may threaten or
undermine the outcome of the negotiations.''
	   He appeared to tone down the possible Palestinian unilateral
action that especially concerns Israel _ the question of whether
Arafat intends to declare an independent Palestinian state on May
4, the end of the five-year interim period set forth in the Oslo
Accord Israel-PLO peace deal.
	   ''Every effort (must) be made to reach an agreement and to
delineate the borders of the Palestinian State before May 4,
1999,'' Arafat said.
	   Asked later if that statement and its emphasis on negotiation
meant he was backing off on intentions to declare a state in May,
Arafat sparred ''Did I give ultimatums before?''
	   Israel this month suspended troop withdrawals from the West Bank
that are called for under the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, demanding
that Arafat publicly state that he will not declare an independent
Palestinian state.
	   The official purpose of Arafat's trip was to attend a meeting
commemorating the 10th anniversary of his statement in Stockholm of
support for U.N. resolutions recognizing Israel's right to exist.
	   Israel was represented at the meeting by Yossi Beilin, one of
the architects of the Oslo peace accord, and by Meir Sheetrit, the
parliamentary whip for the governing Likud coalition.
	   Beilin, of the opposition Labor Party, expressed concern that
many issues need to be worked out in the less than six months
remaining before the end of the interim phase of the peace
agreement.
	   He suggested a possible compromise on the independence issue,
proposing that the Palestinians might wait until 2001 for
independence in exchange for Israel agreeing to withdraw from a
larger amount of territory than is currently called for. But he
admitted he believed neither the Palestinians nor the Israeli
government would find that acceptable.
	   ''It would be difficult for the Pslestinians to extend the five
years'' they have already waited, he said.
	   Israel also says it will not resume troop withdrawals unless
Palestinian authorities accept Israeli criteria for prisoner
releases. The Wye agreement calls for the release of 750
Palestinian prisoners; about 250 have been freed so far and
Palestinians complain that most of those released were criminals
rather than political prisoners.
	   The United States on Friday said it believed Israel was living
up to the terms of the Wye agreement. Arafat did not comment on the
U.S. statement.
	   But stone-throwing clashes erupted near three West Bank towns on
Saturday as Palestinians stepped up demands for the release of more
political prisoners.
	   With those clashes, and the ambush beating of a soldier this
week that prompted Israel to suspend the troop withdrawals, the
brief period of optimism after the Wye accord has deteriorated.
	   Arafat originally had planned to go to Oslo, Norway, on Sunday
but has cancelled that leg of his Scandinavian trip, apparently
concerned that tensions were spiraling just a week before the
planned visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton.

McEnroe beats Leconte, says he wants to play Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe breezed into the final of the ATP
Seniors at Olympia Saturday with a seemingly effortless 6-4, 6-2
victory over Henri Leconte Saturday and then offered his services
as a Davis Cup doubles player.
	   McEnroe, who will meet another Frenchman, Yannick Noah, in
Sunday's final, said he would like to team up with Pete Sampras in
next April's Davis Cup World Group match against Britain
	   ``I'm in shape and, if seven other guys can't make it, I'm
ready,'' he said. ``Mind you, I'm not holding my breath. But that
doesn't mean that I don't know in my heart that I'm better than the
guys who've been playing doubles since I stopped playing.''
	   McEnroe doubts, however, whether Sampras would be interested in
the idea.
	   ``I don't think he's very interested in playing either singles
or doubles,'' he said.
	   ``He played some good doubles in 1992 when we played together
against Sweden and Switzerland and we won the Cup. But if I never
play Davis Cup again I've got some great memories.
	   ``I played my first Cup singles against Britain in the 1978
final, and my last match was when I played doubles and we won the
Cup in 1992.''
	   That also was the year when McEnroe, then age 33, teamed up with
Germany's Michael Stich to win the Wimbledon doubles title.
	   The ATP Seniors looks like being McEnroe's fifth tournament win
in a row.
	   The championship is played in two, round-robin groups and
McEnroe has cruised through straight set victories over Guillermo
Vilas, Mansour Bahrami of Iran and now Leconte to make it 19 wins
in a row.
	   Before Saturday's match, he was presented with the Senior Player
of the Year award, having won seven of his 11 tournaments this
year. McEnroe is 900 points ahead of second-placed Jimmy Connors in
the ranking list.
	   Connors did not play this week and five-time Wimbledon champion
Bjorn Borg dropped out through injury.
	   A third Frenchman in the competition, Guy Forget, downed Pat
Cash 7-5, 6-7 (7-3), 10-8.

U.S. military helping Colombia as rebel threat grows

	   TUMACO, Colombia (AP) _ Chided by his U.S. Green Beret
instructor, a Colombian corporal returns to the firing range after
putting a bandage on a thumb worn raw by clicking the safety of his
M-16 rifle on and off.
	   ``Are we OK, little girl?'' asks Staff Sgt. Juan Estay.
	   Estay, a 34-year-old from Miami, is one of eight U.S. Army
Special Forces soldiers running a six-week training course in this
Pacific jungle port. Such exercises are key instruments of U.S.
policy to bolster Colombia's armed forces in their uphill struggle
against highly effective, well-disciplined rebels.
	   The U.S. trainers are highly esteemed by their 30 Colombian
pupils _ six marine officers and 24 senior enlisted marines. After
a run-and-shoot competition that culminates marksmanship practice,
the Colombian contingent's chief, Capt. Eduardo Chavez, shows his
appreciation by hugging Master Sgt. Mike Wood, 34, of St. Louis.
	   Such training is central to a gradually intensifying U.S.
military involvement in Colombia encouraged by the government of
President Andres Pastrana, who took office in August.
	   During a visit to Colombia this past week, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen signed an accord pledging to increase
intelligence support and provide more training.
	   Officially, Washington classifies the military instructor
missions as counternarcotics training, one ingredient in a
decade-old U.S. effort to combat drug trafficking in Colombia, the
world's No. 1 cocaine-producing nation.
	   In practice, the Green Berets from the 7th Special Forces group
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are teaching skills the Colombian
military needs to fight its main foe: the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia. The rebel movement, the hemisphere's oldest and
largest leftist insurgency, has for the past three years been
pummeling an army comprised largely of ill-prepared conscripts.
	   The six-week course in Tumaco focuses on basic light-infantry
skills, including helicopter-borne operations, riverine
infiltration, explosives use and ambush techniques. U.S. trainers
provided 60,000 rounds of ammunition, three Zodiac inflatable boats
and, for one week, two Blackhawk helicopters.
	   ``It's counterguerrilla training,'' said Col. Juan Diego Rendon,
deputy commander of the Colombian army's 12th Brigade, whose
counterinsurgency battalion now has 150 soldiers being trained by a
second team of Green Berets in the rebel-dominated southern state
of Caqueta.
	   Nowadays in Colombia, it's hard to fight narcotics without
taking on the rebels, who finance themselves largely by taxing the
drug trade and protecting cocaine laboratories and airstrips.
	   The Pentagon put on a dozen Special Forces training courses in
Colombia this year and officials say 14 are scheduled for 1999,
roughly half the overall U.S. ``counterdrug'' training missions in
the country.
	   Over the past two years, U.S. assistance to the Colombian
military has included hundreds of M-16 rifles and M-60 machine
guns, flak jackets, ammunition, night-vision goggles and trucks.
	   The United States is also working on establishing a high-tech
joint intelligence center in southern Colombia, where U.S.
specialists would provide the Colombian military almost immediately
with information from satellites and spy planes, officials say.
	   In addition, Washington has offered to help train and equip an
anti-narcotics battalion, expected to be formed by mid-1999 and
composed of 1,000 soldiers and police officers. Currently, no
Colombian military unit is devoted exclusively, or even primarily,
to drug enforcement.
	   ``Our assistance is provided to combat narcotics production and
trafficking and may be used to counter all those who are actively
involved in the drug trade,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said Tuesday.
	   The American involvement remains a far cry, though, from its
multibillion-dollar help for Central American nations fighting
leftist insurgencies during the 1980s, and it operates within
strict limits.
	   ``We have neither the money nor the appetite to do any great
ramp-up,'' Brian Sheridan, a U.S. Defense Department official
involved in special operations and low intensity conflict, said in
an interview.
	   The number of American military personnel in Colombia never
exceeds 200, U.S. officials say, and American soldiers are not
permitted to accompany Colombian troops into combat.
	   The Colombian government knows that if it is to be successful in
peace talks it is trying to launch with the rebels, it needs a few
battlefield victories, and increased U.S. military aid could be a
decisive factor.
	   ``We are hoping for more help. We need it. Definitely, we do
need it,'' Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said in an interview.
	   A bigger U.S. role faces considerable obstacles, however.
	   Colombia's military has a poor human rights record and two U.S.
laws sponsored by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Democrat and
enacted since 1996 allow U.S. military aid and training only for
Colombian units whose human rights records are clean. So far, only
three units of the army, the service most engaged in fighting
rebels, have cleared the screening process.

TUMACO, Colombia: screening process.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Senior army officers have been accused of promoting right-wing
paramilitary groups that kill civilians suspected of supporting the
guerrillas. The military's main intelligence brigade, dissolved in
May, was implicated in a series of death-squad killings and its
former commander, now a fugitive, is wanted for allegedly
organizing the 1995 assassination of Colombia's main opposition
leader.
	   Largely because of human rights concerns, Colombia's military
annually receives less than one-tenth of the more than dlrs 100
million in anti-narcotics assistance provided by Washington. The
bulk goes to Colombia's police, which the U.S. Congress just voted
to give an additional dlrs 200 million over the next three years.
	   The constraints are not discouraging Marine Gen. Charles E.
Wilhelm, chief of the U.S. Southern Command responsible for Latin
America, who has visited what he calls the hemisphere's ``most
threatened country'' just about every other month this year.
	   ``Frustration is not a course of action for the military,'' the
veteran of two Vietnam tours said of the restrictions in an
interview, adding that he believes the Colombian military deserves
credit for making ``very significant strides on human rights.''
	   At a U.S. congressional hearing last March, Wilhelm listed the
deficiencies of Colombia's military as primarily in ``mobility,
direct attack capabilities, night operations, communications
systems, intelligence systems, the ability to operate in rivers and
coastal regions and the ability to sustain their forces once
committed.''
	   With the guerrillas exploiting those weaknesses in one
devastating attack after another, the temptations for U.S.
personnel to get more involved become harder to resist.
	   After rebels overran an anti-narcotics base in Miraflores on
Aug. 3, American civilian helicopter pilots contracted by the State
Department for the aerial eradication of drug crops flew
search-and-rescue missions for Colombian soldiers and police _
operations that could easily have put them in the line of fire,
officials say.
	   Soldiers of fortune have also gotten into the action. A former
U.S. Army warrant officer, Nilo Bernier, hired by the Colombian
military to train helicopter pilots, suffered two bullet wounds in
late August when he landed a chopper in a combat zone to evacuate
wounded soldiers.

	   TUMACO, Colombia (AP) _ Training is poor. Helicopters are
scarce. Communications are rudimentary. Officers are in short
supply. Many recruits can barely read and write.
	   And good morale is a rare commodity.
	   Capt. Eduardo Chavez, a 30-year-old marine company commander,
ticks off the troubling deficiencies of his nation's armed forces
after a day of training with U.S. Army Green Berets.
	   ``Our military has got big problems. We're in pieces,'' says
Chavez, a career officer so worried about the armed forces'
shortcomings he was willing to put his criticisms on the record.
	   While Colombia's 120,000-member military fights to maintain
political support for its dlrs 3.7 billion budget, the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia has grown rich.
	   Deprived of outside support after the Soviet bloc's collapse,
the rebels now rake in a half billion dollars a year protecting
drug crops and cocaine laboratories and tens of millions more from
kidnappings and extortion, the government estimates.
	   The 2,000-man marine battalion based in Tumaco, a jungle fishing
port, is supposed to keep the peace along 3,800 square miles (9,800
square kilometers) of Colombia's southern Pacific coast _ a stretch
veined with rivers and thick with mangroves, rife with gunrunning
rebels, drug smugglers and pirates who murder fishermen for their
outboard engines.
	   For the past 12 months, the battalion has operated without a
single patrol boat, forced to pursue guerrillas in rented private
launches used by the locals for regular transportation.
	   Lt. Col. Francisco Chilito, the 2nd Battalion commander, says he
could really use a helicopter, noting it can take his men five
hours to get somewhere by water when a chopper could make it in 20
minutes.
	   Colombia's armed forces have fewer than 50 helicopters, most of
them dedicated to southeastern regions where combat with guerrillas
is most frequent and fierce.
	   The former commander of the army's 2nd Mobile Brigade, Gen.
Carlos Ospina, developed a bleeding ulcer from worrying when his
troops got pinned down by rebels and he knew he couldn't fly them
out.
	   ``He got tired of listening to them screaming in agony over the
radio when they were getting shot up,'' said a Green Beret who
worked with Ospina in 1996 and spoke on condition he not be further
identified.
	   Colombia's soldiers often have trouble even getting the basics.
``These guys go into combat in rubber boots without socks,'' the
Green Beret said.
	   While Colombian soldiers rely on radios with a range of just six
miles (10 kilometers), the better trained and equipped rebels stay
in touch with satellite radios and even receive e-mail in the bush.
	   ``There are times you go out and you know you're putting
yourselves in God's hands. You're completely out of touch,'' said
Chavez, the company commander.

Right-wing refuge or populist pathfinder? Alberta stands apart in
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ It was only a tongue-in-cheek letter to
a newspaper. But the suggestion to trade the Canadian province of
Alberta to the United States _ perhaps for Minnesota _ got a lot of
Canadians thinking about this idiosyncratic, occasionally
un-Canadian province.
	   Alberta is Canada's oilfield, its cowboy country, headquarters
for its anti-gun-control lobby, stronghold of its right-wing
political movement. In the American West, it might fit in
comfortably; in Canada _ well, Alberta is different.
	   ``Albertans feel good about Alberta,'' said Thomas Flanagan,
political science professor at the University of Calgary. ``If we
can just be left alone to run our own affairs, and be taxed as
little as possible, we'll be fine.''
	   The Toronto-based Globe and Mail, which circulates across
Canada, recently published a letter from Toronto reader John Firth,
who bemoaned the Alberta government's opposition to gun control and
its reluctance to embrace gay rights.
	   ``Clearly the time has come to expel this right-wing cuckoo from
the Canadian nest,'' wrote Firth, who proposed trading the province
to the United States for ``one of the more civilized border
states'' _ preferably Minnesota or Vermont.
	   Dozens of letters have flowed to the Globe and Mail in response,
some accusing it of disseminating hate literature, and almost all
of it defending Alberta.
	   Rather than expel Alberta, why not send Ottawa-based federal
politicians and bureaucrats to Alberta, reader Jack Tate suggested.
``Both the country and they would benefit from their exposure to
clear mountain air and clear thinking.''
	   But Melanie Anderson, part of Alberta's left-of-center minority
and head of its Planned Parenthood chapter in Calgary, says critics
of the province are on target.
	   ``Other Canadians do look at Alberta as being very redneck, and
unfortunately I'd have to agree with them,'' she said. ``To tell
the truth, it's very embarrassing to be from Alberta when you go to
a national conference.''
	   At the moment, Alberta ranks as Canada's most conservative
province and its most prosperous. Many Albertans would link those
two achievements.
	   Among Alberta's distinctions:
	   _It is the only province with no sales tax.
	   _It is the bastion of the right-wing Reform Party, now the
largest opposition faction in Parliament. The governing Liberal
Party can claim reasonable support almost everywhere else in
Canada; in Alberta, it won one seat in last year's national
election while Reform won the other 25.
	   _Alberta initiated a legal challenge to federal gun control
legislation that will require registration of all 7 million
firearms in Canada. Three other provinces joined the suit, which is
likely to reach Canada's Supreme Court.
	   _Alberta has been a pioneer in providing public funds to private
schools, several of them run by conservative Christian churches.
	   _It implemented a no-frills policy at its jails _ rationing
toilet paper, removing pool tables, eliminating bacon from
breakfast menus _ that prompted one offender to request a 24-month
term in a federal prison rather than 15 months in an Alberta jail.
	   _It is crusading for radical reform of Canada's largely impotent
Senate, saying members should be elected rather than appointed by
the prime minister. In October, the province elected two
``senators-in-waiting'' to fill Alberta seats in the chamber
whenever the rest of the country wises up.
	   _Alone among the provinces, Alberta waged a long legal battle
against offering specific protection to homosexuals in its human
rights code. The Supreme Court ruled against the province in April,
rejecting its claim that the issue should be decided by
politicians, not judges.
	   Murray Billett, an Alberta activist involved in the campaign to
bolster gay rights, said the provincial government has complied
with the high court ruling only grudgingly and is studying ways to
limit homosexual rights in other areas.
	   ``This is a province that was 20 years behind the times, guilty
of state-sanctioned discrimination,'' he said. ``It's a time to be
mending fences, not building them. But look what they continue to
do.''
	   Flanagan, the University of Calgary professor, says Alberta's
unique political character dates back more than a century, when
early settlers included ranchers and Mormons from the United
States.
	   While most of English-speaking Canada was entrenching British
parliamentary traditions, Alberta was influenced by American
populist ideas, Flanagan said. More so than the rest of Canada, it
believes in voter-initiated ballot proposals and seeks politicians
who are more loyal to their constituents than their parties, he
said.
	   Those traditions have been strengthened by the boom in Alberta's
energy industry. Oil and gas companies are constantly moving
personnel and ideas across the U.S.-Canadian border, while seeking
a low-tax, low-regulation political climate that might not mesh
with the interests of eastern Canada.
	   Alberta's popular premier, Ralph Klein, was the first major
political leader in Canada to mobilize public support for slashing
budget deficits. His efforts starting in 1993 have led to a huge
budget surplus for Alberta, while prompting copycat budget-cutting
by the federal government and most other provinces.
	   Now, says Flanagan, Albertans see themselves as economic
victims, sacrificing part of their prosperity so federal
authorities can finance welfare and social programs in less
affluent provinces.
	   ``The frustration leads to occasional spasms of separatism,''
Flanagan said. ``But actually, we have been making considerable
progress. ... Through the Reform Party, we've been having an effect
on what happens in Ottawa.''
	   Billett, the liberal political activist, who has lived and
worked in most of Canada's other provinces, finds Alberta a
stimulating challenge.
	   ``Alberta is slowly coming along,'' he said. ``I take great
pride in being part of the process of making them understand the
realities of the diversity that is here.''

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ No mercy.
	   With two singles wins already in hand and opponent Italy reduced
to a makeshift lineup because of injury, Sweden pounded out a
methodical straight-set doubles victory Saturday to clinch its
third Davis Cup title in five years.
	   Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti toyed briefly with Italy's
Diego Nargiso and stand-in Davide Sanguinetti before shifting into
overdrive for the 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, 6-3 triumph.
	   It gave the defending champions an insurmountable 3-0 lead in
the best-of-5 series. Sunday's singles matches, now academic, will
be reduced to three sets.
	   ``This one isn't nicer, it's just different. We never get
satisfied with winning,'' Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hogeskog said.
``It's a nice feeling and we want it more and more.''
	   Italy's chances for its first Davis Cup trophy since 1976 were
compromised in Friday's opening match when Andrea Gaudenzi retired
with a strained shoulder tendon at 6-6 in the fifth set of a
five-hour ordeal against Sweden's Magnus Norman.
	   Gaudenzi, Nargiso's regular doubles partner, had surgery on the
shoulder in October and had not played an official match since
helping upset the United States in the semifinals.
	   ``Andrea's injury made all our plans go up in smoke,'' said
Italian captain Paolo Bertolucci, whose contract is up.
	   Even the crowd seemed resigned.
	   Hosting a Davis Cup final for the first time, Italy had counted
on its notoriously boisterous fans to provide an edge.
	   But the 12,000 spectators at the sold-out Assago Forum went
eerily silent during portions of the doubles match, and even turned
on their own in the latter stages _ jeering and whistling
derisively after some of the Italians' unforced errors, of which
there were many.
	   When Sanguinetti mis-timed a backhand and sent the ball flying
into the seats in the third set, someone screamed, ``Andrea would
have won this for us.''
	   He probably at least would have helped put up a better fight.
After extending the first set to a tiebreaker, Italy lost 41 of the
ensuing 53 points.
	   ``We moved up another level in that tiebreaker,'' Bjorkman said,
``and we were in control from there. We were always a step ahead of
them.''
	   Nargiso and Sanguinetti were rarely in synch, and nearly
collided under a floating lob that Sanguinetti whiffed on a key
point midway through the second set.
	   Adding insult to injury for Sanguinetti, his wallet and cellular
phone were stolen from a courtside racket bag during the post-match
confusion when the Swedish team and some spectators ran onto the
court to celebrate.
	   Asked if he expected to steamroll the hosts, Hageskog smiled.
``Yes, of course, because I have very good players and I trust
them,'' he said. ``I knew we are good enough to win all five
matches.''

African bank chief says Sudan will pay debt on bombed factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's government has promised to pay a
debt incurred by a factory destroyed by U.S. missiles in August,
the head of an African development bank said Saturday.
	   The El-Shifa pharmaceutical plant owed the Eastern and Southern
African Trade and Development Bank, also known as the PTA Bank,
dlrs 5.7 million, the bank's chairman, Martin Ogang, told
reporters.
	   The United States devastated the factory with cruise missiles on
Aug. 20, saying it manufactured the ingredients of chemical weapons
and was partly owned by Osama bin Laden. Washington alleges bin
Laden is the person behind the Aug. 7 attacks on the U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.
	   Sudan denies that the El-Shifa plant produced chemicals for
weapons and has said it will sue the United States for
compensation.
	   Ogang said his bank was not going to get involved in the
``political issue'' of the factory's destruction.
	   ``We were sorry and shocked as to what happened to El-Shifa. But
we are a financial body. We have to find a way for recovering the
money we paid.''
	   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir ``has assured us Sudan will
find a way for meeting the dues on El-Shifa,'' Ogang said.
	   The PTA Bank's loans to El-Shifa were for the purchase of raw
materials and packaging, he said, adding he was sure the money was
spent as intended.
	   Ogang was speaking at a press conference at the end of a
four-day visit to Sudan. On Saturday he signed three loans totaling
dlrs 6.6 million for the development of a packaging plant, a
milling concern and a gum factory in Sudan.

Palestinian leader lays out vision of how to negotiate final peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTs new fifth graf to ADD quote on independent Palestine
through mutual agreement. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Saturday laid out his vision for final negotiations on Middle East
peace, striking a notably conciliatory tone but avoiding specifics
on the issues that have stalled the current peace process.
	   Referring frequently to ``the logic of peace,'' Arafat said both
Palestinians and Israel must refrain from violence.
	   ``There can be no alternative to resolving the disputed issues
between the two sides except through negotiations,'' he said, and
cautioned against ``unilateral actions that may threaten or
undermine the outcome of the negotiations.''
	   He appeared to tone down the possible Palestinian unilateral
action that especially concerns Israel _ the question of whether
Arafat intends to declare an independent Palestinian state on May
4, the end of the five-year interim period set forth in the Oslo
Accord Israel-PLO peace deal.
	   While insisting on Palestinian independence, Arafat said ''There
can be no just solution without the agreement of the existence of
two states ... coexisting by mutual agreement and acceptance.''
	   ``Every effort (must) be made to reach an agreement and to
delineate the borders of the Palestinian State before May 4,
1999,'' Arafat said.
	   Asked later if that statement and its emphasis on negotiation
meant he was backing off on intentions to declare a state in May,
Arafat sparred ``Did I give ultimatums before?''
	   Israel this month suspended troop withdrawals from the West Bank
that are called for under the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, demanding
that Arafat publicly state that he will not declare an independent
Palestinian state.
	   The official purpose of Arafat's trip was to attend a meeting
commemorating the 10th anniversary of his statement in Stockholm of
support for U.N. resolutions recognizing Israel's right to exist.
	   Israel was represented at the meeting by Yossi Beilin, one of
the architects of the Oslo peace accord, and by Meir Sheetrit, the
parliamentary whip for the governing Likud coalition.
	   Beilin, of the opposition Labor Party, expressed concern that
many issues need to be worked out in the less than six months
remaining before the end of the interim phase of the peace
agreement.
	   He suggested a possible compromise on the independence issue,
proposing that the Palestinians might wait until 2001 for
independence in exchange for Israel agreeing to withdraw from a
larger amount of territory than is currently called for. But he
admitted he believed neither the Palestinians nor the Israeli
government would find that acceptable.
	   ``It would be difficult for the Pslestinians to extend the five
years'' they have already waited, he said.
	   Israel also says it will not resume troop withdrawals unless
Palestinian authorities accept Israeli criteria for prisoner
releases. The Wye agreement calls for the release of 750
Palestinian prisoners; about 250 have been freed so far and
Palestinians complain that most of those released were criminals
rather than political prisoners.
	   The United States on Friday said it believed Israel was living
up to the terms of the Wye agreement. Arafat did not comment on the
U.S. statement.
	   But stone-throwing clashes erupted near three West Bank towns on
Saturday as Palestinians stepped up demands for the release of more
political prisoners.
	   With those clashes, and the ambush beating of a soldier this
week that prompted Israel to suspend the troop withdrawals, the
brief period of optimism after the Wye accord has deteriorated.
	   Arafat originally had planned to go to Oslo, Norway, on Sunday
but has cancelled that leg of his Scandinavian trip, apparently
concerned that tensions were spiraling just a week before the
planned visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton.

No solution in sight for kidnappers on hunger strike in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ After a 20-day hunger strike,
eight convicted kidnappers in Brazil are no closer to freedom than
they were the day they began.
	   The prisoners, who abducted one of Brazil's wealthiest men in
1989, had hoped that their fast would pressure the government into
moves that would mean working outside prison for the Brazilian
among them and expulsion from the country for the five Chileans and
two Argentines. Two Canadians convicted with them were transferred
to a Vancouver prison on Nov. 20.
	   Their protest has received almost daily news media coverage in
Brazil, not only for the wealth of their victim, but also because
of a political aspect to their crime.
	   At their trial, the 10 claimed to be political prisoners because
they belonged to a group that planned to funnel the dlrs 30 million
ransom they were demanding to El Salvador's leftist guerrillas. The
Supreme Court denied their claim, charging them under a harsher
code for common criminals.
	   They were sentenced to between 26 years and 28 years for
abducting Abilio Diniz, the owner of Brazil's largest supermarket
chain. Police freed him unharmed six days later.
	   The kidnappers argue that they are now eligible for work-release
since they have already served one-sixth of their time and are
first-time offenders, and that the authorities are keeping them in
jail because they committed a political crime against a very
influential person.
	   On Friday, a Sao Paulo court refused to place two of the
kidnappers in a work-release program. Three others were previously
denied early release. Work-release would trigger the
non-Brazilians' expulsion.
	   The murderers of soap opera star Daniella Perez and
environmentalist-martyr Chico Mendes received lesser sentences, and
one of Perez's killers is on work-release, noted Breno Altman,
president of the Committee to Free Political Prisoners.
	   ``We no longer have any faith that the judicial system will
resolve their case,'' Altman said Saturday. ``Only President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso can save them now.''
	   Cardoso has given no indication that he will intervene.
	   Public sentiment is about evenly divided between those who say
the prisoners have suffered enough and those who think their
release would set a dangerous precedent.
	   The eight, who say they prefer to die rather than return to
their cells at Sao Paulo's Carandiru Prison, remain conscious and
lucid and have improved slightly since modifying their water-only
fast at Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas, Altman said.
	   They agreed on Thursday to take sodium and potassium salts to
ward off heart failure and convulsions, he said.
	   The prisoners stopped eating on Nov. 16, claiming that
authorities reneged on the agreement that ended their 16-day hunger
strike in April, Altman said.
	   The prisoners say they were to have been transferred to a
minimum-security prison and allowed to participate in work-release.
	   Sao Paulo Judge Otavio Augusto Machado de Barros, however, says
the only agreement made was a promise to review their sentences. A
criminal court is scheduled to do so on Dec. 15.
	   Last week, visits by relatives, sympathetic Brazilian
congressmen, Jose Gregori, the federal secretary for human rights
and Renan Calheiros, the justice minister, failed to convince the
prisoners to end their hunger strike.
	   On Saturday, Sao Paulo Archbishop Claudio Hummes became the
latest visiting dignitary to search for a settlement.
	   In Chile, three congressman have asked President Eduardo Frei to
raise the matter with Cardoso on an official state visit to Brazil
that is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
	   If there is no solution soon, Brazilian Congressman Helio Bicudo
fears the worst.
	   ``The government will have bodies on its hands,'' he was quoted
as saying in Saturday's Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.

Jury finds Russian-born writer's bloody death was suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ A Russian-born writer and
lecturer who became increasingly eccentric in her last months
battered, mutilated, choked and stabbed herself to death, a
coroner's jury has ruled.
	   After four days of testimony and five hours of deliberation, the
panel ruled Friday that Lioudmila Boukina, 47, probably died just
before her husband returned home from a trip to Vancouver.
	   Boukina's body was found in a pool of blood against her bedroom
door in the Victoria home she shared with her husband, Nicholas
Galichenko, a University of Victoria professor who found her for
about 18 hours after she died.
	   The corpse bore puncture marks to the top of the head, neck,
arms, eyelids, and abdomen, bruises around the eyes and evidence of
strangulation.
	   There was no evidence of blood anywhere except by the body,
which blocked access to the room. The windows were locked from the
inside. Under the body lay an awl, a scarf and a belt.
	   Galichenko called authorities after forcing the door to her
separate bedroom. After an investigation, police concluded she had
killed herself but the case was submitted to a coroner's inquest to
resolve any questions.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Saturday laid out his vision for final negotiations on Middle East
peace, striking a notably conciliatory tone but avoiding specifics
on the issues that have stalled the current peace process.
	   Referring frequently to ``the logic of peace,'' Arafat said both
Palestinians and Israel must refrain from violence.
	   ``There can be no alternative to resolving the disputed issues
between the two sides except through negotiations,'' he said, and
cautioned against ``unilateral actions that may threaten or
undermine the outcome of the negotiations.''
	   He appeared to tone down the possible Palestinian unilateral
action that especially concerns Israel _ the question of whether
Arafat intends to declare an independent Palestinian state on May
4, the end of the five-year interim period set forth in the Oslo
Accord Israel-PLO peace deal.
	   While insisting on Palestinian independence, Arafat said ``There
can be no just solution without the agreement of the existence of
two states ... coexisting by mutual agreement and acceptance.''
	   ``Every effort (must) be made to reach an agreement and to
delineate the borders of the Palestinian State before May 4,
1999,'' Arafat said.
	   Asked later if that statement and its emphasis on negotiation
meant he was backing off on intentions to declare a state in May,
Arafat sparred ``Did I give ultimatums before?''
	   Israel this month suspended troop withdrawals from the West Bank
that are called for under the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, demanding
that Arafat publicly state that he will not declare an independent
Palestinian state.
	   David Bar-Illan, the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, told The Associated Press in Jerusalem that
Arafat's position ''is certainly not a retraction and not what we
say we need, which is a clear reatraction and announcment that he
would continue with negotiations.''
	   The official purpose of Arafat's trip was to attend a meeting
commemorating the 10th anniversary of his statement in Stockholm of
support for U.N. resolutions recognizing Israel's right to exist.
	   Israel was represented at the meeting by Yossi Beilin, one of
the architects of the Oslo peace accord, and by Meir Sheetrit, the
parliamentary whip for the governing Likud coalition.
	   Beilin, of the opposition Labor Party, expressed concern that
many issues need to be worked out in the less than six months
remaining before the end of the interim phase of the peace
agreement.
	   He suggested a possible compromise on the independence issue,
proposing that the Palestinians might wait until 2001 for
independence in exchange for Israel agreeing to withdraw from a
larger amount of territory than is currently called for. But he
admitted he believed neither the Palestinians nor the Israeli
government would find that acceptable.
	   ``It would be difficult for the Pslestinians to extend the five
years'' they have already waited, he said.
	   Israel also says it will not resume troop withdrawals unless
Palestinian authorities accept Israeli criteria for prisoner
releases. The Wye agreement calls for the release of 750
Palestinian prisoners; about 250 have been freed so far and
Palestinians complain that most of those released were criminals
rather than political prisoners.
	   The United States on Friday said it believed Israel was living
up to the terms of the Wye agreement. Arafat did not comment on the
U.S. statement.
	   But stone-throwing clashes erupted near three West Bank towns on
Saturday as Palestinians stepped up demands for the release of more
political prisoners.
	   With those clashes, and the ambush beating of a soldier this
week that prompted Israel to suspend the troop withdrawals, the
brief period of optimism after the Wye accord has deteriorated.
	   Arafat originally had planned to go to Oslo, Norway, on Sunday
but has cancelled that leg of his Scandinavian trip, apparently
concerned that tensions were spiraling just a week before the
planned visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ On the streets of a Caracas slum where
police rarely venture and crack cocaine is plentiful, hard-working
people were losing hope. Until former coup leader Hugo Chavez began
dominating the polls for Sunday's presidential election.
	   ``Everyone's for Chavez. He's all anyone is talking about,''
63-year-old community leader Isabel de Infante said as she trudged
uphill into Catia, a vast shantytown in western Caracas.
	   In slums all over Venezuela, the pugnacious former paratrooper
who led an ill-fated 1992 coup attempt is embraced as a savior by
people furious at a political class they believe has failed them.
	   ``They've called him a murderer, a tyrant. But those are his
enemies, no? I think he's full of high ideals,'' said Antonio
Amaral, a 50-year-old city planner.
	   Forty years after dictatorship gave way to democracy in this
nation with the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East,
Venezuelans are deeply angry over democracy's failure to ease
poverty and counter rampant corruption.
	   The nation's economy slumped after oil prices plunged to a
12-year-low. A 27 percent revenue shortfall has forced the
government to make deep cuts in essential services from health care
to education, and annual inflation leads Latin America at 31
percent.
	   Conditions were perfect for the rise of a working-class hero.
Pardoned in 1994 after two years in jail, former Lt. Col. Chavez
seized the national imagination with a simple, messianic message.
	   ``The hour has arrived for the resurrection of Venezuela,''
Chavez, 44, told more than a half million roaring supporters at his
campaign's final rally on Wednesday.
	   For starters, Chavez says, ``we'll sweep away all the corrupt.''
He favors dissolving Congress and enacting a whole new
constitution.
	   ``The masses have rediscovered politics,'' said Jose Vicente
Rangel, an investigative journalist and Chavez supporter. ``This is
fundamentally attributable to the message and figure of Chavez.''
	   That message has lacked specifics, though, and Chavez's advisers
are an odd mix from the political left and right, Communist leaders
rubbing shoulders with ex-generals.
	   Chavez's challenger, former Gov. Henrique Salas Romer of
Carabobo state, ``arose merely as a response to the fear, to the
uncertainty generated by a possible Chavez triumph,'' said Jose
Virtuoso, director of the Jesuit-run Gumilla research institute.
	   Supported by Venezuela's two traditional parties and hoping for
an upset, Salas contends that Chavez will impose a dictatorship.
But that hardly matters to the people of Catia.
	   ``In these 40 years of democracy in Venezuela, the country has
regressed, it's been bleeded,'' complains Francisco Escalona, a
44-year-old firefighter. ``No one complies with the laws.''
	   Corruption is so endemic that both predecessors of President
Rafael Caldera were prosecuted for alleged misuse of millions of
dollars in public funds. And during Caldera's tenure, at least a
dozen banking executives charged with corruption jumped bail and
fled the country.
	   ``If a dictatorship offers the kind of government where
education, health care _ all the public services _ work, then I'm
for it,'' Escalona said.
	   ``Bring on dictatorship, because this is no life,'' said Carmen
de Guevara, a 50-year-old housewife scared sick for her six
children. She's tired of having neighbors shot and killed by
robbers who never get caught.
	   Many analysts say Chavez can't possibly make good on his
promises, at least in the short run _ the funds simply don't exist.
	   ``There are no options because there is no money,'' said Luis
Vicente Leon, director of the Datanalisis polling firm.
	   Shantytown dwellers aren't swayed. They're betting on the man
who invokes independence hero Simon Bolivar in his speeches and
insists he will change the course of history.
	   ``It's like the lottery,'' Escalona said. ``We're going to play
this number and see how we do.''

<TEXT>
	   Thumbnail sketches of the top contenders in Venezuela's
presidential vote Sunday:
	   ___
	   HUGO CHAVEZ, 44, a cashiered lieutenant colonel, is the
front-runner. As head of an elite paratrooper unit, he led a failed
coup against then-President Carlos Andres Perez in 1992 and became
a hero to millions of poor people fed up with rampant corruption.
	   Released from prison two years later, he formed a political
movement invoking independence hero Simon Bolivar. In Nov. 8
regional elections, his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a
plurality of Congress and broke a 40-year stranglehold by
Venezuela's two main traditional parties.
	   Chavez is calling for a ``third way'' between unfettered
capitalism and socialism. His detractors fear he would assume
dictatorial powers.
	   ___
	   HENRIQUE SALAS ROMER, 62, a Yale-educated businessman, is
running second. An independent, he won the backing of Venezuela's
two main traditional parties, Democratic Action and the Social
Christian COPEI, in their last-ditch effort to defeat Chavez.
	   Salas built a reputation as an efficient governor in industrial
Carabobo state. He cut spending, slashed a bloated government
bureaucracy and created the only police emergency telephone system
in Venezuela.
	   A former economics professor, he is seen as conservative and
pro-free market. He is drawing most of his support from the rich
and middle-class and others afraid Chavez would impose a leftist
dictatorship.
	   Critics charge that Salas would rule on behalf of Venezuela's
oligarchy.
	   ___
	   IRENE SAEZ, 36, Miss Universe 1981, is running as an independent
after COPEI dropped its support last week. She built a reputation
as an honest and efficient politician as mayor of affluent Chacao
municipality in Caracas.
	   Her campaign foundered badly because of confusion among her
staff and the COPEI endorsement. The party, along with Democratic
Action, is widely discredited among Venezuelans who blame them for
squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle
East.
	   Saez, who led the polls until earlier this year, is given little
chance of winning. But her political career probably is not over,
and she could run for state governor or congress in two years.

<TEXT>
	   Key facts about Venezuela, which holds its presidential election
Sunday:
	   ___
	   LAND: Bordered by Brazil, Colombia and Guyana, Venezuela is
roughly the size of Germany and France combined. It has almost
2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) of Caribbean coastline.
	   PEOPLE: Most of the 23 million residents are of mixed native
Indian, black and European heritage. The majority live in cities.
	   OFFICIAL LANGUAGE: Spanish.
	   RELIGION: Mainly Roman Catholic, though the number of
Protestants has grown to nearly a quarter of the population.
	   HISTORY: Gained independence from Spain in 1830. Native son
Simon Bolivar, who also freed Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia,
is a national hero.
	   POLITICS: President Rafael Caldera will turn power over to a new
administration in February 1999. Freely elected civilian
governments have held power since the last military regime was
overthrown in 1958, and survived two coup attempts in 1992.
	   ECONOMY: Main foreign supplier of oil to the United States, with
the largest proven reserves outside the Middle East. Oil accounts
for around 70 percent of the country's exports.

Annan in Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled
to Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   But Libya's official news agency, JANA, said during his one-day
trip the U.N. official ``may not be able to meet'' meet Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, adding that Gadhafi ``is now in the desert
outside the region.''
	   The JANA report said that Annan met with the Libyan foreign
minister, Omar al-Muntasser, in the northern coastal town of Sirte,
400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli. It gave no
other information on why an expected Annan-Gadhafi might not take
place.
	   Annan was still in Libya about five hours after his scheduled
departure back to Tunisia, but there was no report on whether his
talks were making progress. Libyan television at 8:30 p.m.
(1930gmt) only repeated the JANA report that Annan may not see
``the brother leader,'' meaning Gadhafi.
	   Earlier, the Libyan media suggested Gadhafi had no authority to
hand over the suspects. Such a report indicated that Gadhafi was
giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides
against giving up the suspects.
	   JANA said Gadhafi is neither the prime minister nor the
president of the country. It suggested that a decision on handing
over the suspects would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots
national committees before being decided by the Parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the General People's Congress, or
parliament, had been called to meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the
report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., did not say
whether the Lockerbie issue would be discussed.
	   Most reporters were barred from traveling with Annan from the
capital Tripoli to Sirte.
	   While the Libyan media gave few reports on the visit, ordinary
Libyans were aware of the developments, and many said they opposed
handing over the suspects.

Palestinian leader lays out vision of how to negotiate final peace

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat laid
out his vision for final negotiations on Middle East peace
Saturday, striking a notably conciliatory tone but avoiding
specifics on the issues that have stalled the current peace
process.
	   Referring frequently to ''the logic of peace,'' Arafat said both
Palestinians and Israel must refrain from violence.
	   ''There can be no alternative to resolving the disputed issues
between the two sides except through negotiations,'' he said, and
cautioned against ''unilateral actions that may threaten or
undermine the outcome of the negotiations.''
	   He appeared to tone down chances for the Palestinian action that
especially concerns Israel _ the possibility that Arafat will
declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4, the end of the
five-year interim period set forth in the Oslo peace deal.
	   While insisting on Palestinian independence, Arafat said,
``There can be no just solution without the agreement of the
existence of two states ... coexisting by mutual agreement and
acceptance.''
	   ''Every effort (must) be made to reach an agreement and to
delineate the borders of the Palestinian state before May 4,
1999,'' Arafat said.
	   Asked later if that statement and its emphasis on negotiation
meant he was backing off on intentions to unilaterally declare a
state in May, Arafat sparred, ``Did I give ultimatums before?''
	   Last week, Israel suspended troop withdrawals from the West Bank
that are called for under the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, demanding
that Arafat publicly say that he will not declare statehood.
	   David Bar-Illan, the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, told The Associated Press in Jerusalem that
Arafat's position ``is certainly not a retraction and not what we
say we need, which is a clear retraction and announcement that he
would continue with negotiations.''

Global turmoil is bump on road to South American free trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAROLD OLMOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil accuses Argentina of
secretly selling milk from New Zealand. The Argentines say
Brazilians cheat by subsidizing sugar. Neither wants the other's
cars.
	   The road to free trade in South America used to be a lot
smoother. But that was before the Asian crisis spread to here.
	   The presidents of the four-nation trade bloc known as Mercosur
meet this week in Rio, with an agenda of problems aggravated by the
global financial turmoil.
	   The slowdown has produced ``some trade tension'' on both sides,
Brazil's Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia acknowledged. But he
added: ``I see nothing that could threaten what Mercosur has
achieved over all these years.''
	   Indeed, Mercosur, seen as the South American version of the
NAFTA trade pact among the United States, Mexico and Canada, has
made believers of many skeptics since its creation in 1991.
	   By any measure, the union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay is the most successful of Latin America's various trade
blocs.
	   Thanks mainly to Brazil's emergence as a stable economy, trade
within the group quintupled from dlrs 4 billion in 1994 to an
estimated dlrs 20 billion or more this year.
	   Historic rivalries were set aside. Argentina and Brazil now talk
about military cooperation instead of an arms race.
	   But ever since the financial turmoil sparked by Russia's
default, relations within the dlrs 1.2 trillion bloc haven't been
so warm.
	   Forced to cut spending and raise taxes to stem capital flight,
Brazil expects its economy to shrink by at least 1 percent in 1999.
Argentina's economy should grow by only 3 percent, half the average
of recent years.
	   Brazilians were stung by Argentine plans to tax car imports by
as much as 40 percent to prevent an ``invasion'' from their
neighbor's more powerful and aggressive auto industry.
	   Brazilians also suspect that Argentines are processing milk
imported from New Zealand and selling it in Brazil. They claim
Argentina is selling more milk products than it produces
domestically, a charge Argentina denies.
	   Argentina, meanwhile, has restricted access of Brazilian sugar,
which gets government subsidies to keep alive a dying alcohol-fuel
industry and to protect thousands of sugar cane growers from
bankruptcy.
	   ``Milk is souring and sugar no longer tastes sweet,'' said Paulo
Roberto Bernardes, of the powerful Agriculture National
Confederation. He warned that failure to find a quick solution
could lead to higher unemployment, social unrest and a
strengthening of the radical Landless Rural Movement Workers.
	   Yet the importance of Mercosur transcends trade. Today the bloc
is a pillar of democracy and integration on a historically volatile
and divided continent.
	   In 1995, it was the strong pressure from Brazil, Argentina and
Uruguay that stifled a military coup in Paraguay. Teaching
Portuguese and Spanish will soon be mandatory in all public
schools, and early next decade citizens of Mercosur
member-countries could have a common passport.
	   Led by Brazil, the bloc resisted U.S. efforts to pry open its
markets for NAFTA. When the U.S. Congress balked at granting
President Bill Clinton fast-track authority to negotiate trade
agreements, Mercosur grew stronger by signing up Chile and Bolivia
as associate members.
	   Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, which make up an Andean
nations common market, could soon follow suit. In a few years, all
of South America conceivably could be united around the Mercosur
axis.
	   That would have seemed pure fiction a few years ago.
	   In 1988, then-presidents Jose Sarney of Brazil and Raul Alfonsin
of Argentina signed the first nuclear cooperation treaty, a
landmark hailed as the equivalent to the French-German steel and
carbon agreement of the early 1950s that led to the current
European Union.
	   When they created Mercosur three years later, Sarney remarked:
``Nobody believed we could do anything that would last.''

Jordan unveils dlrs 3.1 billion budget for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's government unveiled next year's
draft budget Saturday, projecting a deficit of 388 million dinars
(dlrs 546.5 million) or 7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
	   Finance Minister Michel Marto told reporters the deficit was
within the limits set by the International Monetary Fund, which is
supervising the kingdom's economic reforms.
	   Marto said part of the deficit will be plugged by foreign grants
that should amount to 200 million dinars (dlrs 281.7 million).
	   The 2.16 billion dinars (dlrs 3.04 billion) budget draft goes to
parliament for approval later this month. The Cabinet endorsed it
Saturday.
	   The budget is 11 percent bigger than that of fiscal 1998,
reflecting hopes of increased business activity in a country devoid
of natural resources and burdened by foreign debts of dlrs 6.1
billion.
	   Marto said the budget envisages current expenditure at 1.86
billion dinars (dlrs 2.62 billion). Capital expenditure is
estimated at 300 million dinars (dlrs 422.5 million).
	   There will be increased spending on education, health care,
social security, tourism, youth, water resources and
infrastructure, Marto said.
	   Local revenues are estimated at 1.77 billion dinars (dlrs 2.49
billion).

Nigerians begin the march to democracy with municipal elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with voting officially over. Results expected Sunday
at the earliest. Minor edits. No pickup.
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerians took a step away from military
rule towards democracy Saturday in local government elections seen
as a test for Africa's most populous nation.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing
traffic jams of Nigerian cities, shops were closed and the
government ordered all cars, trucks and even motorcycles off city
streets and country highways to prevent political protests and
traffic jams.
	   Children played soccer in the streets while adults filed past on
their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a temporary halt.
	   Although borders were closed and about 100,000 riot police
patrolled the major cities and rural villages amid fears of
elections violence, the mood was buoyant.
	   At one police station in Lagos, officers released prisoners
awaiting trial so they could vote. It was unclear if the move had
been approved by senior authorities or if the prisoners would be
sought to return behind bars.
	   ``Even detainees are entitled to vote,'' said a police sergeant
on duty who asked to remain anonymous. ``I will also go vote when I
leave duty.''
	   Elections organizers said the turnout was high. More than 50
million people are registered to vote for some 8,800 municipal
government posts. Nine parties have registered and three have
fielded candidates nationwide.
	   By 8:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) the elections were officially over,
electoral officials said.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians in May after
presidential elections on February 15. Abubakar took power after
the unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June.
	   ``From what we have seen so far, the turnout is commendable,''
Abubakar said after voting in the capital, Abuja. ``The government
has done its part and it is now up to Nigerians and the politicians
to play their own.''
	   Saturday's poll is a test run. The national electoral commission
is inexperienced and the political parties have vague platforms and
are relatively unknown.
	   Abubakar has promised that the military will not intervene in
the transition.
	   Nigeria, a country of more than 100 million people which has
failed to tackle grinding poverty despite fabulous oil wealth that
has made it the world's 6th largest producer, has a history of
armed coups and military meddling in politics. The country has been
ruled by civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar has warned that parties which campaign on divisive
ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria.
	   After official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation quickly filled radio and television
airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring election
promises on loudspeakers.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Although it was too early to say whether the elections would be
judged free and fair by foreign observers, only scattered
logistical problems were reported by officials early Saturday _ a
few people's names were missing from voters' lists in Abuja and
Lagos and polling began late in some stations.
	   Later in the day, officials said youths stole election material
and disrupted voting in some communities in the western state of
Osun. And there were unconfirmed reports of clashes between rival
party members in a village in the oil-rich Delta state where
elections were cancelled.
	   Ten women fell into a sewage drain filled with human waste that
collapsed beneath a line of voters in the village of Ijegun on the
outskirts of Lagos, the News Agency of Nigeria reported. It said
they all were rescued.
	   Some voters said they did not know who the candidates in their
constituencies were. They said they were voting for whoever
represented their favorite party.
	   Others chose individuals who took a strong anti-military stance
during the unpopular rule of Abacha.
	   ``I voted for the Alliance for Democracy,'' said Lanre Komolafe,
an engineer in Lagos. ``Their members fought Abacha under very
difficult circumstances.''
	   Femi Olayemi, a civil servant in Lagos, said he was voting for
his children's future.
	   ``If we do not vote, we will not have any reason to tell the
military that they should leave power,'' he said.

Aide to slain lawmaker says he wasn't carrying bag of cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A young aide wounded in the attack that killed a
prominent Russian lawmaker denied Saturday that he was carrying a
bag of cash at the time of the shooting, a Russian news agency
reported.
	   Ruslan Linkov, recuperating in a St. Petersburg hospital, said
there had been reports suggesting he was carrying a bag of cash for
Galina Starovoitova when she was killed.
	   ``There was a can of caviar in that bag for her parents ... her
personal belongings and a book in English on interethnic
relations,'' Linkov told Echo Moscow radio, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``There was nothing else in it.''
	   Starovoitova, one of the country's most outspoken liberal
political figures and a potential presidential candidate, was
killed Nov. 20 as she and Linkov walked up the stairs to her
apartment in St. Petersburg.
	   Police have announced no major breakthroughs in the case, but
many believe the motive was political and may have been connected
to Sunday's elections in St. Petersburg.

Rainfall so far in December well above normal

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Rainfall in the first five days of
December has been four times the normal level, leading to daily
flash flood watches in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
according to the National Weather Service.
	   Forecasters say the weather pattern is unlikely to change in the
next few days, though Monday may be a bit drier than recent days.
	   An even foot of rain has fallen on the Caribbean National
Forest, commonly known as El Yunque, since Nov. 29, according to
the San Juan office of the weather service. Two young men were
drowned by a flash flood in the forest preserve this week.
	   Between three to five inches (7.5 to 12.5 centimeters) of rain
have fallen across the north and eastern parts of the island, and
St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands has also seen five inches
(12.5 centimeters) of rain.
	   Flash flood watches remained in effect for the eastern
two-thirds of Puerto Rico Saturday evening. The weather service
warned that with the ground already saturated, any additional rain
would instantly became runoff.

Annan in Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.N. spokesman saying Annan was on his
way to meeting, more details. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN BENEDYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke
Saturday with Libya's foreign minister and was to meet with Moammar
Ghadhafi to try to secure the handover of two suspects in the 1988
Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Although Libya's official news agency, JANA, said Annan ``may
not be able to meet'' Gadhafi on his one-day trip, a U.N. spokesman
in New York said Annan was on his way to the meeting with the
Libyan leader.
	   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, could not
confirm whether the meeting had begun.
	   The JANA report said that Annan met with the Libyan foreign
minister, Omar al-Muntasser, in the northern coastal town of Sirte
but gave no specifics.
	   Annan was still in Libya about five hours after his scheduled
departure to Tunisia, but there was no report on whether his talks
were making progress. Libyan television only repeated the JANA
report that Annan may not see ``the brother leader,'' meaning
Gadhafi.
	   Earlier, Libyan media suggested Gadhafi had no authority to hand
over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room in
case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United
States and Britain for trial in the Netherlands.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah would have to be approved by
some 500 grassroots national committees before being decided by the
parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the report, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., did not say whether the Lockerbie issue would
be discussed.
	   Most reporters were barred from traveling with Annan from the
capital, Tripoli, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east to Sirte.
	   While Libyan media gave few reports about the visit, ordinary
Libyans were aware of the developments and many said they oppose
handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed Abdel-Salam said.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we have
law,'' he said.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from the Tunisian
resort island of Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992
for its refusal to hand over the two suspects, allegedly Libyan
intelligence agents.
	   Al-Megrahi and Fhimah are accused by the United States and
Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie on Dec. 21,
1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on the
ground were killed.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law and using Scottish
judges.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed that
the trial be held in a neutral country. Since then, a new hurdle
has cropped up over the imprisonment of the suspects, if convicted.
Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United
States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and
refuse to negotiate the issue.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's
economic lifeblood, though some Libyan assets abroad have been
frozen. They ban air travel to and from the country and arms sales,
but many African countries have defied the air ban and their
leaders have flown in and out of Libya.

Uzbekistan routs Mongolia, Iran easy winner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sergei Ubedev scored four times and
Igor Shkvirin and Mirdjadai Kasimov three each as Uzbekistan
tallied 10 times in the first half and went on to a Asian Games
record 15-0 rout of Mongolia Saturday, while Iran also advanced to
the second round.
	   Iran beat Laos 6-1, India edged Nepal 1-0 and Mohammed Al-kawari
scored all four goals to lift Qatar past Maldives 4-0 to mark the
end of the first round.
	   The top two teams in each of the eight groups advanced to the
second round starting Monday.
	   From there, four groups of four teams will determine the eight
quarterfinalists.
	   Uzbekistan's victory was another lopsided match in which
Mongolia was overwhelmed. Earlier this week, Kuwait routed it 11-0
to equal the most one-sided victory in Asian Games history set in
South Korea's romp over Nepal in 1994.
	   Ubedev and Shkvirin combined for seven in the first half, while
Kasimov scored his three in the second half.
	   Mongolian keeper Per Jargaisaikhan was almost constantly in
action, deflecting, diving to block and rushing to grab other shots
as the Mongolian defense allowed numerous Uzbek chances.
	   Uzbekistan and Kuwait both finished with a 1-1-0 record atop
Group G, but Uzbekistan advanced on goal difference, finishing with
a plus-15 while Kuwait had a plus 11.
	   The Uzbek victory sends it second round Group One against
Turkmenistan, North Korea and India.
	   Iran, which is fielding a World Cup veteran side, topped Group H
with two victories and will play China, Tajikistan and Oman in
Group Three in the next round.
	   Bayern Munich striker Ali Daei scored twice in the second half
to lead the victory over Laos.
	   Ali Reza Mosavi-Hasanzadeh Iran ahead 2-0 with two first-half
goals: a chip after 30 minutes and a hard drive from 20 meters
eight minutes later.
	   Laos stunned Iran when Soubinh Keophet scored just before
halftime after weaving his way through three defenders.
	   In the second half, Ali Reza Mansourian restored Iran's two goal
lead before Daei scored twice in the last 10 minutes to finish the
rout.
	   India scored the only goal it needed against Nepal in the
opening minute of the second half through Carlton Chapman and made
it stand up.
	   In Group C, Japan had already beaten both India and Nepal to
secure first place. It will play against the United Arab Emirates,
South Korea and Kuwait in second-round Group Two.
	   Qatar's victory finished it atop Group D and eliminated
Maldives. Qatar will face Thailand, Lebanon and Kazakstan in Group
Four.

Annan in Libya for talks on Lockerbie suspects

Downhill canceled again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ For the second day in a row,
fog forced the cancellation of the men's World Cup downhill race.
	   Organizers hope to hold the race Sunday and move the originally
scheduled super-giant slalom until later in the season.
	   Snow flurries and fog that reduced visibility in sections of the
course Saturday caused the start time to be pushed back more than
one hour before it the race was postponed.
	   There was pressure to have a race at this Pacific mountain
resort. The venue has been plagued by weather problems, forcing the
cancellation of the race the last two years.
	   Fog and heavy snow caused the cancellation of Wednesday's
training. Racers finally got their first training run on the course
in three years Thursday.
	   An attempt to hold the race a day early on Friday was scrubbed
when a heavy shroud of fog covered the course. Officials waited 2
1-2 hours before rescheduling the race for Saturday.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A week before the scheduled start of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, Palestinian stone-throwers
battled Israeli troops Saturday in scattered clashes that left 25
Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers injured. Seven protesters
were arrested.
	   Meanwhile in Stockholm, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat struck
a conciliatory note on the explosive issue of Palestinian
statehood.
	   Arafat who has said he will declare statehood unilaterally on
May 4, 1998, said, ``There can be no just solution without the
agreement of the existence of two states...coexisting by mutual
agreement and acceptance.''
	   Just hours before Arafat's remarks, on the outskirts of
Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, and the Israeli settlement of
Ariel, scores of Palestinian youths threw rocks at Israeli troops,
who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The fighting went
on for several hours before protesters dispersed.
	   Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse
dozens of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Also in east Jerusalem, five Israeli busses were stoned, and two
bus drivers were injured lightly from broken glass, the police
said.
	   The disturbances came as Palestinians launched a campaign of
protests to call for the release of so-called security prisoners _
an escalating dispute that has threatened to derail the new Mideast
peace accord.
	   In addition to the street protests, about 2,500 Palestinian
prisoners began a hunger strike Saturday to press for their early
release.
	   In the Ramallah clash, two protesters and two Palestinian police
were hit by rubber bullets, and three demonstrators suffered
tear-gas inhalation. Five protesters in Bethlehem were shot with
rubber bullets.
	   An army officer and two soldiers were injured very lightly in
the Ramallah and Bethlehem clashes, the army said.
	   Outside the northern town of Nablus, three protesters were hit
by rubber bullets and another 10 were sickened by tear gas as they
marched toward a Jewish settlement.
	   Dozens of Palestinians also protested outside of the West Bank
settlement of Ariel and tried to set fire to an electricity pole.
Others threw stones towards homes on the settlement and Israeli
forces on the site. Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear
gas onto the crowd but there were no injuries, the army said.
	   Meanwhile, a week before President Clinton is to arrive for a
three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian faction burned
U.S. flags in the West Bank town of Hebron to protest the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.
	   About 1,000 Palestinians took part in the demonstration
sponsored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
During it, some two dozen masked marchers burned American and
Israeli flags and waved banners vowing to ``continue the
struggle.''
	   In Ramallah, the Palestinians' top negotiator on prisoners
expressed regret over a statement by the Clinton administration
siding with Israel in the prisoner dispute.
	   On Friday in Washington, the State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do...concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' Kadoura Faris, who is
representing Yasser Arafat's government in talks with the Israelis
on the issue, told about 500 protesters at a rally in Ramallah.
	   The West Bank village of Beta outside of Ramallah was put under
curfew by the Israeli army Saturday night after Molotov cocktails
were thrown at a military vehicle passing through the town,
according to Col. Fahed Deyab, who heads the Palestinian side of a
joint security post in the area.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last month it
freed 250 prisoners, but most were common criminals such as car
thieves.
	   The Palestinians are demanding the release instead of hundreds
of so-called security prisoners, who were jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free those involved in attacks that led to death or injury of
Israelis, or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Palestinian officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of
security prisoners eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord _ including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled later this month _ until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.
	   Israel also cited Arafat's repeated calls to establish a
Palestinian state by next May as one of the reasons they have
halted the withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said Arafat's remarks in
Stockholm did not constitute a retraction of his intentions to go
forward with a unilateral declaration of statehood in May.
	   The issues of statehood and prisoners are both highly emotional.
The prisoner issue is particularly charged however, because it
touches nearly all Palestinian families. Almost everyone in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip has had a relative _ a father, a brother,
a son, an uncle, a cousin _ arrested at some point during the
30-year Israeli occupation.
	   At Saturday's rally in Ramallah, families demanded that the
Palestinian Authority make the release of security prisoners a top
priority.
	   ``The Israelis ... did not release the ones who deserved to be
released,'' said Bahia Jabara, 44, who has husband and brother in
Israeli jail.
	   In another development, the first commercial Palestinian
Airlines flight from the newly inaugurated Gaza airport took off
Saturday morning.
	   But in a sour note, the flight to Amman, the capital of
neighboring Jordan, was delayed for more than three hours by an
argument between Palestinians and the Israelis over airport
security.

Fiorentina defeats Bologna, stays atop Serie A standings

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampdoria-Parma night match &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's 16th season goal gave
Fiorentina a hard-fought 1-0 victory against Bologna on Saturday
and kept the Florentine team atop Italian soccer's Serie A
standings, three points ahead of AS Roma and Parma tied in second
place.
	   Roma trounced Perugia 5-1 at home while Parma captured its first
season victory on the road downing Sampdoria 2-0 in a night match
at Genoa's Marassi stadium.
	   The three first division matches were played one day before the
traditional Sunday schedule because of the UEFA Cup commitments of
some Italian teams.
	   Batistuta, the leading league scorer, tallied the game winner in
the 56th minute with a powerful free kick which sent the ball
through the wall and into Bologna's net.
	   At Rome's Olympic stadium, Roma rallied from a 0-1 deficit on a
second-half spree by its young star-forwards Francesco Totti,
Daniele Conti, Marco Delvecchio and Carmine Gautieri.
	   In Genoa, Italian striker Enrico Chiesa sank his former team
scoring both Parma goals.
	   Batistuta, an Argentine international who has scored 12 goals in
league matches and four in the Cups this season, extended
Fiorentina's winning home streak to six games.
	   However victory of the League leader did not come without risks
as Bologna produced at least three clear scoring chances with
strikers Kennet Andersson and Beppe Signori. Their scoring attempts
were bravely saved by Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo.
	   When Toldo could not reach the ball, it was the post to stop a
shot by Bologna's midfielder Joanathan Binotto, in the 51st minute.
	   With a record of 8-1-3 Fiorentina, coached by Giovanni
Trapattoni and fielding such stars as Batistuta, Edmundo, Rui Costa
and Luis Oliveira, piled up a commanding lead of 25 points.
	   Roma vaulted to 22 points on its sixth home victory at the
Olympic stadium for an overall record of 6-4-2.
	   The yellow-and-red home team, coming from a 3-3 draw with
crosstown rival Lazio in the previous league match, wasted three
scoring chances in the first 30 minutes of play and was punished on
the first counter-attack by Perugia, in the 32nd.
	   Roma's keeper Antonio Chimenti fumbled the ball on a powerful
drive by Croat forward Milan Rapajic who gave the visitors a 1-0
lead.
	   Perugia's Japanese striker Hidetoshi Nakata, who scored two
spectacular goals in the previous round against Piacenza, wasted
the opportunity to make it two by the end of the first half.
	   This was the end of Perugia's offensive as the visiting team had
to play the entire second half one player down following the
expulsion of its captain-defender Salvatore Matrecano, who had
overreacted on Brazilian Paulo Sergio.
	   Totti, the young talented captain of the Roman team, tallied the
equalizer with a long-distance shot in the 61st.
	   Another young forward Conti, put Roma in front two minutes
later.
	   Conti headed in his first Serie A goal on a perfect cross by
Russian teammate Dmitri Alenichev.
	   The forward, the son of former Roma's star Bruno Conti, received
a special applause by Roman fans but his joy was short lived as he
was sent off the field four minutes later for rough play.
	   With both teams down to 10 players, Roma kept pressing on the
attack and its agile forward Delvecchio scored twice in two minutes
(77th and 79th) with precise headers to make it 4-1.
	   Gautieri's goal came in second half injury time, to make Roma
the highest scoring Serie A team with 25 goals in 12 rounds.
	   Batistuta's goal improved Fiorentina's total to 23.
	   Batistuta and Edmundo carried out some impressive offensive
combinations against Bologna, but the Brazilian striker was
inaccurate close to the net.
	   Parma, which routed AC Milan 4-0 last Sunday, caused La Samp its
first home loss this season and tied Roma at 22 points.
	   Chiesa, fed by Dino Baggio, scored Parma's first goal with a
precise header from a few meters in the 44th minute.
	   French world champion Lilian Thuram set up Chiesa second goal
with a perfect pass deep into the penalty area. Chiesa outdribbled
goalie Fabrizio Ferron and kicked into the open goalmouth in the
first minute of the second half.
	   The match between defending league champion Juventus and Lazio
of Rome was the big match among the six scheduled on Sunday.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerians took a step away from military
rule towards democracy Saturday in local government elections seen
as a test for Africa's most populous nation.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing
traffic jams of Nigerian cities, shops were closed and the
government ordered all cars, trucks and even motorcycles off city
streets and country highways to prevent political protests and
traffic jams.
	   Children played soccer in the streets while adults filed past on
their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a temporary halt.
	   Although borders were closed and about 100,000 riot police
patrolled the major cities and rural villages amid fears of
elections violence, the mood was generally buoyant.
	   But at least one violent incident reportedly marred the
elections. Rival supporters of two parties campaigning at a polling
station near the town of Warri about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
attacked each other with guns and machetes, resulting in six people
dead, witnesses told reporters there. Police broke up the fighting,
which occurred after the groups exchanged accusations of trying to
rig the vote, the witnesses said. There was no official
confirmation of the incident.

as a test for Africa's most populous nation.
	   In stark contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing
traffic jams of Nigerian cities, shops were closed and the
government ordered all cars, trucks and even motorcycles off city
streets and country highways to prevent political protests and
traffic jams.
	   Children played soccer in the streets while adults filed past on
their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a temporary halt.
	   Although borders were closed and about 100,000 riot police
patrolled the major cities and rural villages amid fears of
elections violence, the mood was generally buoyant.
	   But at least one violent incident reportedly marred the
elections. Rival supporters of two parties campaigning at a polling
station near the town of Warri about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southeast of Lagos attacked each other with guns and machetes,
resulting in six people dead, witnesses told reporters there.
Police broke up the fighting, which occurred after the groups
exchanged accusations of trying to rig the vote, the witnesses
said. There was no official confirmation of the incident.

Turkish premier-designate secures ally, but needs more

protest against government ban on wearing Islamic headscarves. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's premier-designate made progress
Saturday in putting together a coalition government that excludes
the nation's Islamic party, winning the support of a key
center-right party.
	   Even with the Motherland Party's backing, however, Bulent Ecevit
needs still more allies to form a viable coalition among Turkey's
deeply divided pro-secular parties.
	   ``We trust Mr. Ecevit and we are giving full support. We think
his proposal is the best model that would take the country to
elections in harmony,'' Mesut Yilmaz of Motherland said after his
talks with Ecevit.
	   Ecevit, a veteran politician of the left, was asked by Turkey's
president to try his hand at forming a government to replace
Yilmaz's 17-month-old coalition, which collapsed last month amid
mafia and corruption scandals.
	   Ecevit has made clear that he would not resort to seeking an
alliance with the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, the largest bloc
in Parliament. Virtue is the successor of the pro-Islamic Welfare
party, which the military pressured out of power last year to stop
the party's push to increase the influence of Islam in daily life.
	   Turkey has a 99.8 percent Muslim population but a strictly
secular constitution. The military sees itself as the protector of
the republic's secular principles.
	   Also Saturday, police, carrying out a military-imposed crackdown
on any display of radical Islam, detained 111 people for protesting
a government ban on wearing Islamic head scarves in western city of
Bursa. The military sees the scarves as a political statement that
challenges Turkey's secular system.
	   The police said the demonstration was illegal.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians threw stones and Israeli
troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas in scattered
clashes that injured 25 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers
Saturday.
	   The clashes came as Palestinians launched a campaign of protests
to call for the release of so-called security prisoners, an
escalating dispute that has threatened to derail the new Mideast
peace accord. Seven protesters were arrested.
	   In addition to the street protests, 2,500 Palestinian prisoners
began a hunger strike Saturday to press for their early release.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners by the end of January. In a first stage last
month, it freed 250 prisoners, most common criminals.
	   Instead, the Palestinians are demanding the release of hundreds
of prisoners jailed for anti-Israel activity.
	   The prisoner issue is highly emotional because almost everyone
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has had a relative arrested at some
point during the 30-year Israeli occupation.
	   Saturday's protesters dispersed after hours of clashes on the
outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah, Nablus and the Israeli settlement
of Ariel. Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to
disperse dozens of stone throwers in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem. Five Israeli buses were stoned, and two bus drivers were
slightly injured from broken glass, the police said.
	   Meanwhile, a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to
arrive for a three-day visit, supporters of a radical Palestinian
faction burned U.S. flags in the West Bank town of Hebron to
protest the Wye River land-for-security agreement. About 1,000
Palestinians took part in the demonstration sponsored by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   The West Bank village of Beta was put under a curfew by the
Israeli army Saturday night after Molotov cocktails were thrown at
a military vehicle passing through the town, said Col. Fahed Deyab,
who heads the Palestinian side of a joint security post in the
area.
	   In Ramallah, the Palestinians' top negotiator on prisoners
expressed regret over a statement by the Clinton administration.
Friday in Washington, the U.S. State Department said the Israelis
have ``done what they said they would do ... concerning prisoner
releases.''
	   ``We are sorry for what the American administration has said,
that Israel has fulfilled its obligations,'' Kadoura Faris, who is
representing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's government in talks
with the Israelis on the issue, told 500 protesters.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
free members of the Islamic militant group Hamas or those involved
in attacks that led to the death or injury of Israelis. Palestinian
officials contend there is a pool of hundreds of security prisoners
eligible for release even under those terms.
	   Israel has said it would hold up implementing provisions of the
accord, including a troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West
Bank scheduled for later this month, until Arafat accepted Israel's
criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   The Clinton administration has insisted the troop pullback
proceed despite the disagreement.
	   In Stockholm, Arafat struck a conciliatory note on the explosive
issue of Palestinian statehood.
	   Arafat, who has said he will declare statehood unilaterally on
May 4, said, ``There can be no just solution without the agreement
of the existence of two states ... coexisting by mutual agreement
and acceptance.''
	   Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said Arafat's remarks did
not constitute a retraction of his intentions to go forward with a
unilateral declaration of statehood in May.

Mallorca stays alone at top of league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Daniel Garcia ``Dani'' scored the game
winner with eight minutes left, leading Mallorca's 1-0 victory over
Betis on Saturday and consolidated Mallorca atop the first
division.
	   The lone goal improved Mallorca to 7-4-2 and 25 points, two more
than Deportivo de La Coruna after defeating FC Barcelona 2-1 in the
13th round and moving past Celta.
	   While Mallorca and Celta continued its fight atop the league,
two traditional powers continued to struggle Saturday but with
different results, Barcelona losing to Deportivo de La Coruna 2-1
and Real Madrid being held to a 0-0 draw at Barcelona.
	   With the cloud hanging over embattled coach Louis Van Gaal,
Barcelona lost its temper and was easily defeated by 4th-placed
Deportivo.
	   After a goalless first half, Moroccan Mustapha Hadji put
Deportivo up at minute 76. Twelve minutes later Brazilian ace
Rivaldo scored from the penalty shot, giving Barcelona a 1-1 draw,
and mixing happiness with a temporary sigh of relief.
	   But Francisco Javier Gonzalez 'Fran's shot in the injury time
gave Deportivo the victory, and the chance for Deportivo to raise
to No.2 in the league.
	   A win for Barcelona would have all but secured a week of calm
for the Catalan team.
	   In Salamanca, Celta got on the board first when Brazilian
Mazinho scored at minute 5 but Salamanca equalized the game taking
advantage of Celta's tiredness with a surprising shot three minutes
before the whistle.
	   With this draw, Celta drops to the third position, two points
behind Mallorca.
	   In other games Saturday it was: Real Sociedad 2, Extremadura 1
and Atletico de Madrid 0, Athletic de Bilbao 0.
	   In Barcelona, Espanyol and Real Madrid played to a 0-0 draw.
	   Real Madrid missed an opportunity to close the gap separating it
from the top but the white-clad team did move to 5th-place with 19
points, six behind league leader Mallorca
	   Madrid looked sure to beat Espanyol, which is No. 17 in the
20-team league, but a meticulous Espanyol defense and a lack of
coordination left the Intercontinental winners wanting.
	   The round finishes Sunday with Villareal hosting Valladolid,
Oviedo receiving Racing de Santander, Alaves meeting Valencia and
Tenerife welcoming Zaragoza.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hundreds of fans rampaged Saturday before
and after a Greek league match between defending champion
Olympiakos and archrival Panathinaikos.
	   Private Mega television showed fans smashing cars, attacking

Winning the Nobel won't change 75-year-old Portuguese writer Jose
</HEADLINE>
Saramago, he says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nobel Literature Prize winner Jose
Saramago seemed bemused at the notion that relatively sudden
international celebrity, honors bestowed by a king and a country,
not to mention a check for nearly 1 million dollars, might change
his life.
	   ``I'm 75 years old,'' he said Saturday night upon arrival for
the annual Nobel festivities. Besides, ``It wouldn't be worth it to
change your life ... just because of a prize.''
	   One of Europe's best-known writers, Saramago wasn't yanked from
obscurity by his selection two months ago. But it's true that he
often lost out to other authors in competitions for prestigious
awards, only to win the one that crowns a career.
	   At a news conference with questions asked in four languages --
Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and English -- a voluble, smiling
Saramago, his wife seated nearby, bantered with reporters and
talked about the craft of writing.
	   He grew serious when asked to compare his novel, ``The Gospel
According to Jesus Christ,'' for which he was criticized by the
Vatican, to ``The Satanic Verses,'' for which author Salman Rushdie
was condemned by Islamic religious leaders.
	   ``Those books have nothing in common,'' he said, except that
``no one has the right to speak in the name of God, be it pope or
ayatollah ... because God has never told anyone to speak for him.''
	   Saramago was scheduled to give his Nobel lecture on Monday.

 &UR; EDs: ADDS time of Sunday's event &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ For the second day in a row,
fog forced the cancellation of the men's World Cup downhill race on
Saturday.
	   Organizers hope to hold the race at 10 a.m. (1600 GMT), meaning
the super-giant slalom originally slated for Sunday will be
rescheduled for later in the season.
	   Snow flurries and fog that reduced visibility in sections of the
3,185-meter (10,440-foot) Dave Murray course caused the race's
start time to be pushed back more than one hour before it was
postponed.
	   There was pressure to have a race at this Pacific mountain
resort. The venue has been plagued with weather problems, forcing
the cancellation of the race the last two years.
	   Fog and heavy snow resulted in Wednesday's training being
cancelled. Racers finally got their first training run on the
course in three years Thursday.
	   An attempt to hold the race a day early on Friday was scrubbed
when a heavy shroud of fog covered the course. Officials waited 2
1-2 hours before rescheduling the race for Saturday.

Army wins classic rivalry marred by railing collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Army vs. Navy is supposed to more than just
a game, but not like this.
	   Army beat Navy 34-30 in one of American college football's
greatest rivalries Saturday, but the highest-scoring game in the
99-year history of the series was marred by an accident in which
nine people fell out of the stands and were injured.
	   The accident occurred after Ty Amey's 70-yard touchdown run gave
Army a 31-30 lead. A railing behind the east end zone gave way, and
Army cadets and prep students fell about 4 1-2 meters (15 feet)
onto the playing field. The extent of the injuries wasn't
immediately known.
	   After a 31-minute delay, Eric Olsen's 26-yard field goal
provided the final margin as Army (3-8) avenged last year's 39-7
loss to Navy (3-8) at Giants Stadium near New York City.
	   The 64 points broke the previous record of 55, reached in 1959
and 1983.
	   Army came back from a 30-19 deficit at the start of the fourth
quarter, preventing the Midshipmen from winning consecutive games
in the series for the first time since 1982-83. It was Army's sixth
victory in the last seven years, and the sixth game in the 1990s
decided by fewer than five points.
	   But the scary accident cast a somber tone over the postgame
celebration.
	   The uniformed fans were cheering for television cameras after
Army took a 31-30 lead on Amey's 70-yard TD run with 7:33 left in
the game. A railing in front of the first row of seats gave way,
causing the personnel to fall.
	   Several stretchers were summoned, and the game was suspended
with 6:08 left as four ambulances drove onto the field.
	   The injured were four cadets from the U.S. Military Academy in
West Point, New York, and five students from the academy's prep
school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, said Army's sports information
department.
	   Gerald Ravitz, father of Army co-captain Neil Ravitz, was on the
field and said he saw the first person to hit the ground.
	   ``It could have been my kid in the stands,'' said Ravitz, in
tears.
	   Amey rushed 13 times for 134 yards, and Craig Stucker had seven
rushes for 106 yards for Army, whose No. 1-rated rushing offense
amassed 401 yards.
	   The comeback and the collapsed railings overshadowed a
record-breaking performance by Navy's Ryan Read, whose 128 pass
receiving yards were the most ever in the series, which began in
1890.
	   Read's 69-yard TD reception from Brian Broadwater in the second
quarter was the longest pass play in series history. It was Navy's
longest pass play in this game since Roger Staubach, who later went
on to play professionally with the Dallas Cowboys, hit Nick Markoff
for 65 yards in 1962.
	   Read's three catches for 128 yards broke an 84-year-old record
held by Army's Lou Merillat, who had 115 yards in the 1914 game.
	   Broadwater was 7-for-17 for 188 yards. Army's Joe Gerena, a
sophomore who relieved Johnny Goff after the senior fumbled twice,
rushed for 92 yards.

Top international official demands an end to violence in Serb area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The top international
official in Bosnia on Saturday urged Bosnian Serbs to end violence
most likely prompted by the arrest of one of their generals on
suspicion of war crimes.
	   The recent arrest of Gen. Radislav Krstic by NATO troops in
Bosnia's peace force aroused anti-Western feelings in the Serb half
of Bosnia. Krstic was the sought by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
	   An overnight explosion damaged a U.N. vehicle on Friday but
caused no injuries, and according to a statement from the office
	   of Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp, more
incidents occured in the area.
	   Two vehicles of the European Union Monitor Mission were
destroyed and the lives of two international officials were
endangered, the release said, without offering details.
	   Westendorp also criticized Friday's demonstrations in Vlasenica,
some 70 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Sarajevo, where the
first explosion occured. During those demonstrations, the town's
mayor Stanimir Reljic, claimed Krstic was tortured upon arrest.
	   Westendorp said he received NATO assurances that Krstic was
treated according to international standards. He urged the
president of the Bosnian Serbs, Nikola Poplasen, to make sure the
violence was investigated and the perpetrators punished.
	   Violence and inflammatory statements against internationals must
stop immediately, Westendorp said, warning of ``further
	   action'' unless his demands were obeyed.
	   Westendorp has the power to fire local officials.

Tight security across India on anniversary of mosque demolition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Riot police guarded dozens of places of
worship across India Saturday to prevent religious violence while
Hindu right-wingers prepared to mark the sixth anniversary of the
razing of a disputed medieval mosque.
	   Hundreds of armed police cordoned off the small town of Ayodhya,
where the 16th century Babri Mosque was demolished by thousands of
frenzied members of Hindu nationalist groups on Dec. 6, 1992.
	   People were prohibited from congregating anywhere in the town on
Sunday, the United News of India quoted officials as saying.
	   The destruction of the mosque six years ago set off Hindu-Muslim
riots that killed 2,000 people. Hindu leaders claimed the mosque
was built 400 years ago by Mogul invaders using the rubble of a
Hindu shrine they tore down. Many people believe the shrine stood
on the birthplace of Ram, an important Hindu deity.
	   A year later, suspected Muslim extremists set off 13 bomb blasts
in Bombay to avenge the riots. The blasts killed some 600 people
and destroyed many skyscrapers in the country's financial capital.
	   India's Supreme Court is now considering the dispute over the
shrine but has set no date for a ruling. The ruling Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has promised to abide by
judicial opinion.
	   ``I believe there is no issue or dispute which cannot be
resolved satisfactorily through negotiations conducted in an
atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding. This holds true for
Ayodhya too,'' Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said, according
to a statement issued Saturday.
	   But many Hindu fundamentalist leaders have vowed that no matter
what the Supreme Court decides, they will start building a Hindu
temple at the site of a demolished mosque in three years _ as soon
as sculptors complete pillars, arches and images of gods and
goddesses for the controversial shrine.
	   They are expected Sunday to rally in Ayodhya, 550 kilometers
(350 miles) east of New Delhi in the northern state of Uttar
Pradesh, and different parts of the country. Similar demonstrations
in the past have often led to flare-ups with Muslim
fundamentalists.
	   The Vishwa Hindu Parishad or World Hindu Council, a close
affiliate of the BJP which has spearheaded the movement for the
construction of the temple, says it does not believe the court has
any authority in religious matters.
	   Under the VHP's direction, artisans have been working for the
past several years in a field near the mosque's rubble, chiseling
images of gods and goddesses from chunks of sandstone.

Annan says talks with Gadhafi were positive but no final results
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan comments after returning to Tripoli.
 &UR; By MARTIN BENEDYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed
to reach agreement Saturday on bringing two Libyans to trial for
the 1988 Pan Am airliner bombing despite what he called ``fruitful
and positive'' talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Annan said, however, he believed an arrangement for trying the
two Libyan suspects could be secured in ``not an inordinate''
amount of time.
	   The secretary-general talked to reporters after meeting Gadhafi
at an undisclosed location in the Libyan desert. Libyan TV showed
the Libyan leader, in a brown robe and cap, shaking hands with
Annan.
	   It was a long day of diplomacy for the 60-year-old Annan. He
left Jerba, Tunisia, in the morning for Tripoli, held talks with
Libyan officials in the coastal city of Sirte, then took what was
said to be a two-hour journey to his desert meeting with Gadhafi.
	   Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British
plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in
the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that left 270 people dead.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said after
his meeting with Gadhafi. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and
readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said. ``It will require some time but not
an inordinate amount.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported Annan might not be able to meet with the
leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   JANA reported that Annan met with Libya's foreign minister, Omar
al-Muntasser, in Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the
capital Tripoli.
	   Earlier, Libyan media suggested Gadhafi had no authority to hand
over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room in
case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United
States and Britain.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah would have to be approved by
some 500 grassroots national committees before being decided by the
parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the report, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., did not say whether the Lockerbie issue would
be discussed.
	   Most reporters were barred from traveling with Annan from
Tripoli to Sirte.
	   While Libyan media gave few reports about the visit, ordinary
Libyans were aware of the developments and many said they oppose
handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed Abdel-Salam said.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we have
law,'' he said.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from the Tunisian
resort island of Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992
for its refusal to hand over the two suspects, allegedly Libyan
intelligence agents.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law and using Scottish

Annan says talks with Gadhafi were positive but no final results

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed
to reach agreement Saturday on bringing two Libyans to trial for
the 1988 Pan Am airliner bombing despite what he called ``fruitful
and positive'' talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Annan said, however, he believed an arrangement for trying the
two Libyan suspects could be secured in ``not an inordinate''
amount of time.
	   The secretary-general talked to reporters after meeting Gadhafi
at an undisclosed location in the Libyan desert. Libyan TV showed
the Libyan leader, in a brown robe and cap, shaking hands with
Annan.
	   It was a long day of diplomacy for the 60-year-old Annan. He
left Jerba, Tunisia, in the morning for Tripoli, held talks with
Libyan officials in the coastal city of Sirte, then took what was
said to be a two-hour journey to his desert meeting with Gadhafi.
	   Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British
plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in
the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that left 270 people dead.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said after
his meeting with Gadhafi. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and
readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said. ``It will require some time but not
an inordinate amount.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported Annan might not be able to meet with the
leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   JANA reported that Annan met with Libya's foreign minister, Omar
al-Muntasser, in Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the
capital Tripoli.
	   Earlier, Libyan media suggested Gadhafi had no authority to hand
over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room in
case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United
States and Britain.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah would have to be approved by
some 500 grassroots national committees before being decided by the
parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the report, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., did not say whether the Lockerbie issue would
be discussed.
	   Most reporters were barred from traveling with Annan from
Tripoli to Sirte.
	   While Libyan media gave few reports about the visit, ordinary
Libyans were aware of the developments and many said they oppose
handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed Abdel-Salam said.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we have
law,'' he said.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from the Tunisian
resort island of Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992
for its refusal to hand over the two suspects, allegedly Libyan
intelligence agents.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law and using Scottish
judges.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed that
the trial be held in a neutral country. Since then, a new hurdle
has cropped up over the imprisonment of the suspects, if convicted.
Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United
States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and
refuse to negotiate the issue.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's
economic lifeblood, though some Libyan assets abroad have been

Timor protesters demand info from Army trainers of Indonesians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Protesters on Sunday urged Australian
military leaders to identify Indonesian army officers trained here
to allow closer monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor.
	   The Australian military holds joint training exercises with
Indonesian troops, including the elite commando units accused ot
atrocities in East Timor.
	   In Queensland, about 100 activists gathered outside the Canungra
Land Warfare Center, south of Brisbane, to mark the 23rd
anniversary of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor.
	   ``It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian
soldiers,'' spokesman Jason McLeod said.
	   The protesters wanted Australia to cut all military ties with
Indonesia despite Defence Minister John Moore's recent announcement
that joint exercises would resume, he said.
	   ``The Australian government has repeatedly refused to allow the
Indonesians trained here to be identified,'' McLeod said.
	   ``But we are demanding they be named along with their unit and
battalion number because this will allow closer monitoring of human
rights issues,'' he said.
	   McLeod said 40,000 East Timorese were killed by Japanese
soldiers for protecting Australian commandos during World War II.
	   ``When they finally left the country the Australians distributed
leaflets saying they would never forget the people of East Timor,''
he said.
	   The protesters wanted to remind Australia's current soldiers of
that pledge.
	   After Portugal abandoned its former colony in East Timor in
1975, Indonesia invaded it and annexed it the following year.
	   The United Nations refuses to recognize the annexation as
legitimate; Australia is one of the few nations that recognizes
Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.

Power beats Nicol for title

	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Canada's Jonathan Power became North
America's first world squash champion Saturday, rallying from a
first-game loss to beat Scotland's top-ranked Peter Nicol 15-17,
15-7, 15-9, 15-10 and win the 175,000 World Open.
	   The 24-year-old from Toronto fought off three game points in the
opener before finally succumbing. But Nicol noticeably began to
tire during the second game and Power took charge before eventually
prevailing in 72 minutes.
	   Power beat Nicol in last year's Qatar International final on the
all-glass court in Doha.
	   ``I always thought I had a good chance. If you play well, you
win, and I played well tonight,'' he said.
	   ``I guess this was just one tournament too many,'' Nicol said.
``Jonathan played a fantastic game.''

Cuban authorities arrest 18 foreigners on drug charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban authorities have broken up a drug
smuggling ring involving Canadians, Jamaicans and Britons who
allegedly attempted to carry cocaine and hash from Jamaica to Great
Britain, Cuba's official newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Eighteen foreigners were arrested in separate operations between
Nov. 6 and Nov. 16, most at Havana's Jose Marti International
Airport, the daily Granma reported on its Web site, monitored in
Mexico City.
	   On Nov. 6, Customs and Interior Ministry agents arrested three
Jamaicans carrying nearly 3 pounds (1.3 kilos) of hash from Montego
Bay, Jamaica. The suspects said they were to deliver the hash to a
Canadian in Cuba, according to the report.
	   Over the next five days, agents arrested seven Canadians _ four
men and three women _ who had arrived in Cuba from Montego Bay,
Jamaica, with a total of nearly 83.5 pounds (38 kilos) of cocaine
in their suitcases. The seven were bound for Great Britain.
	   Authorities later arrested four other Jamaicans, carrying a
total of 34.5 pounds (15.65 kilos) of cocaine, who said four
British citizens were in charge of taking the drugs out of Cuba.
The Britons were arrested on Nov. 16.
	   The names of the suspects were not released. Granma said 17
suspects remained in custody. A pregnant Canadian woman was
returned to her country.
	   The report said Canadian, Jamaican and British authorities were
cooperating in the investigation of the alleged ring.

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ For the second day in a row,
fog forced the cancellation of the men's World Cup downhill race on
Saturday.
	   Organizers hope to hold the race at 10 a.m. (1800 GMT), meaning
the super-giant slalom originally slated for Sunday will be
rescheduled for later in the season.
	   Snow flurries and fog that reduced visibility in sections of the
3,185-meter (10,440-foot) Dave Murray course caused the race's
start time to be pushed back more than one hour before it was
postponed.
	   There was pressure to have a race at this Pacific mountain
resort. The venue has been plagued with weather problems, forcing
the cancellation of the race the last two years.
	   Fog and heavy snow resulted in Wednesday's training being
cancelled. Racers finally got their first training run on the
course in three years Thursday.
	   An attempt to hold the race a day early on Friday was scrubbed
when a heavy shroud of fog covered the course. Officials waited 2
1-2 hours before rescheduling the race for Saturday.

Cuba says Castro `criticisms' of Mexico were misinterpreted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba moved to quell a diplomatic row with
Mexico on Saturday, saying reporters misinterpreted Fidel Castro
when they quoted him as saying Mexicans traded in their historic
heroes for Mickey Mouse.
	   The Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry had demanded Friday that
Cuba explain criticism of Mexico's relationship with the United
States, which Mexico City newspapers had attributed to Castro.
	   The daily El Universal reported that the Cuban president had
said Mexico was turning its back on poor Latin American nations and
that many Mexicans would sooner be able to say who Mickey Mouse was
than name the father of their country.
	   A statement from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico said Castro's
comments, made Wednesday ``in a discreet and familiar environment''
during a gathering of Latin American economic leaders in Cuba, had
been taken out of context and ``absolutely misinterpreted.''
	   The statement said Castro's comment about Mickey Mouse, a
popular cartoon character, was not a criticism of Mexicans but a
remark on the overwhelming cultural dominance of the U.S.
entertainment industry.
	   If many Mexican children were asked to name their country's
founders ``it is possible that many of them would not know, but
they would instead know who is Mickey Mouse, who are all of the
principal characters of the animated cartoons coming from the
United States; and the same thing occurs in the rest of Latin
America,'' Castro said.

Haitian-American killed on trip to Haiti
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Haitian-American who returned to
his home island to buy property was shot and killed in what may be
a robbery, a security official said Saturday.
	   The victim was identified as Frico Damas, a resident of
Massachusetts, but his age and address were not immediately
available from police.
	   Efforts to reach U.S. embassy officials for further information
Saturday were unsuccessful.
	   The killing comes one year and one day after Willy and Alicia
Merisier of Boston suffered the same fate when they returned to
their home island with dlrs 30,000 in cash and traveler's checks to
build a retirement home.
	   Damas was killed in the Santos area near the capital, where he
was looking at some land, not far from the site where the Merisiers
were killed, according to the security official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and the
official said police suspect robbery was the motive in both
killings.

Ship with some 600 illegal immigrants aground off Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANAKKALE, Turkey (AP _ Police arrested about 400 people after a
ship packed with some 600 illegal immigrants, mostly Kurds, ran
aground off this coastal city on Saturday, an official said.
	   Most of the 400 people arrested were women or children who
disembarked after the Sirinbahce, which was on its way to Italy,
ran aground in strong winds, Gov. Ekrem Ozsoy said. Most of the
passengers swam to the shore, while others used lifeboats.
	   Authorities were searching for the crew and the rest of the
immigrants, including some Afghans, Iraqi Kurds and Africans, said
the governor.
	   No casualties were reported.
	   The exact number of people on board hadn't been counted yet,
according to news reports. The cargo ship originated from Istanbul.
	   The Anatolia news agency said the immigrants told police they
had paid some dlrs 3,000 apiece for the sea voyage, a chance to
slip into Italy, then work their way up to Germany and other
European countries in search of work.
	   Italy has become a gateway for illegal immigrants because of its
porous southern coast and relatively lax immigration laws.
	   Most of the Kurdish migrants are Turks leaving southeastern
Turkey, where the government's 14-year war with Kurdish guerrillas
has ravaged the economy, emptied scores of villages and killed some
37,000 people.
	   While most seek work, the guerrilla group Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK, is suspected of orchestrating the smuggle of the
Kurds into Europe to expand its network.

<TEXT>
	   SAN MANGO D'AQUINO, Italy (AP) _ Italy's Vincenzo Cantatore
knocked out American co-challenger Andy Sample in the third round
of their title fight Saturday night to capture the vacant World
Boxing Union (WBU) light super-heavyweight crown.
	   The previously undefeated American boxer went down after two
minutes and 37 seconds when Cantatore landed a flashing left hook
on his jaw.
	   It was the 18th victory for the 27-year-old Italian, whose
professional career also includes two losses.
	   For Sample, 23, from Topeka, it was the first loss in 23 bouts.
	   American John McClain was stripped of the light super-
heavyweight crown last Wednesday after he asked for a second
postponement of his title defense.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TRIPOLI, Libya _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed
Saturday to secure the handover of two Libyan suspects in the 1988
Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, despite what he called
``fruitful and positive'' talks with Moammar Gadhafi. Annan said,
however, he believed an arrangement for trying the two suspects
could be secured in ``not an inordinate'' amount of time. The
secretary-general spoke to reporters after meeting the Libyan
leader at an undisclosed location in the Libyan desert. Libyan TV
showed Gadhafi, in a brown robe and cap, shaking hands with Annan.
Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan
to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the
Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of an airliner over
Lockerbie that left 270 people dead. (LIBYA-ANNAN)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ The ruling Nationalist Party reversed its
fortunes Saturday, ousting the opposition's top politician as
voters indicated they're in no mood to even think about declaring
independence from China. Former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou,
nicknamed ``Sonny Boy Ma'' for his squeaky clean image and youthful
good looks and charm, led the Nationalist victory by unseating
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party.
The Nationalists also held onto the Taiwanese Legislature, gaining
55 percent of the seats, compared with 52 percent in the last races
three years ago. The results were a blow to the DPP, whose members
had counted on Chen's re-election to propel them toward winning
Taiwan's presidency for the first time during elections in 2000,
when President Lee Teng-hui retires. (TAIWAN-ELECTIONS)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Shops closed and the government ordered all
vehicles off the roads during Saturday's local elections, seen as a
historic first step toward democracy for Africa's most populous
nation. Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a joyous and temporary halt as people walked to
polling stations. The silent streets were a stark contrast to the
usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing traffic of the nation's
cities. But at least one violent incident reportedly marred the
vote. Six people died when supporters of two rival parties at a
polling station near the town of Warri, 125 miles (200 kilometers)
southeast of Lagos, attacked each other with guns and machetes,
witnesses said. The report could not be confirmed. It is the first
vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined his plan earlier this
year to give power to civilians in May after presidential elections
Feb. 15. (NIGERIA-ELECTIONS)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria _ Attackers slashed the throats of eight
villagers in one of several pre-Ramadan strikes blamed on Muslim
militants that have killed 45 people in four days, security and
hospital officials said Saturday. The new wave of violence, barely
two weeks before the start of the holy month, also came before a
state-of-the-nation speech planned for Sunday by Prime Minister
Ahmed Ouyahia. He was expected to announce his resignation ahead of
early elections. Among the latest attacks, a group slashed the
throats of eight villagers overnight Friday in the mountain village
of El Kadiria near Blida, 30 miles south of Algiers, security
forces said. Algeria's insurgency broke out after the
military-backed government canceled January 1992 elections the
Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win. At least 75,000 people
have been killed since then, and the insurgency always intensifies
around Ramadan. (ALGERIA)
	   NEW DELHI, India _ Riot police guarded dozens of places of
worship across India Saturday to prevent religious violence while
Hindu right-wingers prepared to mark the sixth anniversary of the
razing of a disputed medieval mosque. Hundreds of armed police
cordoned off the small town of Ayodhya, where the 16th century
Babri Mosque was demolished by thousands of frenzied members of
Hindu nationalist groups on Dec. 6, 1992. People were prohibited
from congregating anywhere in the town on Sunday, the United News
of India quoted officials as saying. The destruction of the mosque
six years ago set off Hindu-Muslim riots that killed 2,000 people.
Hindu leaders claimed the mosque was built 400 years ago by Mogul
invaders using the rubble of a Hindu shrine they tore down. Many
people believe the shrine stood on the birthplace of Ram, an
important Hindu deity. (INDIA-DEMOLITION ANNIVERSARY)

Wife of human rights activist visits him in detention

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The wife of an Egyptian human rights
activist visited him in detention for the first time Saturday and
his lawyers said they were suing the government for blocking access
to their client.
	   Nehal Abu al-Qumsan said her husband, Hafez Abu Saada, had
refused to eat for the first 48 hours after he was detained Tuesday
on an accusation of receiving foreign money to harm Egypt's
reputation.
	   Warders had shaved his head and put him in a crowded cell with
poor ventilation and a bad smell, the Center for Human Rights Legal
Aid quoted Abu al-Qumsan as saying.
	   Abu Saada, the secretary general of the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights, has now resumed eating. After he protested,
warders moved him to a better cell with only two other inmates, Abu
al-Qumsan said.
	   She did not say why her husband had initially boycotted food.
She said she had been allowed to bring him food and clothes.
	   The Center for Human Rights Legal Aid said Abu Saada's lawyers
had decided to sue the ministers of justice and interior, the
prosecutor general and the head of the prisons service for barring
them from visiting their client.
	   The National Committee for the Defense of Prisoners of Opinion
demanded Abu Saada's release on Saturday, saying he was ``a
prisoner of opinion.''
	   The Cairo-based committee also demanded that the government halt
what it called a ``police campaign against democratic forces in
Egypt.'' Foreign human rights groups have also called on the
government to release Abu Saada.
	   Abu Saada's human rights group had said it accepted a donation
of dlrs 25,703 from a British Parliament committee.
	   An Egyptian weekly, Al-Osboa, alleged the donation was a
``payment'' for a report by the group that accused police of
arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic Christians in a criminal
investigation in a southern Egyptian village in August. The
magazine has close ties to the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for security in Egypt.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations but
transferred four policeman from the village, pending an
investigation.
	   Early this week the rights group said it was returning the
British donation.

Ex-heavyweight champ to sell houses near Cleveland, New York, Las
</HEADLINE>
Vegas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ There will be no open house at this home.
	   Boxer Mike Tyson is selling his 62-acre (25-hectare) estate in
Trumbull County along with homes in Las Vegas and Farmington,
Connecticut, The Plain Dealer reported Saturday. Total asking
price: $21 million.
	   The former heavyweight champ is selling the homes because he is
training in the Phoenix area and plans to spend more time on the
West Coast of the United States, said Mike Farris, a real estate
broker in Las Vegas and one-time head of security for Tyson.
	   ``He doesn't spend any time at these properties,'' Farris said.
	   Farris said Tyson and his wife, Monica, who also own a home in
Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington, will be looking for property
on the West Coast.
	   The house in Trumbull County, about 65 kilometers (40 miles)
southeast of Cleveland, has an asking price of dlrs 2.2 million. It
has six to eight bedrooms, a 900-square-meter (10,000-square-foot)
room with a pool, a regulation-size basketball court and a theater
room decorated in zebra-striped carpeting.
	   He bought the property in 1989 for dlrs 305,000.
	   Farris is selling the home with Michelle Holcomb, a real estate
agent in Ravenna.
	   ``No tours and no open houses,'' she told the newspaper. ``This
will be for qualified buyers, by appointment only, and they will
have to contact me.''
	   Tyson also is selling a mansion in Las Vegas next door to
entertainer Wayne Newton in a neighborhood where the Sultan of
Brunei has a home. Asking price for the mansion with 1,170 square
meters (13,000 square feet), 10 bedrooms, a wine cellar, gymnasium
and guest house: dlrs 5.9 million.
	   The asking price on the 5,040-square-meter (56,000-square-foot)
Connecticut house has been reduced from dlrs 22 million to dlrs 13
million. The house has 20 bedrooms, seven kitchens, five dining
rooms, a theater, dance club, Olympic-size pool, indoor shooting
range, glass elevator, 24 bathrooms and 14 half-baths (toilet but
no shower or bathtub).

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on bank robber, Christopher Reeve, Jewel,
Rudolph the reindeer.

<TEXT>
	   FORT LUPTON, Colorado (AP) _ A 4-foot-11 woman (1.52 meters)
tried to rob a bank while wearing a black garbage bag over her
head, with holes cut out for her arms and eyes, police said.
	   The disguise left Angela Martinez, 70, almost completely covered
as she entered the Bank of Colorado, police said.
	   ``The would-be robber, with other bank customers staring at her,
went to the front of a line and demanded money from a bank
teller,'' Lt. Joe Perales said.
	   Bank tellers alerted police, who arrested Ms. Martinez right
away Monday.
	   Ms. Martinez is also a suspect in a Brighton bank robbery
carried out last month by a small woman wearing a trash bag, police
said. Robert Altman, Sylvester Stallone.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Rudolph the real reindeer wasn't as
eager to please as the one in the song, causing havoc for a week in
the outlying regions of the Finnish capital.
	   The six-year-old Rudolph was brought last month from central
Finland to Sotunki, outside Helsinki, where he was to entertain
children and give sled rides.
	   But on Nov. 22, he fled his enclosure, apparently spooked by a
galloping horse, and plunged into the woods. Farmers reported
several sightings, and motorists sometimes had to swerve to avoid
the renegade reindeer.
	   With the help of vigilant reindeer-spotters, Rudolph was nabbed
by his previous owner who came south and tracked him down, the
Ilta-Sanomat newspaper said Tuesday.
	   There are an estimated 200,000 reindeer in Finland, bred mainly
by the Samis in Lapland, northern Finland. They are tame, unlike in
neighboring Norway and Sweden where there are also herds of wild
reindeer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With a new album out, a best-selling book of
poetry on store shelves and a role as a Civil War widow in the
upcoming film ``Ride With the Devil,'' Jewel has more than enough
success to satisfy the post-adolescent worries that fueled her
first album _ and her poetry.
	   ``I'm starting to get over myself,'' the 24-year-old singer says
in the latest issue of Rolling Stone. ``All that poetry was written
from 15 to 22 or something. It's very self-absorbed: `What is love?
What isn't love? I'm noticing that poetry doesn't seem to interest
me anymore.''
	   She has the same grown-up criticism for her smash debut album,
``Pieces of You'' _ made when she was 19 _ especially now that her
new album ``Spirit'' is finished.
	   ```Pieces of You' is not a good record,'' she says, unhappy with
her guitar playing and singing. ``It's an embarrassing record,
ultimately. It's like having your dirty laundry aired out. I didn't
think people would hear it. But it made me realize that all people
want is to be touched. They don't care if it's Celine Dion, Meat
Loaf, or me.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PISCATAWAY, New Jersey (AP) _ Paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve
is encouraged by global efforts to get damaged nerves to
regenerate.
	   ``In the few years I've been injured, instead of hearing what
are we going to do, I'm hearing of patents, FDA trials, how to
humanize antibodies which we know work in rats. And that dialogue
is very satisfying to hear,'' Reeve said Friday at a groundbreaking
for a new neuroscience lab at Rutgers University. ``I'm so grateful
we have a worldwide effort going on.''
	   Among those present was Sang Lan, the young Chinese gymnast
paralyzed at the Goodwill Games.
	   The Center for Collaborative Neuroscience is scheduled to open
in fall 1999. The dlrs 3.2 million facility is intended to bring
together researchers from all over the world, with Internet and
video-conferencing capabilities.

Another wiped out downhill has likely doomed Whistler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Stands as RECAP to Sports-Skiing-Men-Downhill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ The second postponement in as
many days of a men's downhill has placed World Cup racing on
western Canada's Whistler mountain in serious doubt for the future.
	   Gunther Hujara, men's chief race director for the International
Ski Federation, finally voiced what organizers feared all week when
he said three years of weather problems makes it almost impossible
for him to include Whistler on next year's calendar.
	   ``We're at the point we have to be honest. I can only say it's
really in jeopardy,'' Hujara said.
	   ``It will be really tough for me to come up with a proposal
again to put Whistler on the calendar. I can not propose it once
more.''
	   Organizers will try to hold the downhill Sunday but a scheduled
super-giant race has been cancelled. Poor weather at the Pacific
mountain resort has wiped out the race the last two years.
	   ``If we have an event (Sunday) it doesn't change that fact too
much,'' Hujara said.
	   ``We have to follow reasonable facts. We tried it three years in
a row now, really tried it.''
	   A heavy shroud of fog covered sections of the Dave Murray course
Saturday, making racing impossible. Thursday's training run was the
first time since 1995 a racer had actually skied the course.
	   If the World Cup doesn't return to Whistler, it might not come
back to Canada at all next year. Hujara was blunt in rejecting Lake
Louise, Alberta, as a possibility and FIS is cool to the idea of
returning to Panorama, British Columbia.
	   Nick Wilson, Alpine Canada's director of World Cup events,
refused to say World Cup racing is finished in Canada.
	   ``We have some challenges we've got to review and overcome,''
Wilson said. ``We're going to do that and that's all I can comment
on right now. Obviously we don't want to not be on the calendar.
We're going to exhaust all possibilities.''
	   Peter Webb, chair of the W5 group which organized the race, was
stunned by Hujara's comments.
	   ``It's a surprise to me that he was quite so strong,'' Webb
said.
	   ``My understanding there was an agreement with Gunther there
would be no declaration at this point. If we couldn't pull it off
we'd all sit down in the spring and talk about the whole thing and
think it through carefully.''
	   Webb said it costs about dlrs 1.5 million to host the downhill
and super-G race. The group also spent dlrs 200,000 this year on
safety equipment for the track.
	   ``We're not ready to say the hell with it,'' he said.
	   ``We have too much at stake. We have too much invested in the
way of emotional capital. We do have to think about when and what's
the right way of doing this which is different than let's not do it
at all.''
	   There have been 14 World Cup events in Whistler since 1975.
Problems with either fog, rain or heavy dumps of snow forced
cancellation of races in 1988, 1996 and 1997.
	   Until 1996, Whistler races were held in late February or March,
when weather conditions are more favorable.
	   Three years ago FIS decided to open its downhill season in North
American where fall snow conditions are much better than Europe.
	   The European racers hate flying to North America too often. They
would object to any calendar which schedules races in the United
States before Christmas, then a return to Whistler in March.
	   ``The bulk of the calendar works for 99 percent of the
organizations,'' Hujara. ``We can not change the whole calendar for
the one percent that is losing.''

Hetherington-Mediate ahead after Saturday's 3rd round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALM HARBOR, Florida (AP) _ The team of Rachel Hetherington and
Rocco Mediate shot a 9-under-par 62 in best-ball play Saturday to
take a two-stroke lead heading into the final round of modified
alternate-stroke play in the JCPenney Classic.
	   The Hetherington-Mediate team are 23-under par through 54 holes,
two strokes ahead of Chris Johnson and Steve Lowery at Innisbrook
Resort's Copperhead course.
	   ``If you are with one of the girls who can drive it good you
have an advantage,'' Mediate said. ``And she also putts good.
That's a good thing.''
	   It helped make for bogeyless day during which Mediate produced
six birdies _ including a chip-in on the second hole _ while
Hetherington added three of her own.
	   ``I'm excited,'' Hetherington said. ``I haven't met many of the
PGA players before. In Australia, we only get to see a few events.
The British Open, the U.S. Open, the PGA. We get up real early to
watch them. I love watching the guys. It's neat to see some of
those players here.''
	   Johnson-Lowery shot a 6-under 65 to reach 21 under and Meg
Mallon and Steve Pate (66) were three back at 20 under. Dale
Eggeling-Fuzzy Zoeller (64) and Catrin Nilsmark-Chris Perry (66)
were at 19 under.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A bus driver apparently fell asleep at the
wheel and plowed into two buses Saturday, killing seven people and
injuring 50 in northern Mexico, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   Police said Jose Luis Reyes Macias was speeding when he hit the
other two buses, which had stopped on Highway 45 in Chihuahua state
to help victims of a car accident. Two women and five men,
including one of the other bus drivers, were killed.
	   It was unclear whether passengers who were injured in the
initial car accident were among the victims reported.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A thick haze of smog hung over the Valley of
Mexico on Saturday, forcing authorities to order a third straight
day of traffic restrictions that will keep half of the city's older
vehicles off the streets.
	   Levels of ozone, a colorless, odorless pollutant formed by a
chemical reaction of exhaust fumes and sunlight, stood at 180
points Saturday on a scale in which 100 points is considered the
maximum acceptable limit.
	   The city's environment secretary, Alejandro Encinas, said
reports of dry cough, sore throats, headaches and irritated eyes
have jumped 50 percent in the last two days, the government news
agency Notimex reported.
	   Along with vehicle restrictions, the smog alert requires city
factories to reduce their activities by 40 percent.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party will hold primary
elections to choose its presidential candidate for the first time
in its 69 years in power, according to a top party official.
	   Such an election is likely to cause a more open and heated
struggle for the 2000 presidential nomination than ever seen before
in the once tightly disciplined Institutional Revolutionary Party,
known as the PRI.
	   The government news agency Notimex quoted Carlos Rojas
Gutierrez, general secretary of the PRI's national executive
committee, as saying Friday that the primary vote would be ``direct
and secret.''
	   Presidential nominees traditionally have been selected by the
sitting president from among his Cabinet.
	   It remains unclear whether all registered voters would be
allowed to cast ballots in the primary _ as was the case in the
1998 state primaries _ or if the voting would be limited to
card-carrying PRI members.
	    &UR; ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest accused of beating to death a
Catholic bishop has been hospitalized, suffering from an ulcer,
pneumonia and stress.
	   The Rev. Mario Najera Orantes was taken to the private Old City
hospital late Friday under heavy guard. His lawyer, Jose Toledo
Paz, said the priest has an ulcer and bronchial pneumonia.
	   Orantes was arrested July 22 for allegedly bludgeoning Bishop
Juan Gerardi, 75, to death in April in the garage of the San
Sebastian Church parish house.
	   The prosecutor investigating the case resigned this week, but
gave no specific reason. Church leaders say Orantes has been
wrongly accused, and the Human Rights Office of the Archbishop had
called on Otto Ardon Medina to step down. Ardon's replacement has
not been named.
	   Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina has yet to decide whether to start
proceedings against Orantes, who also was hospitalized July 29 with
respiratory problems.

Army wins classic rivalry marred by railing collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES injuries. &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Army vs. Navy is supposed to more than just
a game, but not like this.
	   Army beat Navy 34-30 in one of American college football's
greatest rivalries Saturday, but the highest-scoring game in the
99-year history of the series was marred by an accident in which
nine people fell out of the stands and were injured.
	   The accident occurred after Ty Amey's 70-yard touchdown run gave
Army a 31-30 lead. A railing behind the east end zone gave way, and
Army cadets and prep students fell about 4 1-2 meters (15 feet)
onto the playing field.
	   Seven of the nine injured were expected to be released with
injuries such as sprained ankles, necks and backs, a U.S. Military
Academy spokesman said.
	   Two more were also in stable condition, but needed more tests,
including the one with a broken bone in his neck.
	   ``There is a broken bone in the neck, however his spine is OK
and they're doing other tests,'' Capt. John Cornelio said.
	   After a 31-minute delay, Eric Olsen's 26-yard field goal
provided the final margin as Army (3-8) avenged last year's 39-7
loss to Navy (3-8) at Giants Stadium near New York City.
	   The 64 points broke the previous record of 55, reached in 1959
and 1983.
	   Army came back from a 30-19 deficit at the start of the fourth
quarter, preventing the Midshipmen from winning consecutive games
in the series for the first time since 1982-83. It was Army's sixth
victory in the last seven years, and the sixth game in the 1990s
decided by fewer than five points.
	   But the scary accident cast a somber tone over the postgame
celebration.
	   The uniformed fans were cheering for television cameras after
Army took a 31-30 lead on Amey's 70-yard TD run with 7:33 left in
the game. A railing in front of the first row of seats gave way,
causing the personnel to fall.
	   Several stretchers were summoned, and the game was suspended
with 6:08 left as four ambulances drove onto the field.
	   The injured were four cadets from the U.S. Military Academy in
West Point, New York, and five students from the academy's prep
school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, said Army's sports information
department.
	   Gerald Ravitz, father of Army co-captain Neil Ravitz, was on the
field and said he saw the first person to hit the ground.
	   ``It could have been my kid in the stands,'' said Ravitz, in
tears.
	   Amey rushed 13 times for 134 yards, and Craig Stucker had seven
rushes for 106 yards for Army, whose No. 1-rated rushing offense
amassed 401 yards.
	   The comeback and the collapsed railings overshadowed a
record-breaking performance by Navy's Ryan Read, whose 128 pass
receiving yards were the most ever in the series, which began in
1890.
	   Read's 69-yard TD reception from Brian Broadwater in the second
quarter was the longest pass play in series history. It was Navy's
longest pass play in this game since Roger Staubach, who later went
on to play professionally with the Dallas Cowboys, hit Nick Markoff
for 65 yards in 1962.
	   Read's three catches for 128 yards broke an 84-year-old record
held by Army's Lou Merillat, who had 115 yards in the 1914 game.
	   Broadwater was 7-for-17 for 188 yards. Army's Joe Gerena, a
sophomore who relieved Johnny Goff after the senior fumbled twice,
rushed for 92 yards.

Nigerians begin the march to democracy with municipal elections

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's democratic transition plan has
made it through its first major hurdle, with local elections marked
by a huge turnout of buoyant voters but also the reported killings
of six people.
	   Nigeria, a country filled with ethnic tension, crime and
corruption, came to a joyous and temporary halt Saturday as people
walked to polling stations. The silent streets were a stark
contrast to the usual frenzied commerce and paralyzing traffic of
the nation's cities.
	   It was the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians in May after
presidential elections Feb. 15. Abubakar took power after the
unexpected June death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who detained, tortured
and occasionally killed his opponents.
	   Election organizers said the turnout was high. More than 50
million people were registered to vote for some 8,800 municipal
government posts. Nine parties have registered and three have
fielded candidates nationwide.
	   The national electoral commission is inexperienced and the
political parties have vague platforms and are relatively unknown.
	   ``The government has done its part and it is now up to Nigerians
and the politicians to play their own,'' Abubakar said after voting
Saturday afternoon.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Shops around Africa's most populous country were closed Saturday
and streets, and all motorized traffic was banned during voting to
prevent protests and traffic jams. Children played soccer, while
adults filed by on their way to the polls.
	   Nigeria sealed its borders late Friday and about 100,000 riot
police patrolled the major cities and rural villages amid fears of
violence.
	   Rival supporters of two parties campaigning at a polling station
near the town of Warri, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast
of Lagos, attacked each other with guns and machetes, killing six
people before police broke up the fighting, witnesses said. The
clash reportedly occurred after the groups accused each other of
trying to rig the vote. The report could not be confirmed.
	   Ethnic tensions had prompted authorities to cancel polling in a
number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria,
including some villages around Warri.
	   But in most places the mood was positive. At one police station
in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital and largest city, officers
released prisoners awaiting trial so they could vote. It was
unclear if the move had been approved by senior authorities or if
the prisoners would be sought to return behind bars.
	   ``Even detainees are entitled to vote,'' said a police sergeant
on duty who asked to remain anonymous. ``I will also go vote when I
leave duty.''
	   Nigeria, a country of more than 100 million people that has
failed to tackle grinding poverty despite fabulous oil wealth that
has made it the world's sixth largest producer, has a history of
armed coups and military meddling in politics. The country has been
ruled by civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   Scattered logistical problems were reported _ a few people's
names were missing from voters' lists in Abuja and Lagos and
polling began late in some stations. Officials also said youths
stole election material and disrupted voting in some communities in
the western state of Osun.
	   Some voters said they did not know who the candidates in their
constituencies were. They said they were voting for whoever
represented their favorite party.
	   Femi Olayemi, a civil servant in Lagos, said he was voting for
his children's future.
	   ``If we do not vote, we will not have any reason to tell the
military that they should leave power,'' he said.

Annan says talks with Gadhafi were positive but no final results
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with new quotes from Annan, Libyan
minister &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN BENEDYK &QC;

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan believes
the two Libyans wanted for the 1988 Pan Am bombing could be brought
to trial in a ``not an inordinate'' amount of time.
	   Speaking before he left Libya in the early hours of Sunday,
Annan said his talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had been
``fruitful and positive,'' though they had not concluded with an
agreement on the suspects' hand over.
	   The secretary-general talked to reporters after meeting Gadhafi
at an undisclosed location in the Libyan desert. Libyan TV showed
the Libyan leader, in a brown robe and cap, shaking hands with
Annan in a tent.
	   Saturday was a long day of diplomacy for the 60-year-old Annan.
He left Jerba, Tunisia, in the morning for Tripoli, held talks with
the Libyan foreign minister in the coastal city of Sirte _ 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Tripoli _ and then took what was
said to be a two-hour journey to his desert meeting with Gadhafi.
	   Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British
plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in
the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of an airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that left 270 people dead.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said after
his meeting with Gadhafi. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and
readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said. ``It will require some time but not
an inordinate amount.''
	   Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser confirmed Annan's
assessment of the timeframe. Speaking to reporters alongside the
secretary general, al-Muntasser said the Lockerbie case ``needs
some procedural and legal matters to be attended to,'' but they
would not take a long time.
	   The United Nations and Libya have ``agreed to work seriously in
order to solve the Lockerbie case and guarantee a fair trial'' for
the suspects, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the foreign
minister as saying.
	   Annan returned to Jerba early Sunday, telling reporters ``I am
tired.'' Asked how his talks with Gadhafi had gone, the secretary
general said ``useful, useful.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported Annan might not be able to meet with the
leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   Earlier, Libyan media said Gadhafi did not have the authority to
hand over the suspects, suggesting he was giving himself room in
case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United
States and Britain.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah would have to be approved by
some 500 grassroots national committees before being decided by the
parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the report, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., did not say whether the Lockerbie issue would
be discussed.
	   Most reporters were barred from traveling with Annan from
Tripoli to Sirte.
	   While Libyan media gave few reports about the visit, ordinary
Libyans were aware of the developments and many said they oppose
handing over the suspects.
	   ``We should never surrender our children no matter what the
price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed Abdel-Salam said.
	   Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown market,
said the men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and we have
law,'' he said.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from the Tunisian
resort island of Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992
for its refusal to hand over the two suspects, allegedly Libyan
intelligence agents.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law and using Scottish
judges.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed that
the trial be held in a neutral country. Since then, a new hurdle
has cropped up over the imprisonment of the suspects, if convicted.
Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United
States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and
refuse to negotiate the issue.
	   The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's
economic lifeblood, though some Libyan assets abroad have been
frozen. They ban air travel to and from the country and arms sales,
but many African countries have defied the air ban and their
leaders have flown in and out of Libya.

Redoing a classic: 'A boy's best friend is his mother'

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Untold numbers of women refused to step in a
shower after seeing Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic thriller,
``Psycho.''
	   The scene was one of the first in the movies to graphically
depict a murder. While the camera cut from Janet Leigh's face to
her stomach to the hacking knife held by the unknown figure on the
other side of the shower curtain, viewers felt the horror with each
cut. And because the editing was so adept, the camera never really
lingered on any one aspect of the killing.
	   The film can boast other distinctions: It was Hitchcock's only
horror movie and his biggest moneymaker, and it is the only film in
history to be remade, scene-by-scene.
	   The new 1998 ``Psycho,'' is said to differ from the original
black and white film only by being in color and by using, of
course, different actors.
	   Universal Pictures has refused to allow reviewers and movie
writers into early screenings of the movie, so the reviews aren't
in yet. But the venture has already been knocked by critics as
symptomatic of Hollywood's lack of originality.
	   The remake is the work of Gus Van Sant, a director of quirky,
modestly budgeted movies like ``Drugstore Cowboy'' and ``My Own
Private Idaho'' until last year's ``Good Will Hunting'' made him
bankable.
	   Van Sant, who in 1960 was a 13-year-old in Louisville, Kentucky,
was given the option to remake a movie from Universal's film
library and he chose ``Psycho,'' with the proviso that he would
reproduce the film exactly as Hitchcock had made it.
	   The cast includes Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins
in the original), Anne Heche as the shower victim (Janet Leigh),
William H. Macy as the private detective (Martin Balsam), Julianne
Moore as Heche's sister (Vera Miles) and Viggo Mortensen as Heche's
lover (John Gavin).
	   ``I didn't start out to make an important movie,'' Hitchcock
told Francois Truffaut in conversations that became the book
``Hitchcock.''
	   ``I thought I could have fun with this subject and this
situation. The picture cost dlrs 800,000. It was an experiment in
this sense: Could I make a feature film under the same conditions
as a television show? I used a television crew to shoot it very
quickly.''
	   In 1959, Hitchcock became interested in a book called
``Psycho,'' by Robert Bloch, because of a favorable review in The
New York Times. But he was busy editing ``North by Northwest'' and
preparing a film for Audrey Hepburn. When the project fell through,
he considered ``Psycho,'' based on a grisly murder case in
Wisconsin. The purchase price: a paltry dlrs 9,000.
	   After one failed script by another writer, Joseph Stefano
delivered a version that won Hitchcock's approval. But not
Paramount Pictures'. Hitchcock's home studio agreed to release the
film but declined to finance it, considering the subject matter too
grim. The director's own company paid the bills.
	   Hitchcock's thrift was exemplified in the actors' salaries.
According to ``Psycho: Behind the Scenes of the Classic Thriller,''
written by Miss Leigh with Christopher Nickens, she received dlrs
40,000 (as opposed to her usual dlrs 100,000). Perkins got dlrs
40,000; Gavin, dlrs 30,000; Miles dlrs 10,000; and Balsam, dlrs
6,000.
	   Ted Knight, later Ted Baxter on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,''
earned dlrs 200 to be a silent police guard at the film's end.
	   Hitchcock splurged only once during the filming. The shower
scene involved 71 or 78 setups, according to different sources, and
consumed seven days.
	   ``Mr. Hitchcock never asked me to do the scene nude,'' Miss
Leigh writes in her book. She pointed out that the industry's
strict self-censorship allowed no nudity.
	   She added: ``Doing the scene nude would have cheated Hitch and
millions of movie fans, because all would have missed his mastery
of insinuating situations and conditions.'' Patches of moleskin
covered revealing areas. A nude model acted as a stand-in for
planning camera angles.
	   The director's mastery evoked terror without any view of the
knife striking the body.
	   ``It's rather unusual to kill the star in the first third of the
picture,'' Hitchcock told Truffaut. ``I purposely killed the star
to make the killing even more unexpected.
	   ``That's why I insisted that audiences be kept out of the
theaters once the picture had started, because the latecomers would
have been waiting to see Janet Leigh after she has disappeared from
the screen action.''
	   ``Psycho'' opened on March 8, 1960, to shrieks from audiences
and catcalls by critics.
	   ``'Psycho' is plainly a gimmick movie whose suspense depends on
a single, specific twist,'' grumbled Newsweek.
	   ``I think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind, a
mean, sly, sadistic little mind,'' sniffed Dwight McDonald.
	   ``A blot on an honorable career,'' scoffed The New York Times.
	   But the movie also received favorable reviews, and praise from
the industry as well. Said filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich (``The Last
Picture Show''): ``Probably the most visual, most cinematic picture
he ever made.''
	   The opening box-office also was positive: dlrs 15 million.
That's small change by today's standards, but in 1960, when the
average ticket price was 75 cents, ``Psycho'' was a blockbuster.
``Rear Window,'' ``To Catch a Thief,'' ``North by Northwest'' and
other Hitchcock hits may have grossed more, but ``Psycho'' was more
profitable because of the low production costs.
	   Hitchcock, Miss Leigh, cinematographer John L. Russell and art
directors Joseph Hurley and Robert Clatworthy were nominated for
Academy Awards. Anthony Perkins was not. Hitchcock wired him: ``I
am ashamed of your fellow actors.'' None of the film's nominees won
Oscars.
	   Paramount's snub of ``Psycho'' prompted Hitchcock's move to
Universal, where he became very rich with television as well as
features. Universal acquired the rights to ``Psycho,'' resulting in
three sequels starring Perkins and now the copycat version.
	   In his 1966 conversations, Truffaut suggested that audiences
responded to ``Psycho'' not only because of the story or the
performances. ``They were aroused by pure film,'' he said.
	   Hitchcock responded: ``That's why I take pride in the fact that
'Psycho,' more than any other of my films, is a film that belongs
to filmmakers, to you and me.''

Will Smith's star continues to rise with 'Enemy of the State'

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ According to the rules of physics _ and
Hollywood _ everything that goes up must come down.
	   So after a string of career highs _ a hit TV show, two
blockbuster films and a multiplatinum rap career _ Will Smith
admits he's a ``little nervous'' with the release of his latest
project, the thriller ``Enemy of the State.''
	   ``I'm not missing too much,'' he said recently, as he sipped
coffee at an upscale New York hotel. ``Film after film I'm scoring
and people are reacting well, so it's inevitable with any ups there
are going to be downs. I'm trying to avoid them as much as I can.''
	   So far, he's doing a pretty good job. The Philadelphia native
first made waves as part of the rap act DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh
Prince, then parlayed that success into the television series,
``The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' which ended its six-year run in
1996.
	   Smith won acclaim with his debut role as a bisexual con artist
in ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' and showed some box-office
swagger with the hit movie ``Bad Boys,'' co-starring comedian
Martin Lawrence.
	   But it wasn't until the blockbusters ``Independence Day'' and
``Men in Black'' that people finally began connecting Will Smith
with superstardom _ and box-office gold.
	   It's not surprising why Smith has vaulted to the top _ he's the
guy everyone wants as a friend. Tall (6 feel 2 inches or 1.87
meters) and attractive, Smith, who recently celebrated his 30th
birthday, has an endearing personality and a great comic instinct.
Those qualities, plus a killer smile, have endeared him to movie
audiences worldwide in mostly supporting or sidekick performances.
	   Now, even though his latest film stars Academy Award-winning
actors Gene Hackman and Jon Voight, it is Smith who's the top draw.
	   Even Smith marvels at his current standing among Hollywood's
elite.
	   ``For six months I knew I was going to be working with Gene
Hackman and like the third day of shooting and I'm already on
screen with Gene Hackman,'' he said. ``So, we did our first take,
and he leans over to me and says (Smith does his best Hackman
impression), 'That was a good job there, son.' And that kind of
inspired me, and I was like, 'OK, we've gotten over that hump.'''
	   ``Enemy of the State,'' features Smith as a successful lawyer
who unwittingly becomes a target of rogue agents who believe he has
evidence that implicates them in a murder. It features conspiracy
theories, high-tech spying, car chases galore and the inevitable
movie explosion.
	   It is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, whose movie credits read
like one long car chase and/or explosion: ``The Rock,'' ``Beverly
Hills Cop'' and ``Top Gun,'' the latter of which starred Tom
Cruise. Actually, Cruise was the first choice for Smith's role, but
he was busy shooting Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which
has been shooting for the past year and a half.
	   ``I don't have any problems taking Tom Cruise's seconds,'' Smith
says with a laugh. ``I will eat off of Tom Cruise's cinematic plate
any day of the week.''
	   An even greater sign of Smith's mainstream success may be his
future role in Barry Sonnenfeld's movie version of the ``The Wild
Wild West'' in which Smith was cast as James West. Back in old TV
series, West was a white man played by Robert Conrad. Even Smith
was surprised when Sonnefeld, who produced ``Men in Black,'' called
on Smith for the film.
	   ``I'm saying to him, 'Barry, I'm black,' and he's like, 'No one
cares that you're black, no one cares.' And in a way I think he's
correct about that,'' he said. ``It's a weird dichotomy because no
one cares and everyone cares at the same time.''
	   Not only does Smith have a potential blockbuster in movie
theaters, he recently signed a deal with Universal Pictures to
start his own production company, Overbrook Entertainment. At the
same time, he is eyeing film projects with Whitney Houston and a
possible biopic on Muhammad Ali.
	   Smith also hasn't forgotten his music career. He has a hit album
on the chart, ``Big Willie Style.'' It is his first album in years
and a best seller. He also won a Grammy this year for best rap solo
performance for the single, ``Men in Black.''
	   At first Smith was unsure if he should return to the rap arena.
A little nudge by someone close to him, however, changed his mind.
	   ``I was really nervous about the big change that hip hop had
undertaken, when that whole gangsta rap thing took over the
mainstream of hip hop. It was just dark, and the darkness was
putting out my light a little bit,'' he said. ``Jada kind of
convinced me to go ahead and make the records that I wanted to make
and make people have to deal with me rather than me have to deal
with them.''
	   Jada is fellow actor and wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who in July
gave birth to a baby boy, Jaden. He is Pinkett Smith's first child
and Smith's second _ he has another son, Willard ``Trey'' Smith,
from his marriage to Sheree Smith, which dissolved after three
years.
	   A smile comes to his face when he mentions Jada's name _ which
is frequently. He calls her his best friend, and said the two had a
``spiritual marriage'' long before their New Year's Eve wedding
date.
	   ``It just felt right. It didn't feel like this was something
that was this big huge life decision. I felt like I was going to be
with her for the rest of my life anyway,'' he said. ``We weren't
even going to have a wedding, we were going to basically get
married in a quick ceremony. But our family was like, 'Hold on!'
Jada's mother wasn't having it.''
	   When seeing the couple in public, they seem to be totally in
love and in sync. But Smith said they both realize the pitfalls
that can doom a relationship, and they know it will take a lot of
work to keep it strong.
	   ``Nothing you love was easy to attain, and we're very clear and
very realistic about our situation,'' he said. ``We have a very
realistic outlook on the world. It makes it so much easier when you
deal with what's real, rather than dealing with what you wish was
real. It's so much easier when you're with someone who is willing
to accept reality rather than create this fantasy.''
	   Of course, a little humor doesn't hurt either.
	   ``Jada said to me the other day, 'You are one of the biggest
movie stars in the world. You just sold 8 million albums with your
record. You are at the peak of your career and you got married.' I
said 'Yeah?'''
	   Jada's reply: ``That was just stupid.''
	   Then Smith laughs, flashing that killer smile.

Chorus calling for Cate's coronation

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A chorus is calling for Cate Blanchett's
coronation. Oscar buzz surrounds her performance as ``Elizabeth.''
Co-star Geoffrey Rush admires her ``chameleonlike'' quality. And
the film's director, Shekhar Kapur, likens her to Meryl Streep.
	   Yet Blanchett, who indeed has displayed protean looks and
redoubtable talents in her movies, expresses doubts about her
career.
	   ``I've got a very ambivalent relationship to acting,'' she says
over lunch at a midtown Manhattan hotel.
	   The 29-year-old Australian studied fine arts and economics at
Melbourne University before deciding she'd give drama school a go.
Then, by her third year, she thought: ``I'll give it five years out
of drama school and see if I'm getting work and if I'm not then
there's plenty of other people out there to do it.''
	   She still characterizes her commitment to acting as ``a sort of
day-by-day, month-by-month thing.''
	   She says she has had fulfilling experiences both in the theater
in Sydney, where she still makes her home, and in the few film jobs
that she's had.
	   ``If I'm lucky enough for that run of good luck to continue,
then I'll probably keep doing it.''
	   But she says she wouldn't want to do something just for the sake
of just doing it.
	   ``It's like being involved in a relationship with someone you
don't feel love for. What's the point? What are either of you going
to get out of it? There's enough people out there who are
passionate about things.''
	   Blanchett made her feature film debut last year in Bruce
Beresford's little-seen, much-panned ``Paradise Road,'' about a
Japanese POW camp for women in World War II, co-starring with Glenn
Close and Frances McDormand. Next came ``Thank God He Met Lizzie.''
(During the production, she met her husband, Andrew Upton, a
continuity editor and second-unit director.) Then, opposite Ralph
Fiennes in Gillian Armstrong's ``Oscar and Lucinda,'' she played a
headstrong 19th-century heiress who loves to gamble.
	   One similarity between Lucinda and England's Queen Elizabeth I,
Blanchett says, is that both were thoroughly and beautifully
described (one in literature and one in history) and both are
larger than life.
	   ``I prefer to do things that are bigger than me, to be part of
something that's bigger than me rather than reducing everything
down all the time,'' she says.
	   Blanchett says Kapur's involvement as director persuaded her to
take on ``Elizabeth.'' She liked the Indian director's best-known
film, ``Bandit Queen,'' and felt that with him on board ``it
wouldn't be this sort of standard biopic.''
	   She did a lot of research, reading the so-called Virgin Queen's
letters and delving into various biographies and historical
accounts, including a book her husband gave her. But that only
carries you so far, she says, ``Because in the end, you have to let
that go. All you can do at the end of the day is play the scene,
and work with the other actors.''
	   Blanchett talks about how the film explores ``the exorcism of
personal needs and desires in order to rule,'' since Elizabeth
forsook her personal life to solidify her power.
	   And what has she given up?
	   ``Stability, security,'' she says, laughing.
	   Married about 18 months ago, she has been unable to spend all of
that time with her new husband, but she has no regrets. ``I'm not a
great believer in regret, and fortunately neither is my husband.
	   ``It's a constant negotiation,'' she says, adding that unlike
Elizabeth, she has a partner who is willing to compromise, and
she's willing to compromise, too. ``You just have to be very
careful, I think.''
	   She smiles and becomes monosyllabic when answering questions
about her background, briefly saying that she has two siblings, her
mother lives in Australia and her father died when she was 10.
	   Despite protestations about privacy, Blanchett will be highly
visible to the public for some time to come.
	   Next year, she plans to star in a revival of David Hare's
``Plenty'' in London, and she'll be making two more films _ an
adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play, ``An Ideal Husband,'' with
Rupert Everett, Gabriel Byrne and Minnie Driver, and ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley,'' directed by Anthony Minghella, who made the multiple
Academy Award-winning ``The English Patient.''
	   Blanchett has completed shooting for Mike Newell's ``Pushing
Tin,'' which Newell describes as ```I Love Lucy' on acid.''
	   Being cast as a Long Island housewife, Blanchett says, ``means
that the experience will be liberating because the director's not
asking you to repeat a performance. So it's encouragement to sort
of stretch your wings, which is great, and I relish those
opportunities.''

<TEXT>
	   BRANSON, Missouri. (AP) _ Mel Tillis was 6 years old when he
found his calling as a country music singer. That's when he learned
that if he sang, he didn't stutter.
	   ``When I started to school,'' Tillis recalls in that soft, slow
Florida drawl of his, ``that's when I realized that I stuttered. I
stammered. And the other kids, they let me know that. And so I went
home and I cried.
	   ``But Mom, she told me, `Well you're a little bit different. But
there's something you can do. You can sing.'''
	   And so he did. At every opportunity.
	   ``And then I found I could ad-lib without stuttering,'' he
continues, smiling now as he sits in the dressing-room at his Mel
Tillis Theater. ``So I ad-libbed my way through school.''
	   It's been 60 years since that first day of school, and Mel
Tillis still stutters a bit, though not quite as much as he does
when he's in front of an audience that has come to see ``country
music's original stuttering boy'' and his backup singers, ``The
Stutterettes.''
	   But never mind, because Mel Tillis is still singing and
ad-libbing his way through life, and not just for the kids at
school anymore. But for hundreds of thousands of fans who show up
to see him perform as many as 400 times a year.
	   ``Nobody does as many shows as he does,'' says his daughter,
Pam, whose name in the 1990s has become just about as synonymous
with country-music stardom as her father's was in the 1970s and
'80s.
	   ``Little babies just starting out, they might do that many
shows. But no big-name entertainer does,'' Pam Tillis adds,
admiring her 66-year-old father.
	   To which he quickly ad-libs: ``Well, the others don't owe dlrs
15 million on their theaters.''
	   ``He doesn't think of a show as a show,'' Pam Tillis says. ``He
thinks of that theater as our living room and those people in the
audience are friends in our living room.''
	   And so he does two shows a day from that big Branson living
room, six days a week, nine months of the year. And when the town
all but shuts down from January until April, he goes out on the
road and does 50 or so more.
	   ``I've got to get out on the road and let people know I'm still
alive,'' Tillis says.
	   Fifteen years after the record companies put him ``out to
pasture'' for a younger, hipper group of country singers that came
to include his baby-boomer daughter, Tillis has come back. And on
his own terms.
	   He did it by playing to huge crowds in Branson year after year
for nine seasons and by building one of the plushest theaters in
this middle-American entertainment town that boasts more than
three-dozen music stages.
	   This year he has turned promoter as well, signing Pam, country
music's 1994 female vocalist of the year, to play nearly 60 dates
with him in his theater.
	   The result has been one of the town's most dynamic shows, with
the elder Tillis singing from the heart on old country favorites
like ``Don't You Ever Get Tired of Hurting Me'' and ``Sugar Foot
Rag,'' while Pam performs rocking crossover hits of her own like
``Land of the Living'' and ``All the Good Ones Are Gone.''
	   In between their separate acts there is some scripted squabbling
as Pam strays too close to straight rock, prompting her
bathrobe-clad father to storm on stage at one point and her to ask,
``Am I grounded?''
	   Backstage, there's some real-life good-natured bickering between
father and daughter, including an extended discussion of the
country's political and moral standards.
	   ``I guess you can tell I'm a Republican,'' Tillis finally says,
attempting to cut off the argument.
	   ``I'm a Democrat,'' his daughter adds, smiling. ``Republicans
don't have a monopoly on moral indignation.''
	   ``I'm much more conservative that you are, Pam,'' he shoots back
before telling a story about his oldest child's teen years.
	   He was in bed watching television one night, Tillis recalls, and
he assumed Pam and her siblings were asleep. ``They were in a march
somewhere, protesting something,'' he says, as Pam giggles at the
memory.
	   She recalls hiding from her father at times when he came home
from the road because of the mischief she would cause while he was
gone. But she also remembers him warmly as her first audience.
	   ``Our earliest performances were just showing off for Daddy,''
she says of herself, her sisters and her brother.
	   Despite his father's 62 albums, his TV appearances, his 37 Top
10 country hits and his country music entertainer of the year award
in 1976, Pam Tillis never realized how famous her father was until
she traveled to a mountain music festival to see him perform in
front of 70,000 people.
	   ``Then you kind of get the idea of it,'' she quipped.

	   LONDON (AP) _ ``It's early,'' Ewan McGregor says with a smile,
as he launches into conversation at a less-than-sociable time of
day. ``I apologize for the earliness of the hour.''
	   That's not all McGregor says on that particular topic, but it's
as much as can be printed coming from a feisty star of film _ and,
for the moment, stage _ whose language is considerably saltier than
most Hollywood films.
	   Not that McGregor has much to do with Hollywood, despite his
starring presence as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi in what should well
be next year's biggest movie, the first of three ``Star Wars''
prequels.
	   His admiration for ``Star Wars'' wizard creator George Lucas
notwithstanding, the 27-year-old Scot speaks mostly disparagingly
of the American studios and of bloated blockbusters like
``Independence Day'' (a pet peeve) and of producers too timid to
voice an opinion lest they get fired.
	   ``They're so terrified,'' says McGregor, who hardly needs a
journalist's prompt to tackle a topic head-on. ``I've sat out there
with studio heads _ you know, people who are supposed to know
better than I. And they go, `Oh, my God, your last movie was so ...
Oh, my God ... it was just Oh, my God,' and I'm like `What? What is
it? What was my last movie? What do you think?' And they're all so
terrified to say anything in case it's the wrong thing ... and they
suddenly lose their job.''
	   Fear certainly doesn't enter into McGregor's own conversational
orbit, and you could argue that the same take-no-prisoners quality
fuels his work on screen.
	   After all, how many actors would allow their bodies to become
experiments in calligraphy, as McGregor did last year in Peter
Greenaway's ``The Pillow Book''? Or leap to attention as a heroin
addict, and take a swim in a toilet bowl, in ``Trainspotting''?
	   Currently, McGregor can be seen as an Iggy Pop equivalent in all
but name _ the character is aptly known as Curt Wild _ in Todd
Haynes' provocative, surprisingly melancholic ``Velvet Goldmine,''
a requiem for the bygone glitter of Glam Rock.
	   And just when it looked as if McGregor was incapable of
suggesting quietude on screen, along he comes as the shy Billy, the
telephone repairman who woos an even more withdrawn Jane Horrocks
in ``Little Voice.''
	   ``Hallelujah, that's a stroke of luck, that one,'' says McGregor
of appearing back-to-back in such dissimilar movies. ``The two
right next to each other _ it's just everything you could want.''
	   In ``Velvet Goldmine,'' the actor dons tight-fitting, spangly
gold with matching nail varnish to play a pop icon who thinks
nothing of dropping his trousers in performance.
	   ``It's debauched and mad, like the '70s were,'' McGregor says
with a grin, before offering a caveat: ``I get off quite lightly in
the camp stakes because I'm the butch American guy.''
	   ``Little Voice,'' by contrast, finds him delicately handling
pigeons. ``It's very, very British,'' he says of that movie.
``There's something really lovely about it.''
	   While British actors of previous generations tended to move from
play to play, McGregor is attempting the same spread of work on
screen.
	   ``People like Jimmy Stewart would make three to four movies a
year. It was almost like repertory theater, but in movies,'' he
says. ``That was my idea of what being an actor was like, so I
guess I'm just trying to do the same thing now.''
	   His approach typifies a career that has traveled its own
idiosyncratic path while making McGregor, no doubt unintentionally,
the thespian embodiment of ``cool Britannia.''
	   These days, he's one of the few acting success stories that his
own country's press _ a notoriously fickle lot _ have notably taken
to heart.
	   ``That's what's nice about him: he's got sense and optimism
written all the way through,'' remarked The Observer newspaper in a
magazine profile in early October. Chimed in British GQ, which
cited McGregor among its Men of the Year: ``Ewan McGregor is the
kind of movie star it's OK to like. A lot.''
	   His colleagues agree.
	   ``He's a hip actor in an unhip role,'' notes Mark Herman of the
actor's participation in ``Little Voice.'' Last year, Herman
directed McGregor as an amorous horn player in the little-seen, if
terrific, ``Brassed Off.''
	   Says Jenny Topper, artistic director of north London's tiny
Hampstead Theater, where the theater-trained McGregor is making his
London stage debut through Jan. 2: ``Ewan himself is so unaffected
and open and natural. He has no side whatsoever.''
	   And, she adds wryly, ``He can talk the hind legs off a donkey.''
	   That much may be due to sheer Scottish loquacity, a trait used
to advantage in the actor's bravura stage turn as the scrappy,
prone-to-soliloquies radical (or so the character thinks) in David
Halliwell's ``Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the
Eunuchs.''
	   The play _ directed by McGregor's uncle, the actor Denis Lawson
(``Local Hero'') _ has become the hottest ticket in town.
	   For his efforts as Malcolm, the anarchic art student of the
title, McGregor is being paid a less-than-stratospheric dlrs 400 a
week.
	   ``I wanted to do a play. I needed to do a play,'' he says of a
career move that must have left his agents speechless following the
multimillion-dollar ``Star Wars'' franchise.

Argentina's gauchos come to life in Aldo Sessa's photography

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ In one photograph, a man in a
wide-brimmed hat picks his teeth with a huge knife while he stares
meditatively at the horizon on a windswept prairie.
	   In another, a man grits his teeth, grips the reins with one hand
and raises his whip with the other atop a bucking horse. In a
third, several men huddle around a side of beef sizzling on an open
fire.
	   These are the gauchos, the fabled horsemen of Argentina captured
by the roving camera of Aldo Sessa, one of Argentina's best
photographers.
	   For most Argentines the gaucho is a thing of the past, the
embodiment of virtues such as loyalty and a fiercely independent
spirit.
	   Sessa has sought to prove to an increasingly urban society that
the gaucho is indeed alive.
	   In a recent exhibit, Sessa presented more than a hundred
photographs, published in his new book ``Los gauchos.''
	   ``The whole point of the exhibition and book is to show that the
gaucho is very much alive,'' Sessa said in an interview. ``Like
most Argentines, I used to think there were no more gauchos. But
I've seen them and they are real.''
	   Once an independent horseman, often an outlaw of the Argentine
grasslands, this uniquely South American cowboy became a ranch hand
early this century as the meat industry flourished and barbed-wire
fences sprang up over the pampas.
	   Sessa's photographs capture the gaucho at work and at play,
breaking horses, driving cattle, eating a barbecue, sipping mate _
the local tea _ through a metal straw, or attending a country
dance.
	   ``I've seen five young gauchos turn out at dawn to catch wild
horses with boleadoras,'' said Sessa.
	   The boleadora consists of three leather balls each about the
size of a baseball, joined by long leather thongs. It is hurled at
an animal and the thongs entangle its legs.
	   The gaucho project began five years ago, when Sessa went to see
Juan Jose Guiraldes, president of the Argentine Gaucho
Confederation, at his ranch in San Antonio de Areco, 60 miles (100
kms) north of Buenos Aires.
	   Guiraldes is a nephew of Ricardo Guiraldes, author of
Argentina's classic novel ``Don Segundo Sombra,'' the story of an
old gaucho who takes a young orphan under his wing to teach him the
values and skills of gaucho life until he attains manhood.
	   The confederation seeks to keep gaucho traditions alive through
festivals and exhibitions
	   ``Aldo told me he wanted to photograph a gaucho and asked me if
there was such a thing,'' Guiraldes said. ``He came in search of a
myth and found a living reality.''
	   Over the ensuing four years, Sessa and Guiraldes traveled more
than 25,000 miles (40,000 kms) from the grasslands of the pampas to
windswept, arid Patagonia, from the tropical northeast to icy
Tierra del Fuego.
	   The result: nearly 50,000 photographs, 130 of which, in color
and black and white, were placed on exhibit until Oct. 12 at the
Argentine capital's Palais de Glace.
	   The photographs with texts by Guiraldes also have been published
in a book, ``Los gauchos''.
	   ``My task was to help him approach the gauchos,'' Guiraldes
said. ``I contributed my knowledge of the gaucho, Aldo his artist's
sensitivity. In thousands of pictures he captured the landscapes
and the people, their habits, fineries, joys, solitudes and
faces.''
	   Born in Buenos Aires in 1939, Sessa alternates painting and
photography. He has illustrated books by distinguished writers
including Jorge Luis Borges and Ray Bradbury.
	   He has shown his work at exhibition halls around the world,
including New York's International Center of Photography, London's
Victoria and Albert Museum, Brussels' Maison du Spectacle and
Hamburg's Kunsthalle.
	   In the prologue to the book ``Fantasmas para siempre'' (Phantoms
Forever), Bradbury wrote: ``This is the team, Aldo Sessa and Ray
Bradbury or Ray Bradbury and Aldo Sessa. We hope you can't tell
where one ends and the other begins, but rather how both run
together.''
	   Critics and commentators have pointed out his use of light, for
example how the light of a fire plays on the faces of a group of
cowherds sitting in a circle.
	   ``Look at that face,'' said Guillermo Valdez, a leather
craftsman and visitor to the exhibition, staring at the photograph
of a man with a full black beard whose dark eyes set on some point
of the horizon. ``That's the face of a man who knows life.''
	   Painter Hugo Diez, another visitor to the show, agreed.
``They're really excellent pictures,'' he said. ``By looking at
them you can almost tell what those people are feeling.''
	   Sessa and Guiraldes plan to take their exhibition to big cities
around Argentina, ``to show city dwellers that the gaucho indeed
exists,'' said Sessa. ``Later on, we will try to take it abroad.''

Universal shakeup is latest chapter in storied history of studio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ At age 85, the legendary Hollywood executive
Lew Wasserman still has an office on the top floor of Universal
Studios' infamous Black Tower, the foreboding glass edifice from
which he wielded power for decades. He still holds court each day
in the Universal commissary.
	   But it has been a few years since Universal was the domain of
the tough, tightfisted ex-talent agent with the giant horn-rimmed
glasses. The sale of the company to a Japanese electronics firm
weakened his grip. The subsequent sale to a Canadian beverage firm
turned him into a figurehead, with only his former employees to
carry on.
	   And this past week, the last important vestige of the Wasserman
era was eliminated when Universal parent Seagram Co. ousted
Universal Pictures chairman Casey Silver, a 12-year company veteran
going back to when Universal was called MCA and Wasserman reigned
supreme.
	   The ostensible reason for Silver's forced resignation was the
dismal state of the film studio. Two important _ and expensive _
late fall films, ``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Meet Joe Black,''
flopped at their openings, as have so many other Universal films
during the last 18 months. But there probably was more to it than
last Monday's announcement revealed. Silver's departure relates to
a move by Edgar Bronfman Jr., CEO of Seagram Co., to increase his
role in Seagram's entertainment businesses as the company undergoes
a major restructuring.
	   ``As long as any of Lew's minions from the MCA era continued to
occupy even a single office in the upper reaches of the Black
Tower, Bronfman could not lay claim to the Universal empire,'' says
Dennis McDougal, author of ``The Last Mogul,'' a new biography of
Wasserman. ``Now, it's his. Whatever happens from here on out,
Bronfman either gets all the blame or all the credit.''
	   Universal Studios is at another important crossroads in its
86-year-history: Its past shows that the recent corporate
convulsions are not unique. Its future is a favorite subject of
Hollywood gossip.
	   It was in 1915 that movie pioneer Carl Laemmle began building
Universal City, 230 acres of soundstages and outdoor shooting areas
in the San Fernando Valley, just over the hill from Hollywood. By
the time it was done, it would be its own little movie-making
community, with a post office, lakes and permanent sets.
	   During the silent era, Universal had such stars as Rudolph
Valentino and Lon Chaney; in the early and mid-'30s it found
success with horror films such as ``Dracula,'' ``The Invisible
Man,'' and ``Frankenstein;'' and at the end of the '30s its money
problems were sung away by Deanna Durbin in popular musicals.
	   Exotic B-pictures like ``Arabian Nights'' and ``Cobra Woman''
kept the studio going in the 1940s, and Abbott and Costello
sustained it through much of the '50s. But financial woes struck
again at the end of that decade, and Wasserman, who ran the
powerful MCA talent agency, was circling.
	   MCA first bought the land and buildings, then the production
operation, but had to get rid of the talent agency in 1962 under
the pressure of a federal antitrust investigation.
	   For much of the Wasserman era, the studio soared.
	   The 1970s brought the hits ``The Sting,'' ``National Lampoon's
Animal House'' and ``Airport,'' and 1975's ``Jaws'' cemented a rich
relationship with Steven Spielberg that would yield such
blockbusters as ``E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial'' and ``Jurassic
Park.''
	   Universal Studios as a theme park attracted so many tourists
that the company built another in Orlando, Fla. The television
division flourished, specializing in one-hour dramas.
	   By the 1980s, Wasserman and MCA president and chief operating
officer Sidney Sheinberg made for a fearsome partnership: tough,
cost-conscious, powerful. But as the 90s neared, they lacked the
ultra-deep pockets of the other entertainment giants, like the
emerging Time Warner.
	   In 1990, in a deal brokered by former super-agent Michael Ovitz,
MCA was sold to Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., and it
would doom Wasserman. The new bosses balked at Wasserman's plans
for expansion into broadcast television and other ventures and soon
the Japanese were looking to get out.
	   By 1995, Ovitz was brokering another deal, this one behind
Wasserman's back, by which Bronfman and Seagram would purchase MCA.
An 80 percent stake in MCA went to Seagram Co. for dlrs 5.7
billion. MCA was renamed Universal Studios, and Wasserman lost
day-to-day control.
	   For his management team, Bronfman courted Ovitz, but the deal
fell through, reportedly over Ovitz's asking price of more than
dlrs 200 million. Bronfman hired Ovitz's former partner at Creative
Artists Agency, Ron Meyer, as the new president of Universal
Studios, and former Viacom chief executive Frank Biondi Jr. as the
Universal Studios CEO.
	   It was not a smooth transition, and this year was particularly
tough.
	   Wasserman left the board of directors in February (he now only
holds the honorary title of chairman emeritus). ``Primary Colors''
tanked in March. April saw four major resignations: production
president Marc Platt, marketing chiefs Kathy Jones and Buffy Shutt
and corporate operations VP Howard Weitzman.
	   Biondi's job security had been in question since last fall when
Bronfman, without consulting him, sold most of Universal's TV
assets to one of his mentors, Barry Diller. For Biondi, whose
strength was in television, it was a blow.
	   Then Bronfman, seeking a strong company focus on music, went
shopping for a record label, again without major involvement by
Biondi.

Riding a comeback, Burt Reynolds stars in and directs three 'Hard

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ It's a business axiom: For a quick decision,
go directly to the top. That's what Burt Reynolds did for a series
of three detective movies on TNT called ``Hard Time.''
	   ``It was amazingly simple,'' Reynolds says. ``I went to Ted
Turner and outlined what I wanted to do, and he said yes.''
	   The talk with the cable channel founder was all it took to get
``Hard Time'' scheduled as a TNT Original. The first two-hour movie
appeared on the cable network earlier this month.
	   The second in the series will appear in February.
	   Reynolds plays veteran Detective Logan McQueen, a violence-prone
cop in Miami. Charles Durning appears as his overage, overweight
partner and mentor, Charlie Duffy.
	   The first sequence shows Reynolds chasing a couple of hoods
through streets and alleys, followed by a puffing Durning.
Reynolds' pace may have slowed a bit, but at 62 he still presents a
rugged figure. He says he does his own stunts because audiences are
so sophisticated these days they can spot when a star has been
doubled.
	   Reynolds appeared trim and upbeat at a recent interview, despite
travails that have plagued him in recent years: a career nosedive,
a messy divorce from Loni Anderson, a bankruptcy filing to sort out
dlrs 10 million in debts (he says his finances are now in order).
	   ``'Boogie Nights' changed everything,'' he declares, referring
to his role as the compassionate producer of porno flicks. The 1997
theatrical film earned Reynolds a Golden Globe award and an Oscar
nomination as supporting actor.
	   Among the rewards: a forthcoming Disney film, ``Mystery
Alaska,'' costarring with Russell Crowe, and ``Hard Time.''
	   ``I wanted to direct again, and this was a good way to do it,''
Reynolds says. ``And I wanted to do it with the right people.'' He
got Robert Loggia, Billy Dee Williams and Durning, who also starred
with him in the TV series ``Evening Shade.''
	   The three movies were shot back-to-back, with Los Angeles
doubling for Miami. Reynolds directed the first one in a
cost-conscious four weeks.
	   ``We had to shoot fast, but that didn't bother me,'' he says.
``After all, I grew up in series television.''
	   How many series?
	   ``Let's see if I can remember them. There was 'Riverboat'
(1959-61), 'Gunsmoke' (1962-65), 'Hawk' (1969), 'Dan August'
(1970-71), 'B.L. Stryker' (1989-90). Later came 'Evening Shade'
(1990-94). I think that's all.'' Reynolds also directed episodes of
``Evening Shade.''
	   Playing a lawman comes naturally. Reynolds' father, a onetime
cowboy, was police chief of Palm Beach, Fla. A natural athlete,
Reynolds won a football scholarship to Florida State, but a bad
knee destroyed his dream of pro ball.
	   He threw his energies into college dramatics, dropped out and
tried his luck in New York. A role in a ``Mister Roberts'' revival
prompted Universal to bring him to Hollywood with a television
contract.
	   It was his powerful performance in ``Deliverance'' and witty
appearances on TV talk shows that propelled Reynolds to the big
time. Then, after 20 years on top, the troubles descended.
	   Now the turnabout. It proves _ as with John Travolta, Peter
Fonda and a few lucky others _ that talent, a household name and
determination can win a second chance.

Black Sabbath is back with new album, tour

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Guitarist Tony Iommi sits in a midtown hotel
room, reflecting on Black Sabbath's 30-year history. Next to him is
singer Ozzy Osbourne. Years ago, both vowed never to share the same
stage again.
	   Black Sabbath is the band that pioneered heavy metal music with
its amplified dirges brimming with cryptic lyrics and bone-crushing
riffs. During the early 1970s, the band's exploits became
synonymous with the hard-rock lifestyle of all-night parties,
groupies and exhausting tour schedules.
	   On the band's first American tour, Iommi and Osbourne knocked
down a hotel wall in Virginia.
	   ``We were angry guys,'' Osbourne explains. ``And we just
thought, 'Hey, let's just scare everybody.'''
	   Now Osbourne and Iommi are getting ready for Black Sabbath's
North American tour to promote a new record that is appropriately
titled, ``Reunion'' (Epic Records).
	   The tour is the first to feature the original lineup since
Osbourne left the band in 1978. It is scheduled to begin in Phoenix
on New Year's Eve. Other cities on the tour: Los Angeles, Seattle,
Chicago, Boston and Detroit.
	   ``I always felt that the original Black Sabbath was
unresolved,'' says Osbourne, his eyes hidden by tinted eyeglasses.
``We just kind of flicked it away.''
	   If a recent in-store signing for the new album is any
indication, the reunion tour will attract as much attention as the
band's first American tour nearly 30 years ago. The line of Black
Sabbath fans stretched a block long at a record store in Times
Square.
	   ``We got our success from the people,'' Osbourne says.
``Everyone said we wouldn't last five minutes, said we couldn't
play, couldn't sing, couldn't write songs. Lo and behold, 30 years
later, we're more popular than ever.''
	   ``Reunion'' features heavy metal classics, ``Iron Man'' and
``Paranoid.'' The songs were performed by Iommi, Osbourne, bassist
Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward before an adoring audience in
the band's hometown of Birmingham, England. The live material is
complemented by two new studio tracks, ``Psycho Man'' and ``Selling
My Soul.''
	   The band's name was snatched from a 1963 horror film starring
Boris Karloff.
	   ``The whole image was built up based on the name, Black
Sabbath,'' Iommi says.
	   Black Sabbath has a host of aberrant admirers, from worshipful
witches to professing pious groups and famous murderers.
	   Osbourne recalls a police photograph that showed his lyrics
etched on a wall inside the apartment of serial killer David
Berkowitz.
	   Then there was a man in California who erected a tombstone in
his back yard as a tribute to Osbourne. He sent the singer a
videotaped invitation to be buried in the shrine.
	   ``The guy's a stalker,'' Osbourne says.
	   Mounting egos led to Osbourne's departure in 1978. While Iommi
continued to record and tour as Black Sabbath, succeeding lineups
never commanded the attention of the original.
	   ``We've all been around long enough in different lineups, but
when we get back in this one, there's no comparison,'' Iommi says.
	   Black Sabbath was among this year's nominees for induction into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It was the band's second
nomination.
	   When asked about Black Sabbath's musical legacy, Osbourne
shrugs, ``Don't ask me what that means because I'm clueless about
that. There was no mystique about it. Jam, smoke a few joints, get
a few bottles of beer. ...''
	   Since the breakup, Osbourne has enjoyed a controversial,
prosperous solo career.
	   In 1992, he announced his retirement from music but returned to
the road three years later with a Retirement Sucks tour.
	   A year later, he launched Ozzfest, heavy metal's answer to
Lollapalooza.
	   ``We all have to carry on somehow,'' Osbourne says. ``We have to
survive and feed the family, you know.''
	   His solo career is on indefinite hold while he and his old chums
decide how much longer to extend the reunion.
	   Osbourne would like to record a full-length album, but says the
decision is not his to make.
	   ``It's not my band,'' Osbourne says. ``I just sing.''
	   Iommi and Osbourne say they will be able to part on amiable
terms when the reunion ends.
	   ``Years ago, we had too many things surrounding us. We were
young,'' Iommi says. ``Now we've grown up and we can handle
things.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marina Kovalyov's mother lives in Brooklyn now.
But like many immigrants, her heart is elsewhere.
	   The people and places of her native Russia are never far from
her thoughts. Letters and phone calls keep her in touch with her
homeland and, for several hours a day, so does the television.
	   The Kovalyov family subscribes to a TV service that beams
Russian programming into their home _ political gossip and local
news, old movies from the Soviet era, even some of the blue rock
videos that make babushkas cluck in dismay at decadent youth.
	   It's provided by the Ethnic-American Broadcasting Co., a small
company that hopes to grow quickly by appealing to the homesickness
of America's newest citizens.
	   About 70,000 people, almost all of them in the nation's biggest
cities, already pay between dlrs 9 and dlrs 25 a month for a window
into their old world. EABC also offers Arabic, Indian, Chinese,
Filipino, Greek, Italian and Ukrainian programming.
	   The company was founded as a radio station in 1987 by a Russian
emigre, Pavel Paley. He methodically expanded into television,
adding customers by wiring one apartment building at a time.
	   An investment banker, David Moro, bought the company in 1991 and
began expanding it beyond the Russian community.
	   ``What attracted me to this business was the amazing loyalty to
the viewers that this service had,'' Moro said. ``It was an
umbilical cord connecting them to the culture and language in their
home country. And just as important, it became the voice of their
community here.''
	   In addition to the shows lifted from television back home,
EABC's channels also provide two hours of daily programming with
news about immigrant communities and advice on how to pass an
American citizenship test.
	   Nostalgia programming _ old movies and vintage television series
_ are most popular among EABC viewers. They're also insatiable news
watchers, and EABC will frequently telecast specials like election
day coverage from overseas.
	   The company has acquired programming from such services as
Italy's Ciao TV, the Egyptian Satellite Channel, Network Asia from
India and Pakistan and ECom, a 24-hour Chinese language channel.
One of the only ethnic groups EABC has not tried to reach are
Hispanics, who already have the well-established Univision and
Telemundo networks.
	   Kovalyov, who runs the Russian-American Arts Foundation in New
York, said her mother and mother-in-law watch most of EABC's
programming in her family. Both women are in their 70s. While they
appreciate the channel, Kovalyov said she wished EABC spent more
time helping Russian immigrants learn about their new country.
	   ``There are many people who are not that interested in what's
going on in Russia,'' she said. ``We belong here. We came here.''
	   It's basically the same argument that rages over bilingual
education in schools: Do these services help or hinder assimilation
into a new culture?
	   Moro said the integration of immigrants into the American
mainstream is irresistible, and his service does nothing to stand
in its way. Most of EABC's new clients are already three or five
years in America, he said. Young families want it more for their
older relatives than for themselves.
	   ``What we help do is keep alive their culture and language in
the broadcast medium,'' he said. ``There's a richness and a wealth
to that that would be unfortunate to lose.''
	   Moro has had to spend much of his time developing a distribution
system. EABC's channels are not widely disseminated like broadcast
signals or through cable. Instead, subscribers need to buy their
own satellite dish or live in a building where special receiving
equipment has been installed.
	   Moro's 250 employees are a mix of the technically and culturally
savvy. After all, someone needs to understand why rock videos that
would never be shown in America are perfectly acceptable to a
Russian audience.
	   It's not an easy combination, though. During the World Cup, Moro
took the advice of American-born staff members believed pre-empting
much of the ethnic programming for a month to show soccer would pay
off in extra advertising revenue. Many of his Russian programmers
quit in disgust after unsuccessfully arguing that viewers would be
angry about losing their regular shows.
	   ``It was a lousy business decision,'' Moro conceded. ``Our
subscribers were furious with us.''
	   EABC is building a corporate headquarters in Fort Lee, New
Jersey, and expects to operate 20 separate channels by the time it
opens next spring. The company also hopes to boost its dlrs 25
million in revenue to several hundred million dollars within five
or six years. They cite the 4.8 million immigrants who have come to
the United States since the early 1990s as an untapped market.
	   That's still relatively small, compared to the nearly 70 million
cable TV subscribers in the U.S., and is one of the reasons EABC
has the market largely to itself.
	   Moro said the audience makes up for in dedication what it lacks
in size. Statistics show his customers are far less likely than
cable viewers to give up the service.
	   ``They really view us as a resource,'' he said. ``It forges a
loyalty and a commitment to the company.''

	   In the spotlight: Judi Dench, queen of the stage
	    &UR; Image: Judi Dench is an award-winning stage and screen star, as
comfortable portraying Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown'' as she is
playing spymaster M in the James Bond thrillers, ``GoldenEye'' and
``Tomorrow Never Dies.''
	    &UR; Personal Stats: She was born on Dec. 9, 1934, in York, England.
She attended the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. At
22, she was picked to play Ophelia to John Neville's Hamlet at the
Old Vic. She became an instant star.
	    &UR; Star of stage and screen: ``Mrs. Brown'' is Dench's largest
screen role to date, even if the movie has been seen by a fraction
of those who caught her in the last two James Bond films.
	   But the actress has been a regular supporting player in English
movies for years. She appeared in the corset-laden Tuscan landscape
of ``A Room With a View'' with Helena Bonham Carter and in the
bookish, musty London of ``84 Charing Cross Road'' with Anthony
Hopkins.
	   Dench was Cleopatra to Hopkins' Antony in the Shakespeare
tragedy at the National Theater in 1987. They also worked together
in Peter Shaffer's 1992 play, ``The Gift of the Gorgon,'' with
Dench as the distraught wife to Michael Pennington's masochistic
writer.
	   She led London's first ``Cabaret'' in 1968, playing a Sally
Bowles who by all accounts was light-years removed from Liza
Minnelli in the film version. Several years ago, she made a
definitively moving and barbed Desiree Armfeldt in ``A Little Night
Music,'' delivering a rueful ``Send in the Clowns'' that sent
listeners in the audience into states of rapture.
	   The star role of the faded glamour cat Grizabella was intended
for Dench before ``Cats'' opened in London in 1981. But an injury
forced her to leave the production.
	    &UR; Her new film: Dench stars in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' also
starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin
Firth and Ben Affleck. In this romantic comedy, a young Shakespeare
suffers writer's block until he meets a real-life Juliet.
	    &UR; Quote: ``I look back on my career and think, 'How terrific.'
But I want it to go on. I never look out for a part and I like not
working, but I have a deep-seated fear of inactivity and I always
feel it's going to be forced on me.''

LONDON: ``Star Wars'' franchise.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``The theater is a joy, a joy,'' he says. ``It's brilliant.''
	   The task, he says, is about ``actors and a director wanting to
do it, to get it on. We're not stuck out in the East End ... with a
burger van giving us food at 12 at night. We're standing on stage
and doing what we want to do.''
	   Indeed, it seems that McGregor's sheer appetite for work _ he
has three films expected for release next year in addition to
episode one of ``Star Wars'' _ acts at once as boon and burden,
since he doesn't necessarily know when to stop.
	   ``He'd been doing too much too quickly. He was a bit frazzled,''
says Herman, the ``Little Voice'' director.
	   Maintaining the pace, McGregor was set to appear last July as
Irish writer James Joyce in a new film, ``Nora,'' until the project
was postponed yet again for financial reasons.
	   ``The money fell through,'' he says, ``and in a way it was a
stroke of luck because I had the summer off. I haven't had time off
for three years. It's been really good for me.''
	   Among other things, it meant time at home and on vacation to
Scotland and France with wife Eve, a French production designer,
and their daughter, Clara, who is 2-and-a-half.

LOS ANGELES: by Biondi.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Last month, Biondi was forced to bail out with a golden
parachute worth between dlrs 25 million and dlrs 30 million.
	   Bronfman, meanwhile, reached a deal to buy PolyGram, the world's
largest record company, for dlrs 10.4 billion _ with more layoffs
and other upheaval to follow as the companies are merged.
	   Then he turned his sights on the troubled film studio, headed by
that MCA holdover, Silver. In three years running the film studio,
Silver had enjoyed some commercial and critical success with such
films as ``Apollo 13,'' ``Schindler's List,'' ``The Nutty
Professor'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July.'' But the last year
had been hitless. Then, on the heels of the disastrous openings of
``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Pig in the City,'' Silver was the next to
go, with his boss, Meyer, taking over his responsibilities.
	   Now, Hollywood is watching the latest chapter unfold: the
operation of Universal under a more hands-on Bronfman, who until a
few years ago never ran an entertainment company, and Meyer, who
until now never ran a movie studio.
	   ``I'm actually looking forward to doing this, believe it or
not,'' Meyer told The Associated Press. He joked that one
adjustment will be that ``I've got to start work earlier and leave
later.''
	   He said he was optimistic about the upcoming slate of films that
Silver greenlighted, including this weekend's ``Psycho'' remake,
``Patch Adams'' with Robin Williams, ``edTV'' from director Ron
Howard, ``Bowfinger's Big Thing'' with Eddie Murphy and Steve
Martin, the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film ``End of Days,'' and
the Andy Kaufman biopic ``Man on the Moon,'' starring Jim Carrey.
	   But exactly how things will be different without Silver wasn't
clear; Meyer spoke generally about a ``change in the dynamics'' at
the top.
	   ``There is a difference in people's styles, and I do think we
needed the change,'' he said.
	   Officials from Seagram didn't respond to a request for comment.
Wasserman also declined to comment.
	   One of Meyer's top duties will be to nurture Universal's
relationships with its producing partners, who include Will Smith,
Tom Hanks, and Imagine, the company run by Howard and partner Brian
Grazer.
	   So far, there are no signs these key players have been spooked
by the corporate upheaval.
	   ``I think I know Ron Meyer and Edgar Bronfman well enough that
it allows Imagine to strongly believe in them and support them,''
said Grazer. ``We believe that our product will be served
effectively.''

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Dec. 6-12:
	   35 years ago: Tom Tyron starred in Otto Preminger's ``The
Cardinal,'' which premiered at Boston's Saxon Theater. It was the
first film in Panavision 70, a process in which 35 mm film was
enlarged to 70 mm and shown on the wide screen.
	   And the Beatles appeared on the BBC-TV show, ``Juke Box Jury.''
Personalities gave their opinions on new record releases on this
show.
	   30 years ago: Graham Nash quit the Hollies. He went into
rehearsals in London with David Crosby and Stephen Stills for their
new self-named trio project.
	   25 years ago: Jack Nicholson, Otis Young and Randy Quaid starred
in ``The Last Detail.''
	   20 years ago: Michael Cimino's ``The Deer Hunter'' starred
Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale and Meryl Streep.
The film won five Oscars including Best Picture, Director and
Supporting Actor (Walken).
	   And John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded a version of ``Soul
Man.'' The song was released under the name The Blues Brothers.
	   15 years ago: Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio starred in Brian DePalma's ``Scarface.''
	   10 years ago: Michael Jackson, Eddie Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg
were honored at the 21st annual NAACP Image Awards. The ceremony
honored black achievement.
	   Leslie Nielsen was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame. ``The Naked Gun,'' starring Nielsen, earned a record dlrs 9.3
million during its first weekend of release.
	   And Sylvester Stallone and Faye Dunaway were chosen to represent
the spirit of legendary silent-film star Rudolph Valentino at the
1988 Rudy Awards. Stallone and Miss Dunaway received statuette
images of ``The Sheik'' in ceremonies in Los Angeles.
	   One year ago: Actress Ellen DeGeneres received an award for
furthering gay rights with her TV show. The American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California gave her its Bill of Rights
Award for advancing ``the cause of gay rights 100-fold.''
	   And Sting, Madonna and Elton John were among dozens of
celebrities who attended a fund-raising gala honoring slain fashion
designer Gianni Versace. Actresses Helen Hunt and Gwyneth Paltrow
also attended the dlrs 2,000-a-plate dinner at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York.
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``I'd much rather be singing songs about romantic love than
human rights abuses, but as long as the world is as it is, I have
no choice.'' _ British pop star Sting.
	   Spoken five years ago:
	   ``Some people, when they get attention in the public eye, stand
a bit taller. But I went the complete opposite _ lower. I shrink
and kind of hide.'' _ Actor Johnny Depp.
	   ``I want to be in movies that inspire kids to live for a period
of time in their imaginations, like 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' touched me when I was a kid.'' _
Actress Daryl Hannah.
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``From the beginning, I said that I didn't want to become a
spokesman for gay rights. But here I am. There's still a lot more
to do. There's a warning label on my show sending a message that
there is something wrong with me.'' _ Comedian Ellen DeGeneres, who
won an award for furthering gay rights.

	   ``Keep the Faith'' (Bad Boy Records) _ Faith Evans
	   Faith Evans' name is linked more often with the wild life and
tragic death of her late husband, rapper Biggie Smalls, than with
her own successful singing and songwriting career.
	   Perhaps her second disc, ``Keep the Faith,'' will put the focus
back where it belongs _ on Evans' marvelous talents.
	   Evans' smoky voice performs gospel-like vocal gymnastics and is
barely contained on the tracks, especially on tour de force ballads
like ``Anything You Need.'' Yet the effect is not overpowering, and
she manages to sound both seductive and demure on the sexy
``Caramel,'' in which she relishes the ``caramel kisses'' of her
lover.
	   Evans co-wrote just about all of the songs on this disc, even
the interludes, which leave you wanting more.
	   The only negatives really aren't her fault. Executive producer
Puff Daddy does the fine uptempo ``All Night Long'' a disservice by
performing some incredibly weak and stale rhymes, even for him. And
Babyface's songwriting contribution, ``Never Gonna Let You Go,'' is
schmaltzy and predictable.
	   _ By Nekesa Mumbi Moody, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Timeless Tales'' (Warner Bros.) _ Joshua Redman
	   Jazz meets pop on ``Timeless Tales,'' and it's a happy marriage.
Saxophonist Joshua Redman and a crack trio of supporting musicians
perform 10 pop classics, beginning with Gershwin's ``Summertime''
and concluding with Prince's ``How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?''
	   Redman produced the record, which manages to mesh music by
songwriters ranging from Irving Berlin and Cole Porter to Joni
Mitchell and Bob Dylan. The album features Brad Mehldau on piano,
Larry Grenadier on bass and Brian Blade on drums, but it's Redman's
show.
	   His renditions are accessible enough for the smooth-jazz crowd,
but there's substance under the sheen. Redman's tenor does full
justice to Stevie Wonder's beautiful ballad ``Visions,'' and the
Prince tune is a sexy, bluesy workout that The Artist will surely
love.
	   Most remarkable is ``The Times They Are A-Changin','' a song
long ago reduced to cultural cliche. Redman makes it seem fresh
again with an inventive, swinging performance, and it turns out the
Dylan chestnut is a timeless tale after all.
	   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``All Disco Dance Must End in Broken Bones'' (Virgin) _ Whale
	   ``Gran Turismo'' (Mercury) _ The Cardigans
	   Whale's newest album has one of the best titles of the year _
``All Disco Dance Must End in Broken Bones'' _ and the originality
doesn't end there.
	   The latest release by the Swedish band, known mostly for the
hyper 1994 MTV buzz hit, ``Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe,'' has so much
energy and the band seems to be having so much fun that it's nearly
impossible to resist.
	   Part rap, pop, techno, punk with a few samples thrown in
(including Chris Isaak and Neneh Cherry), ``All Disco'' begins with
the trancelike ``Crying at Airports'' and keeps the intensity going
with the sultry ``Smoke'' and the hip-hop dance track ``Four Big
Speakers.''
	   Fellow countrymen The Cardigans could take a cue from Whale's
exuberance. ``Gran Turismo,'' their follow-up to ``First Band on
the Moon,'' is a far cry from the band's 1960s lounge pop sound
that sounded so fresh a few years ago.
	   Vocalist/lyricist Nina Persson and her bandmates are
accomplished musicians, and it shows on the introspective ballad
``Higher'' and the melancholy beats of ``Erase/Rewind.'' The
problem is that their music sounds so passionless that it's easily
forgettable.
	   _ By David Kligman, Associated Press Writer.

At the Movies: 'Babe: Pig in the City'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: movie opened Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By DOLORES BARCLAY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Arts Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Babe is a pig with a mission.
	   This time, the mission is bigger than herding sheep.
	   It's bigger than saving Ferdinand the duck from becoming a
savory roast.
	   It's bigger than just about anything the little pink porker has
faced in his short life.
	   This time, Babe must save the farm!
	   His quest unfolds in ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' an amusing
little nugget that might lack the simple charm of the original, but
manages to please with a bundle of laughs _ the biggest coming from
the trio of mice who serve as a Greek chorus of sorts.
	   But there's much to be said for simplicity, and ``Babe: Pig in
the City'' suffers from overload. It's busy: too many animals, too
many subplots, too many chases. It's almost like Babe went to
Hollywood instead of merely to the city, and what was so endearing
about the original movie is suddenly lost in a flood of overkill
and a misguided attempt to be clever and cool.
	   Still, the film will find a sure and steady audience among young
and older movie-goers, and Babe remains the most precious little
pig in the whole wide world, a character who can offer excellent
lessons to kids _ and many adults _ in manners, friendship and
charity.
	   Fresh from his triumph at the National Sheep-Dog Trials, where
Babe took home the gold as the best (and only) little sheep-pig
ever, the huggable porker receives a hero's welcome at Hoggett's
Farm, only to succumb to his first (mis)adventure.
	   While Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) lowers himself down the
well to make repairs, Babe, wanting to lend a hoof, leans over the
well, dislodging stones that cause one of the freakiest chain
reactions on film. Hoggett ends up in bed, various body parts
wrapped in plaster or dangling in slings.
	   (Watch for the three mice at this point singing the Edith Piaf
song, ``Non, Je ne Regrette Rien'' _ ``I Regret Nothing.'' It's a
hoot _ one of many mouse musical interludes you'll love, including
``Are You Lonesome Tonight.'')
	   So the work is left to Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski), who
quickly is overwhelmed and buried in a mountain of bills. Enter the
bankers, threatening to foreclose. Only one thing to do: Take Babe
the sheep-pig to another competition so he can bring home the cash
to pay off the bankers.
	   But things, as they are known to do, go awry. Mrs. Hoggett gets
held up at customs after a drug dog ``sniffs'' out Babe, and they
miss the competition. That means they must spend the night in ...
the city. Oh my.
	   And what a city it is. The filmmakers have blended elements of
Manhattan, Hollywood, Venice, Paris, Tokyo and London into one
cartoonlike cityscape.
	   Mrs. Hoggett and Babe move into a hotel that secretly houses
animals (a local resident has lobbied against pets in the
neighborhood), and when Mrs. Hoggett goes out to phone home, one of
the hotel's guests, a capuchin monkey, steals her suitcase. Babe
takes off in pursuit and meets the monkey's friends, among them _ a
saucy chimp named Zootie, and a rather forbidding orangutan named
Thelonius.
	   The primates' owner is Fugly Floom (Mickey Rooney in a somewhat
grotesque impersonation), a clown who uses the animals in his act.
Floom sees a possible star in Babe and hides him just as Mrs.
Hoggett returns. Thinking her pig missing, she roams the city
looking for him only to be arrested after a failed purse-snatch and
near-riot.
	   Babe must fend for himself, and with his pure heart, he turns
enemies into friends and saves the hotel's menagerie from medical
research.
	   The dialogue is a lot sassier this time around and aims for a
more sophisticated audience. When Babe tries to persuade the pit
bull to give up his cruel ways, the dog tells the pig that it's all
very genetic _ pit bulls are bred that way.
	   ``A murderous shadow lies hard across my soul,'' the pit bull
says.
	   Babe die-hards might miss the barnyard crew _ the border
collies, Whisky the cow and the sheep _ but some of the new animals
are just as much fun, like Zootie the chimp, the pit bull, and
Flealick, a disabled dog whose hind legs are propped up on wheels.
It figures that Flealick likes to chase trucks.
	   And the special effects that simulate the animals speaking
remain worthy.

Takahashi claims first gold of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Naoko Takahashi won the first
gold of the XIII Asian Games Sunday with a commanding victory in
the women's marathon.
	   Takahashi made a flying start and led all the way to post an
unofficial winning time of 2 hours, 21 minutes, 46 seconds.
	   At the 25-kilometer mark of the 42-kilometer race she was 9
minutes in front of a pack of four runners and extended the lead to
12 minutes after 35 kilometers.
	   The race started in cool conditions at 0630 local time but got
hotter as the race progressed. The slight Japanese runner completed
the race in a near-empty main stadium.
	   The games will be opened later Sunday by King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch.

	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ Gabonese President Omar Bongo faced his
second multi-party election Sunday in a contest his opponents said
was marred by extensive voter fraud even before the polls opened.
	   Bongo, with his enormous finances, well-run campaign machine,
fractured opposition and extensive patronage system was widely
expected to win another seven-year term as president of this
oil-rich Central African country. Even many of his opponents'
supporters say their candidate will lose.
	   The only question for most observers was whether Bongo, who ran
a single party state from 1967-1990, will get the 51 percent needed
to win outright and avoid a second round of voting later in
December.
	   ``The government wants to make sure that the candidate Omar
Bongo is elected before the vote count is done,'' Pierre
Mamboundou, a former postal executive who is one of Bongo's two
main opponents, said Saturday at a news conference.
	   Mamboundou accused Bongo's regime of tampering with voter
registration lists and keeping the National Electoral Commission
weak to make sure he wins another term.
	   The government denies the allegations, but diplomats said the
election had serious organizational problems, with questions about
the size of the voter lists and the whereabouts of missing voter
cards.
	   Bongo faces seven opponents, though only Mamboundou and the Rev.
Paul Mba Abessole, a Roman Catholic priest, are believed to have
significant support.
	   What comes after the election, though, will test the winner _ no
matter who that is.
	   Rioting shook Libreville after Gabon's 1993 elections, the first
multi-party presidential voting after 26 years of one-party rule.
Bongo claimed victory, but protesters said the vote was rigged.
Similar accusations already are being made by Bongo's opponents,
although no violence has been reported.
	   Other problems also are looming.
	   Gabon's oil reserves are feared to be running dry and the price
of oil is plummeting, meaning this petroleum-nourished nation may
have to cope with the crippling of it's greatest source of income.
	   With a population of 1.2 million, Gabon has an average per
capita income of about dlrs 3,900 a year, a small fortune compared
to many other African nations.
	   Bongo, however, insists that he holds the key to stability _ and
thus to prosperity.
	   His opponents, though, lash out at him for his autocratic rule,
his corruption and the electoral tampering they say is rampant.
	   Bongo, who took power after his predecessor's death in 1967 and
held tightly to control through his feared presidential guards, has
relaxed his rule since pro-democracy protests forced him to allow
opposition parties in 1990. These days, Bongo is openly criticized
in the newspapers and by his opponents.
	   Still, nearly all roads to power in this sparsely populated but
heavily forested nation lead to Bongo.
	   He enjoys great support rooted in Gabon's oil wealth and his
skill at building coalitions among the country's myriad ethnic
groups.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand: reigning monarch.
	   Kim Chang of North Korea took the silver medal in 2:34.54, 13
minutes, 8 seconds behind Takahashi, after a battle with Japan's
Tomoko Kai.

Kim kicked past with 100-meters to run to finish stronger.
	   Takahashi, who earlier this year became the first Japanese woman
to win an IAAF Grand Prix event, was well inside the games record
of 2:29:32 set by 1994 winner Zhong Huandi of China and 59 seconds
outside the world record set by Kenya's Tegla Loroupe in Rotterdam
this year.
	   Takahashi also improved her own national record time of 2:25:48,
set at the Nagoya International Women's Marathon in March.
	   Veteran runner Irina Bogacheva of Kyrgyzstan and Guilsara
Dadabaeva failed to take their places in the field.

Report Julie Andrews plans to sing again, despite surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Julie Andrews has dismissed reports that her
singing career was over because of throat surgery, a British
newspaper said Sunday.
	   ``I will sing again,'' the 63-year-old actress was quoted as
saying in an interview in The Mail on Sunday. ``It's true my voice
is a little weak at the moment, but I'm resting it and it will get
better. I'm sure it will.
	   ``I had an operation on my throat 18 months ago to remove some
harmless nodules. Since then I have been in what is called slow
vocal recovery. It's not a long-term problem. It will get back to
what it was.''
	   Last month her husband, film director Blake Edwards, was quoted
as telling Parade magazine in the United States that he did not
think she would sing again.
	   Last year she was forced to quit her lead role in the Broadway
musical Victor/Victoria. She underwent surgery to remove
non-cancerous nodules in her throat, prompting speculation of
permanent damage to her voice.
	   Julie Andrews last appeared on stage in New York in September as
the host of ``Leading Ladies of Broadway,'' a one-night musical
evening at Carnegie Hall. She did not sing during the concert which
featured such musical theater stars as Liza Minnelli, Dorothy
Loudon, Audra McDonald and Elaine Stritch.
	   She starred in the movie versions of ``Mary Poppins'' and ``The
Sound of Music,'' and in the original Broadway versions of ``My
Fair Lady'' and ``Camelot.''
	   ``Victor/Victoria,'' one of seven films she made with Edwards,
in October 1995 was turned into a Broadway musical that earned her
a Tony Award nomination.
	   The actress quit ``Victor/Victoria'' in June 1997 to have
surgery and was replaced by Raquel Welch. The musical folded six
weeks later at a sizable financial loss.

Offsides in Bangkok: Viagra and night life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo XBK114 Dec. 4 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For some teams, ``out of bounds'' at
the Asian Games means more than just a line on a soccer field or
basketball floor.
	   That's because the host city offers the punchy mix of Viagra and
notorious night life.
	   The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the
games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder
drug and ``night life ideas.''
	   The Indian team's solution is mandatory meetings for all
athletes before bedtime.
	   The Sri Lankan participants, who had to sign a code of conduct
before coming to Bangkok, are being watched by an army brigadier
with a track record of high discipline.
	   The Chinese have done their homework on staying out of trouble.
	   Thailand, especially the capital Bangkok, is known worldwide for
its titillating night life. From taxi drivers to local tourist
magazines distributed free at hotels, there are messengers aplenty
to advertise massage parlors and escort services. Minutely detailed
photo albums seek to arouse sensual fantasies.
	   Estimates of the number of female sex workers in Thailand, a
country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 to 2 million.
	   Under Thailand's drug rules, Viagra is not available in drug
stores, but is sold only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription
from a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist for
400 baht (about dlrs 10) a dose.
	   But there is a black market in the drug that might prove an
attraction for some among the more than 15,000 athletes, officials
and media personnel in Bangkok.
	   ``No way,'' said Gurdayal Singh Mander, leader of the Indian
contingent, when asked if there was a risk of lack in discipline.
	   ``I believe no one will try anything silly in Bangkok. Even if
they try, our watching system is watertight and we will know,''
said Mander, a former police officer. Indian officials in charge of
various sports meet their athletes at 10 p.m. before bedtime at the
Asian Games village.
	   The Pakistanis have opted for trust and nationalism.
	   ``Oh, Viagra,'' exclaimed Pakistani medical officer Yousef Baig.
	   ``They know all about it and they know all about Bangkok. We
have told them, don't break our trust and keep the good name of
Pakistan flying high,'' Dr. Baig said.
	   China has taken a similar approach.
	   ``We don't treat them as kids, telling them don't do this, don't
do that. We just told them to leave a good impression of Chinese
athletes,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese delegation.
	   For the Sri Lankans, ``we have told them that they will not be
allowed outside the games village until they finish their
discipline,'' said Upali Bandaratillaka, a serving brigadier in the
Sri Lankan army.
	   ``Even if they want to go to shopping, one of us will accompany
them,'' Bandaratillaka said. His deputy is a police officer.
	   Host Thailand is stressing that sex isn't lurking around every
corner.
	   A ``Traditional Thai Massage Parlor'' has been opened at the
games' village.
	   ``Thai traditional massage is considered an art form,'' said
Prarop Laovanich, secretary of the Asian Games Sub-Committee for
Culture and Performance. ``A skilled masseur can cure ailments and
muscular fatigue.''
	   And one must wear baggy white pajamas before a traditional Thai
massage.

	   JERBA, Tunisia (AP) _ After meeting Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the
bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too
distant future.''
	   Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to
agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270
people.
	   Annan spoke to reporters in the Libyan capital of Tripoli after
the meeting and later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island,
where he had begun the day of diplomacy that lasted nearly 15
hours.
	   The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan said in
Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to
find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.
	   ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and
believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other
outstanding issues,'' he said.
	   ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able
to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial.
	   Annan said he was tired after arriving back in Jerba. He was to
leave Sunday for a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
federation of six Gulf states, which begins Monday in the United
Arab Emirates.
	   In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said
the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is
``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
	   ``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,''
Foley said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103
tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.''
	   The meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news
agency, JANA, reported that Annan might not be able to meet with
the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.''
	   JANA reported that Annan met with Libya's foreign minister, Omar
al-Muntasser, in Sirte, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of Tripoli.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on an hour's
trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet with
Gadhadi in a tent with a roaring fire outside.
	   Earlier, Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to
hand over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room
in case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the
United States and Britain.
	   JANA indicated a decision on handing over the two suspects would
have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees
before being considered by the Parliament.
	   Libyan radio reported that the Parliament had been called to
meet Tuesday in Sirte but did not say whether the Lockerbie issue
would be discussed.
	   Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from Jerba after
receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Libya has
been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over
the two suspects.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but
do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.
	   The Netherlands was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed a
trial in a neutral country. But a disagreement has arisen because
wants the suspects jailed in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted,
but the United States and Britain insist they be imprisoned in
Scotland.

Former coup leader favorite to win Venezuela presidential vote
</HEADLINE>

expected by 0000 GMT Monday. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A former army paratrooper who once
staged a bloody coup attempt was the front-runner heading into
Sunday's presidential elections, according to the latest polls,
despite a last-minute attempt to consolidate support for his
opposition.
	   Because of former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez's meteoric rise in the
polls, the vote has turned into a confrontation between rich and
poor _ and a flashing red warning sign for the rest of Latin
America.
	   For the first time in 40 years of democracy, neither of
Venezuela's two traditional parties are fielding candidates.
	   In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government. His candidacy has blown a hole
through the conventional wisdom that democracy and free markets
were inescapable in Latin America.
	   ``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has
happened in Venezuela's political history,'' U.S. Ambassador John
Maisto said Saturday.
	   In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, both the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped
their respective candidates during the past week and threw their
support to independent candidate Henrique Salas Romer, who is
running second in the polls.
	   But the attempt to close ranks around Salas appears to have
failed. A poll taken earlier this week by the private Datanalisis
firm showed Chavez with a comfortable 16-point lead _ he had 53
percent support compared to Salas's 37 percent. The survey of 1,000
likely voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for a
slowing of privatization and free-market economic reforms, already
won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, breaking
the two traditional parties' 40-year political stranglehold.
	   Yet Salas supporters point out that the well-greased political
machinery of the old-style parties could bring out the vote and
enable their candidate to stage an upset victory on Sunday.
	   Until this week, Salas had taken great pains to distance himself
from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware that most Venezuelans
blame them for squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside
the Middle East.
	   The campaign has taken on overtones of class warfare. Those who
oppose Salas, a former governor of industrial Carabobo state, say
he would defend the interests of the oligarchy if elected.
	   And Chavez's opponents say he is a dictator-in-waiting.
	   ``To those who call us coup leaders or tyrants, we have to
respond to them as Jesus of Nazareth: Forgive them, Lord, for they
know not what they do,'' Chavez bellowed to hundreds of thousands
of supporters at his closing rally in Caracas Wednesday night.
	   Yet Chavez's militaristic rhetoric and his trademark red
parachutist's beret, worn by his supporters at campaign rallies,
have terrified middle and upper class Venezuelans, many of whom
have already fled to Miami.
	   An acute economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices
has made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than
15 years.
	   On Sunday, 11 million of the country's 23 million inhabitants
are eligible to vote and turnout is expected to be high.
	   Among the trailing candidates is former Miss Universe Irene
Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. Her candidacy
was badly damaged by confusion among her staff and an endorsement
by COPEI, which many people thought compromised her independence.

Hall beats Begini in light heavyweight bout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Light heavyweight Richard Hall,
the World Boxing Association's No. 2 contender, registered a quick,
convincing victory over New Zealander Anthony Bigeni on Saturday,
stopping him in the third round.
	   After a tentative start, Hall took control in the second round,
backing Bigeni into the ropes and administering a solid beating as
Bigeni held up his hands, offering no offense.
	   He knocked Bigeni down early in the third and later forced him
into the ropes again, unloading about eight consecutive punches and
bloodying his right eye before referee Rudy Battle stepped in at
1:49 of the round.
	   Hall, of Winter Haven, Florida, boosted his record to 23-1 and
captured what was billed as the ``interim'' WBA light heavyweight
title. Bigeni, of Otaharu, New Zealand, dropped to 19-5.
	   The fight was on the undercard of the Johnny Tapia-Nana Konadu
WBA bantamweight title match at the Atlantic City Convention
Center.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Naoko Takahashi set her sights
on the world marathon record after a brave front-running
performance gave her the first gold medal of the 13th Asian Games
Sunday.
	   Takahashi was on world record pace through 20 kilometers (12
miles) of the 42.195-kilometer (26-mile, 385-yard) event but found
it hard to maintain her tempo in rising heat as no one pushed her
along.
	   Her official time of 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds shattered
the Asian record of 2:24:07 set by China's Wang Junxia in 1993 and
was one minute outside the world record of 2:20:47 set by Kenya's
Tegla Loroupe in Rotterdam this year. It was far faster than the
old games record of 2:29:32 set by China's Zhong Huangdi in 1994.
	   Her coach, Yoshio Koide, says Takahashi has the ability to run 2
hours, 18 minutes given the right conditions.
	   ``At 20 kilometers, I didn't intend to lose the pace but my body
wouldn't keep going properly,'' Takahashi said. ``I wasn't
expecting a world record here but it's true that I'll look back and
think I could have done much better over the last 10 kilometers (6
miles).''
	   The 26-year-old made a flying start and was already holding a
good lead at 10km. She finished more than 13 minutes ahead of North
Korean Kim Chang, who outsprinted Japan's Tomoko Kai down the final
100 meters in the main stadium to take the silver.
	   Takahashi is tiny but coach Koide said she is powered by a
voracious appetite.
	   ``Sometimes she will eat a whole plate of meat and 50 pieces of
sushi in one go,'' Koide said. ``She has noticed a Chinese
restaurant in Bangkok and wants me to go there with her tonight.
... She'll probably stop for more food at a street stall after
that.''
	   Koide said Takahashi's next race would be the world
championships in Seville next year but added that the record would
have to wait.
	   ``It will be very hot there and that's not too good,'' Koide
said. ``With her ability now she can break the record any time the
conditions are good.'' He said he did not know which race Takahashi
would target after the world title.
	   Takahashi admitted she started to flag as temperatures picked up
following a cool dawn.
	   ``It was very, very hard at 30 kilometers (19 miles) but
everyone kept saying you're doing good, so I kept going,'' she
added.
	   The marathon finished about 10 hours before the start of
Sunday's opening ceremony. The games will be formally opened by
King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch.

Thai opposition admits it doesn't have the votes to impeach Chuan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's opposition admitted it does
not have enough votes in parliament to dismiss Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, but will file an impeachment motion anyway, an opposition
leader said, according to local papers.
	   Snoh Thienthong said his party would impeach Chuan to focus
attention on what he claimed was the prime minister's
unconstitutional promises to the International Monetary Fund, the
Bangkok Post reported Sunday.
	   Snoh's New Aspiration Party announced earlier this week it will
file the impeachment motion on Dec. 9.
	   The opposition contends that Chuan and his finance minister have
violated Article 224 of the new constitution by signing letters of
intent to the IMF promising reforms that require legislation
without first consulting parliament.
	   The IMF is overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the
troubled Thai economy, and requiring economic reforms in exchange.
	   The new constitution says that any treaties or agreements
affecting Thailand's sovereignty or requiring laws to be passed
must first be reviewed by parliament.
	   Chuan has countered that the letters of intent are neither
treaties nor binding, and so do not violate the charter.
	   The coalition government holds a commanding majority in the
House of Representatives and so could easily defeat an impeachment
move there.
	   The opposition was hoping for crucial support in the Senate, but
this week many senators voiced disapproval of the intention to
impeach the prime minister.

Indonesian Roman Catholics pray in front of church burned down by

<TEXT>
	   UJUNGPANDANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Guarded by riot police, about 600
Roman Catholics solemnly read the Bible at a Sunday service in
front of a church that was attacked and burned by Muslim mobs.
	   Several worshippers wept and three Christian soldiers joined the
congregation in the city of Ujungpandang on Sulawesi island, the
latest site of religious violence that has hit Indonesia in recent
weeks.
	   On Friday, rioters climbed over the fence and through the
windows of the Kare Catholic Church, smashing windows and setting
fire to the building with kerosene. Pews and prayer books were
placed in heaps and set on fire. Statues and other holy ornaments
were smashed.
	   During the past two weeks, at least 25 churches and 18 mosques
have been set afire or ransacked by the followers of rival faiths
in five cities and towns across the sprawling island nation of more
than 300 ethnic groups.
	   Social tensions are on the rise in the world's most populous
Muslim nation amid political turmoil, student protests and the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   At the Sunday service in Ujungpandang, Rev. Van Rooy, a
Dutch-born priest assigned to the Kare Church, urged the Christian
minority not to retaliate and appealed for harmony among religious
groups.
	   ``I don't want to retaliate because it is useless. Let's leave
behind what has happened,'' he said. ``I urge the faithful people
of Indonesia to share life with each other and to stop attacking
each other.''
	   Security officers in black berets and carrying sticks and
shields stood guard nearby.
	   Police said the attack took place after weekly prayers ended at
nearby mosques and appeared to be an act of revenge for assaults
against Muslim places of worship in the city of Kupang, southeast
of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
	   Ujungpandang is 840 miles (1,350 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
The city was calm on Sunday, with food vendors plying the streets
with their carts and many shops open. Fearful of another outbreak
of violence, security forces patrolled the main roads.
	   Indonesia's security problems have worsened since May when
deadly riots and protests helped oust former President Suharto. The
authoritarian leader had kept a lid on the Indonesian archipelago's
social and ethnic rivalries by cracking down on dissent.
	   His successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie, lacks
credibility among many Indonesians and is beset by economic trouble
and student protests for swift democratic change. The religious
strife of the last few weeks has added to the challenges he faces.
	   ``We feel very sad,'' said Marthinus Diry, a worshipper who
mourned the burning of the church in Ujungpandang. ``It is proof
that the national political situation is no longer safe for the
people.''

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As part of his 71st birthday
celebrations, Thailand's king bestowed royal decorations on 5,000
of his subjects who performed service to the country or made large
contributions to charity, local papers reported on Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, two people were sentenced to prison terms for
soliciting donations in exchange for royal decorations that turned
out to be fakes, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Among those admitted to various royal orders by King Bhumibol
Adulyadej were 80 Cabinet members and high-ranking officials, The
Nation reported.
	   King Bhumibol, a constitutional monarch who is revered by his
subjects as a demigod, is the longest reigning monarch in the world
with 52 years on the throne. He birthday was Dec. 5.
	   The two people jailed for selling phony decorations included a
woman who once worked for the Royal Ceremonial Affairs Division.
She received nine months, and her companion was sentenced to four
months in jail.
