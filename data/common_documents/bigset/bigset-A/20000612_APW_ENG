Report: Shots Fired At Fiji Rebel Leader
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The military opened fire Monday on a car carrying rebel
leader George Speight, according to a rebel spokesman who said the bullets did
not hit Speight, who holds 31 people hostage in Fiji's parliament. The gunfire
broke out Monday afternoon as Speight was returning from a meeting in the vice
president's house, leaving Speight uninjured but ''a bit shaken,'' spokesman Joe
Nata said. Speight's car, a dark green Hyundai sedan, was peppered with at least
two bullet holes. Speight had not previously been attacked since he seized his
hostages May 19.

Iraq Asks UN For Money For Supplies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq asked the United Nations on Sunday to free up $400
million from the surplus in an escrow account to purchase humanitarian supplies
for the Iraqi people. The request came in a letter from Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and was carried by
the official Iraqi News Agency. The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to
circumvent U.N. economic sanctions and sell oil under U.N. supervision. However,
the money earned has to be deposited in an escrow account in a French bank and
can only be used to buy food and humanitarian goods after every contract has
been approved by the U.N. sanctions committee.

Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of death penalty cases that were appealed from
1973 through 1995 were successful, report researchers who contend the nation's
capital punishment system is ''collapsing under the weight of its own
mistakes.'' A study of 4,578 appeals during those years showed that most cases
''are so seriously flawed that they have to be done over again,'' said Columbia
University law professor James Liebman, the lead author. Earlier this year,
Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed a moratorium on capital
punishment in his state after 13 death row inmates were exonerated.

Web Attracts Younger News Audience
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key segments of the nation's news audience, particularly
younger and better-educated Americans, and those seeking financial information,
are turning increasingly to the Internet, says a new poll on media trends. The
Web's rapid growth as a source for news continues a splintering of that audience
among the Internet, cable and broadcast television, and print publications. A
third of the public now goes online for news at least once a week, compared to a
fifth two years ago, according to a Pew Research poll. Fifteen percent get daily
reports from the Internet, almost three times the number two years ago.

   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- A new group of militants gunned down a man
Sunday in the Solomon Islands, officials said, a killing that diplomats feared
could end a fragile cease-fire and spark another cycle of revenge attacks in the
South Pacific nation. The shooting came as a new wave of foreign tourists and
workers, many pushing carts piled high with luggage, lined up at the airport in
the capital, Honiara to be evacuated. Despite the evacuations, Honiara appeared
relatively calm.

May 21 because of technical problems and political disputes. There was no
violence during the vote, election office president Benoit Guerrier said,
despite long lines caused when some stations opened late. Results were expected
later this week, with a run-off round scheduled for June 25.

NAACP Head Shinhoster Dies in Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Earl T. Shinhoster, the acting executive director of
the NAACP in the mid-1990s, died Sunday in a car crash at age 47. The driver of
a car Shinhoster was riding in apparently lost control after a tire blew out off
Interstate 85 about 25 miles east of Montgomery, said Cpl. Damon Summers. The
car went off the interstate, overturned, and hit a tree, killing Shinhoster.
Shinhoster was the director of the NAACP's People's Voter Empowerment project, a
national voter registration and education program. Shinhoster was with the NAACP
for 30 years, and served in several senior positions.

<HEADLINE> Derailed train closes three schools, forces evacuation of 16 families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Three schools are closed today and 44
people are evacuated from their homes until tomorrow following
derailment of a train carrying hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the Delaware &AMP; Hudson Railroad train's 82 cars
were derailed in the rural town of Harpursville, 16 miles east of
Binghamton, said state police Sgt. Steven Meyer. Seventeen of those
29 contained hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment happened about 2:45 p.m. Saturday east of Route
79 in Harpursville, parallel to Route 7.
</P>
<P>
   A car carrying methyl chloride began leaking sometime after the
accident and before 9 p.m. Methyl chloride is a colorless,
flammable material that is toxic in high concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the train's other cars were carrying sulfuric acid and
propane, Meyer said. Soil in the area was found to be contaminated
with nickel hydroxide, which is flammable and toxic as a dust or
fume.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were initial reports of chemical leakage, officials
Sunday said that there had been no leaks and that the evacuations
were precautionary. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad tracks are expected to be closed until Thursday
because of damage done to some 2,000 miles of track.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were still investigating the cause of the accident.
The train was going 35 mph, the posted speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sabol of Harpursville said the track was lifted on its side
and cars that were ''stacked, tipped and twisted.''
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;H Railroad officials declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Arson Suspect To Be Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man seen pedaling away from a burning home
was charged with arson Sunday, and police say they plan to question
him about 40 other suspicious fires that have kept the surrounding
neighborhoods on edge for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Reed, 31, who once spent three years in prison for
killing the owner of an empty home he had broken into, was arrested
early Sunday after witnesses saw him ridding away from a vacant
home that had been set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are all sorts of mights and could bes that we are
looking into,'' said Tampa Fire Capt. Bill Wade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, more than three dozen fires have been set in
Tampa Heights and neighboring sections of Ybor City, near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been injured in the fires, primarily abandoned and
occupied homes, but some were set at night while people were
sleeping inside. Investigators have said they believe the fires
were set by more than one person, but the only other person charged
is believed to be connected to only one blaze.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to second-degree arson, Reed was charged Sunday with
a weapons violation; officers who arrested him said he was carrying
a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Reed spent three years in prison after he was convicted of the
1986 stabbing of 71-year-old Roger Weaver, who had come to check on
a vacant home he owned. Unknown to Weaver, Reed had been living in
the house for at least two days. He stabbed Weaver when he walked
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After being declared incompetent to stand trial for three years,
Reed was convicted of third-degree murder in 1989. He has been in
and out of prison since, his last release coming in September.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held on $48,500 bond.
</P>
<P>
   The arsons, which started in June of last year, have been a blow
to city leaders who had been pushing to rebuild the neighborhoods
of historic homes.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Make Most of Tarmac Time  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After talking about Social Security and raising
gobs of money for the Republican Party, George W. Bush had one more
task before leaving California.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential contender had to rub ''Bullet'' behind the
ears.
</P>
<P>
   The panting police dog stood with his handler at Lindbergh
Field, and Bush walked over to pet him. Just another part of an
enduring campaign routine: shaking hands and posing for pictures
with the police and other people who help politicians pull off
their events.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Vice President Al Gore uses just about every airport
arrival and departure to press the flesh with local officials,
campaign volunteers and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Every motorcycle cop helping with his motorcade is invited to
line up on the tarmac for a handshake and souvenir photo with Air
Force Two as a backdrop. The Democratic presidential candidate also
ducks under the plane's nose to say hi to members of the ground
crew.
</P>
<P>
   For the police and campaign workers, the pictures provide a
souvenir image with a possible president. For the candidates, the
favors ingratiate them with loyalists and voters they want to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Because of security concerns, the routine is different when
President Clinton flies into town. Mostly just invited guests get
close enough to Air Force One for a presidential handshake.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, too, was a tarmac wizard when he first ran for
office.
</P>
<P>
   Spending a moment with a candidate was nothing new for Denver
police officer Steven Palka.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Bush shook his hand and posed for a picture, Palka
said, ''His dad (former President Bush) was just like this. So was
his mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I did motorcades with his dad, and he'd walk a city block just
to say hi to me,'' Palka recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As with Gore, each time Bush jets into town, his staff lines up
''greeters'' at the bottom of the aircraft stairs to welcome the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to go, Bush says goodbye to the campaign
loyalists who have worked on the visit.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes hands with the workers who throw the chocks under the
nose gear of his Miami Air charter to keep it from rolling out of
place.
</P>
<P>
   Backslaps and shoulder squeezes go to the aircraft fuelers or
baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
   More goodbyes are said to the bus drivers who cart around the
traveling press or the caterers who stock the aircraft gallies.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 15 minutes later, the last hand Bush shakes before
departing a city usually belongs to a local police officer.
Typically, it is one of the legions who work with the Secret
Service to chart Bush's motorcade routes and then lead the way by
motorcycle or police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been helping us get around the town. I want to show my
appreciation,'' Bush said one afternoon aboard his plane as it flew
away from Ontario, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Before the governor climbed aboard, a technician wearing a
''Crime Scene Photographer'' shirt snapped pictures of him with the
local police.
</P>
<P>
   Such gestures are not lost on the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really appreciate it,'' said California Highway Patrol Sgt.
J.R. Kling. ''There's a lot of time we devote just for him to come
in one time. It's nice to be noticed.''

<HEADLINE> High Schools Face Trauma of Suicide  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many high school principals, Mike Warbel had a plan ready
when the bad news came. It proved useful yet of scant consolation
after two student sweethearts committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors deployed at East Knox High School in Howard,
Ohio; teachers read a message in their classrooms; students were
encouraged to vent their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following last month's suicides, Warbel faced some
tough decisions. Should the prom be canceled? Should he speak at
memorial services?
</P>
<P>
   His choices -- the prom was held, he did give a memorial speech --
weren't based on any formal training. ''You have a sense of how to
react to your kids,'' Warbel said. ''You can't be afraid of making
a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   A sadly high number of his peers confront similar dilemmas.
About 2,000 American adolescents kill themselves each year.
</P>
<P>
   After accidents and homicides, suicide is the third-leading
cause of death for teen-agers. According to federal estimates, one
of every five high school students has thought seriously about
attempting suicide, and one in 14 has made an actual attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this toll, school personnel are struggling to find
effective ways to prevent suicide and cope with its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools lack full-time staff trained to detect mental
illness, and experts offer conflicting advice about
suicide-prevention strategies. Post-suicide procedures also are a
challenge; administrators try to accommodate grief without
glamorizing a death in a way that might encourage copycats.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our decision-making process, we were keeping two things in
mind,'' Warbel said. ''We wouldn't do anything to tarnish the
images of these two kids, or intensify the grief of their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   East Knox High, like many schools, doesn't have a distinct
suicide-prevention course; it addresses suicide in the broader
context of mental health. Many experts counsel against overly
specific courses, saying they could backfire among students already
harboring suicidal thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're talking to a big class and saying a lot of things
about suicide, different people listen to different words,'' said
Dr. David Shaffer, a Columbia University psychiatrist who heads the
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the disturbed kids, you probably reawaken bad thoughts and
bad memories and set them off again,'' he said. ''We recommend
teaching teen-agers about depression, how to recognize the
symptoms, and give that lesson without mentioning suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, while agreeing that caution is warranted, say
teachers shouldn't shy from explicit mention of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adolescents are smarter than we give them credit for. If
you're dancing around something, they know it,'' said Lindy
Garnette, director of child and family services for the National
Mental Health Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't commit suicide because somebody mentioned it. It
can be a huge relief to hear the word, and be able to talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say suicide should not be broached at all in
school. The Eagle Forum, led by conservative activist Phyllis
Schlafly, complains that ''death education'' pervades U.S. high
schools and urges parental skepticism of suicide-awareness
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But prevention advocates say such objections often fade when
suicide strikes close to home. Programs that increase awareness of
depression are widely supported; so are initiatives encouraging
young people to advise an adult if a friend reveals suicidal
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too often the case that students feel they can deal with
this stuff themselves,'' said Dr. Alan Berman, executive director
of the American Association of Suicidology.
</P>
<P>
   Screening for Mental Health, an organization in Wellesley,
Mass., is recruiting 500 high schools nationwide for a program next
fall aimed at identifying students prone to depression.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kopans, the group's vice president, outlined how
students will complete a questionnaire anonymously and score
themselves. The goal: Enabling students to recognize danger signs
in themselves and their friends. ''We want to empower young people
to take action,'' Kopans said.
</P>
<P>
   At East Knox High, a 560-student school in central Ohio, Warbel
regretted that suicide victims Joseph Hall and Rachel Hanna didn't
seek help.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had more lifelines than 95 percent of the kids in this
country, and didn't use them,'' Warbel said. ''The most important
message to our kids is don't be afraid to express yourself. If you
think things are so dire that you might consider harming yourself,
get up on my desk or your teacher's desk and stomp your feet until
someone hears you.''
</P>
<P>
   If suicide prevention remains an uncertain science, so-called
postvention -- handling a suicide's aftermath -- is even more
improvisational.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Hall and Hanna killed themselves by setting
their car ablaze, Warbel decided against holding a school-wide
assembly. He asked teachers to break the news in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the kids in a familiar setting, and then if you drop
a bomb in their laps it's a little easier for them to respond,''
Warbel said. ''You go through your daily routine... The bells still
ring. But the students are free to go anytime to counselors, or
just sit around in groups and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Warbel initially felt anger toward Hall and Hanna -- popular
Honor Roll students and varsity athletes -- because of the pain they
caused their schoolmates. By the time he spoke at Hanna's memorial
service, the anger eased.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all loved these two kids, we miss them tremendously,'' he
said. ''That should never change, no matter what caused their
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Warbel, in his first year as a principal after 28 years as coach
and assistant principal, was determined to restore some semblance
of normality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went ahead with the prom,'' he said. ''We encouraged our
kids, told them they should come without remorse... They came
early, stayed late. It might have helped in the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, of the American Association of Suicidology, empathized
with administrators facing such traumas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a thin line to walk, to be sensitive and responsive to
the need to mourn,'' he said. ''It needs to be done in a downplayed
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kuranz, president-elect of the American School Counselors
Association, recalled using a crisis plan after a suicide at Case
High School in Racine, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   A girl died in a car crash, he said, and was remembered with a
memorial and a tree planting. Soon afterward, a student committed
suicide, and the victim's friends wanted a comparable commemoration
</P>
<P>
   ''We struggled to communicate to the kids why that wasn't
appropriate,'' Kuranz said. ''I felt fortunate to have a well
thought-out plan.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of copycat suicides, experts recommend
stressing that most suicides result from mental illness and inflict
deep pain on families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone may pick up on the notoriety, the attention resulting
from a suicide, but they don't apprehend the downside. The
headlines won't say how the family is devastated,'' said David
Brent, professor of child psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometimes conflict arises between a school and a grieving
family. Mary Margaret Kerr, another University of Pittsburgh
professor, recalled an incident where a bereaved father moved a
memorial stone onto a campus against school board wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Another recurring dilemma is whether to award a posthumous
diploma to seniors who commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say, 'Be generous -- give the family the diploma,''' Kerr
said. ''But every now and then, you hear: 'Why should we give
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   As East Knox High's students dispersed for the summer, Warbel
was unsure what legacy the suicides would leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all trying to say it's over,'' he said. ''And I'm not
sure that's the right answer either.''

<HEADLINE> Waco Questions Loom 7 Years Later  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- It's been seven years since 80 people died in
the fiery conclusion to a standoff between the government and the
Branch Davidian religious sect.
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, the two sides will confront each other again -- this
time in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The government is the defendant in a $675 million wrongful death
lawsuit, which consolidates nine civil cases filed in 1994 by
Branch Davidian family members and survivors. Legal maneuvers by
both sides contributed to the delay in bringing the case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges the government used excessive force in the
initial raid on the Branch Davidian compound that started the
51-day standoff, may have caused at least two of the fires that
destroyed the compound and improperly withheld firefighting
assistance. The government denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Early on April 19, 1993, government tanks rammed holes in a
wooden building in the compound, where more than 80 sect members
lived with their leader David Koresh, to allow tear gas canisters
to be thrown inside.
</P>
<P>
   About six hours later, fire raced through the building and
killed 80 people, at least 17 of them children.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lead attorney, Michael Caddell of Houston, said
the lawsuit is not about money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about acknowledgment of shared responsibility and a
commitment that this will never happen again,'' said Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford, lead counsel for the government,
hopes the trial will restore the public's faith in the
law-enforcement community.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a terrible tragedy because there was a significant
loss of life,'' said Bradford. ''It's been a great burden on the
public and certainly on law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately one
of the things that has happened is there has been a lot of
misinformation over the years in public domain through a variety of
sources. We hope this trial will be an opportunity to get the facts
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those facts are in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that FBI agents fired at Davidians during
the final moments of the siege, and that the gunfire was captured
on infrared aerial surveillance tape made by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't prove that any specific individual was killed by
government gunfire on April 19,'' said Caddell. ''The significance
is simply that people would've been afraid to come out of the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense maintains there was no government gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also accuse government agents of using excessive
force during the original Feb. 28 raid on the compound by agents of
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who were
trying to serve search and arrest warrants for suspected firearms
violations. A gunfight broke out and four agents and six Davidians
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the agents were ambushed and were firing back in
self-defense. In 1994 five Davidians were convicted of voluntary
manslaughter in the agents' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell acknowledges that Davidians fired at ATF agents, but
says it's irrelevant who fired first. ''The ATF never had the right
to fire willy-nilly into a building filled with noncombatants,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Branch Davidians contend that the government
could have been responsible for at least two of three fires that
started on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the government has ''very strong and convincing''
evidence that sect members started the fires. However, the
government has acknowledged that some tear gas canisters were
potentially incendiary.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also alleges that the government was criminally
negligent by ignoring orders to have firefighting equipment on the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford says firefighters were not allowed near the compound
because they were in danger from potentially explosive munitions
stored by the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith ordered a field test in March
simulating the siege. Both sides hoped the test, recorded on
infrared tape, would determine what caused more than 100 flashes to
show up on the FBI's original infrared tape.
</P>
<P>
   A report last month by Vector Data Systems, the court's infrared
expert, said the flashes were sunlight reflecting off debris, not
government gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs say the test violated protocol
agreed upon by both sides and that the court-appointed expert is
less than neutral. Vector is owned by Anteon Corp., which has done
work for U.S. intelligence agencies, the defense department and the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said Vector's analysis was a ''truly independent
evaluation and a very thorough evaluation'' of the infrared tapes.

<HEADLINE> Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of death penalty cases that were
appealed from 1973 through 1995 were successful, report researchers
who contend the nation's capital punishment system is ''collapsing
under the weight of its own mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of 4,578 appeals during those years showed that most
cases ''are so seriously flawed that they have to be done over
again,'' said Columbia University law professor James Liebman, the
lead author.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not one case, it's thousands of cases. It's not one
state, it's almost all of the states,'' Liebman said in an
interview. ''You're creating a very high risk that some errors are
going to get through the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time of increased debate over capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois
imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in his state after 13
death row inmates were exonerated. Texas Gov. George W. Bush
recently approved his first 30-day reprieve in a death penalty case
-- to allow time for DNA testing -- after permitting 131 executions.
</P>
<P>
   But public support for capital punishment remains high. A Gallup
Poll in February showed 66 percent back the use of death sentences,
down somewhat from Gallup polls during the 1990s that showed
support ranging from 71 percent to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia study said only 5 percent of the 5,760 death
sentences imposed from 1973 through 1995 were carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The study, written with professor Jeffrey Fagan and graduate
student Valerie West, examined 4,578 death penalty cases in which
at least one round of appeals was completed. Of those cases, a
state or federal court threw out the conviction or death sentence
in 68 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our 23 years worth of findings reveal a capital punishment
system collapsing under the weight of its own mistakes,'' the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a group
critical of how capital punishment is administered, said, ''It's
amazing how many mistakes are being made. ... Those supporting the
death penalty might look at it and say this isn't getting us
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Sharp of Justice for All, a Houston-based victims' rights
organization, said, ''We all know that these cases get the closest
scrutiny imaginable. ... All systems can be improved and the death
penalty is certainly one of those systems.'' But, he added, there
has been no proof of an innocent person being executed in the past
century.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the rates of reversals varied widely from state
to state and among federal appellate circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which executed 104 people during the study period, showed
52 percent of its death penalty cases reversed on appeal. Florida,
which executed 36 people, had a 73 percent reversal rate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Virginia, which executed 29 people, had a
reversal rate of only 18 percent. The study suggested that may be
partly due to Virginia's strict limits on appeals in death penalty
cases and the overall low reversal rate in the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which hears appeals from that state.
</P>
<P>
   Liebman said the 68 percent reversal rate appears to have come
down some since 1995. A second study to be released later this year
is expected to look at those numbers, as well as the reasons why
death penalty convictions are thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The main reasons appear to be incompetent defense lawyering and
misconduct by prosecutors, the Columbia study said.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment resumed in 1977 after a Supreme Court-imposed
moratorium, and 313 people were executed by the end of 1995. In
recent years, the Supreme Court and Congress have acted to speed up
death penalty reviews in federal courts, and there have been 642
executions to date.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Immunity From U.N. Court  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For U.S. policy-makers, the implications are
chilling: U.S. forces are sent to a distant hot spot, hostilities
occur, innocent civilians die, and Americans are held responsible.
Some are even arrested and sent for trial.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario may not seem far-fetched now that the United
Nations is in the process of establishing a permanent international
criminal court aimed at holding accountable those responsible for
actions deemed to be war crimes or crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   While offering millions to track down war crimes suspects in the
Balkans, the United States is trying to carve out a blanket
exemption protecting American soldiers from being hunted down and
prosecuted by the new U.N. court.
</P>
<P>
   State Department lawyers are beginning the effort Monday at the
United Nations. Human rights experts fear the U.S. example will
encourage other countries, like Iraq, to follow suit and undercut
the United Nations' campaign against war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If an Iraqi military commander committed crimes against
humanity against Iraqi citizens, Iraq as a nonparty state could
deny the court the authority to prosecute. That is in essence what
is wrong with the U.S. effort,'' Richard Dicker of Human Rights
Watch said.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the State Department's ambassador at large for
war crimes, insists immunity for U.S. troops is crucial, given the
numbers of American soldiers deployed overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very inhibiting risk to put on the table every time
you decide whether or not to intervene,'' Scheffer, head of the
U.S. delegation to the United Nations this week, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over Clinton administration objections, agreement was reached at
a U.N. conference in 1998 to establish an international criminal
court, known informally as the ICC. Washington feared U.S. troops
could become targets of politically motivated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 countries have ratified the proposal; five dozen are
needed to create the court.
</P>
<P>
   At present, U.N. war crimes tribunals are dealing with
atrocities committed in the Balkans and in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has offered a reward of up to $5 million
for information leading to the apprehension of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic; Radovan Karadzic, the top Bosnian Serb leader
during Bosnia's civil war; Karadzic's military commander, Ratko
Mladic; and any others indicted by the Balkans tribunal on war
crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say a permanent global tribunal is needed so suspected
war criminals can be pursued regardless of where their crimes are
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would prevent the court from going after Americans even
if the United States is not a member, or ''nonparty state.''
Scheffer's mission in New York is to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe our armed forces should be subject to
surrender to the court because we are a nonparty to the court,''
Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   He also points out that the United States has its own military
justice system designed to punish to U.S. troops suspected of war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Dicker said it is unrealistic for the United States to carve out
an exemption for itself, because other nonparty states will demand
the same treatment. Those countries include Iraq and Libya, both
listed by the State Department as terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Iraq, Libya and the United States were among seven
countries that voted against a treaty to create the court. Voting
in favor were 120 countries.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal the Clinton administration is pushing would prevent
the court from pursuing citizens of nonparty states unless the U.N.
Security Council authorizes it, or if such states have been
condemned by the council ''for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. veto in the council would shield U.S. service members,
but Iraqis and Libyans would be fair game.
</P>
<P>
   The United States faced broad opposition when it fought for a
similar exemption two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through the back door, the State Department is trying to
obtain the concession that it could not obtain in negotiations in
Rome two years ago,'' Dicker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes it all so tragic is that it's all so unnecessary,''
said Dicker. He contends safeguards prevent politically motivated
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome in New York, the prospects of the
United States becoming a court member are doubtful as long as Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who has the power to block U.S. ratification, says the
treaty is a ''flawed and dangerous document'' because it limits
America's freedom to act in its own defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''So long as there is breath in me, the U.S. will never -- I
repeat, never -- allow its national security decisions to be judged
by an International Criminal Court,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> The Government Moves Its Capital  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two hundred years ago this month, packet ships
from Philadelphia tied up at Lear's Wharf on the Potomac River and
unloaded the baggage of government onto wagons and carts.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after work began under the watchful eye of
President Washington, the United States government and its 131
clerks were taking possession of a new capital.
</P>
<P>
   But as members of President John Adams' Cabinet stepped off the
ships to survey the scene, the place was still more construction
site than city.
</P>
<P>
   Cows and pigs wandered freely. Workers' huts and construction
debris littered the grounds of public buildings. Pennsylvania
Avenue was an unpaved, rutted mire clogged with alder brush.
Carpenters and plasterers raced to complete the president's house
at one end of the avenue and one small section of the Capitol at
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The workmen had a deadline. The president and Congress, in
temporary residence at Philadelphia for the last 10 years, would
arrive in November and the work of government would begin, ready or
not.
</P>
<P>
   The full heat and humidity of a Washington summer had yet to
arrive, but political intrigue was already boiling.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in the summer of 1800 was engaged in a bitter
election contest between Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson.
Adams, seeking a second term, was the candidate of the Federalists
who favored a strong central government and a manufacturing
economy. Jefferson's Republicans wanted an agrarian America
centered on the states and free of any taint of monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson and his allies viewed the new federal city with
suspicion and foreboding. They saw hints of royal trappings in the
ceremonially broad avenues and the presidential ''palace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federalists also were not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary John Wolcott arrived on July 1 and settled in
at the Treasury Department just east of the president's house.
After hearing the inflated claims of local landowners about the
city's supposedly rosy future he decided he was ''in the company of
crazy people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Their ignorance of the rest of the world, and their delusions
with respect to their own prospects, are without parallel,''
Wolcott wrote his wife.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's chief financial officer, Wolcott had other
reasons to be appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Immense sums have been squandered in buildings which are but
partly finished,'' he complained. ''With great trouble and expense,
much mischief has been done which will be almost impossible to
remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arnebeck, chronicling the building of the city in his 1991
book, ''Through a Fiery Trial,'' concluded that Wolcott was up to
mischief of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Hamilton, the former Treasury secretary who now pulled
strings from outside the government, asked for inside information
that could be used to embarrass Adams, and perhaps throw the
election to another Federalist candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''So while ditchers opened a drain down 14th Street, Wolcott,
working in an office close by, became Washington's first leak,''
Arnebeck wrote. Whatever information was provided, Hamilton's
purpose was not achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Housing was scarce. Wolcott said he did not know where members
of Congress would reside, ''unless they will consent to live like
scholars in a college, or monks in a monastery, crowded ten or
twenty in one house ....''
</P>
<P>
   The air of political intrigue added to an unsettled feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never felt composed or satisfied since I have been
here,'' the State Department's chief clerk said in a letter.
''Everything is mysterious, and everyman's conduct and opinions
inexplicable.'' The clerk resolved to keep his own opinions to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As the political fever rose, so did the thermometer. ''The heat
here for a few days past has exceeded my experience and unhinged
all my faculties ...,'' James Wilkinson, an Army general, wrote in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a hot and sickly summer, supervisors pressed to get as
much work completed as possible. That meant overcoming a shortage
of such necessary supplies as panes of window glass and door locks.
</P>
<P>
   President Adams made an official 10-day inspection in early June
before traveling home to Boston. He was greeted with a 16-gun
salute, observed the carpenters and plasterers at the Capitol and
the executive mansion and paid a call on the recently widowed
Martha Washington at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Adams voiced hope for an early end to any lingering reluctance
to move the government to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As far as he was concerned, the matter was settled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the Seat of Government very well, and shall sleep, or
lie awake, next winter in the President's house,'' he wrote his
wife.

<HEADLINE> Park Service Set 'Prescribed Fires'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Until last month, the National Park Service
had been sharply increasing the number of fires set to clear brush
and rehabilitate landscapes, tripling the area burned in just four
years.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when a fire set at Bandelier National Monument got
out of control, leading to an inferno that destroyed more than 200
homes in Los Alamos, N.M., and caused hundreds of millions of
dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt halted all ''prescribed fires''
by the Park Service in the West indefinitely, saying an
investigation found ''serious systemic problems in the way the Park
Service conducts prescribed burns.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Service Director Robert Stanton told a House panel last
week that the agency is changing its policies and training to
prevent similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   It was Babbitt who changed policy in 1995 to encourage use of
such fires. He even helped set a prescribed fire in an Idaho
national forest in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional critics say federal land managers should rely more
on ''mechanical thinning'' -- using people and machines to cut down
trees and undergrowth. Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, said the
Clinton administration relies too much on prescribed fires because
of a ''dogmatic, anti-science, anti-technology, anti-people bias.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Fire alone is not sufficient to the task,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But forestry experts say that when properly monitored,
prescribed fires are among the best and cheapest ways to prevent
catastrophic wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you get away from developed areas, fire becomes a more
viable alternative -- there's a reduction in cost, and in threats to
life and property,'' said Park Service fire specialist Tom
Zimmerman. '' ... We're just trying to provide the most appropriate
and cost-effective treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Park Service set a record 326 fires that burned
139,000 acres, according to a computer-assisted analysis of the
agency's fire data. That was a 62 percent jump over the previous
year and triple the acreage burned in 1996. But it still
represented only 0.2 percent of Park Service land.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Park Service set 3,760 prescribed fires since 1970,
burning about 926,000 acres, an area nearly the size of Rhode
Island. By contrast, agency workers battled 43,456 wildfires that
burned nearly 5.5 million acres during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Some agency officials and outside experts say more prescribed
fires are needed to prevent the kind of catastrophic wildfires that
blackened 1 million acres of Yellowstone National Park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even when that number (of prescribed fires) is doubled, it's a
drop in the bucket,'' said Ronald Myers, director of the National
Fire Management Program of The Nature Conservancy, an environmental
group. ''I hope Congress is patient and lets this thing run its
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the low cost, prescribed fires can help prime soil for
new seedlings and spur the reproduction of species such as giant
sequoias, said Nate Stephenson, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist
who studies fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in
California. On the other hand, he said, mechanical treatments
produce less smoke and do not leave fire scars on surviving trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think land managers would be shooting themselves in the foot
to limit themselves to one tool or the other,'' Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   While the current debate focuses on the West, prescribed fires
also are set elsewhere, most notably Florida. The Park Service's
top site for prescribed fires is the Big Cypress National Preserve,
which had 388 set blazes since 1980 that burned nearly 534,000
acres -- an area equivalent to 74 percent of the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We burn throughout the year, whenever the conditions are
appropriate, to remove those hazardous fuels so we don't get those
big, screaming fires we can't control,'' said Larry Belles, the
preserve's fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   Second was the adjoining Everglades National Park, where 363
fires that burned 105,244 acres have been set since 1970. Officials
at the Florida parks said their ecosystems depend on fires every
three to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two hundred years ago, lightning would strike somewhere out in
what are now the Miami suburbs, and over the next few weeks the
fire would burn into the center of the Everglades,'' said Bob
Panko, fire manager for the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ''That can't happen any more, because there's a Kmart out where
the lightning is going to hit. So to respond to that, we've been
lighting fires to maintain that natural regime of fire in our
wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service ban does not apply to Florida, but prescribed
fires in the state have been suspended because of severe drought.
Belles and Panko said they are taking another look at their
planning and procedures because of the New Mexico fire.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, the Park Service director, expects to resume using
prescribed fires in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to ensuring that the mistakes that led to it
(the Los Alamos disaster) are not repeated, so that we can continue
to get the safety and environmental benefits of a prescribed fire
program, with no more tragedies of this type,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Discontent in City School Districts  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) --The toughest spot in American education is the
helm of a large city school district, say leaders and educators
trying to stop the revolving schoolhouse door.
</P>
<P>
   Such districts, whose students are among the poorest and
neediest, can't hold onto their leaders. They pay high salaries,
launch aggressive searches and even hire non-educators presumably
gifted with business and management acumen, but a big-city
superintendent's tenure averages two years. And many top candidates
try their hand in various systems.
</P>
<P>
   Nine top vacancies, and recent high-profile hires in Los Angeles
and New York, highlight the growing discontent in urban school
systems -- and the challenge of finding the right people to turn
them around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many boards are asking superintendents to be messiahs,'' said
Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great
City Schools, a coalition of nearly 60 large districts. ''Urban
districts are a political stew composed of corporations, the
unions, the press and community groups ... they're all fighting
with scarce resources over the one thing they feel most passionate
about: their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not realistic that any superintendent could turn around
some of these systems within two years,'' Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia Superintendent Arlene Ackerman quit last
month after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, the capital city has had eight school chiefs.
Ackerman left to head San Francisco's schools after concluding she
couldn't help a 70,000-student district controlled by a mayoral
board, independent auditors and budget committees in the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''D.C. needs to fix its convoluted and utterly debilitating
governance structure,'' said Casserly. ''Unfortunately, the schools
can't do it because so much is determined elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' superintendent, Ruben Zacarias -- permanently
replaced last week -- was ousted last October after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's chief, David Hornbeck, who quit last week, stands
out as a six-year veteran. The average tenure for all school
leaders is 7{ years.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly said that 15 years ago, systems were being led by
career educators who stayed five times as long. Today, districts
spend six months to a year on searches for superintendents that can
cost $30,000 to $130,000, he said. Then boards must win public
support for salaries that average $175,000, but can reach $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate pool is dwindling as the overwhelmingly white and
male population of school leaders retire, Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   Educators point to other factors, among them increasing pressure
to cut budgets and raise test scores and impatience with career
educators -- leading boards to hire generals, lawyers and
politicians. There's also confusion and conflict about who should
run these schools: the board, the mayor, the state, or in the case
of the District of Columbia, the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone wants to be involved in some way, shape or form in
reforming the school system,'' said Daniel A. Domenech, who runs
the 154,000-student Fairfax County, Va., system. ''Superintendents
find that in a very relative short period of time, two or three
years, that in fact they can't please all of the masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayors in Philadelphia, New York and Detroit have publicly
clashed with school leaders as more politicians seek control over
education, a popular voter issue. And that has taken a toll on
career educators who are not politically astute, some leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are in a fishbowl,'' said Libby Socorro Gil, Chula Vista,
Calif. schools chief, who was a deputy in Seattle. ''I'm not sure
too many traditional educators are prepared for that kind of
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Domenech, a school administrator for nearly three decades, said
enough 4-3 board votes on issues near and dear to him taught him to
join the political arena. ''Most of us got into this business
because we care about kids, but this is not a job anyone is
successful in doing unless you have those alliances. On your own
you're dead in the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts have turned away from educators -- with mixed
results. Retired Gen. John Stanford led the Seattle schools with
charisma and success from 1995 to 1998, when he died of leukemia.
But Julius W. Becton Jr., a former three-star Army general, quit as
D.C. superintendent in 1998 after 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani eventually agreed to give
Harold Levy, a corporate lawyer with no previous school leadership
experience, a chance to run the 1.1 million student system.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say no one can run a system without resources and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a business putting out widgets,'' said Domenech,
noting that boards must hire enough teachers and fix buildings as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And people must be willing to wait for results, said Michael F.
DiPaola, who trains leaders at the College of William and Mary's
School of Education in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that people are not patient enough to see
it through,'' said DiPaola, a former superintendent. ''When you
change leadership so often, you exacerbate the time it's going to
take.''

<HEADLINE> Abortion clash Difficult for Ridge  </HEADLINE>
By PETER JACKSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Tom Ridge, a one-time altar boy, a
churchgoing Roman Catholic and the staunchly Republican governor of
Pennsylvania, is at odds with both his church and his party on the
emotional issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, mentioned often as a possible vice presidential running
mate for George W. Bush, defends his position as ''where I want to
be.'' But he adds that it can make his public life awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand my party is the pro-life party,'' Ridge said
recently as a state plane whisked him from Harrisburg to events at
new high-tech plants in this western Pennsylvania city. ''One day I
hope that this pro-life party will ... just be a little bit more
tolerant of people with different points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He also supports Pennsylvania's laws regarding the procedure,
which are among the most restrictive in the nation, and that has
kept some abortion-rights groups at arm's length. But it is his
refusal to embrace his church's anti-abortion doctrine that is
causing him the worst headaches, both in his religious and
political life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obviously pretty difficult for me because it puts me at
odds with my faith community,'' said Ridge, 54. But he added, ''I
realize the church hasn't created the problem. I have, because I've
parted company with my church on this.''
</P>
<P>
   By order of the bishop in his home city of Erie, Ridge -- like
other Catholic politicians whose views on abortion conflict with
the church -- is barred from speaking at Catholic events in
northwestern Pennsylvania. He is free to participate in church
functions, however, and regularly attends Sunday Mass with his wife
and two children at Harrisburg's St. Catherine Laboure Church.
</P>
<P>
   Erie Bishop Donald Trautman, who remains a personal friend of
Ridge, said his directive was not aimed at the governor. However,
he said, ''I have to fulfill my role as the shepherd of the
diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to point out that there is a higher law, which
is the law of God, and no human law can contradict the commandment
'Thou shall not kill,''' said Trautman, Erie's bishop for the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although the abortion issue did not seriously impede either of
Ridge's successful campaigns for governor, he was embarrassed when
900 anti-abortion activists protested his appearance at a Catholic
fund-raiser in Altoona in May 1998. Ridge was permitted to speak,
but he soon began turning down invitations to speak at
church-sponsored events.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ridge's current situation with some sympathy is
Democratic former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a fellow Catholic who
has spoken at times about a conflict between church doctrine and
contemporary American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic vice
presidential nominee, had run-ins with the late New York Cardinal
John O'Connor about their views that women have the right to choose
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo says the church demands unreasonably that Catholics who
hold elective offices not only follow Catholic teachings but impose
their religious principles on a society of diverse beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his New York City office, Cuomo
said, ''You can't push the Catholic position in this country. It
just won't sell politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's position also clashes with the Republican Party's
platform and Bush's anti-abortion stance, although Bush has said he
will consider his friend as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge told Fox News that as vice president ''it'd be my
responsibility to back him up even though I think people would know
we disagree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Ridge's presence could drive Catholics and
other social conservatives from the GOP ticket in November. Others
counter he could draw women and moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge was re-elected governor two years ago with 57 percent of
the vote, drawing support from both self-described conservatives
and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of contemporary politics, his abortion stance
is strictly middle-of-the-road.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wants to keep the procedure legal, he supports
Pennsylvania laws that require women seeking to terminate their
pregnancies to receive counseling about the procedure and the
alternatives, and to wait at least 24 hours before having an
abortion. Girls younger than 18 require the consent of at least one
parent unless they go to court and persuade a judge to grant them
an exemption.
</P>
<P>
   National groups on opposite sides of the abortion debate dislike
Ridge's position.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is for legal abortion on demand,'' said David O'Steen of
the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Germond, executive vice president of the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League said Ridge also fails to
qualify for a NARAL endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''A true pro-choice governor, or even a moderate pro-choice
governor'' would do more ''to make the process a little more open
and a little more fair,'' Germond said.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can decide where I should be, but I'm where I want to be,
which probably means I'm not where either one of these groups want
me to be,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Airline Apologizes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- For years air travelers have
complained about lousy service offered by Garuda Indonesia
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state-owned carrier is thanking disgruntled customers
for their comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest gift you presented to us is your expression of
disappointment with Garuda Indonesia's services,'' the airline said
in a full-page advertisement published Monday in The Jakarta Post
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years, passengers have experienced dissatisfaction
with our negligence, and services that have not been satisfactory
... we are not surprised to have received so many complaints,''
said the advertisement, which featured a picture of an overflowing
complaint box.
</P>
<P>
   Garuda Indonesia was admitting past mistakes to convince
customers that it was trying hard to improve service, said
Pudjobroto, vice president for corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have a lot of problems,'' he said. ''But Garuda is
committed to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Pudjobroto, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said the
carrier was renowned for being late and for bumping confirmed
passengers off overbooked flights.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a poor safety record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a Garuda DC-10 skidded off a runway in southern Japan
before bursting into flames, killing three people and injuring 170.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, 234 people were killed when a Garuda Airbus A-300
crashed into jungle while trying to land on Indonesia's Sumatra
island.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisement, Garuda, which celebrated its 50th
anniversary in January, apologized for its shortcomings and
promised to improve ''our professionalism by giving you an
enjoyable, pleasant, and on-time flight.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Threatens San Fernando Homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) -- A wildfire roaring through hilly
brush threatened homes on the edge of the San Fernando Valley on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The flames came within 500 feet of some homes but no injuries or
structural damage were reported, said Sandi Wells, a spokeswoman
for the Ventura County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The 800-acre fire, which started about 2 p.m., was burning
northeast in hilly, rough terrain, feeding on the dry grass. It was
about 85 percent contained Sunday night, and the threat to homes
had eased somewhat, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have danger there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a plume of smoke coming straight at you,'' resident
Gary Ford said. ''And then finally you couldn't see the houses
around you. It engulfed everything with ash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The area has been the scene of several large fires, including a
1970 blaze that charred 107,000 acres, Wells said.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Pressured in US Kosovo Sector  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Just the thought of going to school
makes Maja Ristic, an 11-year-old Kosovo Serb run away in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Serbs, who have managed to stick it out since
NATO-led forces entered the province after a 78-day air war that
was suspended a year ago Saturday, Ristic and her family have had
enough.
</P>
<P>
   It gets ever harder to be a Serb in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb kids in this town, run by the U.S. Army, are escorted to
church-run classes by American soldiers in full battle gear or by
U.N. police whose only task is to make sure they get there safely.
</P>
<P>
   Maja's mother Vesna, 28, often tags along with the escort taking
her children to school -- her only way to safely buy groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are reviled collectively by most of Kosovo's majority
ethnic Albanian population, seen as acting in complicity with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's decade-long apartheid-like
campaign here. Worst still, they are attacked -- eight Serbs have
died in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency says that Serbs are leaving some
communities in the American sector of Kosovo at such an alarming
rate that many cities will have no Serbs living there at all by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is apparently where the Serb community is under the most
pressure,'' said Peter Kessler, spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. Even though the U.S. sector once had
more Serb enclaves than any other sector of Kosovo, Kessler said
that in some communities ''every single house is for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs have been leaving Kosovo even in the years before the war,
uncomfortable with the increasing tension, ratcheted up by
Milosevic's regime. Still, after Milosevic lost control of this
southern province of Yugoslavia, tens of thousands more have gone.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus began at first because of attacks leveled in revenge
for Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians. Now though, even
international officials have joined Serb political leaders in
claiming that ethnic Albanians are conducting a concerted campaign
to erase non-Albanians from the province to better prepare Kosovo
for moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the recent
violence an ''orchestrated campaign'' against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing pressure on the Serbs comes at a sensitive moment
politically -- Monday's one-year anniversary of NATO's arrival.
Serbs have grown impatient with their almost virtual isolation in
Kosovo and complained to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is not helping the Ristic family. They've lived
alongside a curving back alley in central Gnjilane for 50 years, in
three houses embellished with flower pots, a garden patch and
wooden benches for sitting in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   They know their past life is gone now. They are among the last
holdouts in a neighborhood surrounding the Serbian Orthodox Church
that was once almost completely Serb. Everyone else has sold their
homes, picked up and gone.
</P>
<P>
   They'd go too, but they want to sell all three houses and leave
together and no one has that kind of money. Their homes are the
only thing they own.
</P>
<P>
   ''The poor are even a burden to God,'' said Leposava Ristic, the
family's grandmother, who has worked all her life as a cleaning
lady.
</P>
<P>
   She and her family and seven now live a life of controlled house
arrest. Leposava, 70, is afraid to sit in her garden, in case
someone tries to cut her throat. The children won't leave the
family's yard.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army First Lt. Vlad Levichev, who is in charge of this part
of city, knows their problems too well. Even though the 24-year-old
officer from West Roxbury, Mass., has only been here three weeks,
he's learned a lot about the 61 Serb families that live among the
some 600 homes in his patch of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He's even mastered the irony of the present situation -- that
American forces whom the Serbs see as being responsible for the air
war in the first place have now become their greatest defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know that they are only here because of us,'' he said,
about the Ristics' decision to stay. Yet the Ristic family fear
even the Americans in the full battle gear may not be enough to
keep them save.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they've had no troubles with their Albanian
neighbors, they fear outsiders, especially the young thugs they see
wandering the streets. With resignation, they admit that unless
something changes, it's only a matter of time before they go, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just think about it,'' Leposava says. ''There won't be a Serb
soul anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Black Paratroopers Fought Racism  </HEADLINE>
By DON THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- White soldiers literally bet against
them, wagering that the newly trained black paratroopers would
refuse to jump out of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The all-black, all-volunteer 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion
proved them wrong, growing into a fighting force that kept its
uniforms more starched and spit-shined than those of their white
counterparts, for fear of soiling the battalion's hard-won dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, surviving members will gather in Redding to
celebrate the 60th anniversary of the first smokejumpers. It's also
the 55th anniversary of the summer of 1945, when the battalion was
sent on a secret mission to fight a feared Japanese bombing barrage
of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The 555th took as its nickname ''the Triple Nickles,'' choosing
the odd spelling as one more sign its members were unique. Its
symbol was three buffalo-head nickels, signifying the ''buffalo
soldiers'' -- blacks who served in the U.S. Cavalry after the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 555th soon learned that though they were ready to
go into combat overseas, the military wasn't ready to send them
there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting German or Japanese soldiers side by side
with white Americans, the black paratroopers found themselves
battling bears, rattlesnakes and forest fires on U.S. soil. The
racism they experienced in training continued in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Members recall getting kicked out of whites-only post exchange
stores and theaters, rousted by white military police and
restricted to certain off-base stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I am with the uniform on, I'm protecting the country, and
here I am being treated like less than dirt. It makes you feel
bad,'' said Richard Green, a former battalion member.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion overcompensated by barring its paratroopers from
public drinking, cursing, smoking -- even dating certain women --
because ''it would upset the dignity of the Triple Nickles,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military's segregation reflected the split society, said
retired Army Col. William A. DeShields, president and founder of
the Black Military History Institute of America at Fort Meade, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a society that was less than equal, and this carried
over in the military from the Civil War right up to, I would say,
the Vietnam War,'' DeShields said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that blacks were inferior soldiers was formalized in a
1920s study by the Army's War College that concluded blacks were
incapable of training and fighting at the same level as whites,
DeShields said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every war they've been fighting two battles: the enemy
abroad and discrimination at home,'' DeShields said of black
troops.
</P>
<P>
   By World War II, civil-rights leaders were pushing for a
heightened role for blacks with the creation of a series of
experimental units such as the 555th.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, 1st Sgt. Walter Morris was searching for
a way to motivate his dispirited all-black service unit, assigned
to guard the white paratroopers at Fort Bragg, N.C. He started his
men on the same regimen of calisthenics as the paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were servants prior to that. Now they were imitating
paratroopers,'' said Morris, now 79, of Palm Coast, Fla., one of
six surviving original members. ''It showed in their uniforms, in
their attitudes, in how they addressed you.''
</P>
<P>
   The parachute school's commander, in charge of forming a new
20-member black test unit called ''the colored test platoon,'' took
notice and made Morris its first sergeant. That unit grew into the
Triple Nickles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our own separate table where we ate, we had separate
barracks where we slept, we had enlisted men and officers betting --
actually betting -- that we could not stand the rigid four-week
training course and that we would not jump out of airplanes,''
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the initial test platoon proved its mettle, the floodgates
opened to other volunteers. The War Department put the battalion on
a troop train bound for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we were on our way to Camp Pendleton, Oregon, we assumed
we were going to join General MacArthur in the Pacific theater,''
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   That was until the train stopped and Morris ducked into a rural
store to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was this group of loggers sitting around this big
potbellied stove and they said, 'Oh, you're here -- we've been
waiting for you a long time. We read in the paper that you were
coming out here to be smokejumpers,''' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks' training, the battalion was ready.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese had launched the first of an estimated 9,300
balloons carrying loads of incendiary bombs. The balloons rode the
high air currents as far as Michigan, with many landing in Alaska,
Canada and as far south as Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   None of the approximately 90 balloons known to have reached the
continental United States is thought to have caused a forest fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the Triple Nickles were kept busy all summer fighting 36
naturally occurring fires, recording more than 1,200 individual
jumps from its bases at Camp Pendleton and Chico, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For the Triple Nickles, the first step toward acceptance came in
January 1946 as they marched with the 82nd Airborne Division in a
victory parade down New York City's Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't win any wars, but we did contribute,'' Morris said.
''What we proved was that the color of a man had nothing to do with
his ability.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan War Attracting Business  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- On the face of it, Sri Lanka does not
appear a great place for businesses to commit investment money.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical island of 18.6 million people is in the 17th year
of civil war. It is fought mostly in the north by ethnic Tamil
separatists, but suicide bombings, gunbattles and army raids
sometimes spill into the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sri Lanka is attracting investment from companies
looking to expand their reach in the globalizing economy. The
government is dangling tariff and tax exemptions and reduced red
tape to win commitments from the likes of Sun Microsystems of the
United States, Marks and Spencer of Britain and BMW of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The man credited with the achievement is Thilan Wijesinghe, a
former banker and stockbroker who was named chief of the national
Board of Investment in 1995. He has sweeping powers to overrule
city laws, customs rulings and tax department decisions to benefit
foreign ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I took over we were achieving a 58 percent success rate
of all agreements signed. We have taken it up to 70 percent,''
Wijesinghe said in an interview at the World Trade Center, a
39-story building that has been damaged by guerrilla bombs twice in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ten free trade zones have been added to the four that existed
when Wijesinghe took over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within a free trade zone, we are in total charge. That is
where the true concept of the one-stop shop operates,'' said
Wijesinghe, who is empowered to give concessions to companies that
meet the government's strategic economic objectives.
</P>
<P>
   They include waiving or modifying income taxes, customs duties,
currency controls and import control laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The investment board also is encouraging the private sector to
fill the gap in areas where the government has been weak, such as
in education. The board offers incentives for businesses to set up
schools to train Sri Lankans in computer programming and other
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Wijesinghe reports directly to President Chandrika Kumaratunga
and is known for making quick decisions, something unusual in
Asia's bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   Among deals announced recently, the British retailer Marks and
Spencer set plans for investing $100 million by the end of this
year, and Sun Microsystems said it would invest $10 million in a
software development center. Wijesinghe said BMW plans to set up a
car parts factory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains in recent years, government officials still
have to work hard to counteract fears of doing business in a
country where 62,000 people have died in the war since 1983. During
three major bombing attacks in the capital since December, 68
people have been killed, and the president was blinded in her right
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that the war has had a negative impact on investment,
Wijesinghe said Sri Lanka ''would do well'' if it achieves $200
million in new investment this year -- a $31 million drop from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels are battling the Sri Lankan military to establish a
homeland for the country's 3.2 million Tamils in the north and
east, saying they face discrimination in a country where
three-quarters of the people are ethnic Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the increased fighting, Wijesinghe is offering
investors 20-year tax holidays and subsidies for the cost of
building factories.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Wijesinghe's development plan is not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Former Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel said that increased
foreign investment is having little impact on Sri Lanka's main
problems: heavy defense spending and debt payments that deny cash
to other government services, a bloated administrative system and a
poorly targeted program to relieve poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''A fundamental weakness like this (war) cannot be solved by
temporary remedies or patchwork solutions as the government is
doing,'' de Mel said. ''A change in the situation can be brought
about only by an end to the war.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Fighting Rabies Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Authorities have ordered all dogs in
an eastern Indonesia region to be slaughtered to quell a rabies
outbreak that has killed at least 11 people in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another 120 people have been hospitalized, said Wayan Arsana,
the top medical officer in Ngada district on Flores island, about
875 miles east of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated there are about 90,000 dogs in the region and said
Monday that some owners have already complied with the death order.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are beating the dogs over the head or shooting them,''
Arsana said. ''We are killing them any way we can. All are then
being buried immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Arsana said none of the district's medical clinics had rabies
vaccine and supplies weren't expected to arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rabies is a viral disease found in the saliva of infected
animals. It is often transmitted to other animals and humans by
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, rabies attacks the nervous system and can cause
a painful death.
</P>
<P>
   In most parts of Indonesia, dog populations are small because
the predominantly Muslim population considers them unclean and does
not keep them as pets. But the Ngada region is mainly Christian and
most families own several dogs.

<HEADLINE> AMA Struggling To Attract Members  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association is asking
doctors to become salespeople to boost its flagging membership.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains America's largest group of doctors, only about
a third of the nation's 800,000-plus physicians, medical residents
and medical students belong.
</P>
<P>
   Membership, now at 293,695, is down about 2 percent from the end
of last year, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., the AMA's executive
vice president, told delegates attending the first day of the
annual AMA meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Membership woes are ''the thousand-pound gorilla in the living
room,'' said Anderson, who urged doctors to pressure their
colleagues and recruit non-members.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that physicians tend to see themselves as healers
rather than salespeople, but said ''that's not enough anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Membership must be a prime consideration in everything the AMA
does,'' the group's board of trustees said in a report prepared for
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The declining membership has been attributed largely to doctors'
reluctance to pay the relatively high association fee for what they
get in return -- a lobbying voice in Washington. The association
also was seen as losing some of its moral authority after it agreed
in 1997 to endorse Sunbeam products without testing them. Reneging
on the deal in the face of an outcry from members cost the AMA $9.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the AMA lost 2,700 members -- $2.6 million in membership
dues.
</P>
<P>
   While recent recruitment efforts have focused on young doctors,
measures that would give medical students and residents more
representation and power within the AMA prompted more than an hour
of heated debate Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some members complained that giving medical students the same
clout within the AMA as seasoned doctors would be unfair to those
who spent years working their way up the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal presented during a committee debate would give free
AMA membership to graduating medical students during their
postgraduate training. Annual dues are $420, though newer doctors
get discounts and residents pay $45 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Cooper, a California pathologist, criticized the
proposal, telling the committee: ''If you want to play, you need to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining revenue from member dues forced the AMA in March to
cut about 80 jobs, or nearly 7 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   The committee can take the proposals under advisement, recommend
further review, or refer them to the full 550-member House of
Delegates for a vote later this week. The meeting runs through
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Routs Ugandan Forces  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Rwandan troops drove Ugandan forces from
Kisangani Sunday in a fierce seven-hour battle that ended a week of
terrifying, indiscriminate shelling and enabled the United Nations
to deploy between the two armies and prepare for their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet-riddled bodies of at least 40 Ugandan soldiers lay
strewn along the gravel road that leads up to the bridge where
Rwandan troops halted the Ugandan push into the city. The stench of
death was everywhere in this Congo River port city, and there was
no water, electricity, food or medicine. But a handful of unarmed
U.N. observers were in place to monitor the cease-fire and for
Kisangani, the worst appeared to be over.
</P>
<P>
   At the bridge, the observers raised the blue U.N. flag and
declared that any further fighting would be considered an act of
aggression against the international community.
</P>
<P>
   This round of fighting, which began on June 5, was the third in
Kisangani between the two armies, who both support rebels trying to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. The city has become a
strategic logistics base for both armies, and disagreements about
the conduct of the 22-month war have increased, as has personal
animosity between senior army commanders on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted Rwandan soldiers inspected tons of ammunition, guns
and an anti-aircraft battery the Ugandans had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not proud of this. But we were fired at. We won because
our soldiers know what they are fighting for,'' Rwandan commander
Col. Karenzi Karake said. ''We are now leaving Kisangani regardless
of Ugandan intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Ugandan capital, Kampala, a senior government official
confirmed that Ugandan forces had withdrawn to Kapalata training
camp, seven miles north of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We covered ourselves and withdrew because life was becoming
impossible for residents in Kisangani,'' said James Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda's decision to withdraw demonstrated that Uganda had not
been planning an offensive against Rwanda, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle ended early Sunday, when Ugandan army chief of staff
Brig. James Kazini called Karake on a satellite telephone and
requested a cease-fire in order to withdraw, Karake said.
</P>
<P>
   Top army officials from both sides were to meet Monday in
Kampala with a U.N. commander for Congo to work out a speedy
withdrawal of both armies from Kisangani, said Lt. Col. Danilo
Paiva, head of the U.N. observer team.
</P>
<P>
   As an eerie calm settled over the steamy city of 200,000,
trembling residents who live near the site where Rwandan troops
halted the Ugandans ventured out for the first time in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Thambwe, 30, was dumbfounded at the extent of the
destruction. Not a single dwelling, neither houses nor apartment
buildings, escaped damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why? This has no purpose,'' Thambwe said. ''We just want them
out of here. Both Rwandans and Ugandans. Bring over the United
Nations and stop this destruction. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. observers said at least 6,000 shells had rained down on
Kisangani since fighting broke out last Monday. The Red Cross had
put the civilian death toll at 150 with 1,114 injured. It was
obvious the number would rise as people were discovered in the
rubble of their homes and bodies were collected from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Three children died and one was wounded Sunday when they were
playing with unexploded hand grenades, said Alexander Liebeskind of
the Red Cross. As many as 20,000 Congolese have been displaced, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men pushed exhausted relatives in wheelbarrows through
streets littered with bodies, spent cartridges and artillery
shells. Women in one house wailed over their five dead children
killed by a mortar that exploded at the entrance of a school.
Everyone begged for water and food.
</P>
<P>
   Church bells pealed from the twin spires of the 101-year-old
Roman Catholic cathedral, which sustained heavy damage from
shelling. Congolese priests said Mass to a few dozen faithful who
prayed with neither altar nor pews.
</P>
<P>
   People washed and fetched water in the chocolate brown Congo,
while others took to dugout canoes to finally reach homes on the
south bank of the mighty river.

<HEADLINE> Report: Shots Fired at Fiji Leader  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Soldiers opened fire Monday on a car carrying
coup leader George Speight, shooting it full of holes but missing
Speight, who holds 31 people hostage in Fiji's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Joe Nata said it was ''a deliberate effort by
the military to kill George Speight. We are treating it as an
assassination attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   An army spokesman blamed bad judgment by soldiers at a
checkpoint that Speight's car sped through. Lt. Col. Filipo
Tarakinikini insisted the shooting did not represent an escalation
of the conflict, and said the soldiers would be disciplined for
using excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers shot at Speight's car as he was returning from a
meeting in the vice president's house.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am alive and well,'' Speight told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's car, a dark green Hyundai sedan, was peppered with at
least two bullet holes, one in the right rear passenger door and
one in the right rear panel. Both rear passenger windows were
smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Tarakinikini said Speight's car was one of two that sped through
a military roadblock. Soldiers first fired warning shots in the
air, then fired at Speight's car when the vehicles failed to stop.
Tarakinikini said about 20 shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   The other car stopped, and soldiers arrested the rebels inside.
Officials quickly freed them after the rebels phoned and threatened
the hostages could otherwise be harmed, a military statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Nata said Speight was on his way back from drinking tea with a
Methodist church leader. Nata assured the public the rebels would
not retaliate even though Speight's supporters inside parliament
''wanted to go out and kill everything in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight had not previously been attacked since he seized his
hostages May 19, although he has ventured out of the parliamentary
compound several times.
</P>
<P>
   The martial law regime of Commodore Frank Bainimarama, which
took control of Fiji 10 days into the crisis, had previously
pledged it would not try to use force and free the hostages,
including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, in turn, had said he would not harm his hostages if the
military did not attack the compound that has become a camp full of
Speight supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's ventures outside had included trips to the military
barracks for negotiations with Bainimarama that broke down last
week when the military said it would entertain no more demands from
Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims to be acting on behalf of Fiji's indigenous
majority in his fight for a new government system that
discriminates against the ethnic Indian minority by denying them
political power. Chaudhry last year became the first ethnic Indian
to become Fiji's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The military had previously taken steps that met a number of
Speight's demands, including scrapping Fiji's 1997 constitution
that gave Indians greater rights -- and removing the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama also offered amnesty to Speight and his armed gang
in exchange for release of the hostages and surrender of their
weapons, but the crisis has been in a standoff over disagreements
over the form of Fiji's next government.
</P>
<P>
   The military has ruled out any role by Speight or his supporters
in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, police halted a march that had been called to
protest Speight's seizure of the hostages and they arrested its
organizer, the son of one of the hostages, because he had no permit
for the march. Witnesses said only a handful of people had arrived
in the western town of Lautoka to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, a mob of Speight supporters armed with
sugarcane-cutting knives torched a seaside restaurant. There were
no injuries, and the violent crowd did not confront the army,
Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Already this week, rebels have exchanged warning shots with the
army and beaten up a policeman.

Park Service Set 'Prescribed Fires'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Until last month, the National Park Service had been
sharply increasing the number of fires set to clear brush and rehabilitate
landscapes, tripling the area burned in just four years. That changed when a
fire set at Bandelier National Monument got out of control, leading to an
inferno that destroyed more than 200 homes in Los Alamos, N.M., and caused
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
halted all ''prescribed fires'' by the Park Service in the West indefinitely,
saying an investigation found ''serious systemic problems in the way the Park
Service conducts prescribed burns.''

Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of death penalty cases that were appealed from
1973 through 1995 were successful, report researchers who contend the nation's
capital punishment system is ''collapsing under the weight of its own
mistakes.'' A study of 4,578 appeals during those years showed that most cases
''are so seriously flawed that they have to be done over again,'' said Columbia
University law professor James Liebman, the lead author. Earlier this year,
Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed a moratorium on capital
punishment in his state after 13 death row inmates were exonerated.

Web Attracts Younger News Audience

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key segments of the nation's news audience, particularly
younger and better-educated Americans, and those seeking financial information,
are turning increasingly to the Internet, says a new poll on media trends. The
Web's rapid growth as a source for news continues a splintering of that audience
among the Internet, cable and broadcast television, and print publications. A
third of the public now goes online for news at least once a week, compared to a
fifth two years ago, according to a Pew Research poll.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Co. Scores in Prime Time  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If he didn't have to watch his health, you could
almost picture David Letterman leaning back in his chair with a
big, fat cigar.
</P>
<P>
   That's what entertainment moguls look like, right? Quietly this
spring, he's become one, with his production company, Worldwide
Pants, having its most successful stretch since it was formed when
he joined CBS in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the pilots the company pitched were picked up on
prime-time network schedules this fall: ''Welcome to New York,'' a
half-hour situation comedy, will be on CBS, and ''Ed,'' a quirky
drama inspired by ''Northern Exposure,'' will be on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, Worldwide Pants president, predicts impending world
domination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to have every show on every network and cable
outlet be a Worldwide Pants production,'' he said. ''We're on track
-- two shows this year, four the next year, 16 the year after. I
think it's by 2012 when every show will be a Worldwide Pants
production.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the ''Late Show'' joke writer in Burnett coming out, but
it's hard to disguise his pride and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting two-for-two with your pitches in one development season
-- a 1.000 batting average -- is about as unusual in television as it
is in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With one notable exception -- ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' --
Worldwide Pants hasn't seemed much different than the vanity
projects that production companies for big stars often amount to.
The company produces ''Late Show'' and Craig Kilborn's ''Late, Late
Show,'' but two other prime-time productions, ''The Bonnie Hunt
Show'' and ''The High Life,'' vanished as quickly as they appeared
in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to New York'' is about the experiences of an Indiana
weatherman who comes to the big city. Although many people assume
it's based on the life of Letterman, a former Indiana weatherman,
the idea actually comes from Midwestern comedian Jim Gaffigan. When
actress Christine Baranski signed on, CBS did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed,'' written by Burnett and Jon Beckerman, has a more
complicated history. The story of a New York attorney who loses his
job, dumps his wife and moves back to his Midwestern hometown was
pitched to CBS four years ago. It was then called ''Stuckeyville.''
</P>
<P>
   The network wanted a more traditional half-hour comedy, which
Burnett resisted. The idea withered for awhile as Beckerman and
Burnett paid more attention to the ''Late Show,'' but it was
revived in an hour-long format in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   CBS turned it down again, but gave Burnett permission to shop
the pilot around to other networks. NBC quickly agreed to air it.
</P>
<P>
   It sets up a potentially awkward situation: Some of the leading
minds behind CBS' late-night franchise working for another network.
Even stranger, NBC is the network that six years ago handed
Letterman the biggest rejection of his life when it picked Jay Leno
as the ''Tonight'' show host instead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed'' would never have made it on NBC if the executives who
picked Leno were still in charge, Burnett said. Instead, there's a
new management team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a terrific relationship because it feels very clean for
us,'' Burnett said. ''We have nothing to offer them except our show
and they have nothing to offer us except a spot on their schedule.
It's a very nice and pure relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's cancelled after three weeks, my attitude will change
completely,'' he said. ''But right now, we all love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett won't second-guess CBS President Leslie Moonves for
passing on ''Ed.'' It probably fits NBC's schedule better, since
the network has a younger audience and has more need for a
''lighter'' drama to balance its more intense hours, he said. CBS
has more of a mix.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the show were to go on and become an enormous hit for
NBC, it doesn't necessarily mean it would have been a hit for
CBS,'' he said. ''It can be a situation where he's made the right
decision and NBC made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves, asked about NBC's pickup of ''Ed'' at a news
conference, said, ''We will miss Rob, but we hope 'Ed' fails.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Les has been very kind about it,'' Burnett said. ''We're all
just human beings trying to make a living. I took that as a joke. I
thought it was pretty funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said he hadn't detected any concern from CBS that
Worldwide Pants' success might mean less attention paid to the
''Late Show.'' He is stepping aside as that program's executive
producer, replaced by two longtime staff members, Maria Pope and
Barbara Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman may not be as hands-on at Worldwide Pants as Burnett,
but he did take the ''Ed'' pilot script home one weekend to do some
rewriting. His role is more metaphysical: As with ''Late Show,''
most of the staff members at Worldwide Pants are intent upon doing
work that they hope Letterman will find funny. His sensibility
dominates, even if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett couldn't answer when asked how many people work at
Worldwide Pants. One thing he knows for sure is that there soon
will be more, although not too many.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will always be a boutique,'' he said. ''We have had
opportunities to really expand and get big development funds and
floors of executives, but we've never had an interest in that. The
way that we attract talent to Worldwide Pants is that we focus on
the projects that we have really singularly.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court OKs Texas Ballot Law  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas law that lets voters in federal
elections cast their ballots prior to the November election day
without having to state a reason survived a Supreme Court challenge
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected an appeal that said Texas' early-voting
law nullifies the notion, reflected in federal law, that all
federal elections in any given year should be held on one day
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an absentee-voting law that provides early voting
by mail for people who expect to be away from home on election day
or who are unable to make it to a public polling place, the Texas
early-voting law lets any registered voter cast a ballot up to 17
days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal by five Texas voters and the Voting Integrity Project
public interest group urged the nation's highest court to use their
challenge to decide ''whether Congress has ultimate control over
the timing of federal elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said 15 other states have election laws that
similarly allow unrestricted early voting. They are Alaska,
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington
and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the appeal said, two states -- Florida and Vermont --
do not require absentee voters to explain why they cannot vote on
the federal election day, the Tuesday after the first Monday in
November.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found
no problem with the Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the election of federal officials in Texas is not
decided until Texas voters go to the polls on federal election day,
we conclude that the Texas early-voting scheme is not inconsistent
with federal election laws,'' the appeals court ruled last January.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that no election results are released until the votes
are tabulated on election day, and concluded that ''the election of
federal representatives in Texas is not decided or consummated
before federal election day.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for the Texas law's
challengers said the appeals court ruling means federal laws ''no
longer mandate a single uniform date for holding federal elections.
Instead, they establish a mere deadline for completing federal
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is The Voting Integrity Project vs. Bomer, 99-1685.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Alaska Waters Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to referee a
dispute over ownership and control of marine waters and submerged
lands across Southeast Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Alaska or the federal government has title
to areas within the Tongass National Forest and the Glacier Bay
National Park and Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also is asking the court to decide who holds the title to
submerged lands along the Alexander Archipelago, a group of over
1,000 islands over an area nearly 600 miles long and 100 miles wide
with more than 13,000 miles of shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Holding title would give the state the right to regulate
activities in the water above those submerged lands, notably
commercial fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are allowing Alaska to ''sue'' the federal
government in the Supreme Court without first having the dispute
heard in some lower court. The Constitution gives the court such
''original jurisdiction'' in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   The submerged lands issue took on new prominence after the
National Park Service decided to phase out commercial fishing in
the waters of Glacier Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to resolve, once and for all, the issue of where
federal jurisdiction ends and state jurisdiction begins in
Southeast Alaska,'' Gov. Tony Knowles said when the state sought
Supreme Court help in November. ''The Park Service's phaseout of
commercial fishing in Glacier Bay is just one of many actions taken
over the years that restrict access and activities on state
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, the state's lawyers said, ''The
marine waters of Southeast Alaska are vitally important to the 33
coastal communities and numerous tiny settlements there ... The
sounds, straits, canals, channels and narrows of Southeast Alaska --
known collectively as the Inside Passage -- form its roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration lawyers, who disagree with the state's
claims, told the justices they did not oppose having them resolve
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases can take years to resolve. The justices typically
appoint a ''special master'' to conduct hearings and make
recommendations. Monday's brief order gave Justice Department
lawyers 60 days to file a formal response to Alaska's complaint, a
preliminary step to either appointing a special master or
conducting oral arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Alaska vs. U.S., 128 Original.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Man Fired Over HIV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese court on Monday ordered a company and a
hospital to pay damages to a man fired from his job after he was
found to be HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiba District Court, near Tokyo, awarded $61,600 in damages
to the 35-year-old man, a Brazilian of Japanese descent, a court
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose name was withheld by the court, was dismissed in
December, 1997 by Takigawa Chemical Industries Ltd., a
plastics-processing firm near Tokyo, after a hospital conducted an
HIV test without his permission.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge Yukio Nishijima ruled that the dismissal was
invalid, said the court official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hospital violated the plaintiff's privacy by conducting
the HIV test without his consent and conveying the results to the
company,'' Nishijima said in Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A Takigawa Chemical Industries official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, refused to comment, saying that court papers were
still unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Japanese court ordered a medical
institution to pay damages for violating the privacy of an
HIV-positive individual, said Marii Goto, director of the Japan HIV
Center, a private support group.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today after a
pair of technology companies released vastly different profit
forecasts, leading investors to question the outlook for corporate
earnings in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 16.26 at 10,630.32.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 5.77 at 1,462.72, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 8.87 at 3,865.97.
</P>
<P>
   Corning rose $16 to $228. The company said it anticipates
earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80 cents a share,
well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share. Corning expects
profits to come in about 50 percent above last year's
second-quarter totals.
</P>
<P>
   But Corning's rosy forecast was tempered by a warning from
Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of computer network products that said
its earnings will miss estimates in the coming quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Citrix said expansion of its core business in large enterprise
accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged
$16.75 to $24.438.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are
just beginning the ''preannouncement'' period, in which companies
give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive
surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong
one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts expect investors
to harshly punish any company that appears to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 96.4 million shares,
well behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.26 to 521.80.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.6 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Appeal Rejected by Court  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John DuPont, the heir to a family chemical
fortune convicted in 1997 as a mentally ill murderer, lost a
Supreme Court appeal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, rejected a challenge to a
Pennsylvania law that allowed a jury in Media, Pa., to find DuPont
guilty of third-degree murder but mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont is serving a prison sentence of 13 to 30 years for the
1996 shooting death of Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler David
Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   He had pleaded insanity. State prosecutors had sought a
first-degree murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont's lawyer, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, said the
Pennsylvania law ''gives rise to an unacceptably high risk'' that
someone legally insane, and therefore not subject to punishment,
will be found to be mentally ill but guilty.
</P>
<P>
   That risk violated DuPont's constitutionally protected rights of
due process and equal protection and subjected him to cruel and
unusual punishment, the appeal said. It also raised other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania prosecutors waived their right to respond to the
appeal, and the nation's highest court did not request a response
brief from the state before taking Monday's action.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen other states have enacted laws that allow juries to find
mentally disturbed defendants guilty but mentally ill. Those laws
add a fourth option to the traditional alternative verdicts of
guilty, not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity in cases in
which defendants plead insanity.
</P>
<P>
   The other states are Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina,
South Dakota and Utah, according to DuPont's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Pennsylvania's 1982 law is unique, the appeal contended,
because the legal standard for finding someone legally insane is
the same as the one for finding him guilty but mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''A jury permitted to choose between the two alternatives is
deciding a defendant's fate by the flip of a coin,'' the appeal
said, adding that juries end up being encouraged to choose between
defendants who are ''sick rather than bad'' and those who are
''both bad and sick.''
</P>
<P>
   '''Bad' is a moral or ethical judgment, not a legal standard,
and it is irrelevant to assessing a defendant's mental state,'' the
appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court rejected that argument last year, and the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear DuPont's ensuing appeal
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The case is DuPont vs. Pennsylvania, 99-1809.

<HEADLINE> WHO Issues Antibiotic Alert  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Health Organization warned Monday
that increasingly drug-resistant infections in rich and developing
nations alike are threatening to make once-treatable diseases
incurable.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been urging action for years to fight the
growing problem of infections becoming impervious to treatment. The
WHO's new report adds to the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're losing windows of opportunity,'' said WHO infectious
diseases chief Dr. David Heymann. ''It's something we have to
really address immediately or we're going to start losing our
antibiotics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a major problem for us, and it isn't going to go
away,'' added Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, director of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, who helped WHO unveil the report.
''We use the same antibiotics as other countries do,'' so
resistance in one country is bad news for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria, parasites and viruses all naturally evolve to fight
treatment. It's classic survival of the fittest: Bugs exposed to
drugs that don't kill them become stronger, able to withstand
subsequent treatment attempts, and pass on that drug resistance to
their next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Misuse of medications, particularly antibiotics, speeds this
process.
</P>
<P>
   In developed countries, people often overuse antibiotics,
demanding them for viruses like colds. The body always harbors
germs, so each unneeded antibiotic dose is an opportunity for them
to evolve. U.S. and Canadian doctors are estimated to overprescribe
antibiotics by 50 percent, the WHO report said.
</P>
<P>
   Impoverished developing countries have the opposite problem.
Many patients can't afford the full course needed to cure an
infection. Antibiotics may be sold at market stalls where people
buy a few doses without a doctor's exam. In Vietnam in 1997,
researchers found more than 70 percent of patients were prescribed
inadequate doses to cure serious infections.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's misinformation: In the Philippines, people
mistakenly use low doses of an anti-tuberculosis drug as a ''lung
vitamin,'' WHO said.
</P>
<P>
   Animals add to the problem. Half the world's antibiotics are
used on the farm, sometimes to treat illness but mostly to help
healthy animals grow bigger. That encourages drug-resistant germs
that cause food poisoning, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
   What effect does all this have? Among the report's sobering
examples:
</P>
<P>
   --Gonorrhea was once easily curable with penicillin and
tetracycline. ''Today, you can't touch it anywhere in the world
with those drugs,'' Heymann said. Poor nations can't afford more
expensive alternatives and, to make matters worse, untreated
gonorrhea is fueling spread of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   --In Estonia, Latvia, and parts of Russia and China, more than 10
percent of tuberculosis patients have strains resistant to two
powerful medicines. Overall, up to 2 percent of the world's 16
million TB sufferers have multi-drug resistant strains,
particularly frightening because TB is airborne, spread when people
cough.
</P>
<P>
   --Malaria, the mosquito-spread infection that kills a million
people a year, is resistant to the top medication 80 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   --Some 5,000 Americans may have suffered longer-lasting food
poisoning in 1998 from drug-resistant germs in chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody counts deaths from drug-resistant infections. The CDC
says 88,000 Americans a year die of infections they catch in the
hospital, and many are resistant to at least one antibiotic,
complicating treatment attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Wiser use of antimicrobial drugs is the solution, the WHO said.
It recommended increased funding to help poor countries afford
enough antibiotics, and education for poor and rich nations alike
to avoid misuse.
</P>
<P>
   WHO also recommended that human antibiotics not be used as
growth promoters for animals. Europe already has banned several
such drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has debated
stricter rules here for several years, but is under industry
pressure not to tighten animal drug restrictions.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed Monday after a pair of
technology companies released vastly different profit forecasts,
leading investors to question the outlook for corporate earnings in
the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 62.02 at 3,812.82.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 13.43 at 10,627.49, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.09 at 1,454.86.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 240.14 million
shares, well behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq tumbled after Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of
computer network products, said its earnings will miss estimates in
the coming quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Citrix said expansion of its core business in large enterprise
accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged
44 percent, or by $18.125, to $23.063.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning,
which rose $14 to $226 after the company said it anticipates
earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80 cents a share,
well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last
year's second-quarter totals.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are
just beginning the ''preannouncement'' period, in which companies
give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive
surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong
one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts expect investors
to harshly punish any company that appears to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at
least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating,''
said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in
New York. ''The market is still quite fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it
more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products.
Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because
it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising
rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June
28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and
housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's
earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.21 to 516.83.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Against Bank Robber  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People charged under a federal bank robbery
law are not entitled to have the jury consider whether they
committed the lesser crime of bank larceny, the Supreme Court said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling 5-4 in a New Jersey case, the justices said the federal
larceny law contains several elements that are not part of the
robbery law, and therefore larceny cannot be considered a ''lesser
included offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd J. Carter had argued that the jury should have a choice of
convicting him of larceny, which does not involve the use of force,
violence or intimidation as robbery does.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court that
larceny cannot be considered a lesser offense of bank robbery.
Thomas said the larceny law requires proof of three elements not
included in robbery: intent to steal, property worth more than
$1,000, and proof that the defendant ''takes and carries away'' the
property.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery law requires no proof of the defendant's intent, the
value of the property or that it is carried away, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices upheld a federal appeals court decision that
affirmed the bank robbery conviction of Carter, who was charged
after he walked into the Collective Savings Bank in Hamilton, N.J.,
in September 1997, unarmed and wearing a ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he jumped over the counter to an unoccupied teller
station and emptied several drawers of cash, getting away with
about $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   As he went out the door, he told employees, ''Don't bother
following me, I run fast.'' He was arrested later that day.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Carter of bank robbery after the trial judge
refused to let jurors consider the lesser offense of bank larceny.
He was sentenced to 17 years and 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction and
sentence, disagreeing with other federal appeals courts that had
allowed jurors to consider larceny as a lesser offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said the 3rd Circuit court was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Ginsburg said the majority had made a
''woodenly literal'' interpretation of the law. Traditionally, she
said, ''robbery meant larceny plus force, violence or putting in
fear'' and larceny was considered a lesser offense of robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress, I conclude, did not depart from that traditional
understanding'' in making robbery and larceny federal crimes,
Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Carter vs. U.S., 99-5716.

<HEADLINE> Worker Benefit Plans Can Sue Brokers  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employee benefit plans can sue brokers and
others who provide services for their roles in money-losing deals
on grounds that certain transactions are barred by a federal
pension-protecting law, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision means Ameritech Corp. and its pension
plan trustee, Harris Trust and Savings Bank, can continue trying to
recover some $20 million lost in a deal with Salomon Brothers Smith
Barney Inc., a stock brokerage that is now part of Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were provisions in the federal Employee Retirement
Income and Security Act (ERISA) that bar anyone with a legal duty
to an employee benefit plan -- what lawyers call a fiduciary -- from
engaging in certain transactions with a ''party in interest,'' or
someone the fiduciary might favor at the expense of the plan's
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court that the provisions
allow such parties in interest to be sued by the plan even though
they are not fiduciaries of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Salomon sold $21 million worth of interests
in a financial deal involving two motel chains to Ameritech's
pension plan. The plan lost nearly all of its investment in the
deal after the motel chains failed.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech and the bank that administers its pension plan sued.
Among other things, the lawsuit invoked ERISA and alleged that the
sale had been unfair and a ''prohibited transaction'' under that
law.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon contended it could not be sued under ERISA because it,
unlike Harris Trust and Savings Bank, owed no fiduciary duty to the
pension plan. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with
Salomon and dismissed the case. That left the pension plan with
only one option -- sue its trustee for engaging in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But six other federal appeals courts had allowed such lawsuits
even in the absence of a fiduciary duty.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision sided with those interpretations of ERISA and
reinstated Ameritech's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Harris Trust and Savings Bank vs. Salomon Smith
Barney, 99-579.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 84, Dow Drops 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower Monday after a pair
of technology companies released vastly different profit forecasts,
leading investors to question the outlook for corporate earnings in
the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 83.92 at 3,790.92.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.51 at 10,593.55,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 5.57 at 1,451.38. Both
indexes had given up early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues had overtaken advancers by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange by midday, where volume came to 338.85
million shares, well behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq led the market lower after Citrix Systems Inc., a
maker of computer network products, said its earnings will miss
estimates in the coming quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Citrix said expansion of its core business in large enterprise
accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged
42 percent, or by $17.50, to $23.688. Edward M. Kerschner, chief
investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his
firm's ''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning,
which rose $13.625 to $225.625 after the company said it
anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80
cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last
year's second-quarter totals.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are
just beginning the ''preannouncement'' period, in which companies
give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive
surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong
one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts expect investors
to harshly punish any company that appears to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at
least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating,''
said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in
New York. ''The market is still quite fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it
more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products.
Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because
it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising
rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June
28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and
housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's
earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.91 to 513.15.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Death Penalty Appeals  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sharply divided Supreme Court made it harder
for some convicted killers to challenge their death sentences in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote Monday, the justices upheld Virginia killer Bobby
Lee Ramdass' death sentence even though he was barred from telling
jurors he would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The court's four dissenters said the decision condones ''an
acute unfairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling clarified the court's 1994 decision that said
defendants have the right to tell jurors about their ineligibility
for parole whenever prosecutors urge jurors to impose a death
sentence based on ''future dangerousness.''
</P>
<P>
   During a weeklong crime spree in 1992, Ramdass robbed two pizza
restaurants and a convenience store in Fairfax County, Va. During
one episode, he killed convenience store clerk Mohammed Kayani.
</P>
<P>
   In separate trials, juries found him guilty of all three crimes.
He was sentenced to death for the murder after a state court jury
found he was ''a continuing threat to society.''
</P>
<P>
   After all appeals were rejected in state courts, Ramdass sought
help in federal court. He argued that he wrongly was barred from
telling jurors about his ineligibility for parole under Virginia's
three-strikes law.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Supreme Court had ruled that the three-strikes law
did not apply to Ramdass when he was sentenced for the murder
because he had not yet been sentenced for one of the three separate
crimes for which he had been convicted. In other words, he
technically had only two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge ruled that Ramdass was entitled to a new
sentencing trial, but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw
out that decision. The appeals court said federal courts are bound
by state courts' characterization of the relevant state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Supreme Court said the 4th Circuit court was right.
</P>
<P>
   In the court's main opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said
federal courts could not help Ramdass because ''the Virginia
Supreme Court's decision to deny (him) relief was neither contrary
to, nor an unreasonable application, of'' the Supreme Court's 1994
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote separately but joined in the
result.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an acute unfairness in permitting a state to rely on
a recent conviction to establish a defendant's future dangerousness
while simultaneously permitting the state to deny that there was
such a conviction when the defendant attempts to argue that he is
parole ineligible and therefore not a future danger,'' Stevens
wrote for the four.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the most miserly reading of the opinions in (the 1994
decision) supports the conclusion that (Ramdass) was denied one of
the hallmarks of due process,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who in announcing the decision from the bench went into
considerable detail about the cold-blooded manner in which Ramdass
committed his murder, said the lack of a final judgment in a
previous conviction was more than a formality.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Ramdass vs. Angelone, 99-7000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The Class of 2000 at Gray-New Gloucester
High School was looking for a big-name commencement speaker.
</P>
<P>
   So it sent invitations to former presidents, Hollywood stars
such as Sandra Bullock and Nicolas Cage and scores of other
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes'' commentator Andy Rooney was the only one to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   He did so, he told the 115 graduates Sunday, because he likes
young people and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Maine is the least appreciated of the 50 states,''
Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney emphasized the importance of lifelong learning,
regardless of whether one goes on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the good things about learning is how much fun it can
be,'' he said. ''And the trick to enjoying school is to realize
that what you learn is going to be with you for the rest of your
life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Asthma kept ''Red Dawn'' director John Milius
out of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's signed up to develop virtual reality and simulation
technology for use in training troops.
</P>
<P>
   Milius is the first prominent member of the Hollywood community
to join forces with the fledgling Institute for Creative
Technologies, a research and development program at the University
of Southern California funded by a $45 million Army grant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always wanted a military career but due to the fact that I
had asthma, I was never able to serve,'' Milius said. ''When the
project started, I asked the Army to draft me. They did and it's an
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is designed to help troops make wise decisions in
combat situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through his enormous body of work, John has shown a deep
understanding of the human condition and the ways that conflict can
be resolved,'' the institute's Richard Lindheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Milius and Francis Ford Coppola received an Academy Award
nomination for adapted screenplay for ''Apocalypse Now.'' His other
writing credits include ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean,''
''Dirty Harry,'' ''Magnum Force'' and ''Geronimo: An American
Legend.''

<HEADLINE> Norman Rockwell House Up for Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The home where artist Norman Rockwell
spent the last 25 years of his life is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the 14-room home, built in 1783, to become the
Rockwell Bed &AMP; Breakfast or the Rockwell Antiques Shop. A
restriction in the deed prevents the use of the Rockwell name for
any commercial purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell lived in the house from 1953 until his death in 1978 at
the age of 84. His wife, Molly, lived in the house until her death
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The current owners, Richard Herrick and his wife, Elizabeth
Holtzinger, are asking $775,000 for the two-story Victorian home.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzinger purchased the home for $390,000 in 1986 following the
death of Rockwell's widow. Herrick said the couple wanted a smaller
home now that their children are grown.

<HEADLINE> Can 'Survivor' Keep Winner Secret?  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With CBS' ''Survivor'' a giant hit after two
weeks on the air, suspense is already mounting: How will things
play out by summer's end for this game-show twist on ''Gilligan's
Island''?
</P>
<P>
   But the real mystery isn't which one of the show's 16 castaways
outlasted the others to claim $1 million. That question was settled
forever (and captured on videotape) on April 20, the show's 39th
and final day on remote Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   The still-unanswered question is: Can ''Survivor'' keep its
secrets in this tell-all world?
</P>
<P>
   CBS wants us to learn what happened on Pulau Tiga step by step,
surprise by surprise, in a strictly administered regimen of 11 more
episodes airing Wednesday nights. This information-rationing surely
makes the show more fun and the ratings more robust.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CBS is bucking a trend. We live in a
news-when-you-want-it culture. We have a sense of entitlement that
if something -- anything -- has happened anywhere, we ought to be
told. Instantly.
</P>
<P>
   In the information age, are secrets possible?
</P>
<P>
   ''George Clooney's surprise appearance on 'ER' was a tremendous
source of inspiration for us,'' says CBS spokesman Chris Ender,
referring to the former ''ER'' star's return for a scene not even
NBC execs knew about until the series' May 11 episode hit the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ender says all 16 castaways signed confidentiality agreements
that bar them from discussing the outcome, at the penalty of
forfeiting their various cash prizes, including the survivor's
million bucks. They could also face punitive damages. All of their
interviews with the press are chaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the unintentional tip-off? When a ''Survivor''
washout returned home less than 39 days after the contest's March
13 launch, wasn't that a clue to a co-worker or a next-door
neighbor that this person could be crossed off the list of possible
winners?
</P>
<P>
   No, says Ender. As each contender was voted off the island, he
or she was invited to stay on at a Malaysian resort. All but three
(Ender isn't saying which three) accepted the offer. This means
nearly everyone returned home at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   What about the staffers of CBS' ''Early Show,'' which has dibs
each Thursday on the castaway seen banished the night before?
''Early Show'' executive producer Steve Friedman says he learns
with the rest of the nation on Wednesday nights which member of the
''Survivor'' party will be his show's guest -- and by then that
person is already in New York, accompanied by someone who works for
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   What if one of those bounced from ''Survivor'' is miffed and
decides to blab, contract or no?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, insists Chris Ender. The castaways ''are all
tremendously proud of what they've accomplished. In conversations
we've had with all 16, I can tell you that it's more than a matter
of the confidentiality agreement. They've banded together to
maintain the secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The media, he adds, ''has for the most part been aggressive in
its coverage, but tremendously respectful of what we're trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, how can CBS guard against the emergence of an ''Outsmart
'Survivor''' Web site, whose contributors might somehow put all the
pieces together? Or the mischief of a computer geek with too much
spare time?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, only the survival of the secret is in doubt.

<HEADLINE> Top Marine To Fly Aboard Osprey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first MV-22 Osprey aircraft to carry
passengers since one crashed in April, killing 19 Marines, will
have one seat reserved for a special guest: Gen. James L. Jones,
commandant of the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   After the Osprey crashed April 8 while trying to land at an
airfield near Tucson, Ariz., Jones said he intended to be on board
when the first Osprey returned to flight as a gesture of confidence
in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will make that flight Saturday at the Naval Air Weapons
Station in China Lake, Calif., his office announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, the Ospreys resumed ''operational evaluation''
flights to determine their readiness to join the Marine Corps'
active air fleet, but they have not been carrying passengers.
Evaluation flights began last November but were halted while the
crash was investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines announced last month that mechanical failure was
ruled out as a cause of the crash, although the investigation is
continuing. It was the deadliest air disaster for the Marines since
22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Lott Won't Rush Vote on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Monday
that he won't speed a vote on the China trade bill, despite pleas
by corporate America and the Clinton administration for quick
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we rush to it we could take something that probably is
going to pass overwhelmingly and get it tangled up in a way that
would be counterproductive,'' the Mississippi Republican told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As do most Republicans, Lott backs the legislation to grant
China permanent normal trading benefits to accompany its expected
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said it needs a full airing -- with members given the
chance to offer amendments if they so desire.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Lott indicated the Senate must give higher priority
to spending bills needed to keep the government in operation in the
new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   China-trade bill supporters have sought to parlay the
unexpectedly strong 40-vote margin of support in the House last
month into fast Senate approval -- even if it means accepting the
House version and not seeking to amend it further.
</P>
<P>
   The House added amendments to set up a commission to monitor
human rights in China and a process to protect U.S. industries from
surges in low-price Chinese imports.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors hope to get the measure passed before the Fourth of
July, fearful that the longer the delay, the more the measure will
get snarled in election politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both major-party presidential candidates support the bill. But
it is being strongly opposed by organized labor, a key Democratic
constituency, and that could weigh in congressional races in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he believes the measure will ultimately pass the
Senate and that things need to run their normal course.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments have been proposed from both ends of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said he wants to pursue
legislation he is sponsoring with Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
to set up a process for monitoring China's role in the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he either wants a separate vote or he'll push it
as an amendment to the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a very strong proposal that's going to have to be
considered,'' Lott said Monday. ''And I'm going to work with him
and others to decide how that will be carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told
reporters that, while he supports the right of senators ''to
express themselves and to offer amendments,'' he planned to oppose
all of them in hopes of speeding the bill along.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said there was ''broad based support'' for the bill in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the clearer we can send the message that we want to get on
with our new trading relationship with China, we ought to do that.
I'd prefer to do that before the Fourth of July. There's no reason
why we should wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the bill 237 to 197 on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   On a related subject, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters that the United States has ''real concerns'' about
Israel's proposed sale of radar technology to China. But, she
added, ''we will oppose any effort on Capitol Hill'' to try to link
the sale to U.S. assistance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative House Republicans have suggested such a
linkage.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is building a plane for China and equipping it with the
U.S.-developed PHALCON airborne early warning radar system at a
cost of $250 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 75, Dow Dips 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower Monday after a pair
of technology companies released vastly different profit forecasts,
leading investors to question the outlook for corporate earnings in
the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 75.21 at 3,799.63.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.60 at 10,606.46, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.70 at 1,453.25. Both
indexes had given up early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues led advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 488.74 million shares,
well behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The light volume convinced analysts that investors are treading
cautiously in advance of several government reports on the economy,
due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an orderly market, but not a market with a great deal of
conviction,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq led the broad market lower after Citrix Systems Inc.,
a maker of computer network products, said its earnings will miss
estimates in the coming quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Citrix said expansion of its core business in large enterprise
accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged
47 percent, or by $19.188, to $22. Edward M. Kerschner, chief
investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his
firm's ''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning,
which rose $21.625 to $233.625 after the company said it
anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80
cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last
year's second-quarter totals.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are
just beginning the ''preannouncement'' period, in which companies
give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive
surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong
one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts expect investors
to harshly punish any company that appears to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at
least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating,''
Ackerman said. ''The market is still quite fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it
more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products.
Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because
it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising
rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June
28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and
housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's
earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were paying a price for an anticipated economic
slowdown. Home Depot shares fell $2.125 to $47.875 and Wal-Mart
fell $1.625 to $52.375, depressing the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 11.52 to
511.54.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Leader Touts Economy Plan  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Argentina's president defended his economic plan
of higher taxes and spending cuts Monday, saying that despite
recent public protests, the measures are helping to revitalize his
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua used his stop in New York on his
first official visit to the United States to urge a group of about
300 financial and business leaders to steer investments toward
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a breakfast held by the Americas Society, the
Argentine leader acknowledged the unpopularity of lowering the
budget deficit by raising taxes and cutting state workers'
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It always carries a political cost, but one must have the
courage to assume the political costs if one wants to take a
country forward,'' he said. ''If I didn't take the necessary
measures, it would again provoke in the country the crisis we have
to get away from. And we are getting away from the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   With Argentina's unemployment rate at 14 percent, however, many
of the country's people are losing patience. Hundreds of thousands
of workers across Argentina staged a national strike Friday to
protest De la Rua's economic policies, closing many businesses and
halting buses and trains.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua told his listeners in a hotel conference room that he
hoped they would not take the images of the strike as representing
the situation in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have shown some images of some people in the street, of
burned tires. That wasn't the situation in the country. It could
have been that way in two or three places,'' he said. ''But in
general, the unions called a strike that occurred in a peaceful
fashion, and after the strike, what remains open is the path of
dialogue and prudent discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, who took office in December, drew applause when he
reaffirmed his staunch support for keeping the value of the
country's currency, the peso, pegged to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   He showed the audience an economic report, lifting the pages
into the air to display graphs showing improvement -- in industrial
production, supermarket sales and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''With these facts, I only want to tell you that things are
getting better,'' De la Rua said. ''I'm convinced that my country
has what it takes to successfully face the challenges of this new
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, De la Rua said in an interview with The Associated
Press that his economic advisers had scaled back the country's
growth target for the year from 4 percent to 3.5 percent, or
perhaps less.
</P>
<P>
   But during his speech Monday, he emphasized that Argentina's
exports have grown, together with the neighboring economies of
Chile, Uruguay and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of government cutbacks last month, De la Rua
ordered cuts in state salaries to trim a $7.1 billion deficit by
$2.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting measures help Argentina maintain access to
loans from the International Monetary Fund if needed. But De la Rua
said the IMF is not the force behind his economic program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say that our program is demanded by the fund. That's not
so. We are complying with the national law of fiscal
responsibility, and I'm convinced that we're going to reach our
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   He said creating new jobs is a priority. And he urged the
financiers to invest in Argentine tourism, mining and
telecommunications, saying his country's economy offers ''immense
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, De la Rua is to visit Washington, where he plans to
meet President Clinton and publicly seek forgiveness for his
country's role in providing sanctuary to Nazis after World War II.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Children March for Elian  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Waving Cuban flags and their Communist Pioneer
neckerchiefs, tens of thousands of school students answered
President Fidel Castro's call to march Monday for the repatriation
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down with the Cuban Adjustment Act!'' the boys and girls in
their school uniforms chanted as they marched, skipped and hopped
down the Malecon coastal highway, referring to a U.S. law that
allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay. ''Free Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   A sea of children flowed down the 3{-mile stretch where men and
women have thronged in recent months calling for the return of
Elian to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was more than we had expected,'' said Castro, who
attended the event outside the U.S. Interests Section, the American
mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by their teachers and nurses dressed in white, the
boys and girls waved their red or blue neckerchiefs, part of the
traditional school uniform. Some smaller children giggled and waved
at television cameras broadcasting the event live across the
island.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 students in the 4th to 6th grades circled the
mission, following Castro's orders, to prevent younger children
from throwing anything at the building.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and other senior officials, including Ricardo Alarcon,
president of Cuba's National Assembly, sat in the first row facing
a permanent stage erected recently outside the mission. They
listened to a series of brief and virulent speeches by small
children blasting American ''imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Long live Fidel!'' the children cried repeatedly. ''Socialism
or death!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I studied with Elian,'' said Yailen Fuentes, 7, a girl from
Elian's hometown of Cardenas, 90 miles east of Havana. ''We came
here for him -- everyone for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off Florida in November after his mother and
10 others perished in a sea journey to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was reunited with his father, Juan Miguel, on April 22 after
the boy was seized during an armed federal raid at the home of the
Miami relatives. Father and son are staying in Washington, along
with other relatives from Cuba and several of Elian's Cuban
classmates, pending an appeal by the boy's Miami relatives to keep
him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a federal appellate court in Atlanta sided with
Elian's father, who says only he has the right to speak for his
son. The boy's Miami relatives had been seeking a political asylum
hearing for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said he wants to return with his son to Cuba. But
under a timetable outlined by Attorney General Janet Reno, Elian
cannot leave the United States until June 21, to give his Miami
relatives a chance to appeal the latest ruling.

<HEADLINE> Israel Political Battle Turns Nasty  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A religious Israeli government minister
compares a critical Cabinet colleague to the Nazis, and a Jewish
settler suggests parallels between Adolf Hitler's regime and Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of epithets this week invoking the Holocaust was met by
widespread condemnation in a country built on the ashes of the Nazi
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also laid bare the deep animosities -- between
religious and secular, hawks and doves -- that Barak will have to
bridge to put together a new coalition stable enough to ratify a
future Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply divided on basic values, and the culture war
that has been going on for a number of years has reached a very
serious level,'' said author Tom Segev, who has written on the
impact of the Holocaust on Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is trying to rebuild his coalition after three rebellious
parties voted last week with the opposition in support of a bill
calling for early elections. The prime minister has said he would
not tolerate such behavior in the future, but has backed down from
threats to throw out the three renegade factions for good.
</P>
<P>
   He has until July, when the bill is up for the next vote, to put
together a new coalition. Barak needs at least one of the parties
to return, preferably the ultra-Orthodox Shas faction whose dispute
with the prime minister is over money, not ideology.
</P>
<P>
   If he fails, he will have to rely on a coalition of 52 dovish
and secular lawmakers and hope that on crucial peace issues, he
will win the outside support of 10 Arab legislators for a narrow
majority of 62 in the 120-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's courtship of Shas was complicated when Health Minister
Shlomo Ben-Izri, a leading figure in the party, accused another
senior coalition member, Education Minister Yossi Sarid of the
secular Meretz party, of persecuting Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid has been sharply critical of Shas' attempts to extract
more state funding for its bankrupt school system by threatening to
leave the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel frustrated by the persecution we are experiencing,
among others by Sarid,'' Ben-Izri said. ''They are using methods
against us that remind me of the Nazi propaganda, the way it was
used then against the Jews. They (the Nazis) claimed the Jews were
blackmailers trying to extract money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Izri also lashed out at Tommy Lapid, leader of the secular
Shinui party who has said he would not join the coalition as long
as Shas is part of it. The health minister said Lapid, a
sharp-tongued former TV talk show star and Holocaust survivor, was
a ''Super Haider,'' a reference to the Austrian far-right leader,
Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised confrontation with his nemesis on Monday night,
Ben-Izri told Lapid that his attacks on Shas may ultimately foment
a ''civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Jewish settlers protesting the government's
declared willingness to uproot tens of thousands of West Bank
settlers in a final peace agreement with the Palestinians drew a
parallel between the Barak coalition and the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally outside Barak's home, one of the speakers read his
adaptation of famous words by German pastor Martin Niemoeller, who
wrote that no one was left to speak out against his imprisonment in
a Nazi concentration camp because he had not protested when Jews,
Communists and others were seized by Hitler's gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the beginning, they expelled the settlers, and I didn't
speak out because I wasn't a settler,'' the speaker read at
Sunday's rally. ''Then they took the ultra-Orthodox, and I didn't
speak out because I wasn't ultra-Orthodox.''
</P>
<P>
   Settler activist Daniella Weiss defended the analogy, saying all
means were permissible to prevent the handover of parts of the
biblical Land of Israel to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest are games by leftists and bleeding-heart liberals,''
said Weiss, shrugging off concerns that hurtful words could bring
back the divisive political climate that led to the November 1995
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by an ultranationalist Jew.

<HEADLINE> College Loan Interest Rates Locked  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   With interest rates on college loans about to go up, the federal
government is letting students and families lock in current rates
if they consolidate their borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Education Department gives people with student
loans until June 30 to take advantage of current rates if they
combine their outstanding loans into one. This applies only to
loans borrowed directly from the government or through a
cooperating private lender.
</P>
<P>
   With college increasingly financed by loans, students often need
more than one. Many eventually merge them to get a single monthly
payment, with a rate set for the life of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, interest on a consolidated loan is set when the
original loans are verified. That can take a week to 30 days. With
a rate hike coming, this could cost borrowers more than they
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government will let borrowers lock in a rate the
date they apply for federal loan consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The government calculates that a student who owes $20,000 could
save $1,500 in interest on a 10-year repayment plan by
consolidating this month.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 1, Stafford loan rates, currently between 6.32
percent and 7.72 percent, will rise to between 7.59 percent and
8.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rates on PLUS loans for parents with dependent undergraduates --
now anywhere from 7.72 percent to 7.98 percent -- will jump to
between 8.99 percent and 9.48 percent.

<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of students and parents
from neighboring El Alto marched Monday through downtown La Paz
demanding the creation of an independent university.
</P>
<P>
   The protests paralyzed most downtown traffic in La Paz. Hundreds
of police officers were mobilized throughout the city to curb any
violence.
</P>
<P>
   A similar protest last month resulted in violent confrontations
and the ransacking of the El Alto Municipal building.
</P>
<P>
   El Alto, an impoverished city of half a million, is inhabited
mainly by Aymara Indians and does not have a government-run
university. El Alto sits on a flat plateau that borders La Paz, the
seat of government.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered to build a university in El Alto but
insists it be a branch of the San Andres University that is based
in La Paz.

<HEADLINE> New Threat Emerges In Assad Family  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Amid a frenzied national outpouring of
grief, Syria's leadership lined up behind late President Hafez
Assad's son as the choice to succeed him, with the parliament
speaker on Monday declaring Bashar Assad as capable as his father.
</P>
<P>
   But in an almost Shakespearean twist, a new threat emerged from
within the Assad family. Rifaat Assad, younger brother of the late
president who has been in exile in Europe since attempting to seize
power in 1983, made his own claim to the presidency just one day
before Hafez Assad was to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   In the first open challenge to what has otherwise been a smooth
transition, Rifaat Assad promised a ''corrective movement'' in
Syria -- a term used to refer to Hafez Assad's coup in 1970. The
statement to the Syrian people was read Monday night by an
announcer on Arab News Network, a London-based satellite television
station owned by Rifaat's son Sawmar.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Rifaat said through a spokesman that he planned
to return to Damascus at the ''appropriate time'' to contest his
nephew's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Rifaat) represents legitimacy in Syria,'' Rifaat Assad's
spokesman Al-Hareth Al-Khair said, adding that ''the people and the
army ... are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Khair appeared to be exaggerating the extent of Rifaat's
following in Syria. He enjoyed considerable popularity at the time
of his work alongside his elder brother, but his long years in
exile and the removal of his supporters in the army and the ruling
Baath party renders him a spent political force.
</P>
<P>
   The army has already publicly pledged its backing for Bashar
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Though Syria adopted a republican system after independence from
France in 1946, the hereditary succession and familial challenge to
the presidency was reminiscent of Shakespeare's dramas about
European royalty. But the speaker of the People's Assembly,
Abdul-Qader Qadoura, also a member of the party's national
leadership, brushed aside talk of a ''royal republic,'' saying
Syria was governed by ''institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Syria, the people declared their support for
the late president's son, chanting his name and waving his portrait
alongside those of his father in mourning marches that erupted in
cities and towns throughout this country of 17 million people.
</P>
<P>
   With shops closed in a show of respect, street hawkers did a
brisk business selling portraits of Assad, Bashar and his elder
brother Basil, Assad's first choice for a successor who died in a
road accident in 1994. Black cloth was also sold by the yard to
hang on buildings and fly from car antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of banners and poster-size portraits of
Assad and his two sons were plastered on buildings, cars,
motorcycles and even the bare chests of male Syrians taking part in
the mourning marches, most of which were accompanied by drummers.
</P>
<P>
   Recitals from the Koran, the Muslim holy book, could be heard in
virtually every corner of Damascus. A few mourners even cut
themselves to express their sorrow, in keeping with Shiite Muslim
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of mourning, though officially orchestrated like all
other mass displays in Syria, carried an element of genuine grief.
Assad was the only leader many Syrians had ever known, and despite
-- or perhaps because of -- his iron-fisted rule, he instilled in
ordinary Syrians a sense of security and national pride.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such an outpouring, Rifaat Assad's spokesman
Al-Khair stressed that the challenger will work through peaceful
means. Rifaat, he said, ''stresses peaceful action and refraining
from spilling blood and does not want Syria to drown in blood. But
he believes that legitimacy will prevail in a rightful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat Assad, 63, who has a political science doctorate from the
former Soviet Union -- his thesis was on class struggle in Syria --
was once vice president to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has in the three days since his father's death
received the crucial support of the armed forces' top brass, been
promoted from colonel to general and been nominated to the office
of president by the leadership of the Baath party. It was the
tribute his father, who had groomed him for succession, might have
wanted more than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Qadoura heaped lavish praise for Bashar Assad's abilities
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission of defending and loving the nation is not linked
to a man's age,'' he told a news conference. ''We believe that
every citizen in Syria who is capable of giving should be allowed
to give regardless of his age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenges are the same, the people are the same and the
baton has been handed over to someone who came from this party and
this people. Therefore he is capable of dealing with the
challenges,'' said Qadoura.
</P>
<P>
   As Syrians took to the streets for the third straight day
chanting ''Assad is in heaven!'' and ''Bashar, Bashar, we sacrifice
our blood and lives for you!'' world leaders and dignitaries began
to assemble in the capital, Damascus, for Tuesday's funeral. Late
into the evening, state television showed them arriving at the
Damascus airport.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to arrive were Sudanese President Omar El Bashir
and former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Most
dignitaries, including French President Jacques Chirac, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook, were due to fly in early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral promised to be an elaborate affair, beginning in
Damascus early Tuesday and ending 125 miles to the northwest at
Assad's home village of Qardaha, near the Mediterranean port city
of Lattakia. There, Syria's leader of nearly three decades was to
be buried.

<HEADLINE> Testimony In Jordan Terror Trial  </HEADLINE>
By SHAFIKA MATTAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A defendant accused of planning terror
attacks during millennium celebrations in Jordan testified Monday
that ammunition and chemicals found in his house belonged to
another suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Osama Sammar, one of 28 Arabs accused of planning New Year's
attacks, said another defendant, Raed Hijazi, had told him that he
had hidden personal equipment while Sammar was away from his rented
house.
</P>
<P>
   Sammar told the three-man tribunal that when he was away he
sometimes allowed his relative, Hijazi, to stay in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nitric and sulfuric acid found in my place also belonged
to Hijazi, who told me that he used to sell the acid to jewelers,
as it is a product used in manufacturing gold and not explosives,''
Sammar said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the 28 accused are in custody. The remaining 12 --
including Hijazi -- are outside Jordan and are being tried in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 are accused of planning to attack U.S. and Israeli
tourists during New Year's celebrations at Mount Nebo -- where
tradition says Moses saw the Promised Land -- and a Christian
settlement along the Jordan River said to be the site where Jesus
was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants are suspected of links to Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi-born millionaire wanted by the United States in the 1998
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings
killed 244 people.
</P>
<P>
   Suspect Mohammed Fayez, 18, told the court: ''Nobody asked me to
attack American and Israeli interests and touristic sites in
Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five defendants who appeared Monday claimed their
confessions were taken under torture and duress.
</P>
<P>
   Sammar said he was beaten so harshly that a military doctor was
brought in to treat him.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Brother To Challenge Nephew  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The estranged brother of late Syrian
President Hafez Assad hinted Monday he will work to overthrow the
new government, nearly certain to be headed by Assad's son and
chosen successor, Bashar Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a new corrective movement for a new course
covering all political, social and economic levels,'' the brother,
Rifaat Assad, said in a televised statement to the Syrian people.
</P>
<P>
   By referring to a ''corrective movement,'' Rifaat was borrowing
terminology used to refer to Hafez Assad's 1970 takeover of Syria
in a bloodless coup. The late president, who was then Syria's
defense minister, declared the coup was to correct the course of
the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, which he said had deviated
from its true objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat, a former Syrian vice president, has been exiled since
1984. Earlier Monday, a spokesman for Rifaat said he wants to bring
about change in Syria through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Rifaat stresses peaceful action and refraining from
spilling blood, and does not want Syria to drown in blood. But he
believes that legitimacy will prevail in a rightful way,''
Al-Hareth Al-Khair told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from Rifaat's home in exile in Marbella, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Khair said Rifaat plans to return to Syria but for now is
still in Europe. He would not say where.
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat's challenge came as Bashar Assad was making his way to
the top of Syria's political hierarchy. In swift steps after
President Assad's death Saturday, the Syrian Parliament lowered the
age of presidential eligibility to match Bashar's age, the ruling
Baath Party nominated him for the presidency and the government
named him commander of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The first public indication that Rifaat was considered a threat
to Bashar surfaced earlier Monday, when a newspaper reported that
Rifaat would not be allowed to return to Syria. The Al-Hayat daily
quoted an unidentified senior Syrian official as saying orders had
been issued to arrest Rifaat should he show up in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where 30,000 Syrian troops are stationed, witnesses
reported increased security checks at Beirut International Airport
and at seaports. Security officials speaking on condition of
anonymity said Syrian agents were on the lookout for Rifaat in case
he tried to sneak through the porous Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat Assad was a feared and effective enforcer of President
Assad's wishes during much of his 30-year rule. In 1982, he and his
crack army units crushed a Muslim fundamentalist uprising in the
northern city of Hama, leveling a huge swath of the city and
reportedly killing 10,000 to 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, as the president lay in a hospital
recuperating from a heart attack, Rifaat's tanks began maneuvering
on the streets of the capital, Damascus, in what was seen as an
attempted coup.
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat spent most of the next few years in exile. He returned to
Syria for his mother's funeral in 1992, and he was last seen at a
public event in Syria in 1994 at the funeral of Basil Assad, the
president's eldest son, who died in a traffic crash.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Monday, the 63-year-old Rifaat said he wants to
change the way autocratic Syria has been governed for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Freedom and democracy will be established in Syria. The
citizen will play his role in building the nation and choosing his
representatives in Syria,'' Rifaat said in the statement read on
Arab News Network, a London-based satellite television station
owned by Rifaat's son, Sawmar.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the speed of developments in Damascus that cleared
the way for Bashar's rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have left a sudden and tragic vacuum which some believed
they could fill, underestimating the issue of your succession and
downplaying the enormity of responsibility,'' he said, addressing
the late president.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word from Syria on measures against
Rifaat. But Lt. Gen. Mustafa Tlass, the longtime defense minister
and deputy armed forces chief, warned that the ruling Baath Party
and the military back Bashar against any potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will always be on his side. ... Let no one try to drive a
wedge in this united front,'' he told Lebanon's Future television
station.

<HEADLINE> UN Mission In Kosovo Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A senior Chinese leader joined
Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic in accusing the U.N.
mission in Kosovo of tolerating ''genocide'' against non-Albanians
and urged the withdrawal of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement issued late Monday, Milosevic and Li Peng,
the second-most powerful figure in the Chinese Communist Party,
denounced what they called ''systematic'' violations of the U.N.
Security Council resolution establishing the peacekeeping mission
in Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the authority of the United Nations, genocide against
the Serb people and other non-Albanians is being carried out,'' the
statement said, adding that the NATO-led peacekeepers ''have not
fulfilled any of their tasks and therefore should be withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   It also called for an end to U.S.-led efforts to isolate
Yugoslavia while Milosevic remains in power, saying that ''policies
of pressure ... must be abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia, both permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, have sought to maintain and expand links with Belgrade
despite Milosevic's international isolation and his indictment by
the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, however, maintains troops in Kosovo as part of the
NATO-led peacekeeping force and last week agreed to keep them there
for at least another year. China has no troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Li, who served as China's premier during the
1989 crackdown on the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square,
denounced last year's NATO bombing campaign as a violation of
international law and praised Yugoslavia for its ''heroic'' defense
against the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Yugoslav parliament, Li called the NATO air
campaign, launched to force a halt to the Milosevic government's
crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a ''flagrant
violation of international law and norms'' and a blatant
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yugoslavs made a heroic defense and defied the pressure of
powerful countries,'' said Li, who arrived Sunday for a three-day
visit. ''What good that war has done is a question for the
international community and for most European countries, especially
those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Li said that although fighting in Kosovo has ended, ''Kosovo's
problems are not solved. Ethnic conflicts are far from easing and
the question of refugees is still acute. The Balkan region is far
from peace and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the months of diplomacy leading to the 78-day air
campaign, China strongly opposed international threats against
Yugoslavia, claiming the crackdown in Kosovo was an internal
matter.
</P>
<P>
   China has suppressed dissent in Tibet and by ethnic and cultural
minorities in other parts of its own territory and traditionally
opposes multinational involvement in what it considers internal
crises.
</P>
<P>
   China's interest in improving relations with Yugoslavia
intensified after U.S. jets mistakenly attacked the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, killing three Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has responded to Beijing's overtures. After a
red-carpet welcome for Li at Belgrade's airport Sunday, the
Yugoslav parliament convened to hear his address, which was
broadcast live on state television.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing China's position on Taiwan, parliament speaker Milomir
Minic said Yugoslavia supports reunification ''of all parts of
Chinese territory'' and expressed hope that ''Taiwan will soon be
rejoined to the motherland.'' China considers Taiwan its breakaway
province.
</P>
<P>
   After Belgrade, Li is to visit Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia,
Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Drops Hairstyle Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The government overruled complaints
about a 12-year-old boy's hairdo, ordering school officials to let
the German-born student compete in the national mathematics
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Education Minister Fernando Robleto overruled a local ministry
official, who had banned Theo Sullow from competing in the
contest's second round. Sullow won a first, regional round in the
northern town of Esteli.
</P>
<P>
   The local official, Mercedes Garcia Guevara, argued that
Sullow's hairstyle -- described as a tall pompadour with a part down
the middle -- violated regulations. Local newspapers and the
government's child protection agency had criticized the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ruling Monday ''is a victory not only for Theo,
but for all children who have the right to their own tastes and
their own identity,'' his mother, Angelika Sullow, said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Hubertus Sullow, had accused Garcia Guevara earlier
of ruling against his son because of his nationality.
</P>
<P>
   The family, originally from Gottingen, Germany, has lived in
Nicaragua since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Still Face Old Terrors  </HEADLINE>
By HAROLD OLMOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The message on a scrap of paper
was written with a fractured hand but a still-unbroken spirit. It
read simply: ''Help me before it is too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer, Syrian journalist Nizar Nayouf, has been jailed
since 1992 for writing poems that angered his country's leaders and
for refusing to turn down international awards honoring his cause
and his courage.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the World Association of Newspapers added to that
list by awarding Nayouf the Freedom Gold Pen award in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, he is not here. Maybe one day,'' said Ruth de
Aquino, the Brazilian editor of the Rio de Janeiro daily O Dia and
president of the World Editors Forum.
</P>
<P>
   As 1,400 publishers and journalists gathered to discuss issues
such as the impact of the Internet on newspapers, many members of
the press like Nayouf still face centuries-old problems of
censorship, repression and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at least 71 members of the media were killed while on
the job, many victims of ''cold-blooded assassination,'' said Bengt
Braun of Sweden, association president. Worldwide, 124 journalists
in 24 countries are serving long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Murder is the ultimate form of censorship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A black-and-white picture of Nayouf projected behind her, de
Aquino quoted Nayouf as saying he was being held in ''one of the
most savage, bloody, criminal and secretive places in the world,''
where three to five people die from torture every day.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ''cemetery of living creatures,'' she quoted Nayouf, 27,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Among the abuses he described were dogs urinating on him and
being held on tiptoe in a simulated crucifixion for three hours a
day for a month. His captors tried to assassinate him three times,
once by placing arsenic in his food, and he was denied medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nayouf managed to smuggle out written messages to let the world
know of his condition, and one of the last was a cry for help, de
Aquino said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His torturers broke a finger of his right hand. Still he
managed to write,'' she said. ''He has become the voice of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian journalist Francisco Santos Calderon, editor of the
Bogota daily El Tiempo, faced a similar ordeal. He was kidnapped
for eight months and freed in 1991. After learning that hit men had
been paid to kill him, he fled into exile in the United States and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Now writing for his newspaper via e-mail from Miami, Santos told
conference members of the terror journalists in his country often
face.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of weeks ago, a Colombian journalist went to an
appointment with a paramilitary agent. She was kidnapped, tortured
and abandoned 60 miles to the southwest of Bogota,'' he said Monday
at the opening session of the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message for her and all journalists was clear: We can
kidnap and kill you, but this time we will not,'' Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in Colombia today is even worse than in the days when
druglord Pablo Escobar ran the dreaded Medellin cocaine cartel,
Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst is still to come,'' he said. ''Now, we don't know
who is shooting at us, where the bullets come from, why or when.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos urged international press organizations to set up
monitoring groups in Colombia and issue frequent reports on the
press. Speed is crucial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford annual reports,'' he said. ''We need
solidarity, the sooner the better''.

<HEADLINE> Saudis, Yemen Sign Border Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed an
agreement Monday expected to end decades of border disputes between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries' relations have ''entered a new era,'' Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh told a news conference after meeting
with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. The agreement was signed by the
countries' foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Yemen, which lies on the southwestern tip of the Arabian
peninsula, has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with
potentially lucrative oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement draws new borders in the Empty Quarter, Saleh
said. It also provides for the withdrawal of troops to a point
about 12 miles from the borders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on brotherhood and neighborliness, we were able to
overcome a number of points of conflict,'' Saleh said, noting that
many in the Arab world doubted the two sides would be able to reach
an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdel-Aziz said the
agreement ''serves the two countries and their peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   No details were released about how the pact handles the Red Sea
islands. The Saudi defense minister was expected to hold a news
conference Wednesday to explain details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Saleh and Abdullah left separately for the Syrian
capital of Damascus to attend Tuesday's funeral for late President
Hafez Assad.

<HEADLINE> House Passes College Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Universities would be required to notify
parents and students of the presence of any students or campus
employees charged or convicted of rape or other violent sex crimes
under a bill that passed the House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was approved by voice vote, takes other
steps to improve campus safety and security, including requiring
schools to make known their policies on investigating and notifying
parents about missing students.
</P>
<P>
   Universities receiving public funds also would have to notify
students and parents about the status of fire alarms and sprinklers
in dorms.
</P>
<P>
   The new security measures were attached to a bill that makes
mostly technical changes to a 1998 law that made it easier for
lower income students to attend institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   One provision makes clear that lower income students who receive
federal funds for higher education but have to withdraw from school
will never have to return more than 50 percent of the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard ''Buck'' McKeon, R-Calif., the sponsor of the
legislation, said he hoped this would allow low-income students to
make another attempt at school.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1998 law, students earn a certain amount of aid as
they go through the semester. The unearned part is open for
repayment if they withdraw, but a students' repayment obligations
are fulfilled after he completes 60 percent of the term.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department, in a letter last week to Education
Committee Chairman William Goodling, R-Pa., said it favored
one-time forgiveness for students who withdraw, but voiced concern
that forgiveness for further withdrawals could become a
disincentive for students to complete their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis., also said he was worried about
abuses. ''If there is a theoretical way for people to take
advantage of the government, some people will find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said he had also clarified language in
the original law barring the granting of loans to students
convicted of drug offenses. He said students would lose their loans
only if convicted after they had received the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which now goes to the Senate, also provides for
loan forgiveness for public defenders and prosecutors who earn less
than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4504.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Paraguayan Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Smiling and waving to onlookers, a
former Paraguayan army chief wanted in connection with the killing
of his nation's vice president was jailed Monday in Brazil's
capital while he awaits a ruling on his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Lino Oviedo was flown to Brasilia on Monday just hours
after his arrest in Foz do Iguacu, a tourist resort city on
Brazil's border with Paraguay and Argentina. Guards took him to
federal police headquarters and locked him in a cell reserved for
special prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We only have one cell like that, so he's sharing it with three
other prisoners,'' federal police spokeswoman Viviane da Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the case will be a Brazilian Supreme Court
ruling on whether Oviedo should be extradited to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Oviedo said they would file a petition Monday for
his release pending a decision on extradition. But Supreme Court
spokesman Gerson Matos said later that no request had been made on
Oviedo's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo was arrested late Sunday in a penthouse apartment in a
middle-class district of Foz do Iguacu, a city known for its
spectacular waterfalls and slack border controls about 220 miles
east of Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo was alone in the apartment and did not resist arrest, da
Rosa said. Police found 10 cellular phones and a loaded .38
revolver in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Da Rosa said Oviedo showed a false ID card with the name of
Emilio Franco Villareal, a Paraguayan citizen. She said he was
charged with carrying a gun without a license and using false
documents.
</P>
<P>
   With a mustache and long hair over his collar, Oviedo looked
very different from the neatly trimmed figure on news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian police had been searching for Oviedo since May 26,
when the Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant at the request of
the Paraguayan government.
</P>
<P>
   A former presidential candidate, Oviedo is accused of plotting
the 1999 killing of Vice President Luis Argana. He also was
convicted of leading an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1996 and is
suspected of planning another on May 18 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 attempt, Oviedo was sentenced to 10 years in
prison. He was released after just six months by then-President
Raul Cubas and went into exile in Argentina. Cubas himself was
accused of supporting Argana's killing and was forced to resign and
seek political asylum in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, Oviedo was protected by former President Carlos
Menem, who refused Paraguay's request for extradition. But Menem's
successor, Fernando de la Rua, said he would reconsider that
position. On Dec. 9, a day before de la Rua took office, Oviedo
eluded his Argentine security in the far southern region of Tierra
del Fuego and vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayan authorities said intelligence agents traced his phone
calls to Foz do Iguacu.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never stopped talking on the phone,'' Paraguayan Defense
Minister Walter Argana said in Asuncion. ''We have 90 hours of
tapes of his conversations with his collaborators.''

<HEADLINE> Elderly woman rescued after being 'fused' to her couch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Emergency crews used cutting tools to
rescue a neglected elderly woman who had spent as many as the last
four weeks physically stuck to her couch.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Zurek, 78, was hospitalized and was listed in serious
condition on Monday after she was ''fused to her couch,'' in what
Erie County Medical Center officials have called one of the worst
cases of neglect they have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Zurek, rescued Sunday evening, had been stuck to her couch when
fluids from open sores on her back and legs had leaked onto the
sofa and hardened, acting like glue, Buffalo Police Lt. Larry
Baehre said. Buffalo fire and emergency medical officials had to
cut into the couch to release the woman, Baehre said.
</P>
<P>
   Her two sons, who apparently lived with Zurek at the east-side
home, were being questioned by police, who are also considering
asking a state agency on elderly abuse to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second case of elderly neglect recorded in Buffalo
in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Hail, 76, died in a hospital on Monday afternoon, six days
after she was found in her home covered with maggots and bedsores.
</P>
<P>
   Hail lived with her son, who is reported to be mentally
incompetent. Police noted that two of her daughters lived nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, authorities are investigating whether charges of
criminally negligent homicide should be laid against those who were
supposed to take care of Hail.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County District Attorney is sorting through the information
to see whether criminal charges are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're living with mom and she can't take care of herself,
you have to do it,'' Clark said. ''And if you don't do it, maybe
your failure is a crime.''

<HEADLINE> Death penalty hearing set to begin on boy witness case  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The same jury that convicted Russell
Peeler Jr. in the murders of an 8-year-old witness and the boy's
mother is set to begin a hearing to determine whether Peeler will
spend the rest of his life in prison or die by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Although the murders of Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother,
Karen Clarke, sparked widespread public outrage, there are
drastically differing opinions on whether Peeler should get the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of five women and seven men will ultimately decide.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler was convicted last week of arranging the murders of B.J.
and his mother to prevent the little boy from testifying against
him in an earlier murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler was convicted on two counts of capital felony: killing a
child under the age of 16 and killing two people at the same time.
Under the law, must be sentenced to either life in prison without
the possibility of release or execution.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty phase of Peeler's trial is scheduled to begin
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers will present evidence of mitigating factors,
while prosecutors will present evidence of aggravating factors. The
jury will then be asked to weigh aggravating factors against
mitigating factors in determining whether Peeler should receive the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to present evidence of four different
aggravating factors, including the argument that the murders were
committed ''in an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner.''
The state also plans to argue that Peeler paid co-conspirator
Josephine Lee with crack cocaine to assist in the crime.
Prosecutors say Peeler also paid Gary Garner, the suspected driver
of the getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's attorneys would not say what mitigating factors they
plan to argue. But under the state's death penalty law, they are
allowed to argue factors spelled out in the statute and other, more
general factors such as a troubled childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Before the state's death penalty law was amended in 1995, if a
jury found just one mitigating factor - either those specified by
the statute or more general factors - the death penalty could not
be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The current law allows juries to weigh mitigating and
aggravating factors, but still prohibits the death penalty if the
jury finds one of the four mitigating factors spelled out in the
statute. Those factors are: if the defendant was under 18; if his
mental capacity was significantly impaired; if he was criminally
liable for the offense but his participation was relatively minor;
or he could not reasonably have foreseen that his conduct would
create a grave risk of causing death.
</P>
<P>
   In Peeler's case, his lawyers may argue that his participation
was relatively minor because his brother, Adrian, is accused of
being the actual triggerman. Adrian Peeler, who also faces capital
felony charges, will be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 40 years since the death penalty has been used in
Connecticut. Joseph ''Mad Dog'' Taborsky was executed on May 17,
1960, after a murder and robbery spree. Six people are now on death
row.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Peeler case, where there was a public outcry over
the killing of a little boy, there is a reluctance among some to
call for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Chris Caruso, D-Bridgeport, was one of the most vocal
critics of the state's judicial system for failing to protect B.J.
from Peeler, a notorious drug dealer who B.J. had promised to
testify against in the killing of his mother's boyfriend, Rudolph
Snead Jr. Yet, Caruso says he has mixed feelings about giving
Peeler the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you could ever forgive in a situation like this,
but maybe the just punishment is to have him serve the rest of his
life in jail and have him reflect on how he threw away his life and
also how he ended the life of such a promising young man and his
mother,'' Caruso said. ''That may be torture in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who has prosecuted
four of the six men now on death row, wouldn't comment on the
Peeler case specifically, but said sometimes the death penalty is
the only just punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some cases the crimes are so vicious and so heinous that
the person who has committed the crime has demonstrated through his
conduct that he no longer belongs in society and, in fact, he is a
danger even if he is incarcerated,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald Gold, a senior attorney in the Chief Public
Defender's Office, said the state should not be in the business of
retribution. He also would not comment on the Peeler case.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a case where a guy's been convicted of a capital offense, I
think that the only appropriate sentence is prison without the
possibility of release. That certainly protects society and it is a
significant form of justice and a punishment,'' Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's brother, Oswald, said he wants Peeler prosecuted ''to
the full extent of the law, whatever that is.'' He said he would
leave it up to the jury to decide whether Peeler lives or dies.

<HEADLINE> Newark lags behind nation in Census response rates  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Language barriers, a low response in the
black community and a high turnover rate among Census enumerators
have caused Newark to lag far behind the nation in Census response
rates, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt appeared in the state's
largest city Monday to rally Census workers to get a complete
count. Newark is a stop on a national tour of some of the country's
lowest performing cities, including Milwaukee, Baltimore and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every Census office in the country hits what we call the
wall,'' Prewitt said Monday. ''In a city like Newark, you hit that
wall a little sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 82 percent of all households have turned in Census
forms in Newark, compared to a national average of over 98 percent.
Overall, New Jersey has a 96.2 percent response rate.
</P>
<P>
   Census workers are still seeking responses from 23,000
households that didn't mail back forms and have been unreachable
door to door, said Lester A. Farthing, the Census Bureau's regional
director for New York City and northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt and other officials said many Newark residents are
immigrants who have trouble speaking English and may be afraid of
the government. But Newark has fared worse than Jersey City, which
also has a diverse ethnic population but has a response rate of
nearly 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Newark has a higher percentage of people in its general
population who don't understand the purposes of a Census and who
aren't fully committed to it,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Farthing said the city's black community, which makes up at
least half of Newark's population, has had an extremely low
response rate. He also blamed problems on high turnover rates with
Census enumerators.
</P>
<P>
   ''This job isn't for everybody,'' Farthing said. When Census
workers knock on doors ''and they get yelled at the first time,
that can turn them off right away.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the turnover rate among approximately 400 enumerators is
over 20 percent, despite the $18.50 an hour Census enumerators
make. The salary is the highest in the nation for Census
enumerators, matching New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Officials pointed out that while Newark lags behind the nation
and the rest of the state, it is ahead of where it was 10 years
ago. At this time in 1990, the city had only reached 61 percent of
its population, Prewitt said. The Census Bureau and state
governments launched massive advertising campaigns this year to
ensure a more complete count.
</P>
<P>
   An incomplete Census count can result in losses of hundreds of
millions of dollars in state and federal aid and in political
representation.
</P>
<P>
   The city faces a July 7 national deadline to turn in a complete
count, but Prewitt said the enumerators would stay in Newark until
the job is done.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to open all its firehouses 24 hours a day next
week to encourage people who haven't turned in Census forms to show
up, said Deputy Mayor Luigi Campana, who is coordinating the city's
Census outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And Farthing said the city is trying to better match its
counters with its population. For example, a female senior citizen
is less likely to open her door to a younger person, he said. And
he also said he's found the right people to try to solicit forms
from unresponsive young bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some beautiful women in Newark, and if that's what it
takes to get that door to open, that's what we'll do,'' Farthing
said.

<HEADLINE> Violence against tourists, others, mars summer weekend  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Six people were killed and 59 others were
stabbed or shot around the city over the weekend. In Central Park,
a group of young men stripped and groped four women, including
tourists from France and England; a bias attack occurred in Coney
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spate of violence over the hot, humid weekend, the
mayor and police commissioner were quick to point out on Monday
that crime is still down from last year, and considerably lower
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'm concerned with public perception,'' Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said in response to a reporter's question. ''I'm
concerned with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more brazen attacks occurred Sunday in crowded
Central Park. Shortly after 6 p.m., about 15 men, some carrying
large water pistols, squirted six women with water, then tore off
the clothes off of four of them and groped them. All the attacks
took place in heavily traveled areas - along Central Park South,
near the zoo and the Plaza Hotel. Five of the women were robbed of
money and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The men first attacked two Long Island teens, ages 16 and 18.
Then they targeted a couple visiting from France, restraining the
29-year-old man while they stripped and fondled his 28-year-old
wife. About 30 minutes later, three women, ages 18 and 19, visiting
from England, were attacked by the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was naked, completely naked. We were mortified,'' said
native New Yorker Rita Berlin, who saw police aiding one of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   David Rowe, 24, of Hempstead, on Long Island, and Tremayne Bane,
23, of Brooklyn, were arrested on robbery and sexual abuse charges
after the English victims pointed them out to police. Other
suspects were being sought. Police urged any other victims and
anyone who was using a videocamera in the area to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said crime in the 840-acre
Central Park is down this year, but added, ''If I put 10,000 cops
in Central Park, we couldn't cover every single area.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the incident, the park was again crowded on Monday.
''All the tourist books say the city is so much safer these days,
how Times Square has been cleaned up, things like that,'' said
tourist Valerie Izzard, 30, of London. ''That incident makes you
wonder. But I believe it was isolated, and I would not let it deter
me from seeing the park.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Coney Island incident, eight Hasidic men walking along
the boardwalk around 4:30 a.m. on Sunday were beaten, and four of
them stabbed by men who yelled anti-Semitic remarks. There were no
immediate arrests; police declared it a bias crime; the attackers
were described as Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In other acts of violence, six people were injured in Brooklyn
by a man brandishing an Uzi, and two women were hurt when three men
armed with a blow-dart gun drove by and shot at them, also in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   And three people were stabbed on Manhattan's Upper East Side on
Sunday. There were no immediate arrests; the victims, who police
said had apparently just attended the Puerto Rican Day parade, were
expected to make full recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were killed Saturday and Sunday, including one man
involved in a Harlem shootout and another, in the Bronx, stabbed in
a fight over money. The others were described as disputes in which
the victim and assailant knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest police statistics, through June 4,
murders have increased almost 6 percent from 281 during the same
period last year, to 297 this year. Shootings have risen nearly 7
percent from 791 last year to 846.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last month and a half, homicide is actually down; and
over the year, crime is down between 7 and 8 percent,'' said
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unrealistic to assume,'' the mayor added, ''that police
officers can be everywhere at every time.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Oppose Missile Shield  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American scientists opposed to a limited
national missile defense program asserted Monday that the
Pentagon's plan for such a shield won't work and should be put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may never be ready. This is basically a flawed process,''
said Kurt Gottfried, a physics professor at Cornell University in
Ithaca, N.Y., and chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 scientists and engineers told a Capitol news conference
the proposed system to shoot down ballistic missiles fired at the
United States from terrorist countries is scientifically unsound,
no matter how politically popular.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Danchick, a retired missile expert who worked for defense
contractor TRW, cited ''a fatal rush to deployment with a system
that can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy congressional pressure, President Clinton is to
decide this fall whether to deploy such a system. His decision will
come after another interception test in early July and the Pentagon
makes its recommendation in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the $60 billion system could easily be
defeated by countermeasures, such as hiding warheads among a flock
of decoy balloons, that any nation capable of producing a ballistic
missile could fabricate.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing an opposing view, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a leading
congressional missile-defense advocate, said in a statement, ''For
the longest time, these Luddites insisted that national missile
defense would never work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weldon, who was traveling in Russia with Defense Secretary
William Cohen, said, ''The Department of Defense is moving forward
with an effective national missile defense that will be able to
discern between countermeasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have claimed the Pentagon rigged recent tests of an
anti-missile interceptor rocket by using simple decoys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon acknowledged last week that it used simpler decoys
in recent flight tests but said stepping down the decoy quality was
according to plan and did not amount to dishonest manipulation to
hide a fatal flaw, as had been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   An October test hit the mock warhead, but the interceptor missed
its target in the most recent test, in January. The next test is
scheduled for early July, and more than a dozen others are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unsuccessful in his recent meeting in Moscow to win
Russian President Vladimir Putin's agreement to modify the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit such a missile-defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some missile-defense advocates want the United States to
withdraw from the treaty and build the missile system anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The plan envisioned by the administration would involve a
limited system designed to counter a small number of missiles, such
as might be launched by North Korea, Iran or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has suggested
he would like a more elaborate system.

<HEADLINE> Pataki slams Gore's ''progress and prosperity tour''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - On the eve of Al Gore's ''progress and
prosperity'' presidential campaign tour, Republican Gov. George
Pataki on Monday accused the vice president of unfairly trying to
claim credit for the nation's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the height of hypocrisy for the man who claims to have
invented the Internet to now claim he's invented prosperity,'' said
Pataki, who leads Texas Gov. George W. Bush's New York presidential
campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said any credit for the economic boom due politicians
should go to governors, both Republicans and Democrats, and to
Republican congressional forces, but not to President Clinton or
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes in Washington, he believes in government and that
is precisely the philosophy that in the 70s under President Carter
led us to our period of malaise,'' the New York governor added.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called the Gore tour ''an insult to the intelligence of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokesman said Pataki was backing the wrong
horse if he was concerned about the nation's economic prosperity in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor ignores the fact that the last time a Bush was in
the White House, we were suffering a painful recession,'' said Doug
Hattaway. ''Al Gore was part of the team that helped balance the
budget and pay down the national debt which helped create the
climate for our current prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to energize his presidential campaign, Democrat Gore
planned to begin his tour with a Tuesday afternoon speech in New
York City. While New York is considered a safe state for the vice
president, aides felt he could grab major national media attention
by starting his tour there.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore was to speak in Pennsylvania about health
care and, on Thursday, he was to be in Ohio to talk about tax cuts.
Both Pennsylvania and Ohio are considered swing states that could
help determine the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   All three states have something in common - Republican
governors. And all three - Pataki, Tom Ridge in Pennsylvania and
Bob Taft in Ohio - are Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that he's going to three states where Republican
governors have truly turned around the economic climate with tax
cuts and control over spending and other pro-business fiscal
policies, I think points out the differences between what a Gore
administration would do and what a Bush administration would do,''
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Clinton administration deserved any credit for
the nation's economic prosperity, Pataki said that Federal Reserve
Chairman ''Alan Greenspan deserves some of the credit because his
policies have been positive ... but I certainly think the
foundation for this was laid by the Reagan tax cuts and has been
carried forward at the state level by governors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, the credit goes to the American people and the
American entrepreneurs,'' the New York governor added.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said some Clinton administration policies have hindered
economic growth in the state and that Gore ''has never seen a tax
cut he doesn't deem risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized Bush's proposed tax-cut plan as ''risky,''
but Pataki said Monday that he is backing the Bush plan completely
and thinks it would be good for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Hattaway said, ''Governor Pataki is backing a
candidate who has little experience with managing national economic
issues and is pushing a tax cut that would keep us from paying down
the (national) debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he had not been contacted by the Bush campaign about
criticizing Gore's tour and had come up with the idea on his own.
Gore heads for Scranton, Pa., on Tuesday night. Ridge plans to
campaign in the Scranton area on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Displaced Congolese Return  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Tens of thousands of war-weary Congolese
poured into Kisangani on Monday, returning to their families and
shattered homes at the end of a seven-day bombardment by Rwandan
and Ugandan forces.
</P>
<P>
   A woman cried ''Papa,'' hugging her father after worrying about
him for a week. Mothers with crying babies on their backs crossed a
key bridge over the Tshopo River under the scorching sun where
unarmed U.N. military observers watched the steady flow of human
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Blue U.N. flags flew at both ends of the bridge that now
separates Rwandan and Ugandan forces after the Rwandans pushed the
Ugandans north across the river on Sunday. Ugandan forces tried for
a week to move into Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city between
the Tshopo and Congo Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Danilo Paiva, head of the 30-strong observer team, said
about 50,000 people were on the move, crossing back into the city
after fleeing into Ugandan-controlled northern Congo when the
fighting erupted between the two armies June 5.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the fighting began after the two sides had
agreed to a prearranged withdrawal from the city.
</P>
<P>
   At least 150 Congolese civilians were killed in the week of
shelling and shooting, and 1,000 others were injured. The Rwandan
and Ugandan armies did not disclose their casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the Ugandans set up weapons in front of my house and
started shooting, I fled across the bridge,'' said Joseph Ilumbe,
61. ''I don't know what has happened to my house or my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan military spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali, that the Rwandans would meet this week
with Senegalese Gen. Muntaga Diallo, head of the U.N. military
observer mission in Congo to discuss their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo heads the 100-strong observer mission created under a
peace accord signed last summer to bring an end to the civil war in
Congo. The U.N. is to deploy 5,537 more troops to protect the
monitors as they verify the cease-fire throughout Africa's
third-largest nation.
</P>
<P>
   Initially allies backing the same group that rebelled against
Congolese President Laurent Kabila in August 1998, Rwanda and
Uganda fell out as the rebel movement split in two over how to
conduct the war. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia are backing Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, The U.N. Security Council on Monday condemned the
fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in Kisangani and said
it expects the two sides to abide by pledges to fully withdraw from
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The council also said it was concerned about the statement from
the Congolese government that it no longer supported an
African-appointed facilitator, former Botswana president Ketumile
Masire.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo, made the statement
late Sunday after visiting the Angolan capital Luanda, where he
briefed Congo's military ally in the latest developments in the
fighting. Kongolo also accused the United Nations of siding with
the rebels -- a charge U.N. officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   The council said it was concerned about ''violent
demonstrations'' over the weekend at U.N. headquarters in the
Congolese capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Life slowly returned to normal Monday in Kisangani with the
familiar din of cars, bicycles and shouting Congolese traders.
Kisangani's normally vibrant central market reopened, although most
of the wooden stalls stood empty. Instead of the usual smoked
monkey and fish, traders offered soap and cigarettes from
pre-fighting stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the uncollected bodies of Ugandan soldiers still lay in the
city's streets, covered by white cloths, awaiting Red Cross
volunteers to collect them. Rwandan army officials said they had
counted at least 140 bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross was trying to arrange for their transfer to the
Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
   Unexploded mortar shells lay in the streets as did spent shells
and empty cartridges. On Sunday, three children died and one was
injured while playing with unexploded hand grenades, the Red Cross
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program flew in 1.5 tons of maize meal,
beans and high-protein biscuits on Monday, and another 35 tons of
food were expected on Tuesday, regional WFP spokeswoman Brenda
Barton said in Nairobi, Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Photos of missing persons to be posted on state websites  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Police say the first 48 to 72 hours in a
missing person's case are critical. After that, hopes of recovering
the individual become dim.
</P>
<P>
   But a new initiative by the state - the ''Missing Person Alert''
program - aims to assist the search by spreading instantaneous
photos and information about a missing person over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in the first few hours when you can follow the movement
of the missing person,'' Lt. Jamie Mills of the New York State
Police said Monday. ''As times goes by, the trail goes cold.''
</P>
<P>
   When an investigation finds a disappearance may have involved
foul play or some criminal element, the missing person's picture
and descriptive data would be posted as an ''alert'' at the top of
state websites.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on the alert would lead to a site with more information
and a ''Missing Person'' poster that can be downloaded and printed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, we had to fax these out, but now they can be printed
right at the (Thruway) toll plazas and posted very, very quickly,''
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the alerts will be posted on the websites of the State
Police, Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Thruway Authority
and the Department of Transportation. Combined, those sites have
43,000 visitors a day, according to Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of those (website visitors) are the motoring
public who are traveling across geographic lines and have a chance
of seeing and maybe recognizing the person and giving us a
contact,'' said James McMahon, superintendent of the New York State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the alert will be posted on over 90 state-affiliated
websites, Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state has long used the traveling public to aid in
searches for missing people. Thruway toll plazas feature pictures
of missing people and in the mid-1980's, pictures of missing
children were printed on the back of toll tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to be able to track movement,'' Mills said. ''Soon
after an abduction it's likely that people will travel out of the
area on the Thruway.''
</P>
<P>
   Alerts will stay posted on the state websites for one week and
will be reposted every time additional information or leads are
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 36,000 people are reported missing in New York state
each year. Using the Internet to help find them came at the
recommendation of Doug and Mary Lyall, whose 19-year-old daughter
Suzanne has been missing for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Lyall was a computer science major at the University at
Albany at the time of her disappearance. The Lyalls created a
website soon after she disappeared with photos of Suzanne, letters
to her abductor, links to information about other missing women and
ways to contact them with information on their daughter's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If an alert helps even one family find a loved one, it will be
a great success,'' said Doug Lyall.

<HEADLINE> Lazio says he backs 'hate crimes' legislation  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio said Monday he supports
a ''hate crimes'' law to provide for higher penalties for offenses
committed on the basis of a victim's race, gender, religion or
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People ought not to be subject to violence because of their
background,'' Lazio said, adding that such crimes have ''a
particularly corrosive impact on society.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a private meeting with Republicans who control the
state Senate, the U.S. Senate opponent of Hillary Rodham Clinton
said he backs the measure supported by 24 of the 36 GOP state
senators last week. The legislation was proposed by Republican Gov.
George Pataki and passed the Senate, 48-12.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton supporters questioned Lazio's support for
hate crimes legislation after discovering he had abstained during a
vote on the subject in 1990 while in the Suffolk County
Legislature. The county measure had called on the state Senate to
pass a hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been closely identified with a hate crimes bill in
Albany, appearing earlier this spring at the Capitol to publicly
lobby for the Senate to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio met Monday for the first time formally with Senate
Republicans since he became the GOP's candidate to oppose Clinton
on May 30. After the closed-door session, Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno declared, ''I can't think of anything that we are not really
in sync on and this conference is unanimously supporting him in
every way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate probably will not make Lazio happy on one issue the
congressman has pushed for in Washington, however.
</P>
<P>
   A measure which would allow some disabled people in New York to
continue receiving Medicaid benefits while holding private jobs is
supported by Senate Republicans, but is not likely to pass before
the Senate concludes its regular 2000 session, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we open, are we talking?'' Bruno asked. ''The answer is
yes. Do I expect we are going to get to it these next couple of
days? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he would continue lobbying for the so-called Medicaid
''buy-in'' in Albany, but conceded ''there are some fiscal issues
that the state has, they are real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, legislators say Pataki is opposing the buy-in, which
could cost the state at least $14 million a year, unless lawmakers
can show where that money will come from.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio reiterated his opposition to federal gun licensing and
said bullet ''fingerprinting'' and other technological advances
should be employed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also pressed the flesh Monday with employees and visitors
to the sprawling Empire State Plaza office complex in Albany. His
aides took him on a rather confused tour of the first floor of the
Capitol, with a troop of reporters trailing behind. He walked down
a hallway and then doubled back before finding where a waiting car
was parked to drive him to the exclusive Fort Orange Club nearby
for a meeting with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Lazio ran into Pataki in the Empire State Plaza.
The congressman's brief chat with the governor was the only contact
the two Republican allies had on Monday, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My partner,'' Lazio declared as Pataki hurried away to attend
an event in the office complex.

<HEADLINE> Judge hands city another First Amendment loss  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The latest in a string of First Amendment losses
for the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani came Monday when a
federal judge said rent increase protesters can lie or sleep on a
city sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said ''core First Amendment
rights to political protest are at stake'' in the plans by the
Metropolitan Council Inc., a tenants' advocacy organization, to
stage the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The group contends that rent increases proposed by the city's
Rent Guidelines Board would increase homelessness in the city,
clogging more sidewalks with people sleeping on flattened cardboard
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The group planned to stage a vigil at a park beginning Tuesday
near Giuliani's residence, Gracie Mansion. The plan included having
protesters lying on the ground in the park from 8 p.m. until 1
a.m., when up to 25 protesters were going to move to a stretch of
sidewalk opposite Gracie Mansion, where they would remain until 8
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Metropolitan Council sought a court declaration
that the city could not interfere with its protest. The New York
Civil Liberties Union said after Wood issued her ruling that the
protest would occur as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The city had opposed the request, saying a total ban on sleeping
on city sidewalks protects people who do not understand the dangers
of sleeping in public places, and keeps sidewalks clear of
obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   Wood listened to arguments by both sides in the dispute Friday
and issued a written ruling Monday, finding that the First
Amendment ''does not allow the city to prevent an orderly political
protest from using public sleeping as a means of symbolic
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected the city's reasoning that allowing the
protest means it cannot ever regulate disorderly public sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said there were ''obvious and dramatic differences''
between what the protesters had planned and the intentions of
others who might sleep on sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's top lawyer, said Wood was wrong but
added he doubted the city would appeal because the ruling was
limited to the protesters who sought the court's protection.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, though, said the city would consider arresting the
protesters at the conclusion of the demonstration if any laws were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Judge Guido Calabresi on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals criticized the city, saying, ''We would be ostriches if we
failed to take judicial notice of the heavy stream of First
Amendment litigation generated by New York City in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Calabresi noted 18 prominent cases in which the appeals court or
a lower federal court had found one of the city's actions or
policies unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote that ''in the current and rather remarkable
state of affairs in New York City,'' there was a danger that the
courts might become an agency that performs crucial local
government functions.

<HEADLINE> State loses appeal on parole of man who killed two officers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A man convicted of killing two police
officers could be in a halfway house by June 19 and on his way to
parole after more than three decades in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. lost an appeal Monday to
block Thomas Trantino's transfer while the state works to overturn
a ruling issued last week that said the convicted killer should be
paroled.
</P>
<P>
   The state appeals court delayed Trantino's move for only seven
days. Farmer's office had sought an indefinite postponement while
appealing the case to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, a spokesman for Farmer said attorneys
were preparing an emergency appeal to the state Supreme Court. That
appeal was expected to be filed Tuesday morning, said spokesman
Chuck Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general will ask the Supreme Court to review the
order to parole Trantino, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer will also ask the justices to keep Trantino in a state
prison while they consider the appeal, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino, who was convicted of killing two Lodi police officers
in 1963, has been denied parole at least nine times during his 37
years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The lower court last week said Trantino should be immediately
transferred to a halfway house. In that order, the court said state
Department of Corrections officials had 30 days to ready Trantino
for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Supreme Court does not act, by the 19th he could be in
the halfway house and then on his way out,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling focuses solely on parole issues, said
Trantino's lawyer Roger Lowenstein. The state disagrees only with
the final outcome, not the legal foundation for the ruling, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it unlikely the Supreme Court will hear the case,
according to Lowenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't need to take this case. There are no issues here
that are of any merit,'' Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel said in a 66-page opinion Friday that
Trantino's latest rejection by the state parole board was ''not
supported by any credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman immediately ordered Farmer to appeal.
Farmer's deputies were able to convince an appeals court judge to
grant the emergency stay Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the state lost the second round Monday when the same
appellate panel issued its ruling, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no reason given. Essentially they denied us,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino had been sentenced to die for killing the two officers
in a bar in August 1963. But when New Jersey's death penalty was
overturned in 1972, Trantino's sentence was changed to life in
prison. Sentencing guidelines in effect at the time made Trantino
eligible for parole in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier appeal, Trantino earned another chance at
release and a hearing before the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 1999 session, the board rejected Trantino's plea for
parole. Board members relied on a number of points, including
claims by prison mental health examiners that he would likely
commit another crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Trantino argued on appeal that parole board members ignored
several key points on his behalf. Trantino cited a prison record
that showed no infractions since 1970 and a private doctor and
other tests that said he appeared to be a good candidate for
parole.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Leadership Claims Victory  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Municipal elections in Montenegro,
Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation, left the
country divided Monday between backers of the pro-Western
government and supporters of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   President Milo Djukanovic's side won 28 of the 54 municipal
posts in Podgorica, the capital, according to results released
Monday by Montenegro's election commission.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's forces, which favor looser ties with Yugoslavia --
if not outright independence -- can now govern the city. Previously,
they had 27 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The results failed, however, to give Djukanovic the ringing
endorsement he sought.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's opponents, under Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic, claimed an ''absolute victory'' in the coastal resort of
Herceg Novi, the other key city involved in Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic's side wants this tiny mountainous republic to remain
firmly in the federal embrace. Its victory in Herceg Novi is likely
to dissuade Djukanovic from taking a hasty step to full
independence anytime soon and risk an armed conflict with
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic's camp said it had won 19 out of the 35 seats there.
The election commission reported Monday it had ''received no
results'' on Herceg Novi balloting and referred journalists instead
to claims published in the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Downplaying the loss of Herceg Novi, Djukanovic urged his
followers not to be disheartened and focus instead on the victory
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proves Montenegro is stepping forward on the road of
democracy and no one can stop us anymore,'' Djukanovic told
supporters early Monday. ''Milosevic's policies are on their
deathbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting would be repeated at one polling station in Podgorica
where minor irregularities were reported but had no bearing on
final results, the election commission also said. After a 72-hour
complaint period, the results are expected to be declared official
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe had dispatched 80 observers to the balloting.
Julian Peel Yates, the head of the OSCE in Europe's Montenegro
office, said the election was conducted in line with the group's
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The election campaign was vigorously contested mainly on
national issues against a complex, tense and uncertain political
background,'' he said. ''Nevertheless, fundamental freedoms were
respected and it's noteworthy that campaigning was conducted
peacefully throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   The election commission said the turnout in Podgorica was 78.8
percent,and newspapers reported turnout in Herceg Novi around 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several explanations could account for the victory of the
pro-Milosevic bloc in Herceg Novi.
</P>
<P>
   The town includes a large group of Serb refugees from wars in
the former Yugoslavia who had since acquired Montenegrin
citizenship and eligibility to vote. The refugees are generally
believed more supportive of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   However, Herceg Novi's new mayor, Djuro Cetkovic, said his side
won because they had the ''support of the people ... support in the
villages.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people who have lived for centuries here and cannot
imagine a future without Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' Cetkovic told the
Pobjeda daily.

<HEADLINE> Advisers Urged Willey Papers Release  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's advisers urged the release
of letters from presidential accuser Kathleen Willey because they
feared her allegations might fuel impeachment and widen Ken Starr's
criminal probe, according to court papers filed on behalf of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Clinton's closest adviser,
Bruce Lindsey, provided a written account of internal deliberations
in March 1998 that led to Clinton's release of Willey's friendly
exchange of letters with the president.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' Willey accused Clinton of making an
unwelcome sexual advance in 1993. The correspondence that Clinton
subsequently authorized his aides to release was written after the
alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, White House counsel Chuck Ruff and deputy counsel
Cheryl Mills ''concluded that Ms. Willey's allegations, without any
context, might bias the public and Congress and thereby increase
the potential for the expansion of the Independent Counsel's
jurisdiction and the likelihood of impeachment proceeedings against
the president,'' the court papers stated.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department papers, which Lindsey sworn to ''under
penalty of perjury,'' stated that the advisers also took ''general
public confidence in the president's credibility'' into account in
publicizing Willey's letters.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton's advisers ''discussed whether the use of Ms.
Willey's letters would be, or would appear to the public to be,
inconsistent with the White House's commitment not to attack any of
the president's accusers personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisers ''determined that because these letters were Ms.
Willey's own words, the use of them would not be inconsistent with
that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The written explanation came in a lawsuit filed against the
Executive Office of the President by former appointees in the
Reagan and Bush administration's whose FBI background files were
gathered by the Clinton White House. A conservative group, Judicial
Watch, is representing the former appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey stated that before Willey's TV appearance, he telephoned
Clinton at Camp David and that the president agreed with the
recommendation to release the letters and to decide on the exact
timing after the ''60 Minutes'' program. The letters were released
the day after the show aired.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey had resisted providing the explanation in the lawsuit,
but U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered him to do so in a
decision which found Clinton engaged in a criminal violation of the
Privacy Act by releasing the Willey letters. An appeals court
rejected the Clinton administration's effort seeking an emergency
review of Lamberth's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Paula Jones, who accused the president of sexual
harassment, subpoenaed materials from the Executive Office of the
President, a step that should have led to the Willey letters being
turned over to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey stated, however, that Jones's first set of lawyers
withdrew the subpoena and that it was not renewed by her second set
of lawyers.

<HEADLINE> PBS Will Rerun Popular Shows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- PBS will test a revamped prime-time schedule in
seven markets this fall, moving a long-running drama series to
Monday nights and running repeats of two of its most popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilot project goes well, the PBS schedule for the entire
country could be changed as early as April.
</P>
<P>
   PBS, which seldom fiddles with its schedule, will have the
''Exxonmobil Masterpiece Theatre'' and ''American Experience'' swap
their Sunday and Monday time slots. The idea is the drama
presentation would do better on Mondays with less network
competition, spokesman Tom Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nature,'' which airs on Sunday nights, will switch to Fridays,
and ''Mystery!'' moves from Thursdays to Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, PBS will feature same-week repeats.
''Antiques Roadshow,'' which premieres new episodes on Sunday
night, will rerun them on Wednesdays. ''Nova,'' which has new
episodes Tuesdays, will air reruns on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tactic used frequently by cable networks but not as often
by broadcasters. Epstein said it will mean fewer spots on the
schedule for first-run programming, but is likely to increase the
audience for PBS' popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   The new schedule will be tested at PBS stations in Orlando,
Fla., Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Cleveland
and San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Pataki nominates former Freedom Party head to wagering board  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The former chairwoman of the defunct Freedom
Party was nominated Monday by Gov. George Pataki as a member of the
state Racing and Wagering Board.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the state Senate, Cheryl Buley would be the
first woman to serve on the three-member board, which oversees all
the state's legalized gambling activities, including thoroughbred
and harness horse racing and off-track betting, except for the
state Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Buley, who has worked for Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno, ''gained a working knowledge of the horse racing
industry working for Senator Bruno that will serve the board
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Buley worked for Bruno in 1985-86 before moving to public
relations firms in Boston and Albany. In 1994, she became
chairwoman of the Freedom Party, a creation of the state Republican
Party to add another party line backing Pataki during his first run
for governor. The Freedom Party was disbanded after Pataki won the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki tapped Buley for the post after a printing executive
withdrew his name from consideration last week. Salvatore ''Skip''
DeBiase, founder and CEO of Phoenix Graphics Inc. in Rochester,
said that his family and business commitments would not give him
enough time to serve as a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Buley's husband, Jeffrey Buley, is a lawyer for the state
Republican Chairman William Powers and has a lobbying partnership
with Albert Pirro. Pirro, a lobbyist and developer who is married
to Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, is being
tried in federal court in White Plains for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   State law prohibits all three board members from being members
of the same political party. The board's other two members,
Chairman Michael Hoblock and Joseph Neglia, are both Republicans.
Buley, not enrolled in a political party, filed forms Monday to
retain that independent status and thus qualify for the
$101,600-a-year job.
</P>
<P>
   She had earlier filed forms to become an enrolled Republican
after this November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's nomination drew criticism from Democrats, who
questioned Buley's political affiliation and her job experience.
They want the governor to reappoint Bennett Liebman, a Democrat who
has served two six-year terms on the board. Liebman's term expired
in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are we replacing somebody who is eminently qualified for
the job, who has demonstrated a nonpartisan approach to the board,
with somebody who appears to have no qualification for the job,''
said Bill Reynolds, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Martin
Connor, D-Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all seems very murky, Reynolds added.
</P>
<P>
   He said those concerns will be brought out at a meeting Tuesday
of the Senate's racing, gaming and wagering committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, controlled by Republicans, must confirm Buley's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The resident of the Albany suburb of Slingerlands could not be
immediately reached for comment Monday on her nomination.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Some Lawsuits vs. HMOs  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court waded into the patients'
rights debate Monday, shutting down one legal avenue for people to
sue their health-maintenance organizations while Congress considers
bolstering the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' unanimous ruling said patients cannot use a
federal law to sue HMOs for giving doctors a financial incentive to
cut treatment costs. Such lawsuits could mean the end of HMOs,
which are based on financial incentives, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that for over 27 years the Congress of the United
States has promoted the formation of HMO practices,'' Justice David
H. Souter wrote for the court. ''The federal judiciary would be
acting contrary to the congressional policy ... if it were to
entertain (a claim) portending wholesale attacks on existing HMOs
solely because of their structure.''
</P>
<P>
   HMO representatives praised the ruling. Stephanie Kanwit of the
American Association of Health Plans said the decision was
''sensible for both health plans and for consumers'' because the
Illinois lawsuit thrown out Monday was ''challenging the very cost
containment mechanisms that in fact keep health care costs down for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   James P. Ginzkey, the lawyer for the Illinois woman who filed
Monday's case, ''I am very disappointed but not at all surprised at
the decision... It's a bad decision. I think that managed care
systems are going to get an awfully lot more aggressive in their
cost containment measures. Basically, the Supreme Court has said
'do whatever you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Patients' rights advocate Jamie Court noted the ruling left open
the possibility that lawsuits could be filed in state court. ''This
really doesn't do much damage to the patients' rights movement,''
said Court of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always believed that state courts are the better venue''
for patients' lawsuits, Court added. The Illinois lawsuit was based
on a federal law that strictly limits damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Several states -- including California and Texas -- have enacted
laws explicitly letting patients sue their HMOs, and some courts
have allowed lawsuits in states without such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress is considering patients' rights legislation
that could give people an expanded right to sue as well as other
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling barred a lawsuit by Cynthia Herdrich of
Bloomington, Ill., who blames her ruptured appendix on inadequate
care. The court said federal law does not allow her to sue her HMO
on a claim that it violated its duty to act in patients' best
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said, ''Since the provision of profit is what makes the
HMO a proprietary organization, (Herdrich's) remedy in effect would
be nothing less than elimination of the for-profit HMO'' and
perhaps nonprofit HMOs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling leaves in place patients' right to file lawsuits in
state court alleging that an individual doctor committed medical
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   It was not certain how Monday's ruling would affect about a
dozen federal class-action lawsuits that accuse HMOs of unlawfully
concealing doctors' financial incentives to hold down treatment
costs. The Supreme Court's ruling noted that Herdrich did not raise
such a claim in her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Herdrich sued the Carle Clinic Association in 1992, saying her
appendix ruptured and peritonitis set in because her doctor delayed
diagnostic tests for eight days so the tests could be performed at
a facility owned by the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   She was awarded $35,000 in damages for medical malpractice under
Illinois law. But she also sued under a federal law that governs
employee health benefits and pensions, known as the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, which requires health plan managers
to act in patients' best interests.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed her claim, but the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals let her sue. The Supreme Court said the appeals
court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation in 1973 intended to encourage the
development of HMOs. The ERISA law, passed the following year,
aimed to protect workers' benefits by setting federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Several HMO stocks were up following the decision. Aetna, which
was upgraded by Salomon Smith Barney on Monday, rose $3.25 to
$70.625. Cigna jumped $2.25 to $90.75. United Healthcare rose $1.50
to $78.18; and Pacificare rose $1.50 to $67.87.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Pegram vs. Herdrich, 98-1949.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 107; Dow Down 50  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Monday, sending the Nasdaq
composite index down more than 100 points, as reports from two
companies suggested that second-quarter earnings won't meet Wall
Street's high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   An earnings warning from Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of
computer network products, helped give the Nasdaq its worst loss
since May 23. Meanwhile, Home Depot hurt the Dow Jones industrials
after a Wall Street analyst said rising interest rates are taking a
toll on sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq ended the day down 106.93 at 3,767.91. Since it lost
199 points on May 23, the index had been staging a gradual
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 49.85 to close at 10,564.21, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 10.95 at 1,446.00. Both indexes gave up
early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light, convincing analysts that investors are
trading cautiously in advance of several government reports on the
economy due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an orderly market, but not a market with a great deal of
conviction,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Citrix set the tone for the Nasdaq, warning that its earnings
will miss estimates in the coming quarter. The company said
expansion of its core business in large enterprise accounts is
taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged 47 percent,
or by $19.188, to $22, and Edward M. Kerschner, chief investment
strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his firm's
''Highlighted Stocks'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning,
which rose $18 to $230 after the fiber-optics company said it
anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80
cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last
year's second-quarter totals.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks that sustained sharp losses: Harmonic
Inc., which lost $18.688 to $38.75 and MicroStrategy, which fell
$23.313 to $38.938.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot fell $1.938 to $46.063 after a Robinson-Humphrey Co.
analyst lowered his estimate for second-quarter same-store sales.
Analyst Mark Mandel lowered his expectations after meeting with
Home Depot management on Friday, and said rising interest rates
appear to be hurting business.
</P>
<P>
   Other retail stocks also paid a price for an anticipated
economic slowdown. Wal-Mart fell $1.25 to $52.75, adding to the
Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are
just beginning the ''preannouncement'' period, when companies give
Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive
surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong
one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts predict
investors will punish any company that appears to be losing
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at
least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating,''
Ackerman said. ''The market is still quite fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it
more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products.
Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because
it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising
rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June
28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and
housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's
earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the retail sales and consumer price reports show the
economy slowing and inflation remaining tame, then we believe the
odds are that the Fed will not be raising rates at that time,''
said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by just a few dozen
issues on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came
to 943.94 million shares, compared with 967.03 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.55 to
508.51.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.3 percent and Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
0.2 percent. The French stock market was closed for a holiday.

<HEADLINE> Italian Mother Rues Exile in Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- An Italian woman who took refuge with her two
daughters at Kuwait's Italian embassy after court rulings gave
custody rights to their father said Monday she wants to go home
with her girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that in a short time we will be in Italy,'' Stefania,
33, told The Associated Press at the embassy. She spoke on the
condition only her first name would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Stefania accused her ex-husband of abusing her and her daughters
-- a charge the man, who holds Egyptian and Italian nationalities,
has denied. She said that although she loves Kuwait, where she has
lived for 12 years, she wants to live in Italy, ''where women are
protected by law and where we have the same rights as men.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's story has riveted Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Stefania and her husband, who is 20 years her senior, divorced
last year. In January, three weeks after a court placed her in her
father's custody, Stefania's eldest daughter fled to the embassy.
Stefania and her younger daughter joined the older girl this
weekend after a court awarded custody of the second girl to the
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was violent, he didn't respect me as a woman, and he tried
to strangle me once,'' Stefania told the AP. She said he also
punched Erica, 13, in the chest, hit her on the face and locked her
up at home.
</P>
<P>
   The former husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied
he abused Stefania and the girls. He accused his ex-wife of trying
''to remove the role of the father from the lives of his
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement published in the Al-Rai Al-Amm daily on Monday,
the father, who is a lawyer, said the courts believe it is not in
the interest of the Muslim girls to grow up in a ''Western
environment with different customs.'' He called on the government
to enable him to take his girls with him if he leaves Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Stefania said she converted to Islam three years after the
couple married, but her ex-husband wants ''other people to think
I'm not a good Muslim'' so he can have the girls. She has turned
down her ex-husband's proposal that she keep the girls on weekdays
and give them to him on weekends. Stefania said her ex-husband
plans to go to Egypt this summer and take the girls with him.
</P>
<P>
   The older daughter, who appeared briefly to be photographed with
her mother and sister, said she wants to go to Italy and does not
want to live with her father because he beat her. The thin girl
with long black hair has been taking her school exams at the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking Italian diplomat was dispatched here earlier this
year in an attempt to solve the problem, but Kuwaiti officials and
Italian diplomats have refused to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names New Undersea Projects  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Video screens displayed fantastical pictures
of otherworldly landscapes below the waves and beyond the sun
Monday as President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
hosted the latest in a series of White House lectures on science,
arts and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session on space and sea exploration featured gee-whiz
science demonstrations and scientists' musings on what future
explorations might yield. Schoolchildren asked questions in person
and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must continue as a nation to set out for new frontiers,
whether under the sea or into the heavens,'' Clinton said at the
start of the 90-minute session. ''We must continue to try to
conquer the seemingly impossible, to discover the unimaginable, to
find out more about what's out there, and in the process about
ourselves and what's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced federal participation in three new undersea
exploration projects: A deep-water canyon off the coasts of New
York and New Jersey; reefs deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico off
Florida's Gulf Coast; and an ocean mountain range off California.
</P>
<P>
   He also directed the Commerce Department to form an advisory
panel of scientists to recommend priorities and goals for new ocean
exploration. A report is due in four months.
</P>
<P>
   Although oceans cover some 70 percent of the Earth's surface,
scientists estimate that 90 percent of that space remains unknown
to humans. Clinton and scientists predicted Monday that some of the
organisms found in those depths might one day provide medical cures
or lessons for industry and human development.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of those creatures -- brightly colored tube worms that
live near undersea volcanoes and diaphanous scribbles floating in
the deep -- flashed on the eight thin, high-tech screens set against
the gilded splendor of the White House East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fidgeted at times but also looked amazed as two
prominent scientists, undersea explorer Marcia McNutt of
California's Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and Neil de
Grasse Tyson of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, traded
what-ifs about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The lecture was the ninth of a program conceived by Mrs. Clinton
as part of the White House millennium year commemoration.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Hometown Plans For Funeral  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   QARDAHA, Syria (AP) -- Here among the green hills where President
Hafez Assad was born and spent much of his youth, somber
preparations were under way Monday to welcome the late Syrian
leader for the last time before he is laid to rest next to his
eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   In a mournful atmosphere and a quiet broken only by verses of
the Koran, Islam's holy book, blaring occasionally from
loudspeakers, workers were busy making arrangements for Assad's
funeral, expected to bring together tens of thousands of mourners
from across the country Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were planning an elaborate state funeral -- the biggest
in Syria's modern history -- with dignitaries from all over the
world flying in for daylong ceremonies beginning in Damascus.
Assad, who died Saturday at the age of 69, was to be flown from
there to the coastal city of Latakia and carried on a gun carriage
to Qardaha, about 125 miles northwest of Damascus, for prayers and
burial in the family cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In Qardaha on Monday, municipal workers draped pictures of Assad
on the main road where the funeral procession will pass. They also
posted pictures of Bashar, his younger son and likely successor,
and Basil, his eldest son, who died in a car accident in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of young people in mourning black paraded the
streets waving black flags, some crying. Hundreds of security
guards lined the main highway leading up to Qardaha and the narrow
streets inside the village where many of Assad's Alawite clan live
in stone, red-roofed villas.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will live in our hearts forever,'' read a black and white
banner at the entrance to Qardaha. ''Bashar, you are the hope of
the nation'' read another -- one of many pledging undying support
for Assad's expected successor.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Basil Assad's elaborate hilltop grave, workers were
constructing a makeshift stage for officials and close friends of
the family who were expected to attend the funeral. About 100
people were arranging wreaths, spreading out piles of white plastic
chairs and erecting loudspeakers on lampposts.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is to be buried close to the huge marble mausoleum for his
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot believe this is where our president of 30 years will
be laid to rest tomorrow,'' said Ibrahim Rahiyeh, 68, a retired
construction worker from Qardaha. ''It's the end of an era.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from where Rahiyeh was speaking stands the modest,
one-story stone house said to have been the Assad residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assad's early years were spent largely out of doors, perched
on a donkey on the way to the fields, helping with the gathering of
fruit, or just scampering about in the mountains with other
children,'' biographer Patrick Seale wrote of the Qardaha of the
president's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Qardaha has modern homes and schools, as well as a large
mosque Assad built and named for his mother, Na'isa. Prayers were
to be held Tuesday at the green-and-white stone Na'isa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the mosque was draped with large black banners.
Elsewhere, little black flags fluttered on almost every electricity
pole, balcony and car antenna and huge pieces of black cloth hung
from homes, buildings and car windshields.
</P>
<P>
   Najah Sharkas, a 40-year-old housewife from the city of Homs,
sat quietly watching workers near Basil Assad's mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart is broken,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharkas said she came from Homs to Qardaha on Sunday and will
stay for Assad's funeral. She said she has no friends in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where she would spend the night, the woman said: ''I will
not sleep, just like I haven't in two days. I am so sad that I may
never sleep again.''

<HEADLINE> Fourth poll finds Hillary Clinton-Lazio race tight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A fourth statewide poll in less than three
weeks has found Hillary Rodham Clinton in a close race in New York
with her new Republican opponent for the U.S. Senate, Rep. Rick
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS News/New York Times poll out Monday had Clinton with a
very slight lead over the little-known congressman from Long
Island. Clinton was backed by 44 percent of likely voters surveyed
to 39 percent for Lazio. Seventeen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times poll out in April had Clinton leading
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, 49 percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent
undecided. Giuliani quit the race May 19 to deal with his prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The new telephone poll of 1,187 likely voters was conducted June
4-10 and has a margin of error of plus of minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, the Zogby International Group had the race a
statistical dead heat with Clinton at 46 percent and Lazio at 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a poll conducted by Blum &AMP; Weprin for the New York
Daily News and cable television's New York 1 all-news channel
reported Clinton with a slight, 46 percent to 42 percent, lead over
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute had
Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent each.

<HEADLINE> Court Helps Workers vs. Job Bias  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Workers who say their employers illegally
discriminated against them can win lawsuits, or at least get their
accusations to a jury, without direct evidence of intentional bias,
the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court's unanimous decision in an age-bias dispute from
Mississippi could carry profound practical importance as well for
lawsuits nationwide that charge employment discrimination based on
race, sex and physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a huge setback for employers because some federal
appeals courts routinely had dismissed lawsuits that lacked
''smoking gun'' evidence of employers' discriminatory intent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision said circumstantial evidence often is enough
to sue employers successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Employer organizations were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is ... it may be tougher to get cases out of
the hands of the jury,'' said Peter Petesch, a lawyer for the
Society for Human Resource Management. ''In some jurisdictions,
we're going to see more litigation ... which lasts longer, even for
employers who did nothing wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Osborne, an AARP lawyer, praised the decision as a
victory for the some 12 million over-50 workers who belong to his
organization because it ''says employers no longer can lie about
their personnel decisions and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The playing field is no longer slanted toward employers,''
Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of employment-bias decisions, the nation's highest
court has imposed various requirements on employees who say they
were treated illegally. They must show they were subjected to
adverse treatment and that the employer's asserted reason for such
treatment was phony.
</P>
<P>
   But federal appeals courts have disagreed on a key point:
whether employees who discredit an employer's stated reason must
also offer proof of a discriminatory motive. Not always, the
Supreme Court said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that a federal appeals court
wrongly relied on ''the premise that a plaintiff must always
introduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence
is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of
intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive,'' she
said. ''In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can
reasonably infer form the falsity of the explanation that the
employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said employees will not always be entitled to win a
job-bias lawsuit after showing that an employer's explanation for
their treatment was false. But she ruled that it was enough in the
case of a Mississippi man who said age discrimination cost him his
supervisory job at a toilet-seat manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Reeves sued Sanderson Plumbing Products of Columbus,
Miss., after he was fired in 1995 from his job as a
hinge-department supervisor in the plant. Reeves, then 57, had
worked at the plant for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   His lawsuit invoked the federal Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, and a jury awarded him $70,000 in damages and $28,490 in lost
pay.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that award
after ruling that Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal
age bias.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves had been required to prove he was over 40 and therefore
protected by the federal law, that he had been fired and replaced
with someone younger. Such evidence amounted to what courts call a
''prima facie'' showing of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reason for the firing. Once it did, the burden
shifted back to Reeves to show that the stated reason was false.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to derogatory comments made about his age by a
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said Reeves had been fired for falsifying time
records but he showed that he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The jury apparently concluded that he succeeded in proving bias,
but the appeals court said Reeves had to also offer proof that the
company's decision was motivated by age bias.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision said the appeals court was wrong about that,
and reinstated the jury's verdict.

<HEADLINE> Suspect freed after 23 years in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - A man whose murder conviction was
overturned in 1995 and then twice got hung juries was freed Monday
after 23 years behind bars when the Passaic County Prosecutor's
Office declined to seek a fourth trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence L. Simmons, 43, was greeted by his mother and sisters
as he left the Passaic County Jail, said one of his lawyers, John
Vincent Saykanic.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons maintains he is innocent of the 1977 fatal beating of a
well-known Paterson physician, and years ago refused a deal that
would have freed him with time served in return for a guilty plea,
said his other lawyer, Miles Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The release was set in motion last week, when a panel of state
appellate judges directed that the indictment charging Simmons with
the murder of Dr. David Doktor be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Monday, state Superior Court Judge Sylvan G.
Rothenberg dismissed the indictment after Assistant Passaic County
Prosecutor Steven J. Brizek said the office would not appeal to the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do this in the hope that we may thereby constructively
bring to a close one of the saddest chapters in the history of
Paterson, Passaic County and the state of New Jersey,'' Brizek told
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   His boss, Prosecutor Ronald S. Fava, said a conviction in a
fourth trial would not have kept Simmons in prison, since he had
already served more time than he could receive at sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his office would have tried the case if not for the
appellate ruling, Fava said.
</P>
<P>
   Fava said he met Monday with Doktor's daughter, Deborah, to tell
her of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''She understood, she agreed, she was very thankful for the
efforts that had been put into this case,'' Fava said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who now lives in Massachusetts, was pregnant with her
first child in 1977 at Simmons' first trial, Fava said. Her town
and age were not immediately available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 and 1998 retrials, a total of only seven jurors
voted to acquit Simmons of murdering Doktor, noted Brizek, adding,
''The truth of who killed him is in the record for anyone to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Brizek also noted that a conviction for mugging George Marshall
was left intact by the state appellate panel, for which Simmons got
a 15-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Posing the question of whether Simmons spent eight years in
prison for a crime he did not commit, Brizek said none of the state
or federal court decisions in the case suggested ''that the
evidence did not support the 1977 jury's unanimous conclusion that
Lawrence Simmons murdered Dr. David Doktor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brizek recounted that Simmons began his criminal career at age
9, amassing 15 sustained juvenile complaints and adult convictions
by age 20 for armed assault, robberies and receiving stolen
property.
</P>
<P>
   Doktor, 64, was beaten to death May 27, 1977, with a lead pipe
when he was called out late at night to tend to a stroke patient,
Brizek said.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons testified to his innocence but he and co-defendant
Donald Phillips were convicted of murder later that year and were
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' appeal was delayed until 1988 because his
court-appointed lawyer never filed an appeal. After Simmons was
appointed a new lawyer, Saykanic, state courts upheld the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a key state witness, David R. Wilson, recanted his
testimony and claimed Simmons was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal appeals court overturned Simmons' conviction
because the prosecutor in his 1977 trial may have improperly kept
blacks off the jury. Simmons is black, Doktor was white.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's ruling, the state appellate judges said the
murder indictment should be dismissed because Simmons spent half
his life in prison during appeal delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he is innocent, this protracted incarceration would be
tragic and unjust in the extreme,'' Appellate Division Judge Sylvia
B. Pressler wrote. ''If he is guilty, he can be regarded as having
served his time. Another trial in all these circumstances is not
likely to serve the interests of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was paroled in 1998 but returned to prison after
failing a drug test.

<HEADLINE> Government rests tax case against Pirro  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Federal prosecutors wrapped up their
tax evasion case against Albert Pirro on Monday with more of the
stunning numbers that have defined the trial, including $1 million
in unreported income and a checking account overdraft that topped
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy Seibel methodically attacked the
defense team's cross-examination of an Internal Revenue Service
agent, then rested her case and fought off a motion to dismiss the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is scheduled to call its first witness on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS agent, John Dennehy, said that between 1992 and 1995
alone, Pirro, husband of Westchester District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro, had more than $1 million in unreported income, representing
38 percent of his intake. Most of it showed up as business
deductions instead of personal spending, thereby reducing his tax
payment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where did the money go that didn't go to Uncle Sam?'' Seibel
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Into Mr. Pirro's pocket,'' Dennehy said.
</P>
<P>
   In his fifth day on the witness stand, Dennehy testified that 69
percent of all the American Express charges on Pirro's various
business and personal cards - nearly $300,000 - were for personal
items.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much did Al Pirro pay from his personal funds?'' Seibel
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zero,'' Dennehy said, testifying that it was all paid - and
deducted - by his businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hammering the point, Seibel asked, ''Who took the trips? ... Who
got the clothes from Barneys? ... Who went on the Cunard Lines?''
</P>
<P>
   It was Albert Pirro, his wife and their children, Dennehy said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, Pirro spent $61,059 on personal items at the
Westchester Country Club, but not a cent of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel brought out that Pirro had apparently ironclad overdraft
protection on his personal account, often going five figures into
the red and at least once into six figures; she displayed for the
jury a bank statement that showed a deficit of $100,313.66.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has claimed that Pirro often used business checks
for personal spending when he didn't have enough cash in his
account.
</P>
<P>
   Over defense objections, Dennehy said he believed that Pirro
would still be writing off his $123,000 Ferrari and his $45,000
home security gates as business expenses if he weren't under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Robert Giuffra suggested last week that the gates
were legitimate business expenses because they were needed for
Jeanine Pirro's security. Seibel brought out Monday - before
Giuffra objected - that the Pirros had bought a pool, awnings for
their home and several luxury cars between the time they first said
they needed security and the time they installed the gates.
</P>
<P>
   The defense did have some victories Monday:
</P>
<P>
   -Giuffra made the point that only about 5 percent of all the
business deductions taken by Pirro's companies were challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my book, being right 95 percent of the time, that's pretty
good,'' Giuffra said.
</P>
<P>
   -The IRS agent revised downward his figure on how much tax went
unpaid - $412,518 instead of $413,004.
</P>
<P>
   -And the judge refused to allow into evidence Albert Pirro's law
school transcript from 1974, which the prosecution hoped would show
that Pirro was not ''a layman'' when it came to understanding
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, asked outside court how he did in his tax law classes,
said, ''Obviously, not good enough.''

<HEADLINE> State orders reform expanded into poor middle, high schools  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It's hard enough to revamp an elementary
school from the ground up. Now urban superintendents face the
daunting task of instituting wholesale change in middle and high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education last week adopted new regulations
forcing New Jersey's 30 so-called special needs school districts to
scrap educational plans in their secondary schools and replace them
with new ones.
</P>
<P>
   State officials defend the new mandate as necessary to improve
the poor schools' failing academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   But local school officials and state critics say the poor
schools already have enough to do. They also say so-called whole
school reform in the higher grades has not been thoroughly
researched.
</P>
<P>
   The new mandate also runs afoul of a 1998 state Supreme Court
ruling that ordered changes only in elementary schools, critics
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is right, the new mandate is expected to usher in a new
way of thinking about education from pre-school to 12th grade in
the special needs schools.
</P>
<P>
   There are several models employing various methods under the
overall umbrella of whole school reform. For example, the state's
favored model for elementary schools, Success for All, stresses
small class sizes, intense tutoring in reading, staff retraining,
and innovative budgeting.
</P>
<P>
   Local school administrators, faculty and parents work together
to choose and implement a specific model for their school.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1998 ruling, the court ordered the special needs schools
to implement whole school reform in all elementary schools. It's
considered one of the most far reaching reform experiments in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court stopped short of requiring it in middle and
high schools, noting academic research was incomplete at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Education Commissioner Barbara Anderson said national
research has come far in two years. But she conceded that it is not
yet complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we believe more research needs to be done, we believe
it's important for the work at the elementary level to move
forward,'' she said. ''There are some promising models at the
secondary level.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As the research base broadens, we'll learn more about them,
about their strengths and weaknesses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants to be a step ahead of the research to prevent
any academic drop-off from occurring when elementary school
students graduate from their innovative programs to underperforming
middle schools, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But David Sciarra of the Education Law Center, which sued the
staff on behalf of poor school pupils, said it is premature for the
state to order such a massive retooling.
</P>
<P>
   Special needs middle and high schools must still implement a
menu of supplemental programs as well as rigorous curriculum
standards previously ordered by the court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no sense to add on yet another requirement,
particularly one on which there is absolutely no research produced
by the state showing its effectiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also quarreled with the state's timeline. Schools must submit
their reform proposals to the state by January 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giving schools only seven months to do this is ludicrous.
There's no time to research the programs, their own needs, develop
plans, get a buy-in from teachers, and gets parents on board,''
Sciarra said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the special needs school officials should not be
surprised. The state has been warning them for months that a
mandate was coming soon, she said. In fact, about one-third of the
100 secondary schools in the 30 poor districts have already
implemented some form of whole school reform on a voluntary basis,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two special needs superintendents, including one who
jump-started the state's mandate in his higher grades, were not
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whole school reform is a fiasco, a joke,'' said Ronald Larkin
of the New Brunswick school district.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the state rushes local schools into proposing
new programs, then delays approving them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is hurry up and wait,'' he said. ''It's delay,
underfund, delay, underfund. The frustration level is sky high.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said local officials chose a particular type of reform
because it was ''least disruptive and least harmful'' to the
students' routine.
</P>
<P>
   Millville Superintendent Larry Miller said he is dreading
expanding whole school reform into his upper grades, given the
state's record helping him institute it in the district's
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state ought to listen to the districts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Sorry for Nazi Harboring  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fulfilling a promise he made last month,
President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina said Monday a main focus
of his U.S. visit will be to seek forgiveness for his country's
role in providing sanctuary to Nazis following World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview an apology is appropriate because
''common Nazi criminals had found refuge in Argentina, and some
Jews were not given all the necessary facilities to emigrate to our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua will meet Tuesday with President Clinton and also will
carry his message of forgiveness to the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, where a ceremony is planned. In addition, he will meet
with Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to convey a message for the dignity and equality of all
human being and especially to Jews and all those who have suffered
persecution in Nazi Germany,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations welcomed de la Rua's remarks, but said they
wanted to see him take action to apprehend those who have committed
crimes against Jews and are still at large.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly it's welcome that de la Rua has reached out to the
Jewish community to acknowledge the harboring of the Nazi
criminal,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations. ''I hope fully this will
transfer into action to finding those who are alive and at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said: ''Going public about harboring war criminals is important. As
important as that is, it is really important to see when and if the
Argentine government can bring to justice those who perpetrated the
bombing of the Jewish community center and embassy. There still is
no closure on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires killed 29
people. Two years later, an attack on a Jewish community center in
the Argentine capital claimed 86 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires recently, de la Rua held a luncheon in honor of
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At a speech last month to mark the 57th anniversary of the April
19-May 16, 1943, Warsaw Uprising by Jews, de la Rua said Argentina
had to come to grips with its past, which included harboring wanted
Nazi war criminals for decades. Some may still be at large, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Israeli agents abducted Adolph Eichmann, a chief
architect of the Holocaust, from his hide-out in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, Argentine authorities arrested Dinko Sakic,
one-time commander at Croatia's Jasenovac concentration camp, who
had been living peacefully in Argentina. He was extradited to
Croatia, where last year he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine researchers reported in November 1998 that they had
found proof that former Argentine President Juan Peron encouraged
fleeing Nazi war criminals to seek asylum in his country after
World War II. Peron was president between 1945 and 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Israeli-based groups say that the number of Jews
purged during the anti-left campaign of the 1976-83 military
dictatorship was disproportionately high.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Jews who vanished during that period
range as high as 2,000, and Israel has asked the de la Rua
government to investigate. Argentina is home to about 300,000 Jews,
the second largest Jewish community in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua credited his democratic predecessors for significantly
improving the country's human rights record. He noted that his
immediate predecessor, Carlos Menem, ordered a full investigation
in 1992 into Argentina's role in sheltering Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   He said Argentina has come a long way from the period when
rights abuses occurred routinely.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, he said, ''there is a law against racism.''

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand, Boyd Gaming officials reiterate support for new casino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - MGM Grand Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp.
said Monday they remain committed to a $1 billion casino to be
built in the Marina District.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the companies, unveiling a scale model of the
$1 billion project, said they are making it bigger than originally
planned, too. The Borgata, most recently described as a 25-story
tower with 1,207 guest rooms, is now going to be a 40-story,
2,010-room casino hotel, Boyd Gaming CEO Robert Boughner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Borgata was to be a joint venture of Mirage Resorts Inc. and
Boyd Gaming. MGM, which bought Mirage Resorts Inc. last month,
remains committed to its share of the deal, CEO John Redmond said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A billion dollars? Ah, that's OK to start,'' said state Sen.
William Gormley, R-Atlantic, who attended unveiling ceremonies for
the model Monday at the Atlantic City Convention Center.

<HEADLINE> State urged to restore recycling funds after declining rates released </HEADLINE>
By Nina Rizzo
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Association of New Jersey Recyclers is
asking the state Legislature to restore a multimillion dollar fund
that rewarded towns for documenting how many bottles, cans and
newspapers were recycled.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after the state released figures that show New
Jersey's overall recycling rate has declined 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection reported that
the amount of waste recycled dropped from 61 percent to 55.5
percent between 1997 and 1998, the year for which the latest
figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a major jump backward,'' said Marie Kruzan, executive
director of the recycling association. ''I'm not looking forward to
the 1999 figure because I think it's going to be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   When the state enacted a mandatory recycling law in 1987, it
also created a $1.50-per-ton tax on waste disposal to support the
Recycling Tonnage Grant Program. The program had a $9 million fund,
on average, that municipal and county recycling coordinators could
tap into to supplement the cost of education campaigns and other
efforts. The amount of money each coordinator received was
dependent upon the number of recyclables documented.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very good carrot,'' said Kruzan. ''There was an
infrastructure in place to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax, however, lapsed in 1997 and the fund is expected to dry
up by the end of the year, said Guy Watson, chief of the DEP's
Office of Recycling and Planning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last year the tax was collected, the fund reached
$12 million. About 60 percent of that money went to municipalities
($5.4 million) and counties ($1.5 million). The rest was used for
state-funded recycling efforts, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Vineland recycling coordinator Barbara Panzino said that town
typically received about $75,000 from the fund. She is pushing for
restoration of the tax so Vineland can continue promote recycling,
buy new buckets and pay for code enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people do it because it's the right thing and others do
it because they have to,'' said Panzino. ''That's why we're seeing
the drop.''
</P>
<P>
   DEP spokesman Peter Page said the 1998 figures are incomplete
because more than 50 towns did not report recycling rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''When towns stopped getting grants, they stopped reporting
their numbers,'' said Page. ''Towns don't have the direct financial
incentives they had three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Alan Augustine, R-Union, introduced a bill in
January that would create a similar fund, but it has yet to be
considered by the Assembly Solid Waste Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine said the fund needs to be restored if the state wants
to maintain the highest recycling rate in the country, and meet
even more ambitious goals. The DEP wants to increase the state's
recycling rate from 60 percent to 65 percent by Dec. 31, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Solid Waste Committee chair, Assemblyman John
Rooney, R-Bergen, doesn't comprehend the importance of spending
money on recycling education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way I'm going to impose another tax,'' said Rooney,
who is also mayor of Northvale. ''If local officials can't get
people to recycle, shame on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my town we tell the garbage men to shake the bags. If they
hear bottles or cans or see newspapers, leave it there. That's the
best education program you can give to residents. It doesn't have
to happen twice,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Morris, who teaches the economics component of the recycling
coordinator certification course offered by Rutgers University,
said the fund helped New Jersey create a model program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have the most comprehensive program in the nation,''
said Morris. ''But for recyclers to have their message heard, they
need a statewide commitment of resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter if it's a Hershey bar or a Web site, if you
don't promote it you have to expect that awareness or participation
will decline.''

<HEADLINE> Diallo parents to attend Springsteen concert  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The parents of Amadou Diallo were to attend
Bruce Springsteen's concert at Madison Square Garden Monday to
thank him for writing a song about their son's death at the hands
of four police officers, a family friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo also will extend an invitation to
Springsteen to visit with the city's black community, said the
friend, who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Springsteen did not return repeated telephone
messages Monday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday starts Springsteen's 10-show run at the Garden. It was
unclear whether he would perform the song about Diallo, called
''American Skin (41 Shots).''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen introduced the new song last week during a concert
in Atlanta with his E Street Band. The song, which does not mention
Diallo by name, opens up with these words: ''41 shots, 41 shots.''
That's the number of bullets fired at Diallo by the officers on
Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old West African immigrant was mortally wounded as
he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx home when police mistook his
wallet for a weapon. The four officers involved in the shooting
were acquitted of murder earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The song's refrain contains the line: ''Is this your wallet? Is
this your life?'' At another point, Springsteen reportedly sings,
''You can get killed just for living in your American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents the
city's 27,000 police officers, has urged its members not to attend
or work overtime security detail at Springsteen's Garden concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Eric Adams, of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said his group supports Springsteen and is upset that few
black artists have used their talents to support the Diallo family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We commend Bruce Springsteen and we believe that he is
courageous in the position that he is taking,'' Adams said in a
news conference before the concert.

<HEADLINE> High court scheduled to rule on mall access  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court is scheduled to
release its decision Tuesday on whether political groups can have
unfettered access to shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a 1996 lawsuit filed after a Secaucus mall
required the Green Party of New Jersey to buy a $1 million
insurance policy before it could distribute leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party members contend that the insurance policy was
restrictive and its $665 price tag cost them their right to free
speech. A trial court agreed. But in August an appeals court said
mall owners were justified in requiring the insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the justices rule, their decision will have to do with
much more than just the case of the Green Party against mall owner
Hartz Mountain Industries, said lawyer Frank Askin, an attorney
with the Rutgers Law School Constitutional Litigation Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to do with the right of free speech at these ubiquitous
state shopping malls,'' said Askin, who argued the case for the
Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Mall at Mill Creek managers require every group that comes into
the mall to get the insurance policy, according to lawyer Curtis L.
Michael. But after the appellate ruling, mall managers have
developed several options, including a $250 permit, Michael told
the court during oral arguments in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that although shopping malls and
other similar marketplaces are privately owned, they can be
considered public forums, Askin said.
</P>
<P>
   In that earlier decision, the court said groups could use the
malls much as they would public places like town squares, Askin
said. The court also said the mall owners could make reasonable
requirements of the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case will now define what reasonable requirements are,''
Askin said.
</P>
<P>
   Askin said the opinion will be carefully read since it comes
from a court supervised by Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz and
several other justices, all appointed recently by Gov. Christie
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the first decision by the new Poritz court on a
significant issue of free speech under the state constitution,''
Askin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really will be the first indication of where this court is
going on these issues,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Attack Sierra Leone Town  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Pro-government troops said they
repelled a fierce rebel attack against a front-line town, and a
Sierra Leonean government militia handed over dozens of child
fighters to aid workers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting raged for three hours in Lunsar, about 45 miles
east of the capital, Lt. Edmond Bangura told journalists Monday.
The troops eventually drove the rebels off.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether there were any casualties. Bangura said
the soldiers and pro-government militiamen often fired on each
other and found it difficult to determine their own troops from the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters on both sides wear a hodgepodge of civilian clothing,
military uniforms and traditional garb that sometimes includes
charms, headbands and fetish necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was confusion everywhere,'' Bangura said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Vatican news agency MISNA cited local sources
as saying state helicopters ''intercepted'' a rebel contingent
nearly a week earlier at Kabata Junction, some five miles from the
government-held town of Port Loko. More than 100 rebels were killed
in the attack, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be independently confirmed. Government
officials, who are usually quick to take credit for battlefield
successes, said they were not aware of the alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsar was retaken by government forces twice last week, nearly
a month after the rebel Revolutionary United Front captured it. The
rebels reignited Sierra Leone's civil war in early May, kidnapping
U.N. troops and launching an offensive that at one point reportedly
came within 25 miles of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have killed tens of thousands of people and committed
countless other atrocities, including lopping off civilians' hands,
legs and other appendages.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Monday, the pro-government Civil Defense
Force, a militia of traditional hunters also known as the Kamajors,
handed over to aid workers 138 children -- mostly soldiers but also
girls and boys forced by rebels to become porters and sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The children, aged eight to 16, were taken into the militia's
custody in front-line towns like Lunsar, Civil Defense Force
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian U.N. peacekeepers escorted the children from the town
of Masiaka to a temporary tent camp in the government stronghold of
Waterloo, 10 miles from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   There they were being clothed, fed and interviewed to determine
whether to place them in camps for ex-child combatants or returned
to their families, UNICEF official Roisin de Burca said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young girls told journalists of being forced to
become ''wives,'' or sex slaves, of rebel leaders before escaping
or being captured in battles with the Civil Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
   Mariama Mansaray, 15, said she was held as a sex slave by the
rebels in various bush camps for four years before escaping about a
month ago and making her way by road to Masiaka.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to return to school,'' Mansaray said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Conteh, 16, said he had fought with an assault rifle for
years as a member of the Civil Defense Force, and had ''killed
anyone, whether RUF or civilians, if I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Another child fighter, 12-year-old Mohamed Kargbo, said he was
abducted from his family last June and accompanied the rebels on
raids in which they looted villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were rioters. Everything we could find, we took to the
bush,'' Kargbo said.

<HEADLINE> Manchester College Defends PC List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- Perhaps officials at Manchester's
Stockport College should change their mailing address to
Person-chester.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators in the northwest city have issued a list
of potentially offensive words and phrases that they urge staff and
students to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   A guidebook singles out the words ''history'' and ''man-made''
because of their gender implications, as well as the phrase
''slaving over a hot stove'' because of its reference to slavery.
It says ''crazy'' could offend a person with mental health
problems, and that ''ladies and gentlemen'' carries class
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, which
aims to improve state education standards, called the guidebook
''absolute nonsense,'' saying language should be dictated by
manners and not by an institutionally issued mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person who might be offended by the word history is a
radical feminist,'' he said. ''It is a word that has been used for
hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ''slaving over a hot stove'' was more likely to
evoke the image of a chef than a slave.
</P>
<P>
   But college spokesman Richard Tuson said the list was part of a
comprehensive equal opportunities policy, serving the same purpose
as wheelchair access and family-friendly schedules in making
everybody feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about political correctness. It is about
sensitivity and people's feelings,'' Tuson said.

<HEADLINE> Former parole commissioner indicted on perjury charges  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former state parole commissioner lied to a
grand jury investigating allegations that the office of Gov. George
Pataki sought the early release of violent felons in exchange for
campaign contributions, authorities charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-page indictment unsealed in Brooklyn federal court charges
the defendant, Leo Levy, with six counts of perjury and one count
of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 grand jury testimony, Levy admitted he violated his oath
of office by letting ''impermissible factors'' influence his
decision to parole armed robber John Kim, whose parents had
contributed to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a predisposition to consider the case favorably,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities allege Levy - an appointee of former Gov. Mario
Cuomo who left the parole board in 1998 - also sought to protect
himself and the Pataki administration by falsely accusing mid-level
bureaucrats of illicitly lobbying for the release of Kim at a 1996
hearing. Records show one of those bureaucrats was never there.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 57, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, was
expected to surrender later this week. His attorney, Brian Mumford,
did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment stems from an ongoing grand jury investigation of
possible corruption at the state Board of Parole.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two other parole officials have been convicted of lying
to investigators. A Republican fundraiser, Yung Soo Yoo, also is
facing trial next month on charges he illegally solicited
contributions from members of the Korean-American community who had
children in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also has focused on a top Pataki aide, Patrick
Donohue. But no one close to the governor, including Donohue, his
campaign finance director, has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Mike McKeon had no comment on Monday. Said
Parole Department spokesman Tom Grant: ''We're confident that the
parole board handled this case in an appropriate matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators launched their probe after a Korean man
went to police claiming Donohue had failed to deliver on a
guarantee to free his son for $20,000 in donations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said they found documents indicating that at
Donohue's prompting, Pataki's New York City staff contacted parole
officials about three Korean-American inmates whose families made
sizable campaign contributions to the governor's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, parole official Sean McSherry led the three-member
parole panel - including Levy - that met with Kim, then 21, at an
upstate prison in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kim had served the minimum four years of a
4-to-12-year sentence for three armed robberies in Queens. The
board unanimously ordered Kim's release over the objections of
Queens prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Brooklyn jury found McSherry guilty of lying to the
grand jury. He was sentenced to two years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Second in All-Star Voting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chicago's Sammy Sosa passed major league
home-run leader Barry Bonds and moved into second place among NL
outfielders in voting for next month's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds, a 10-time All-Star for
Seattle before the Mariners dealt him in February, led NL
outfielders with 692,964 votes, followed by Sosa (544,915).
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, who has 25 home runs for San Francisco, was third with
531,297, followed by Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero (488,688) and St.
Louis' Jim Edmonds (479,765).
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza of the New York Mets was the leading vote-getter
with 819,839, more than three times as many as the No. 2 catcher,
Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall (229,913). Piazza, a seven-time
All-Star, has started the last six All-Star games for the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire of the Cardinals (671,738) led at first base, with
Atlanta's Andres Galarraga (345,789) second.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If Shaquille O'Neal keeps missing free
throws, he can expect to be fouled intentionally for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rule against it, and there won't be one any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not planning to rush out and enact some Hack-a-Shaq
antidote. We've been very slow to rush to make changes in our
game,'' NBA commissioner David Stern said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hack-a-Shaq strategy calls for intentionally fouling O'Neal
on every Los Angeles Lakers' possession late in games -- but not in
the final two minutes -- to put O'Neal on the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers used it in Game 2 of the Finals, sending
O'Neal to the line an NBA-record 39 times, and the Portland Trail
Blazers tried it in the Western Conference finals, forcing Shaq to
shoot 25 free throws in the fourth quarter of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers and Trail Blazers lost those games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't work,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it hasn't worked yet, Indiana coach Larry Bird has not
ruled out employing Hack-a-Shaq again if the circumstances call for
it. Ideally, the Pacers would hope for O'Neal to make about half
his foul shots, giving Indiana a chance to limit the Lakers to one
point per possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers then, in theory, could get two or three points per
possession and cut into a Lakers' lead. In Game 2, the Pacers got
within three -- but no closer -- by using the Hack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes of games, the strategy must be
abandoned because of the NBA rule that provides for one free throw
-- plus retaining possession of the ball -- if a foul is committed
against a player who does not have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our feeling is that it's a strategy that these two teams
employed, so far without great success, and for us to be running to
create some rule because of that doesn't seem logical,'' deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it became a commonplace thing, then we might have to look
at it. But when we met (last week) with competition committee and
the coaches, there was absolutely no discussion on the subject,''
Granik said. ''I don't see any point in addressing how we might fix
it until we reach a conclusion that it needs to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, a career 53 percent free throw shooter, went 3-for-13
from the line in Game 3 after going 18-for-39 in Game 2 and 1-for-6
in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   RULES CHANGES: The NBA plans to implement one significant rule
change for next season, reducing a team's timeouts from seven to
six.
</P>
<P>
   Teams currently are limited to four full timeouts in the fourth
quarter and three during the final two minutes. Those limits also
will be reduced by one.
</P>
<P>
   The change is aimed at preventing fourth quarters from lasting
too long, such as the 54-minute fourth quarter in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may take a while for the coaches to get used to,'' Granik
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change was approved last week by the competition
committee and is expected to be approved by the league's Board of
Governors in July.
</P>
<P>
   To placate the coaches, two other rules will be adjusted. Teams
will now be able to advance the ball to midcourt by calling a
20-second timeout after a made basket, and they will be able to
inbound into the backcourt instead of being limited to the
frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coaches were ready to give up a timeout, but they wanted
to make it a little easier to inbound the ball because that's often
when you need one of your timeouts,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MUSTN'T SEE TV: There won't be as many Saturday games on
national television next season. There were 10 this season with low
viewership numbers that dragged down the league's overall ratings --
21 percent during the regular season and 12 percent in the first
three rounds of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first two games of the Finals, national ratings are off
5 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This past year we had some problems in the regular season,''
Stern said. ''Those Saturday night games, I didn't know they were
on some nights. I forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need some more regular programming and we need less on
Saturdays. Outside of the playoffs, people don't associate NBA
basketball with late Saturday afternoons. It's a Sunday sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Current plans call for NBC to televise five Saturday night games
in succession next season, perhaps in late December or January.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NOT NAMED MNBA: Granik said the NBA's new minor league is
slated to begin play in November 2001, and will be called the
National Basketball Developmental League, or NBDL.
</P>
<P>
   Players must be 20 years old to play unless they were drafted by
an NBA team and then cut before reaching that age.
</P>
<P>
   The league will be centrally run, and teams will be placed in
cities with populations of 750,000 or less with arenas that seat
6,000-10,000 fans. There will be 8-10 teams in the first season,
all in cities located in somewhat close proximity to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll probably try to stay in one geographic region, but we're
not sure where yet,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG MUMBLE: Poking fun at O'Neal's low-volume voice, a
reporter at Monday's news conference mumbled unintelligibly into a
microphone pretending to ask O'Neal a question.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal took the bait and brought the house down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I DON'T TALK LIKE THIS. SORRY,'' he boomed into his own
microphone, drawing howls of appreciative laughter. ''Most of you
guys who've been watching me know I'm a smooth, mellow guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CYBERDAVE BITES TONGUE: In one of the day's biggest surprises,
Stern used the word ''Internet'' only twice during a nearly
hour-long news conference.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Joneses Switch Places  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Keeping up with their Joneses, the Mets are
sending Bobby J. (the right-hander) to the minors for 10 days and
bringing up Bobby M. (the left-hander).
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. is just 1-3 with a 10.19 ERA in 10 starts, allowing 38
runs and 50 hits in 32 2-3 innings. Because he has more than five
seasons of major league service, New York needed his permission to
option him to Triple-A Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Because of days off, the Mets don't need a fifth starter until
June 23 against Pittsburgh, and New York promised to bring back
Bobby J. to pitch that night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you have to swallow your pride and do what's best
for you and what's best for the organization,'' Bobby J. said.
''There have been a lot of restless times and sleepless nights
figuring out what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up seven runs and nine hits during 4 2-3 innings against
the Yankees in Saturday's 13-5 loss and hasn't made it past the
sixth inning all year. The roster moves are effective Tuesday,
before the Mets' game at the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I have a long way to go,'' Bobby J. said Monday.
''I think there is a significant difference between my first few
starts off the DL and the Yankees start. I thought I had pretty
good stuff in the Yankees game. Sometimes guys hit good pitches. A
couple of things go my way and it's a different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who struck out Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire in the
1997 All-Star game, has just one win since April 17, 1999, beating
Arizona on May 19, his first start after a stint on the disabled
list caused by a calf problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were off Monday and are scheduled to be off Thursday
and next Monday. For the next 10 days, they'll need just four
starters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the fact that I'm struggling like I have, I need to get
innings,'' Bobby J. said. ''It's not going to do me one bit of good
to go the bullpen and pitch every sixth or seventh day. I'm not
going to get straightened out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby M., acquired during the offseason from Colorado for Masato
Yoshii, becomes another left-hander in a bullpen that already
includes lefties John Franco, Dennis Cook and Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby M. is 6-3 with a 4.18 ERA in 12 starts for Norfolk,
allowing 35 runs and 70 hits in 75 1-3 innings. Mets general
manager Steve Phillips said New York wants to ''get a taste of what
he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said sending Bobby J. to Norfolk shouldn't be
interpreted as a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's for a finite period of time and an agreed upon period of
time,'' Phillips said. ''We're absolutely going to bring him back
to start the game on the 23rd.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. is confident he can bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't lost my mental edge,'' he said. ''When you go out
there doubting yourself, you're beat before you go out there, and
at that point, you go on to do other things.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets-Yankees' game at Shea Stadium on July 9 may be
moved from 1:10 p.m. to 8:05 p.m. so ESPN can televise it. Sunday's
rainout at Yankee Stadium could be made up as a day-night
doubleheader on July 8, with the day game at Shea Stadium and the
night game at Yankee Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Giles Gets $45M Contract  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Brian Giles might be the first $45 million
bargain in Pittsburgh Pirates history.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, who went into Monday night's game against Atlanta leading
the NL with 60 RBIs, will average $7.5 million a season under the
terms of $45 million, six-year contract he signed May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The contract's total value was reported previously, but not
Giles' per-year salary, which could jump, with incentives, to as
much as $9 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $45 million, $12.5 million will be deferred at 5 percent
interest until 2006, the year after the richest contract in the
Pirates' 113-year history expires.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' deal dwarfs the $24 million, four-year contract signed
last year by first baseman Kevin Young, previously the biggest in
club history.
</P>
<P>
   However, based on Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green's $84 million,
six-year contract and the $57 million, six-year million deal signed
recently by Cardinals outfielder Jim Edmonds, the contract could be
a bargain if Giles continues to produce as he has in his first 1{
Pirates seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly a platoon outfielder with Cleveland, Giles hit .315
with 39 homers and 115 RBIs before missing the final 11 games last
season with a fractured finger. He has been one of baseball's most
consistent hitters this season, batting .335 with 19 homers and 60
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' new contract replaces the deal he signed when he was with
Cleveland and was worth $1.75 million this season, $2.55 million in
2001 and a club-option year worth $3,625,000 in 2002. That contract
would have increased $200,000 per year in 2001 and 2002 with 600
plate appearances the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   In his new contract, the 29-year-old Giles received an $8
million signing bonus, with $5.5 million deferred, and will make $3
million this season, with $1 million deferred.
</P>
<P>
   He will make $6 million in 2001 (with $2 million deferred), and
$7 million each in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (with $4 million of
his 2002 salary deferred).
</P>
<P>
   Giles' salaries would increase to:
</P>
<P>
   --$7.5 million in 2003 if he has been an All-Star in two of the
preceding three seasons, in 2004 if he has been an All-Star in two
preceding seasons; and in 2005 if he has been an All-Star in three
preceding seasons.
</P>
<P>
   --$8 million in 2003 for finishing in the top 10 in the NL MVP
voting in any preceding season or in the top 15 in any two
preceding seasons; or in 2004 for finishing the top 15 in the MVP
voting in two preceding seasons.
</P>
<P>
   --$8.5 million in 2004 for finishing in the top 10 in the MVP
voting in two preceding seasons; or in 2005 for finishing in the
top 15 in the MVP voting in three preceding seasons.
</P>
<P>
   --$9 million in 2005 for finishing in the top 10 in the MVP
voting in three preceding seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Giles also has a limited trade clause that allows him to
designate six teams each year he can be traded to.
</P>
<P>
   By deferring $12.5 million, Giles put the Pirates in a better
position to re-sign key players such as catcher Jason Kendall,
whose contract runs through 2001, and pitcher Todd Ritchie, a
15-game winner last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie recently signed a $5.25 million, two-year extension that
runs through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big thing for me was to structure the deal so we can sign
Jason Kendall and Todd Ritchie, guys who are going to need new
deals,'' Giles said. ''This team needs to keep guys we can win
with.''

<HEADLINE> White House: GOP Drug Plan Flawed  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Older Americans who live in rural areas
already have to travel too far and pay too much for prescription
drugs, a situation that would worsen under a Republican Medicare
overhaul proposal gaining ground in the House this week, the White
House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, President Clinton and fellow Democrats plan to
highlight difficulties faced by rural elderly people and promote
the White House plan for what Clinton calls universal prescription
drug coverage. House Republicans planned a press conference for the
same hour to detail their competing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans would cover the cost of prescription drugs for older
people and the disabled covered under the federal Medicare
insurance program. For most people, drugs are not covered unless
they buy additional insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over drug coverage has centered on the number of
people served and the costs of the competing programs.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart claimed Monday that
Republicans are merely searching for political cover by rushing to
vote on a half-baked plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is too important an issue to be done in the dead of night
or pushed through quickly, before there can be a real debate on
it,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claim the White House plan is too costly and that
it, too, is a political calculation designed to improve the
presidential chances of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans who live far from major cities are 60 percent
less likely to get the drugs they need, and they pay around 25
percent more for the medications, a study of Medicare recipients
released by the White House said. About 29 percent of rural elderly
spend more than 5 percent of their income on out-of-pocket
prescription drugs, compared to 21 percent of city-dwelling
seniors, the same study found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, rural Medicare recipients are 50 percent less
likely to have any coverage for the cost of prescription drugs, the
White House claims.
</P>
<P>
   Details were not available Monday night, but the White House
claimed the evolving GOP plan is a ruse, as it was likely to depend
in part in the cooperation of private insurance plans to provide
drug coverage. White House health care policy adviser Chris
Jennings said insurers aren't likely to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is hoping it will evolve into a policy the
president can support, and we can have a Democratic and Republican
consensus on this legislation,'' Jennings said.

<HEADLINE> Devils Move To Keep Cup Champions  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Lou Lamoriello pulled off three
trades Monday, ensuring that none of the key players that helped
the New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup will be lost in next
week's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils general manager also announced the team will have a
Cup celebration at the Continental Airlines Arena on Wednesday
night, and that he plans to resolve his own future with the
franchise soon in meetings with the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   That decision might also affect the future of Larry Robinson,
who took over as coach late in the season and guided the Devils to
an NHL championship.
</P>
<P>
   However, 48 hours after beating Dallas 2-1 in double overtime to
win the Cup for the second time in six seasons, Lamoriello was more
concerned with keeping the team together.
</P>
<P>
   That meant wheeling and dealing so the Devils could expose two
forwards and one defenseman to the expansion draft for the new
Columbus and Minnesota franchises.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils acquired right wing Steve Staios from Atlanta for a
ninth-round draft pick this year, and got right wing Ed Ward from
Anaheim for a seventh-round pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Staios and Ward were then left unprotected on the expansion list
the Devils had to submit to the NHL by 6 p.m. EDT Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more notable players New Jersey also left unprotected
were backup goalie Chris Terreri, defensemen Brad Bombardir and Ken
Sutton, and forwards Steve Kelly and Steve Brule. They were all on
the Devils' Stanley Cup roster.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who spent most of the year with Albany of the AHL, played
10 games in the postseason, but none in the finals. Brule and
Bombardir played in one playoff game, while Sutton and Terreri
didn't see any action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have kept this team intact and I feel good about some of
these things,'' Lamoriello said in a conference call about three
hours after the Devils took a team picture with the Stanley Cup,
then took time for group and family pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the picture was Devils tough guy Krzysztof Oliwa,
who missed the playoffs with a knee injury. Hours after the
picture, Lamoriello traded him to Columbus for a third-round pick
next year and future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa, who had career highs of six goals, 10 assists and 16
points in 69 games, led the Devils in penalty minutes the last
three seasons, including 184 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Owner John McMullen will complete the sale of the Devils to a
subsidiary of YankeeNets on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a big void,'' McMullen said after arriving
for the picture ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schiller, head of YankeeNets, said he wants Lamoriello
back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be done as soon as it possibly can,'' Lamoriello said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach with eight games
left in the regular season, has two more years left on his contract
as an assistant coach and two more as a consultant for the Devils.
He said he hasn't even thought about next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to relish what has gone on over the last couple of
months and not have to try to make decisions,'' said Robinson, who
admitted he was physically and mentally drained from the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson even said there was a possibility he might come back as
an assistant coach, although even he said that was just a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   As far as working for a George Steinbrenner-led group, Robinson
didn't know what to think.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new regime,'' Robinson said. ''With Dr. McMullen you
know what to expect. I don't know what the new people are going to
want. The fact we won, I think our chances are pretty good. But
this year has been an emotional rollercoaster for me, and I want to
make sure the decisions we make are the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as unrestricted free agents, right wing Claude Lemieux
said he would like to return and go for his fifth Stanley Cup,
provided the money was right and his role was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Sergei Nemchinov would also like to return, while
defenseman Vladimir Malakhov didn't indicate a preference.
</P>
<P>
   The players the Devils protected in the expansion draft were:
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Martin Brodeur; forwards Bobby Holik, Jason Arnott,
Alexander Mogilny, John Madden, Randy McKay, Petr Sykora, Patrik
Elias, Jay Pandolfo and Sergei Brylin; defensemen Scott Stevens,
Ken Daneyko, Scott Niedermayer, Colin White and Josef Boumedienne,
an unsigned draft pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup celebration will be the same as in 1995, staged around
the parking lot of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our fans know how to get here, and this is the place
and this is the proper place in life,'' McMullen said. ''It's been
our home and I don't know of any other place to have it.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Police End Bus Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police ended a four-hour standoff
Monday by storming a city bus and fatally wounding a man who had
held passengers at gunpoint, but one hostage died during the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear if the 20-year-old woman was killed
by police or the assailant. Globo television news showed the
assailant with his gun to the head of a female hostage as a special
tactics police approached and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   The man was wounded but still alive immediately after the police
stormed the bus. Crowds tried to attack him, but officers were able
to haul him away in a van.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant had boarded the bus hours earlier. During the
standoff, he fired his gun and threatened to kill his eight
hostages unless given money and grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was horrible, horrible. I had to give him my money for him
not to kill me in the back seat,'' one hostage told Globo
television through a bus window after the police raid.
</P>
<P>
   The man was a robbery suspect, and police were following him
when he tried to escape by boarding the bus, according to reports.
Police blocked the bus's progress on a main road in Rio's upscale
Jardim Botanico district, next to the city's famous botanical
gardens, and the tense standoff ensued.
</P>
<P>
   As TV networks broadcast the standoff live, the man put the gun
in passengers' mouths and threatened to shoot. He fired out the
window and told one woman to lie down, then fired at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   According to initial reports the 17-year-old passenger who had
been told to lie down was killed or injured, but police later said
she was unharmed. Earlier, she had been forced to write in lipstick
on the window: ''He has a pact with the devil and showed me his arm
with the devil and a dagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranting and gesturing, the man reportedly demanded two grenades
and $550. He allowed three passengers to leave, but several women
still were visible through the bus windows.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he stuck his head out the window and shouted:
''I'll blow her head off. This is not a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the crisis, the suspect ordered the hostages
to the back of the bus, where he apparently threatened to kill
them. Police stormed the bus soon afterward.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Schmidt on DL  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Schmidt, expected to be the Pittsburgh
Pirates' No. 1 starter this season but only a two-game winner so
far, was placed on the disabled list Monday with more shoulder
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt spent two weeks on the disabled list in April with an
inflamed shoulder, an injury that had lingered since spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has not been especially effective since
returning from that layoff, allowing 45 hits and 25 earned runs in
34 1-3 innings in six starts while experiencing continued
discomfort in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Cam Bonifay said the problem is affecting ''the
command and control of his slider.''
</P>
<P>
   To replace Schmidt, right-hander Bronson Arroyo was recalled
from Triple-A Nashville and was scheduled to start Tuesday night
against Atlanta, his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Schmidt -- the Pirates' key acquisition in the Denny
Neagle trade in 1996 -- is 2-5 with a 5.40 ERA and 41 walks in 63
1-3 innings after going 13-11 with a 4.19 ERA last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the pain in Schmidt's shoulder has persisted almost
since the start of spring training, it is possible this stay on the
disabled list could be an extended one.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Schmidt is to be examined Wednesday in
Birmingham, Ala., by Dr. James Andrews, who has operated on
numerous pro athletes. Andrews specializes in reconstructive
surgery, and it is doubtful he would be examining Schmidt unless
there were concerns Schmidt's injury might be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get a total checkup from him,'' Schmidt said Monday.
''He's the best in the business. I want him to look at it and see
what he thinks. I want to find out what is wrong once and for
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's injury came just when the Pirates' starting pitching
seemed to be settling down after being uneven all season. Kris
Benson has made a succession of strong starts despite having only a
4-5 record, and Todd Ritchie has lost just twice in seven starts
since late April.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Arroyo has been the Pirates' most successful
minor league starter the last two seasons, going 15-4 at Double-A
Altoona and 0-2 at Nashville last season and 7-2 with a 3.86 ERA in
12 starts with the Sounds this season.
</P>
<P>
   A control pitcher, he usually does not throw more than 90 or 91
miles per hour, but walked a relatively low 58 in 153 innings in
Double-A last season. He has a 56-30 career minor league record
after being drafted in the third round of the 1995 June draft from
Hernando High School in Brooksville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo will be the 20th pitcher used this season by the Pirates,
including catcher Keith Osik, who pitched one inning in a blowout
loss to St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> State agrees to tentative contract with a law enforcement union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state has agreed to a tentative contract
with a law enforcement union that includes a series of raises of at
least 3 percent a year, state officials announced Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative contract with Council 82 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees must still be
approved by the rank and file. The employees have worked without a
contract since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a 3-percent raise retroactive to October,
another 3 percent retroactive to April, 3.5 percent more in April
2001, and 3.5 percent more in April 2002, according to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for a $500 signing bonus and increases
in co-payments for office visits and prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fair contract that demonstrates our respect for the
important job that members of Council 82 perform for the taxpayers
of New York,'' said Governor George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Council 82 represents security officers on State University of
New York campuses, forest rangers, life guards and other personnel.
It covers workers in the state departments of correctional
services, mental health, mental retardation and development
disabilities, SUNY, environmental conservation and parks and
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   The union was usurped by New York State Correctional Officers
and Police Benevolent Association in 1999 as the bargaining unit
for state prison corrections officers.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Kim Leaves For Summit  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Vowing to push for an end to the Cold
War on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
flew to North Korea Tuesday for a historic summit -- an event that
offers the greatest hope for peace on the divided peninsula in more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under sunny skies, Kim Dae-jung left in a presidential jet from
a military airport on the outskirts of Seoul after shaking hands
with well-wishers waving South Korean flags. A children's choir
sang a ballad popular in both Koreas: ''Our wish is unification.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wholeheartedly hope that my trip to Pyongyang will be on a
path toward peace and reconciliation,'' Kim said in a departure
speech. ''I hope that it will be a turning point in efforts to
remove threats to war and terminate the Cold War on the Korean
Peninsula so that all 70 million Korean people in the South and
North can live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, hundreds of children, government workers and elderly
people cut off from their families in North Korea clapped and waved
national flags made of paper as the president's black limousine
passed on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the summit will lead to a durable peace,'' said Kim
Doo-shik, a 75-year-old man who has been separated from his family
in the North since Korea's liberation from Japanese colonizers in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-day summit, Kim Dae-jung is expected to appeal
to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to agree to reunions of
separated families, a summit sequel in Seoul and other conciliatory
gestures in exchange for economic resources from the South. Though
endowed with long-range missile capabilities, North Korea was
unable to feed its own people in the late 1990s and today is
reliant on food aid from its traditional foes: South Korea, Japan
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification, the stated goal of both nations, is likely to be
a lengthy and difficult process. The first summit between leaders
of East Germany and West Germany was held in 1970, two decades
before the dismantling of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of South Korea and North Korea have never met since the
two countries were founded in 1948 in the Cold War's infancy, and
the conflict between two populations that speak the same language
and the same ethnic roots has been bitter and bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Animosity and suspicion remain fresh a half-century after the
communist North, backed by the Soviet Union and joined by Chinese
troops, fought the pro-Western South and its U.S.-led allies.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950-53 Korean War left up to 5 million people dead, injured
or missing. Its legacy lingers most vividly at the Demilitarized
Zone, a buffer area that separates hundreds of thousands of troops,
tanks and artillery pieces on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, concerns over the North's purported nuclear weapons
program nearly triggered a military conflict. And North Korea's
totalitarian government -- based on a personality cult that
virtually deifies Kim Jong Il and his late father and national
founder, Kim Il Sung -- had been reclusive for so long that
reconciliation seemed a doubtful dream.
</P>
<P>
   Yet driven partly by desperation for economic aid to rebuild its
dilapidated economy, the North embarked on a new course over the
last year, seeking diplomatic contacts with the outside world that
culminated in the decision to host an inter-Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from 1968, when relations were so bad that a
North Korean commando team infiltrated Seoul and attacked the Blue
House.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory mood now is such that The Korea Times, an
English-language daily, compared the summit to the 1969 landing of
a man on the moon. ''One small step for reconciliation, one giant
leap for reunification,'' the newspaper declared.
</P>
<P>
   Korea's leaders have a host of touchy issues to resolve, among
them North Korea's missile and nuclear programs and the 37,000 U.S.
troops deployed in South Korea. Their role has been to deter the
North, which is believed to have stockpiles of chemical weapons and
one of the world's largest standing armies.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is hosting the summit in the mysterious style that
it has often employed over the years. It delayed the meeting for a
day without a clear explanation and has refused to announce the
schedule, possibly out of concern for the security of Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The summit pairs two men whose careers reflect the political
gulf that separates democratic South Korea and communist North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As an opposition leader, South Korea's Kim was jailed, sentenced
to death and, he says, the target of four assassination attempts.
He won election to the nation's top office on his fourth attempt,
and he has received international accolades as a defender of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The North's Kim, on the other hand, was reared from childhood to
succeed his father as head of a totalitarian state and heir to a
personality cult that lends him mythical status. He rarely appears
in public, and he is suspected of masterminding terrorist attacks
on South Korean targets, including the 1987 mid-air bombing of a
Korean Air plane that killed all 115 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims planned to meet Tuesday and on at least one other
occasion, and their governments have agreed not to use national
flags and anthems to avoid political or ideological frictions.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea barred foreign reporters from attending the summit,
allowing only 50 South Korean journalists to join President Kim's
entourage.

<HEADLINE> Fire destroys old records, knocks out phone system in municipal building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TENAFLY, N.J. (AP) - A fire in a storage room of Tenafly's
police, fire and municipal building destroyed years of old records
and knocked out the building's phone system Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A police dispatcher - the only person in the building - saw
smoke coming out of a ventilation shaft at about 3 a.m. and called
Cresskill's fire department because the building's electricity and
paging system had failed, Capt. Wayne Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The borough's volunteer fire department houses its equipment in
the same building that holds its government offices and 29-member
police force.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the building's attic was declared under control
within an hour, but borough records that may have gone back 100
years were destroyed, including construction histories on
buildings, Health Department records and information on historical
buildings in town, Mayor Ann Moscovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   She said state officials will be coming there to decipher
exactly what's missing, but ''a lot of it looks as if it's pretty
well charred.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials believe a severe storm Sunday night caused either
a lightning strike or an electrical outage which led to the
building fire, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of telephone service forced police to route 911 calls
through Cresskill and communicate with each other through police
radio. Bergen County Police sent over a van with compatible police
radios, and dispatch operations were relocated in a trailer,
Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone service in the borough administration building was
expected to be restored by Tuesday, but Morrison said police
telecommunications service would take longer to fix.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at about a several months disruption of
service,'' Morrison said. ''We'll be working out of a trailer for
some time.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Colonels Offer To Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Nine military leaders of an insurrection
that prompted the overthrow of President Jamil Mahuad offered to
resign their posts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Army Col. Lucio Gutierrez said he made the decision, along with
six officers and two enlisted men, as ''a contribution to peace for
all Ecuadoreans.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with hundreds of Indians, Gutierrez led a cadre of
soldiers, mostly midlevel officers, in the Jan. 21, takeover of the
Congress building.
</P>
<P>
   Their declaration of a ''Parliament of the People'' to fight
corruption and end poverty prompted top military leaders to force
Mahuad from power.
</P>
<P>
   After recognizing a short-lived junta, the military high command
ceded control to Gustavo Noboa, the democratically elected vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Military court proceedings were halted after Congress approved
Noboa's request to grant amnesty to the Indian and military
insurrectionists in the name of national reconciliation. But the
amnesty, approved May 31, did not rule out disciplinary action by
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Hugo Unda said last week that military
ringleaders in the uprising would be asked to resign voluntarily,
or would face forced discharge under military regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of Gutierrez's followers have said they will go to
court to fight efforts to oust them from the military ranks. Dozens
of other members of the armed forces face lesser disciplinary
action for their part in Mahuad's unconstitutional overthrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Clark Renner spent the past four
years working with players like Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Tom
Watson and Paul Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   This week in the U.S. Open, he'll be playing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Renner, who played the Australasian and Canadian tours but never
made it to the big leagues, finally left the golf circuit in 1995
and became a custom club-fitter for Callaway Golf. But the desire
to play competitive golf stayed with him, and he quit Callaway six
weeks ago to give it one more try.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   He played two mini-tour events in San Diego right after he left
Callaway and won both. He also advanced through both stages of U.S.
Open qualifying, and will tee it up in the 100th Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was working with the best players in the world, learning
about equipment and learning about myself,'' Renner said. ''I was
able to objectively look at my weaknesses over a four-year period
and made a lot of improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to be 40 and say, 'Your best golf was in your 30s
and you didn't try.' I'll be 35 in two weeks and I've never played
better.''
</P>
<P>
   After this week, Renner plans to play more mini-tours until PGA
Tour qualifying school later this year. He has never made it in
three previous attempts.
</P>
<P>
   As for this week?
</P>
<P>
   He played another mini-tour event this past weekend and won, so
who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning breeds winning, and I've been shooting good scores to
do it,'' Renner said. ''That gave me confidence that I could go on
and get better. I've learned how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Renner played Pebble Beach was in 1981, when he
was a 15-year-old member of the Torrey Pines High School team that
won the state championship.
</P>
<P>
   He has been back plenty of times since. Renner would come to
Pebble Beach every November as part of the Callaway Invitational.
Of course, he was fitting players with drivers, not hitting the
clubs himself.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TAKE A DEEP BREATH: Jack Nicklaus says he hasn't caught any
grief for his admission in Golf Digest that he once tried marijuana
-- except from wife Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who tells you the truth probably tried it at some time
in their life,'' Nicklaus said after a practice round Monday.
''What's the big deal about it? I don't ever lie about something if
I can avoid lying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview for the July issue of the magazine, Nicklaus
said he was having dinner with a college buddy some 30 years ago
when his friend asked if he could light up a joint.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never had a puff of the stuff, so I said, 'Let me have a
puff.' I felt terrible, man,'' Nicklaus said. ''I never want to
touch that stuff. If my kids ask me, I tell them, 'Man, it was
terrible.' That's what it was.''
</P>

<P>
   GOGEL'S RETURN: The last time Matt Gogel played at Pebble
Beach, he was on his way to an apparent victory in his fourth PGA
Tour event. Then, he became another victim of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods rallied from seven shots down over the final seven holes
to overtake Gogel at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February.
The PGA Tour rookie finished two shots back, in a tie for second
with Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not Tiger Woods,'' Gogel said after a practice round
Monday. ''I can't put unrealistic expectations on myself. But if I
put the ball in the fairway, with the way I putt, I can play very
well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, 29, earned his card this year after near-misses the last
two years on the Buy.com Tour. He has struggled since that
impressive showing at Pebble Beach, failing to make the cut in
eight of 12 tournaments and finishing no higher than 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to learn along the way,'' he said. ''I don't want
to put a lot of pressure on myself. By the same token, I haven't
played all that well since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel realizes that the course plays much different in June than
it does in February. Also, the stakes are much higher this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jack Nicklaus is here. Tom Watson is here. Tiger Woods is
here, and he's having a phenomenal year,'' Gogel said. ''All the
stars are playing great. It's the 100th year of the Open. You can
just tell it's a phenomenal event.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PEBBLE RULES: The USGA's new ''pebble'' rule will not be in
effect at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA aligned itself with the Royal &AMP; Ancient this year by
saying courses can adopt a local rule on loose impediments in
bunkers. Prior to this change, if a small stone was directly behind
a ball in a bunker, a player could not move it.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be the case this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's for golf courses that has problems with the sand,''
said Tom Meeks, director of rules and competition for the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIES OF '82: Jack Nicklaus is feeling a little better
about his loss in the 1982 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   During a practice round Monday, Tom Watson pulled the Golden
Bear aside at No. 17, showing him the spot where Watson made his
famous chip from the rough for a clinching birdie 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't quite sure where I chipped it in from,'' Watson
said. ''When I told him, that made a difference. It wasn't quite as
tough as he thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that shot, Nicklaus appeared headed for a playoff and a
chance at winning an unprecedented fifth Open. He has never come as
close to winning as he did that day at Pebble Beach, but at least
Nicklaus now realizes it wasn't an impossible shot that beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It eased the pain a little bit,'' Watson said. ''It's not as
tough to take after 18 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nicklaus, he always goes into the U.S. Open thinking he
has a chance to win. Even at age 60.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not playing very well,'' he said. ''But I always believe
somewhere deep down inside of me that I can do it. Sure.''

<HEADLINE> Self-appointed freshness police sues supermarket chain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) - A couple years ago a supermarket chain
guaranteed its products' freshness and put their money where their
vow was.
</P>
<P>
   So five local men started cruising ShopRite stores in search of
items where the expiration date expired.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're saying they have a freshness guarantee,'' said
68-year-old John Pizza, a retired salesman turned un-fresh prince.
''We said, 'Well, let's see how fresh it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   He and four other men hit ShopRite stores throughout Orange
County. They say they found expired food every time - sometimes as
many as 40 items.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes ShopRite would pay the $1 bounty. Sometimes Pizza said
they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now he and the other un-freshmen have filed suit against
ShopRite's owners, Big V supermarkets, and the parent company,
Wakefern Food Corporation. Pizza, Michael Catanzaro, Ray Bowley,
Jeffrey Burfeindt, and Henry Williams claim ShopRite attempted to
defraud the public with its freshness claim and should pay them $5
million, according to the Middletown Times Herald-Record.
</P>
<P>
   ShopRite rejects the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do believe the claims are without merit and we'll prevail
in court,'' said Alan Lewis, Big V's lawyer. He said he couldn't
discuss the details of the case because it's in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefern's spokeswoman, Karen Meleta, said, ''Big V and Wakefern
believe there is no basis to the claim.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What they're doing is consumer fraud,'' Pizza said. ''They're
endangering the public with these expired foods.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has about 50 food items - from salmon to cottage
cheese - that he will bring into court if the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza and his posse are representing themselves because lawyers
cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that it's not illegal to sell most food past
its expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wouldn't be breaking any laws,'' said Pete Gregg, the
spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture and Markets, the
state agency that monitors supermarkets. Expiration dates are
''voluntarily imposed by the industry,'' he said. He noted, too,
that ShopRite has a good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Expiration dates do not impact on safety,'' said Jill
Hollingsworth of the national Food Marketing Institute.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made On Nazi Compenstation  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and German negotiators moved one step
closer Monday to setting up a plan for compensating Nazi-era slave
laborers and protecting German companies from further lawsuits by
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-hour negotiating session, they agreed on what had been a
major sticking point -- wording of the statement the U.S. government
will submit to courts to discourage the hearing of further suits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very pleased that a major hurdle ... has been overcome,''
President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we are on the verge of a historic agreement,'' Deputy
Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat, chief U.S. negotiator, said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   German industry and the German government agreed last year to
set up a 10 billion mark ($5 billion) fund to compensate people
forced to work for little or no pay in support of Hitler's war
machine. In exchange, companies wanted protection from lawsuits
mounting in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the final agreement has been stalled because German business
leaders were dissatisfied with the ''statement of interest'' the
Clinton administration has offered to submit to U.S. courts
whenever such a case is filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, we have got it,'' the German envoy to the talks, Otto
Lambsdorff, said at the news conference with Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
   He said it did not provide ''100 percent guarantee'' against
future lawsuits. ''But we have come as close as possible under ...
the legal system of the United States courts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff said he would take it back to Germany with a
recommendation that it be accepted and passed by Parliament into a
law setting up the so-called German Foundation Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Gentz, chairman of the German industry fund and chief
financial officer of DaimlerChrysler, agreed and said he would use
it to press more German companies to contribute to the fund. Some
2,000 companies have pledged money, but it doesn't come near to the
$2.5 billion need for industry's share of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies had said it was pointless to contribute unless
there was a promise they would be free of lawsuits in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it takes out the uncertainty,'' Gentz said of the
document agreed to Monday. ''It will strengthen our argument to win
new participants.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, with contributions from German industry and
government is to pay an estimated 2 million former laborers --
mostly Central and Eastern Europeans -- as well as people on whom
medical experiments were performed and some with other
Holocaust-related claims.

Chinese Migrants Riot at British Columbia Jail
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Dozens of Chinese migrants
smashed windows and set fires Monday at the detention facility
where they've been held since arriving illegally in Canada last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Green, a British Columbia Corrections spokesman, said 49
migrants housed in three dormitories at the Alouette River
Correctional Center in Maple Ridge began to riot around 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have sort of an ongoing series of disturbances there,''
Green said. Migrants ''began to smash windows and break toilets and
light small fires.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 82 migrants being housed at the Maple Ridge facility east
of Vancouver, 49 are believed to be participating in the riot.
</P>
<P>
   He said the riot seemed mainly due to the repatriation of other
Chinese migrants who were among the 600 that arrived last summer
aboard four decrepit cargo ships.

Chretien Questions Provincial Medicare Claims
</P>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- As far as Prime Minister Jean Chretien
is concerned, Ottawa has already restored all the money chopped
from medicare five years ago and need not cough up another $4.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We argue that the restoration has been done,'' he said Monday
after an hour-long meeting with Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, where
health care was one of the main topics on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you include all the transfers there's $2 billion more
going to the provinces this year than 93-94.''
</P>
<P>
   The premiers made another plea last week for full restoration of
the money chopped from health care five years ago. They reject the
Liberal math and insist $4.2 billion is still owing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they calculated that medicare needs a $13-billion
injection over the next five years to keep pace with a growing and
aging population.

Quebec Cree Threaten Court Case Unless Referendum Bill Is Changed
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Cree of northern Quebec may challenge the
federal government's referendum bill in court unless it's amended
to guarantee aboriginal people a say in negotiations if the country
ever breaks up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all else fails and Bill C-20 comes into force, we certainly
will look at whatever resources we have,'' Ted Moses, grand chief
of the Cree, told a Senate committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might even consider a constitutional challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   His stand appeared to catch Phil Fontaine, national chief of the
Assembly of First Nations, by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Fontaine, in his own remarks to the committee, agreed the
legislation, which proposes tough federal ground rules for any
future referendum on Quebec separation, should be modified to meet
aboriginal concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But he shied away from talk of a court challenge.

New Federal Funding Designed To Improve Health in Rural Canada
</P>
<P>
   CHESTERVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Health Minister Allan Rock has
announced $130 million for projects intended to improve health
services and demonstrate new approaches to health care, especially
in rural Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But little if any of the money will go to address the shortage
of doctors and nurses in rural communities, which a Liberal task
force has identified as the top health concern of rural Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   In the report released Monday -- the same day Rock announced the
new funding -- the Liberal rural caucus recommends medical schools
across the country admit more students, especially from rural
areas, to address the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus, which conducted extensive public hearings,
recommends greater reliance on midwives, paramedics and nurse
practitioners, and more investment in rural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chunk of Rock's announced spending is $80 million
for
</P>
<P>
   converting patient records into digital form.

Family Income Rebounds in 1998 but Poverty Lingers
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Belts were tighter through most of the nasty '90s
but average family income hit a 10-year high in 1998, Statistics
Canada said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest yearly hike in a decade pushed the average
after-tax family income to $49,626 -- up 3.7 per cent from 1997
after adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   After-tax income is earnings plus government benefits such as
tax credits, minus income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 figure is the most recent available and indicates
brighter times ahead, say economists.
</P>
<P>
   It's just $819 higher than the pre-recession peak of $48,807 in
1989 and hardly cause to uncork the bubbly.

<HEADLINE> Oldest daughter testifies she found mother's body  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - The oldest daughter of a slain Florida woman
testified Monday she found her mother's body covered in blood after
returning home from school, and at first thought her mother was
playing a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was covered in blood. I could see that her throat was
slit. There was blood everywhere, everywhere,'' said Stevie
Bellush, the 16-year-old daughter of Sheila Bellush - the mother of
six who was found shot and stabbed to death in 1997. The murder
occurred in the family's Sarasota, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
   The teen Bellush was the first prosecution witness to testify
against her father, Allen Blackthorne, 45, who has been linked to
the murder of the elder Bellush, who had given birth to
quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   A two-count federal indictment charges Blackthorne, a South
Texas millionaire, with interstate conspiracy to commit murder for
hire, which carries a mandatory life sentence, and interstate
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio trial is expected to last three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Bellush said she was so convinced Bellush ''was playing a
trick on me'' that she hung up on an emergency service dispatcher
after calling 911 because she wanted to go back to reaffirm what
she had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatchers traced the call and rang the teen back.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother is dead,'' a sobbing Stevie Bellush was heard saying
on the 911 tape. She was 13 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered the 2-year-old quadruplets wearing their
lifejackets and crawling in their mother's blood. They were in
their lifejackets because there was a pool in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Bellush was composed during her testimony, but at one
point lowered her head and sobbed when she described the police and
ambulance arriving.
</P>
<P>
   She also testified that her parents were locked in a bitter
battle for about 10 years over custody of the two children from
Bellush's marriage to Blackthorne - Stevie and younger sister
Daryl. Stevie Bellush talked about how Blackthorne would describe
his hatred for Bellush and ''he said he wished she was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who referred to Blackthorne by his first name, also
talked about how her mother had strict rules, and as a youngster
she wanted to live with Blackthorne. At his house, she testified,
there were no rules, no bedtime and generous gifts of money and
presents.
</P>
<P>
   As she got older, the teen testified she understood how
Blackthorne has hurt her mother.
</P>
<P>
   After separating in 1987 and divorcing afterward, Stevie
Bellush, her sister and mother lived in church-sponsored housing.
Blackthorne frequently failed to provide child support, Stevie
Bellush testified.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bellush was working two jobs to make ends meet and
losing weight from undue stress, Stevie Bellush said. She and her
second husband, Jamie Bellush, moved to Florida from the San
Antonio area about six weeks before she was killed. He is the
father of the quads. The Bellush family now lives in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne was indicted by a federal grand jury in January. A
day later, a Bexar County grand jury returned state charges. The
federal case now underway is the first to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   A former golfing buddy of Blackthorne - already convicted of
solicitation of capital murder - said he was paid to arrange his
ex-wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   In opening statements Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Murphy said Blackthorne didn't like to lose and was embittered
because he did not have custody of his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne is expected to draw upon a wealth of financial
resources in his defense. His legal team reportedly prepped for
their day in court two years before Blackthorne was even indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rocha, 30, and Samuel Gonzales, 29, were convicted
previously of solicitation of capital murder in the case. Rocha
testified during his trial that Blackthorne, a golfing buddy, asked
him to arrange his ex-wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha said he enlisted the help of a friend, Gonzales, who
agreed to find someone willing to do the job for $4,000. Jose Luis
Del Toro Jr., 23, Gonzales' cousin, is accused of being the hit
man.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said Rocha, an accomplished amateur golfer, told him
the money for the hit, like the plan, came from Rocha's frequent
golf and gambling partner, Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, a former high school football star in Uvalde, spent 20
months in a Mexican jail after fleeing across the border. He was
extradited last July 12 to face a first-degree murder charge in
Sarasota. His trial is scheduled for next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales avoided a trial by pleading guilty to solicitation of
capital murder and agreeing to testify against Rocha. He was
sentenced to 19 years in prison. Rocha was sentenced to life.

<HEADLINE> State Farm to return $100 million on Florida car policies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Some 2.2 million Floridians who insure
their cars with State Farm will get dividends, the insurer said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The average dividend in Florida will be $45, said Tom Hagerty,
with the company's Winter Haven office.
</P>
<P>
   The total paid to Florida customers will be $100.3 million,
according to a release issue from State Farm's headquarters in
Bloomington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The dividends are being paid to all customers of State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. across the country except in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Policyholders who have a dividend of more than $10 will receive
a check and those with dividends of less than $10 will get a credit
on their next premium, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Payments will be made over the next six months starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dividends are a one-time return of premium paid after State Farm
enjoys better-than-expected financial results.

<HEADLINE> Judge says rules that shorten accident claim filing deadline are illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge declared Monday that new state
Insurance Department rules that shortened the time in which car
accident victims have to notify their insurance companies are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing rules that the Insurance Department enacted in
February, State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob said the
agency did not follow state law that sets procedures for changing
administrative regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules required that accident victims notify their
insurance companies within 30 days of an accident instead of the
previous time limit of 90 days. The change had established the
nation's shortest period for filing claims.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of lawyers and doctors around the state filed a lawsuit
in February in Manhattan's State Supreme Court to undo the new
regulations. They called the 30-day filing deadline ''brutally
short.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene De Santis, of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association,
said when the lawsuit was filed that the new filing rule ''requires
you to report the extent of injuries before you realize how badly
you've been hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule changes also would have affected the billing deadlines
for physicians, chiropractors and physical therapists, requiring
them to demand payment from insurers within 45 days instead of the
previous 80.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Insurance Association, which pushed for the
regulations, had said the new deadlines would help the group
prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Department defended the regulations by saying they
allow insurers to monitor medical treatment and protect consumers
by requiring insurers to consider why a claim was filed late.
</P>
<P>
   Gangel-Jacob, in a 22-page decision, declared the rule changes
''invalid as a matter of law,'' and their enactment ''unlawful,
arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   David Golomb, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers
Association, called the judge's ruling ''a resounding victory for
consumers'' against the insurance industry and the state Insurance
Department as well.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Marchon, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Department, said,
''We're disappointed in the court's decision and we plan to take
immediate action to appeal.''

<HEADLINE> La. St. 10, Southern California 4  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Louisiana State's Brad Cresse and his 30 home
runs and 105 RBIs were no problem for Southern California on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Hawpe was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hawpe, who hits cleanup behind Cresse, had two three-run homers
as LSU beat USC 10-4 in a winners' bracket game to snap the
Trojans' 16-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are one victory from advancing to the College World
Series championship for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an imposing presence,'' Hawpe said of Cresse. ''He's got
a lot of home runs and it's tough to hit behind those. I always
feel like I have to hit one every time he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Cresse was 0-for-3 with three strikeouts, but Hawpe more than
made up for it.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tigers trailing 3-0 in the sixth with just two hits off
USC starter Mark Prior (10-7), Hawpe drove a 1-0 pitch high over
the bleachers in right-center to tie it 3-all.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had thrown a lot of changeups to lefthanders. I just went
out there looking for it,'' Hawpe said. ''Sooner or later he was
bound to leave one up over the plate. He did and I got a hold of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU (50-17) has won 11 straight games and remains the only
unbeaten team in the postseason. In two CWS games the Tigers have
scored 23 runs and hit five home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Prior (10-7) took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. It was
broken up by Ryan Theriot, who scored three times and drove in
three runs for the Tigers, who have won four national titles in the
five times they have opened the CWS 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Hodges (4-2) allowed two runs and four hits in relief of
Ben Saxson, who left in the fourth inning with a blister on his
right middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Craig and Alberto Concepcion homered for the Trojans
(44-19), who committed four errors and used six pitchers, five in
the final three innings. USC will play Florida State, which beat
Texas 6-2 Monday night in an elimination game, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California, which has won 12 national titles, is no
stranger to the losers' bracket. In two previous trips under coach
Mike Gillespie, the Trojans lost their CWS openers but went on to
the national championship game both times. In 1998 USC lost to LSU
in the opener and had to beat the Tigers twice to advance to the
title game, which they won for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're in better shape than we were two years ago,''
said shortstop Seth Davidson, who had an RBI single for the
Trojans. ''By playing them today, we know what they're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   USC looked like it was headed for the winners' bracket and two
days off with a 3-0 lead through five innings on Craig's two-run
homer in the fourth and Davidson's single. But the hot, muggy
afternoon got to Prior in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 3-0 lead against a team that good, that's a long way from
being in control,'' Gillespie said. ''I wouldn't say that we were
relaxing or breathing easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Theriot broke up the no-hit bid with a one-out line-drive single
over third baseman Justin Gemoll's head. Theriot went to third on
Mike Fontenot's single to right and they both scored on Hawpe's
ninth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   LSU coach Skip Bertman noted Theriot's hit was what started the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got a curveball and got it over the third baseman's head.
That was a good thing for us because I heard some rumblings in the
dugout about how we didn't have a hit,'' Bertman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawpe hit another three-run shot in the eighth on a 1-1 pitch
from Pete Montrenes that also cleared the right field stands. Hawpe
hit both homers with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Theriot gave LSU a 4-3 lead in the seventh after the Trojans'
fourth error of the game. Ray Wright drew a one-out walk, then went
to third when Prior's pick-off attempt got past Concepcion and
bounced off the tarp into right field. Wright trotted in on
Theriot's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion homered to left to lead off the seventh.

<HEADLINE> First lady, House Whip share foster care award  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - They are about as odd a political couple as
there is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican House Whip
Tom DeLay shared an award Monday night honoring their work to
improve foster care. Typically at bitter odds with each other,
Clinton and DeLay heaped praise on each other Monday night as they
smiled and posed for pictures together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee you we are an example that children can bring
anybody together,'' DeLay quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's GOP rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, has questioned whether she
would be effective in working with Capitol Hill Republicans - many
of whom voted to impeach her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has cited her work with DeLay as evidence that
she can work in a bipartisan fashion. The Texas Republican is one
of the Clinton administration's fiercest critics and a leader in
the impeachment drive. He has also been a foster parent to three
children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday night called DeLay ''the whip of all whips''
on foster care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it came time to persuade people that this needed to be a
priority, he was there day in and day out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay noted that many people had referred to him and the first
lady as ''an odd couple.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I do not think it's at all odd that Americans of different
perspectives can come together to meet the solemn obligation our
nation has to those who cannot help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He added that did not mean he expected to be ''hanging around
the East Wing (of the White House) anytime soon ... reminiscing
about the good old days.''
</P>
<P>
   The award Monday night was given by the non-partisan Orphan
Foundation of America, formed to help older foster children
transition to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna, Va.-based group cited Clinton and DeLay's
longstanding commitment to children, specifically their work on two
key pieces of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Adoption and Safe Families Act that passed in 1997 broke
down barriers to adoption. Among other things, it provided
encouragement in the form of cash bonuses to states that increased
the number of adoptions from the foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   The Foster Care Reform Act that passed last year extended
benefits and other assistance for the 20,000 adolescents who ''age
out'' out of foster care each year at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us it isn't political. It's common sense to care about
these kids,'' Orphan Foundation of America Executive Director
Eileen McCaffrey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so non-partisan. In a television interview
Sunday, Lazio strategist Mike Murphy accused Clinton of ''trying to
create a record for herself in the middle of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   After the demise of her sweeping health care reform plan in
1994, Clinton largely retreated from public view but continued to
work on policy. Because that work was done behind the scenes it has
sometimes been difficult for her campaign to establish a specific
record of accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But at least some Republicans involved in the adoption
legislation recall the first lady's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's certainly been very supportive and used the bully pulpit
that she has to bring some needed attention to this,'' said Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md, who worked on last year's foster
care bill, recalled Clinton working the phones in the crucial days
leading up the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially on children's issues she has tremendous credibility
on both sides of the aisle,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Rhonda Mapp had 21 points and 15
rebounds, and Andrea Stinson added 21 points as the Charlotte Sting
won for the first time this season, 78-67 over the Detroit Shock on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After losing their final five regular-season games last year,
the Sting traveled to Detroit for a 60-54 playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   They started 0-5 this season, including 0-4 at home, but
improved to 8-3 against the Shock with Monday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte (1-5) also got 13 points from Dawn Staley, while
Detroit (2-3) was led by 16 points by Elena Tornikidou, and 12 each
from Astou Ndiaye-Diatta and Tamicha Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sting forward Charlotte Smith missed the game with a twisted
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock trailed by as many as 15 in the first half, and were
down 44-32 at intermission, but rallied to pull within 48-43 with
12:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting scored the next six points to move the margin back to
11, and still led 59-50 with just over six minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But two 3-pointers by little-used Anna DeForge keyed an 8-2 run
that got Detroit within 61-58 with 4:21 left. DeForge played a
total of five minutes in the Shock's first four games, and hadn't
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Staley answered with a 3-pointer, and after two Wendy Palmer
free throws, Mapp and Stinson hit back-to-back layups to increase
the lead to 68-60 with 2:26 left.

<HEADLINE> Florida St. 6, Texas 2  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Mike Ziegler pitched a five-hitter and Ryan
Barthelemy hit his fifth career College World Series home run
Monday night as Florida State staved off elimination with a 6-2
victory over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler retired 15 of the final 17 batters. He had sat down 13
consecutive Texas batters before Matt Rosenberg singled with one
out in the ninth. Two batters later, Tommy Nicholson doubled,
scoring Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson had two hits for the Longhorns (46-21).
</P>
<P>
   But Ziegler (10-4) got Ben Emond to fly out to end the game, his
11th fly ball out. The junior right-hander struck out five without
a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles face Southern California on Tuesday in another
elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler started and finished with a flurry. He retired nine of
the first 10 Longhorns before giving up a hit to Todd West in the
fourth inning. West scored three batters later on Chris Houser's
single.
</P>
<P>
   But Ziegler went right back to work.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down the next 12 Texas batters in order, giving him four
straight 1-2-3 innings. He had seven three-up, three-down innings
total.
</P>
<P>
   The game took 2 hours, 17 minutes, the fastest CWS game since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles (52-18) led off the game with three consecutive
hits, but only got one run out of the bases-loaded situation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Phil Seibel hit Karl Jernigan, scoring Chris
Smith. But then Seibel got Pichi Balet to ground into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   FSU added two runs in the fourth and one in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Seminoles got three straight hits. Mike Futrell's
single up the middle scored Jernigan, and Balet came home on a wild
pitch to put Florida State ahead 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   John-Ford Griffin hit a solo home run in the fifth, his ninth of
the season, to give the Seminoles a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel (5-2) was pulled in the sixth after giving up his only
walk of the game. He allowed eight hits and four runs and struck
out six.
</P>
<P>
   Barthelemy, who went 4-for-4 with two homers and three RBIs in
the 'Noles opening loss to Southern California, made it 6-1 in the
eighth with a two-run homer, his 13th of the season and fifth
all-time at Rosenblatt Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Workers Worry About Image  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY MASSEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Workers at Los Alamos National
Laboratory were concerned Monday about the lab's image following
the disappearance of nuclear secrets from a vault, the latest bad
news for the birthplace of the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's lousy. This has not been a good year,'' said Katherine
Norskog, who has worked for the lab for 15 years. ''Just everybody
is going, 'Oh no!'''
</P>
<P>
   Norskog said she worries that in the public's perception, this
would be another ''black eye'' for the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the two computer hard drives containing the nuclear
secrets is the latest distraction for lab workers. Last year, the
lab was at the center of a security controversy surrounding
allegations against a co-worker, scientist Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lee was charged with 59 counts of breaching lab
security. The prosecution contends Lee transferred 19 files from
secure to unsecured computers and downloaded some material to
computer tapes. Prosecutors have said the material included the top
secret ''crown jewels'' of American nuclear science, but the
defense disputes that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee, who was a nuclear physicist in the weapons section
of the lab, has not been charged with espionage, prosecutors
contend he intended to aid a foreign government. Lee, 60, who has
been in jail since December, has denied giving secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the entire laboratory was evacuated, as well as the
town of Los Alamos, when a prescribed burn by the National Park
Service raged out of control and burned down more than 200 homes
and some lab property, including research and historic buildings
from the Manhattan Project era. Workers were allowed back at the
lab beginning May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, and looking at my colleagues, we're distracted in
some way because we're trying to deal with all these things that
are going on,'' said Philip Thullen, the lab's program manager for
integrated safety management.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things all tie together,'' he said. ''We're dealing with
people who have emotions, who have thoughts and ideas.''

S. Korea Leader Arrives for Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- On a mission to end the Cold War on the Korean
Peninsula, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in North Korea on Tuesday
for a historic summit -- an event that offers the greatest hope for peace on the
divided peninsula in more than 50 years. The South Korean presidential jet
landed at Sunan airport near Pyongyang, the North's capital, after detouring
over the sea during the 70-minute trip from Seoul. There is no direct air travel
between Korea's capitals, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers are deployed on
both sides of the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, which separates the North and
South.

Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Missing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two computer hard drives containing an array of nuclear
secrets have disappeared from a highly secured vault at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, prompting a top-level investigation, laboratory and
Energy Department officials disclosed today. Energy Department officials first
learned that the nuclear secrets and other sensitive material were missing on
June 1 and have not ruled out the possibility that the disappearance is related
to the forest fire that threatened the lab and forced its evacuation last month.
Senior officials expressed doubt that it involved espionage.

Gov't To Compensate Nixon Estate
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Nixon's estate will receive an $18 million
compensation payment from the Justice Department for thousands of secretly
recorded tapes and presidential papers seized when he resigned in 1974. The
government said Nixon's estate at one point had sought $35 million plus 25 years
worth of interest, bringing the asking price to more than $200 million. The $18
million figure was reached in a settlement in U.S. District Court in Washington
over the value of items seized when Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment.

Court Nixes Some Lawsuits vs. HMOs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today shut down one legal avenue for
people to sue their health-maintenance organizations. The justices' unanimous
ruling said patients cannot use a federal law to sue HMOs for giving doctors a
financial incentive to cut treatment costs. Such lawsuits could mean the end of
HMOs, which are based on financial incentives, the court said. In another
ruling, the Supreme Court made it easier for employees to prove they were
victims of on-the-job discrimination, or at least get their accusations to a
jury, without direct evidence of intentional bias.

Soldier Suicides Are Rising

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soldier suicides are on the rise. In hopes of rallying his
troops to confront this sensitive issue, the Army chief of staff has issued an
unusually public -- and deliberately blunt -- call for commanders to take the
offensive. Statistics do not indicate any general increase in suicides for the
military as a whole, although the Army says its suicide rate has gone up the
past two years to one of the highest levels since the 1970s.

balloons. If prosecuted as a juvenile, he could be held only until he turns 21.

this week, Michael is to follow Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, another player the
Yankees want. Sosa, who feuded with Cubs manager Don Baylor last week before
proclaiming peace, has made it clear to Chicago that he wants a trade, three
baseball sources said today, all on the condition they not be identified.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn company recalled about 10,000 bags of
dried sweet potatoes Monday because the labels failed to mention
that the potatoes contained sulfites.
</P>
<P>
   People who are allergic to sulfites can become seriously ill or
die if they consume them. The sweet potatoes had been distributed
throughout New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Strong America Limited recalled its 7 ounce bags of STR Brand
Dried Sweet Potato after it was discovered that potatoes containing
sulfites were distributed in packages that did not indicate the
presence of sulfites.
</P>
<P>
   The dried sweet potatoes contained 41.96 milligrams of sulfites
per serving, according to the company. Ten milligrams can cause
severe reactions in some asthmatics and other allergic people.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who purchased the mislabeled sweet potatoes can return
them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 4, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Frank Castillo pitched seven strong innings and
Brad Fullmer had two hits, including a homer, as the Toronto Blue
Jays beat the Detroit Tigers 4-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo (2-5) allowed two runs on five hits in his first win
since May 2. Castillo, who allowed a career-high seven walks in a
start at Atlanta on June 6, walked none and struck out four against
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quantrill started the eighth for the Blue Jays, and was
followed by Pedro Borbon and Billy Koch. Koch got the final four
outs for his 13th save in 17 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo (2-6), who lost his third straight start, gave up
four runs on seven hits with eight strikeouts and one walk in 7 2-3
innings. Detroit scored just three runs in Nomo's two previous
starts -- a 2-0 loss to the Chicago Cubs and a 4-3 loss at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson hit a two-run homer for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez started Toronto's three-run third with a looping
double to left that Higginson just missed with a diving attempt.
Nomo walked Alberto Castillo, then threw a wild pitch allowing both
runners to move up.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart snapped out of an 0-for-10 slump with a two-run
double in the gap in right-center. Tony Batista's RBI grounder,
which glanced off the bag at third, scored Stewart for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer, 2-for-4, led off the fourth with his eighth homer and
first since May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz doubled leading off the Detroit sixth and rode home
on Higginson's two-out homer, his seventh, cutting the lead to
4-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Juan Gonzalez hit his 300th career double leading off the
Detroit second. ... Gonzalez made a spectacular play at shortstop
to prevent a run in the second. With two outs and a runner on
third, he went deep in the hole to his right to snare a grounder,
then leaped and threw in one motion to nip Juan Encarnacion at
first.

<HEADLINE> Gore notes 'irony' in pitching reform while raising campaign cash  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Al Gore promoted campaign finance reform at
a Democratic fund-raiser Monday, then hit the trail with Jon
Corzine, the Senate candidate whose $33 million primary bid is this
year's symbol of spending excess.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to Gore on a counter stool in a diner, Corzine
maintained an uneasy smile as the Democratic presidential contender
weighed in on the phenomenon of a candidate spending tens of
millions of his own dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's for the voters to decide,'' said Gore. ''There's no
campaign reform bill from any of the reform groups that I've seen
that would have an effect on an individual spending his or her own
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the problem is special-interest money in campaigns. He
added that Corzine, a New Jersey Democrat, ''will make a great
United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore spoke at a fund-raiser that brought in $400,000
for the Democratic National Committee - at least some of it in the
unregulated ''soft money'' that he says he will try to outlaw as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will leave Tuesday on a three-week ''progress and
prosperity tour'' to celebrate good economic times and claim at
least partial credit as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign ridiculed that as ''Al Gore's
I-Invented-Prosperity Tour.'' Spokesman Ari Fleischer said,
''Americans - not government - deserve credit for our nation's
prosperous times.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Gore participated in a 90-minute televised forum
sponsored by Oxygen, the new cable television network developed by
Oprah Winfrey and devoted to women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator was former White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl
Mills, who played a key role in President Clinton's impeachment
trial. Mills is now Oxygen's senior vice president of corporate
policy and public programing.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen promoted the event as: ''Al Gore gets in touch with his
feminine side.'' Facing a studio audience of 150 women, Gore
promised more money for special education, pledged his support for
affirmative action and said he does not believe enough doubts have
been raised about capital punishment to warrant a nationwide
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also detailed his support for a woman's right to an
abortion and added, for emphasis, that the next president is likely
to appoint enough justices to shape the Supreme Court for 30 to 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue in the forefront of this year's debate in
this presidential election,'' Gore said, ''and let me just state
clearly again: I support a woman's right to choose. My opponent
does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, much of the talk was about campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, worth an estimated $400 million, relied mostly on his
own money in the record-breaking spending that helped him win last
week's Democratic primary against former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Corzine said he shares Gore's support for
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said over and over again during this campaign that we
have to open up the airwaves,'' said Corzine, the former chairman
of Wall Street's Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ''When people sit down and
look at how we used the resources we had, it was buying media.
Media is very expensive, and if we had not done that, we would not
have been competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   At a late-morning fund-raiser at a private home on Long Island,
Gore acknowledged the irony in raising money and preaching reform
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ''If you entrust me with the presidency, the very
first bill I'll send to the Congress will be the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance reform bill, and then I want to go beyond that to
reform our electoral process and the way campaign money is
raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would outlaw soft money raised by
parties. Gore has also proposed creating a $7.1 billion ''Democracy
Endowment'' that would pay for campaigns of candidates who elect
not to accept any political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Previewing his prosperity trip, Gore told the 100 supporters
present, ''Instead of the biggest deficits we now have the biggest
surplus. Instead of a triple-dip recession we've seen a tripling of
the stock market. ... And officially as of two months ago, we now
have the longest economic expansion, the strongest economic
recovery and the healthiest economy in the entire 211-year history
of the American economy. That is a success story.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip begins Tuesday with a speech in New York City, then
an address in Pennsylvania on health care. Gore travels to Ohio on
Wednesday to discuss tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee suggested a better name for
his trip would be the ''Broken Promises Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said Congress and the nation's
governors share credit for prosperous times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the height of hypocrisy for the man who claims to have
invented the Internet to now claim he's invented prosperity,'' said
Pataki, who leads Texas Gov. George W. Bush's New York presidential
campaign effort.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Gunmen Ambush Police Truck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Gunmen ambushed a
group of police as they searched for bandits in southern Mexico on
Monday, killing seven people and injuring two, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Those killed were a state police commander, five state police
officers and a municipal policeman from the nearby mountain village
of Las Limas, about 90 miles north of here. Another police officer
and the son of the town's mayor were injured in the attack,
Attorney General Eduardo Montoya Lievano said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was traveling along a rural highway looking for
bandits responsible for numerous assaults in recent months, Lievano
said. The mayor's son was driving the truck, which was riddled with
more than 80 bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the area are sympathetic to Zapatista rebels in the
southern state of Chiapas. However Lievano said it appears the
Zapatista rebels were not involved and that the assailants were
common criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. A
partial accord was signed in 1996, but peace talks later broke
down. The Zapatistas have refused to resume negotiations, claiming
the government has failed to abide by the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, nine people were killed when the Army tried to
take control of the town of El Bosque, 2 miles) from Las Limas.
Police officers and Zapatista rebels were among the dead.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox-Yankees Postponed by Rain  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Yankees' second straight rainout only
delayed their matchup with Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   One night after their Subway Series showdown with the Mets was
postponed, the opener of New York's series with AL East rival
Boston was washed out at 9:29 p.m. Monday night -- more than two
hours after the scheduled starting time.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement pushed back Martinez's next start one day until
Wednesday, with Brian Rose (3-3) opposing Orlando Hernandez (6-4)
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do whatever they consider is right,'' Martinez said about
having an extra day between starts. ''I've done pretty well that
way in previous starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said he is still deciding whether to
go with former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens or Ramiro Mendoza against
Martinez on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which way Torre goes, Clemens and Martinez will
likely have a rematch of their May 28 duel -- won 2-0 by Martinez --
either this week of next Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done that before,'' a confident Martinez said. ''I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a thought that puts the Yankees at ease. No matter
what approach they try against the Cy Young winner, the results are
similar: making outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't make too many mistakes,'' shortstop Derek Jeter
said. ''He throws a lot of strikes. You look for one pitch and hope
you get a good swing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada employs a much more defensive approach, knowing
that Martinez can embarrass any hitter with any of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to go up there guessing against him, you're
going to go 0-for-4,'' he said. ''That's how good he is. You can't
look for one pitch because he throws all his pitches for strikes.
You try to hit the pitch he gives you. You have to hope he makes a
mistake and take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hasn't made many mistakes this year. He has a 0.95 ERA,
a .152 batting average by opposing batters -- both major league
bests -- and has allowed only two hits in 45 at-bats with runners in
scoring position. Martinez hasn't given up a homer with a man on
base since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pedro is the best,'' teammate Carl Everett said. ''He believes
in himself. Even when he doesn't have his best stuff, he's so good
he knows he can get you out. He's very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Martinez is, the Yankees said he's not unhittable.
They generated a couple of rallies against him in May, including
loading the bases in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to throw three strikes. If it's a strike, it's a pitch
you can hit,'' Jeter said. ''You can't fear him when you go up to
the plate. If you do that, you might as well not go up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has been at his best against the Yankees, going 5-0
with a 1.10 ERA in his career against New York, including a win in
last year's AL championship series. New York's projected lineup
against Martinez has a .175 career average with no homers and six
RBIs -- including the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is considered the expert on how to hit Martinez. He went
3-for-4 last time out -- although one hit was an opposite-field
blooper off his fists and another was a slow roller to third base
that he beat out -- and is 6-for-20 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not an expert. It's just more luck,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be just what the Yankees need if they are to finally
beat Martinez on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Monday's game will be made up Sept. 11 at 6:05 p.m. ...
There is still no makeup date set for Sunday's postponement against
the Mets, although the most likely date seems to be a day-night,
two-stadium doubleheader July 8 with an afternoon game at Shea
Stadium and a night game at Yankee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Merlakia Jones had 15 points to lead five
Cleveland players in double figures as the Eastern
Conference-leading Rockers beat the Indiana Fever 83-70 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Chastity Melvin had 14 points and eight rebounds, Vicki Hall
scored 12 points and Eva Nemcova and Mery Andrade each added 10
points for Cleveland (5-1), which extended its winning streak to
five games.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Wolters scored 17 points and Stephanie McCarty had 14 for
Indiana (2-4), which lost its third consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Melvin and the 5-9 Jones dominated inside as
Cleveland opened the second half with a 20-8 run over a
seven-minute stretch. That extended the Rockers' four-point
halftime lead to 58-42.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana used an 18-4 run early in the first half to go ahead
18-10, but Cleveland went on a 20-6 tear en route to the 38-34
halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Report: Expos Owner Eyes Investors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Expos lead controlling owner Jeffrey Loria could
bring in new investors if his local partners refuse to provide more
operating cash, the Montreal Gazette reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A contract signed last December between Loria and 15
Quebec-based shareholders outlines a formula to reduce the
partners' equity if they fail to provide the money Loria requests.
</P>
<P>
   Loria, a New York art dealer who owns 24 percent of the team,
says he needs more money to pay bills and field a winner. But the
local partners, who own 76 percent, have said they don't want to
inject additional money.
</P>
<P>
   Local owners include BCE, Canadian Pacific, Le Groupe Jean-Coutu
and the Montreal and western Quebec federation of credit unions.
They are expected to meet with Loria this week.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has led to speculation Loria might turn to American
investors and eventually attempt to move the Expos. Club bylaws
prohibit a move unless owners holding 70 percent of equity approve.
</P>
<P>
   Loria and the local partners have refused to comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The team's partnership agreement allows Loria to demand cash
from his partners any time he ''reasonably determines'' more money
is needed, the Gazette reported. The partners have up to 45 days to
respond.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 8, Indians 7  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- OK, the Chicago White Sox are for real. And get
this, there's finally a real race in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas hit a two-run homer and Ray Durham had three RBIs
Monday night as first-place Chicago opened a three-game lead over
Cleveland with an 8-7 win over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   If this was supposed to be Chicago's first test this season,
then the White Sox passed. They outhit, outpitched and outlasted
the Indians, the five-time defending division champs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got within 8-7 in the ninth on Jim Thome's home run,
but Keith Foulke got Sandy Alomar Jr. to hit into a game-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Eldred (7-2) pitched six effective innings for the White
Sox, who hadn't been in first place during a visit to Jacobs Field
since July 21, 1994. And the way Chicago is playing, it seems the
White Sox are enjoying the view from atop the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has won 10 of 12 and Monday began a stretch of 14 games
where it will play the Indians seven times, and the World Series
champion New York Yankees seven more.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Branyan homered twice, and Travis Fryman, Kenny Lofton
and Thome connected for the Indians, who have been in first place
just 17 days this season after being there for 360 of a possible
362 days the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Foulke got out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the ninth to
get his 15th save. Foulke gave up Thome's 16th homer and Enrique
Wilson followed with an infield single. Foulke then walked Branyan
and Richie Sexson to load the bases before getting Alomar to ground
into a double play to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Paul Rigdon (1-1) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 8-3, the Indians scored twice in the seventh and had
runners at second and third with none out.
</P>
<P>
   But reliever Bob Howry struck out David Justice and Thome before
getting Fryman on a tapper in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman argued that catcher Brook Fordyce fielded the ball in
foul territory and was ejected by plate umpire Chuck Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   Branyan's second homer -- and sixth in 19 at-bats this season --
brought the Indians within 8-6 in the eighth, and again Cleveland
had runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   But Howry retired Omar Vizquel on a fly to right and struck out
Roberto Alomar with runners at second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Durham's two-run double and Thomas' two-run homer gave the White
Sox a 4-2 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Thomas drove a 2-1 pitch from Rigdon 426 feet to
left for his eighth homer in 14 games and 16th this season, one
more than he had all last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman's 13th homer brought the Indians within 4-3 in the
fourth, but Durham put the White Sox back up by two in the fifth
with his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago added a run in the sixth on a double-play grounder and
went up 8-3 in the seventh on RBI singles by Thomas and Magglio
Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Thome walked to lead off the second and Branyan homered into
Chicago's bullpen in right.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago first baseman Paul Konerko killed a potentially big
inning for the Indians by fielding Lofton's hard smash to start a
3-6-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Howry hadn't allowed a run against the Indians in 13 2-3
career innings before Branyan's homer in the eighth. ... Thomas'
homer helped the White Sox tie a club record (1987) by homering in
their 16th straight game. It also tied Thomas with Hall of Famer
George Brett with 317 career homers, 76th on the career list. ...
Roberto Alomar's fiancee, French Open champion Mary Pierce, just
back from winning her title Saturday in Paris, attended the game.
... Alomar said he'll continue to play through the pain in his left
wrist as long as he can. He strained a tendon while making a check
swing in Chicago last month and has been told by doctors that it
will only get better with rest. Alomar, who has been reluctant to
get a cortisone shot, said ''nothing was going to keep me out of
this series.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Red Sox-Yankees:
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON: OF Carl Everett, still bitter about his tenure with the
Yankees, challenged their fans. ''They booed everything I did last
time here. That's fine. I just ask them to get more original stuff,
because I like to get involved and laugh. The fans here aren't
nearly as original as the ones in Fayetteville,'' he said. ... For
the second straight game, Jose Offerman started at first base and
Jeff Frye at second. ... Reliever Bryce Florie was scheduled to
make his first appearance for Double-A Trenton after making two
appearances for Single-A Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Some of the Yankees were intrigued by the possibility
of a day-night, two-stadium doubleheader next month against the
Mets. The most likely scenario being discussed to makeup Sunday's
rainout is to play two on July 8: an afternoon game at Shea Stadium
followed by a night game at Yankee Stadium. ''That's a first for
me,'' manager Joe Torre said. ''But it probably has to happen
because there's no other day we can play it.'' ... 2B Chuck
Knoblauch, out since last Sunday with a sore left forearm, was back
in the lineup hitting leadoff. ''It's the order we want. It's nice
to have him back in the lineup,'' Torre said. ... Next up for the
Yankees is Pedro Martinez, who shut them out May 28. ''You have to
assume that one of these days, we're going to get him,'' Jeter
said.
Athletics-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The Athletics have won seven road series this season,
tying their total for the entire 1999 season. ... The A's are using
their 55th different lineup in 63 games. Oakland entered Monday's
game last in batting average (.257) but first in runs scored (366).
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins acquired minor league RHP Mike Romano from
Toronto in exchange for INF Jimmy Alvarez. Romano was 6-3 with a
3.25 ERA in 10 starts with Triple-A Syracuse. He will be assigned
to Triple-A Salt Lake City.
Mariners-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: RHP Brett Tomko flew back to Seattle to have his
shoulder examined by Dr. Larry Pedegana. Tomko, who was 4-2 with a
5.24 ERA, has tendinitis in his throwing shoulder and was placed on
the 15-day DL. The Mariners are in the middle of their longest road
trip of the year, a 10-game sojourn to San Francisco, Kansas City,
and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The 64-year-old woman who was shot while sitting in
the stands at a Royals game Friday night got a call from team
president and Hall of Fame 3B George Brett. Brett expressed his
personal sympathy and the concern of the team to the woman, who was
not seriously hurt. The woman's seat was facing the 12-story
scoreboard and police have found a bullet hole in the back of the
scoreboard, indicating the shots were fired from outside the
stadium.
Blue Jays-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays believe they started the first
all-Castillo battery Monday night when RHP Frank Castillo went to
the mound, with Alberto Castillo behind the plate against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: 1B Tony Clark, activated Monday from the 15-day
disabled list after recovering from a strained left ribcage, was in
the Tigers' lineup -- batting eighth -- against Toronto. In a
three-game rehab assignment with the Toledo Mud Hens over the
weekend, Clark went 1-for-12. Before the injury, he was hitting
.176 in 25 games for Detroit.
White Sox-Indians
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: With seven games against the Indians and seven vs. the
New York Yankees in the next 14 days, White Sox manager Jerry
Manuel expects to find out even more about his team. ''This is a
huge series because we are the team being chased,'' Manuel said
before the opener of a three-game set in Cleveland. ''When you're
on top the focus and attention is on you.'' Manuel said it's still
a little different seeing the Sox atop the AL Central standings.
''I couldn't imagine (in spring training) we'd be at this point.
But I was always optimistic.'' ... Through 61 games in 1999, the
White Sox (37-24) were 31-30 and trailed the Indians by nine games.
The last time they came to Cleveland in first place was on July 21,
1994. ... The White Sox entered the biggest series of the season
thus far having won their last five series. It's their longest
series streak since winning five in a row in April of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Charles Nagy, who had elbow surgery last month,
threw 65 pitches off a mound Monday. ''He did good,'' pitching
coach Dick Pole said. ''He threw fastballs and changeups and said
there wasn't any distress.'' Before having elbow chips removed May
19, Nagy hadn't missed a start since 1993. He was expected to be
out eight weeks, but is ahead of schedule. ... RF Manny Ramirez's
left hamstring is still hurting and he will not come off the 15-day
DL on Wednesday as scheduled. ''He can run, but it still bothers
him,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel said. Ramirez may need to go
on a minor league rehab assignment if he's out more than a few
extra days, Manuel said. ... 3B Travis Fryman was forced to play
first base for the first time in his career in Sunday's game
against Cincinnati. ''It was very strange'' said Fryman. ''The game
comes at you from different angles.'' Fryman doesn't own a first
baseman's glove, so he borrowed Jim Thome's backup glove.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Marlins-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Cliff Floyd flew back to Miami after being diagnosed
with a contusion sprain of his left knee. Floyd injured the knee in
Sunday's game at Tampa Bay. His status is not yet clear. ... The
Marlins probably aren't too happy to be getting back to playing NL
opponents. In interleague play, Florida is 35-23, tied with
Cleveland for the best record. The Marlins have won 13 of the 20
series they have played vs. the AL.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The 1980 Phillies, the only team to win a World
Series in franchise history, will have its 20th reunion this
weekend. Among the events scheduled are the Richie Ashburn Golf
Outing and an autograph session to benefit ALS. The team will also
be honored in pregame ceremonies at the Vet on Saturday night. On
Friday, an unusual gala concert will be held at Philadelphia's
Academy of Music to honor the team, with performances by Peter Nero
and the Philly Pops mixing with R&AMP;B artists Ashford and Simpson.
Tug McGraw, the closer for that team, will give a rendition of
''Casey at the Bat'' at the gala ... RHP Curt Schilling threw
batting practice to three teammates before the game in an attempt
to ''work things out.'' Schilling is 1-4 this season with a 6.34
ERA since coming off the disabled list. ... The Phillies' winning
percentage against the Florida Marlins is the highest than against
any other opponent.
Brewers-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Dave Krynzel, Milwaukee's first-round pick in last
week's draft, signed his contract Monday morning at County Stadium.
Despite rain, the CF from Green Valley High School in Henderson,
Nev., hit in the cages underneath the stadium. Soon he will go to
Ogden, Utah, to participate in the Brewers' rookie camp. ... C
Henry Blanco remained in Venezuela to attend the funeral of his
father, Carlos, who died Saturday night. Blanco is expected to
return Wednesday. ... Eight players from the team's Class-A Midwest
League representative, the Beloit, Wis., Snappers, have been placed
on the Western Division All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Four Expos -- Vladimir Guerrero, Lee Stevens, Jose
Vidro and Rondell White -- are on pace to drive in 120 runs. There
have never been even two Expos to drive in more than 100 runs in
the same year. ... Four Expos pitchers on the DL progressed in
their rehabilitation Monday. Scott Strickland and Matt Blank flew
to Jupiter, Fla., to continue their work. Mike Thurman threw soft
toss for the first time since late May. Reliever Ugueth Urbina
started long-toss throwing after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on
May 17 to remove a bone chip in his right elbow. ... Stevens was a
late scratch from Monday's game after straining his right hamstring
Sunday against Toronto. His status will be evaluated daily.
Braves-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Greg Maddux, who starts Wednesday, is 8-0 -- allowing 15
earned runs in 12 starts -- since last losing to the Pirates on
April 30, 1994. ... John Burkett, an all-state pitcher at Beaver
High School near Pittsburgh in the mid-1980s, starts Tuesday. He is
3-4 with a 6.64 ERA at Three Rivers Stadium and 7-4 in his career
against Pittsburgh. The Braves visit Pittsburgh only once this
season, so this will likely be Burkett's final start in the stadium
where he grew up watching games. ... Braves SS Rafael Furcal limped
into second base on a first-inning double Monday, but stayed in
after being examined by a trainer. However, he was lifted in the
second for a pinch-hitter. ... Bobby Bonilla was scratched for the
second day in a row with an illness. He has seven hits in 17
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   PIITSBURGH: RHP Jason Schmidt, who has had shoulder problems
since spring training, was placed on the disabled list Monday for
the second time this season. He will be examined Wednesday in
Birmingham, Ala., by James Andrews. ... RHP Bronson Arroyo, 22-8 in
the minors the last two season, was recalled from Triple-A
Nashville and will make his major league debut Tuesday against the
Braves. ... The Pirates have lost eight of their last 10 road
games. ... Brian Giles had 60 RBIs in the Pirates' first 60 games
and is on pace to drive in a club-record 162 runs. Willie Stargell
had 67 RBIs in 60 games during the Pirates' World Series
championship season in 1971 before finishing with 125 RBIs. ...
J.R. House, a catcher who set numerous national high school
football passing records at Nitro (W.Va.) High in 1998, is batting
.361 at Class A Hickory.
Cardinals-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: OF Ray Lankford was held out of the lineup one day
after he sprained his right hand while striking out against
Detroit. Lankford, the DH against the Tigers, has not started in
the field since June 3 due to a sore left hamstring. ... The last
time the Cardinals were in first place with 100 games left in the
season was in 1987, when they went to the World Series. ... 1B Mark
McGwire has hit seven homers with 19 RBIs in 11 previous games at
Qualcomm Stadium. ... Darryl Kile will attempt to become the
majors' third 10-game winner when he starts Tuesday. Kile won only
eight games last season for Colorado. ... The Cardinals continue to
be the best draw on the road, averaging 35,566 fans in 29 dates.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres are 4-18 (.182) against baseball's
division leaders, including 0-3 against St. Louis. Their mark
against the rest of the division leaders: Atlanta (1-5), Arizona
(3-7) and Oakland (0-3). The Padres are 23-16 (.589) against all
other opponents. ... Tony Gwynn did not start in right field as
part of his routine of not playing in back-to-back games. The
team's medical staff hopes that will help heal Gwynn's ailing left
knee. ... Nine different pitchers have started for the Padres, one
more than the entire 1999 season.
Reds-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: RHP Osvaldo Fernandez was originally signed by the
San Francisco Giants, but after missing more than two years due to
reconstructive elbow surgery, he was cut loose. The Reds signed him
as a free agent and he is 2-0 in five games with a 2.76 ERA. He's
scheduled to pitch Tuesday against the Giants. ''You have to cut
the cord sometime,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ''We fixed
him, but sometimes a change of scenery is good. It's good to see
him back in the big leagues.'' ... RF Dante Bichette was not in the
starting lineup Monday after leaving Sunday's game against the
Indians with a mildly sprained left ankle. He's listed as
day-to-day. ... C Eddie Taubensee's streak of consecutive games
without an RBI reached 24 games (84 at-bats) on Sunday (June 11).
... OF Ken Griffey, Jr. will be spending Thursday's off day in
Pebble Beach for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: SS Rich Aurilia, who strained his left hamstring
on May 30, wasn't in the starting lineup for a second straight day.
Giants manager Dusty Baker said Aurilia will probably take Tuesday
off as well. ''He's feeling OK, but we want to get him two or three
days so he can get back to 100 percent,'' Baker said. ''We don't
want him chronically pulling something.'' ... OF Ellis Burks has a
say in whether he's going to play on a given day. ''It's his call
each day he comes into the locker room,'' said Giants head trainer
Stan Conte. ''It's been the same since spring training, he's
literally day to day.'' ... The Giants haven't lost two consecutive
home games since losing six straight to open Pac Bell Park.
Diamondbacks-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Luis Gonzalez, NL player of the week, was 24-for-61
against the four pitchers starting for the Dodgers in the four-game
NL West showdown that began Monday night -- Darren Dreifort
(1-for-6), Chan Ho Park (9-for-21), Carlos Perez (3-for-5) and
Kevin Brown (11-for-29). ... Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre
have a combined record of 18-4. The rest of the staff was 19-21.
... Mike Morgan, a starter for most of his 20-year career, is
5-for-5 in save situations after recording his previous save in
1991. The 40-year-old right-hander, who will make his second start
of the season on Tuesday, has played for 12 major league teams and
nine minor league clubs. ... Arizona scored 26 runs in the first
two games of their three-game sweep of the Dodgers last month in
Phoenix, before Brown and Randy Johnson dueled on even terms
without a decision in a game the Diamondbacks won 2-1. But there
won't be a Brown-Johnson rematch this time because Johnson is
pitching Wednesday and Brown is going Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Bullpen coach Rick Dempsey was amused by the
videotape of Robin Ventura -- disguised as Mike Piazza -- running
around the bases and splashing into second base during Sunday
night's Mets-Yankees rain delay at Yankee Stadium. It was
reminiscent of Dempsey's waterlogged belly-flopping jaunt around
the bases at Fenway Park some 20 years ago. ''I'd give him an
8.5,'' Dempsey said with a grin. ''He might have to work on it a
few more times, but I had a little more experience than he had. I
got to do it about three or four times, and that was his first try.
But I'm glad that somebody else is picking up the ball and running
with it.'' ... The Dodgers, who drew 3 million fans at home nine
times before any other team did it once, became the ninth of 16 NL
teams the season to reach the one million mark. One reason for the
early dropoff in attendance might be the Lakers, who have played
nine televised NBA playoff games while the Dodgers were at Chavez
Ravine.

S.Korea Leader Arrives for Historic Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The smiling leaders of South and North Korea
applauded each other and shook hands near the North's capital on Tuesday in the
first-ever meeting between the two sides' leaders -- and the first step toward
ending a half-century of enmity on the Korean Peninsula. Arriving for a
three-day summit, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's jet landed at an airport
on the outskirts of Pyongyang. His counterpart, Kim Jong Il, greeted him along
with a military brass band, goose-stepping soldiers with fixed bayonets and
women dressed in traditional, billowing Korean gowns.

Court Nixes Some Lawsuits vs. HMOs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today shut down one legal avenue for
people to sue their health-maintenance organizations. The justices' unanimous
ruling said patients cannot use a federal law to sue HMOs for giving doctors a
financial incentive to cut treatment costs. Such lawsuits could mean the end of
HMOs, which are based on financial incentives, the court said. In another
ruling, the Supreme Court made it easier for employees to prove they were
victims of on-the-job discrimination, or at least get their accusations to a
jury, without direct evidence of intentional bias.

Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Missing

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two computer hard drives containing an array of nuclear
secrets have disappeared from a highly secured vault at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, prompting a top-level investigation, laboratory and
Energy Department officials disclosed today. Energy Department officials first
learned that the nuclear secrets and other sensitive material were missing on
June 1 and have not ruled out the possibility that the disappearance is related
to the forest fire that threatened the lab and forced its evacuation last month.
Senior officials expressed doubt that it involved espionage.

Gov't To Compensate Nixon Estate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Nixon's estate will receive an $18 million
compensation payment from the Justice Department for thousands of secretly
recorded tapes and presidential papers seized when he resigned in 1974. The
government said Nixon's estate at one point had sought $35 million plus 25 years
worth of interest, bringing the asking price to more than $200 million. The $18
million figure was reached in a settlement in U.S. District Court in Washington
over the value of items seized when Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment.

Columbine Tapes Reveal Chaos
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Videotapes from surveillance cameras show students
huddling under tables in the Columbine High School cafeteria and then two gunmen
casually walking through the room after nearly everyone had fled. The tapes give
some glimpses of the chaos that erupted when students Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold began an assault April 20, 1999, that left 12 students and a teacher
dead. The pair then killed themselves. The Jefferson County sheriff's office
made the tapes public last week after a judge ruled in favor of victims'
families who sought them under the state open-records law. The two tapes are
from four surveillance cameras in the cafeteria, which is downstairs from the
main killing field in the library.

'Dot-cc' Name Sells for $1 Million

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A company paid $1 million for the Internet domain name
Beauty.cc in a sale demonstrating that even in an age of investor doubt about
new Web ventures, the right moniker still can fetch a hefty price. The sale
today also reflects the scarcity of prime names in the popular dot-com domain
and could prove a windfall to the tiny Cocos Islands, population 636, which owns
the dot-cc domain. Until the Internet age made dot-cc a valued commodity,
coconuts were the sole export of the islands, located in the Indian Ocean
halfway between Australia and India.

<HEADLINE> Braves 10, Pirates 8  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Andruw Jones homered and drove in five runs as
the Atlanta Braves lost a three-run lead, then rallied from five
runs down to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-8 Monday despite Kevin
Young's six-RBI night.
</P>
<P>
   Young drove in six runs in the first two innings with a double
and homer as the Pirates quickly chased Kevin Millwood and seized
an 8-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones led the Braves' comeback with a solo homer and a two-run
shot, both off Todd Ritchie. The Braves regained the lead in the
ninth off Jason Christiansen (1-6) on RBI singles by Javy Lopez and
Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied it at 8 with a two-run eighth against Rich
Loiselle and Christiansen aided by a walk, third baseman Luis
Sojo's run-scoring throwing error and Keith Lockhart's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth for the
victory and Mike Remlinger finished for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who went 2-for-4, and Jones, 3-for-5 with a two-run
single, combined to drive in 11 of the game's 18 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Young, jeered by some fans after his error helped Atlanta to a
three-run first, responded with a three-run double off the slumping
Millwood in the bottom of the inning and a three-run homer in the
second off Jason Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have lost five in a row to the Braves and 17 of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood remained in a major slump, surrendering five runs on
four hits and walking two while retiring only one batter, leadoff
hitter Warren Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, an 18-game winner last season, hasn't lasted past the
fourth inning in three of his last five starts and has lost his
last four decisions. His slump mirrors that of the long-reliable
Braves starting staff, which has given up 47 earned runs in its
last 38 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Braves rookie shortstop Rafael Furcal, arrested on a DUI charge
in Georgia over the weekend, doubled and scored to start the first
before being lifted with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones followed with a run-scoring single and Andruw
Jones hit a two-run single, but Millwood quickly surrendered the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Young's double followed Jason Kendall's one-out single and walks
to Wil Cordero and Brian Giles. Adrian Brown, Luis Sojo and Abraham
Nunez then singled to chase Millwood, who has allowed 14 earned
runs in 4 1-3 innings his last two starts. He gave up nine runs in
four innings in a 12-8 loss to Toronto on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Young's homer, his ninth, followed Cordero's single and the
second of Giles' three walks. Young has three homers in his last
six games despite batting only .228 since his average peaked at
.275 on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie shook off the three-run first keyed by Jones' two-run
single and Jones' two homers to last 5 1-3 innings, but didn't
figure in the decision.
Notes: The start was delayed 43 minutes by rain. ... Morris went
1-for-4 after needing three hits to tie the club record of 12 hits
in three games. He had five hits Saturday and four Sunday in Kansas
City. ... RHP Bronson Arroyo, who will make his first start Tuesday
night against the Braves, grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the
sixth in his first major league appearance. ... Andruw Jones also
had a two-homer game May 19 against San Diego. ... Chipper Jones
has a 10-game hitting streak (14-for-35, .400). ... The Pirates
have lost six of nine overall.

<HEADLINE> First Lady, Tom DeLay Share Award  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They are about as odd a political couple as
there is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and House Republican Whip
Tom DeLay of Texas shared an award Monday night honoring their work
to improve foster care. Political opposites, Clinton and DeLay
heaped praise on each other Monday night as they smiled and posed
for pictures together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee you we are an example that children can bring
anybody together,'' DeLay quipped.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent for the Senate from New
York, has questioned whether she would be effective in working with
congressional Republicans, many of whom voted to impeach President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has cited her work with DeLay as evidence that
she can work in a bipartisan fashion. DeLay is one of the
administration's fiercest critics and a leader in the impeachment
drive. He has also been a foster parent to three children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called DeLay ''the whip of all whips'' on foster care
legislation. ''When it came time to persuade people that this
needed to be a priority, he was there day in and day out,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay noted that many people had referred to him and the first
lady as ''an odd couple.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I do not think it's at all odd that Americans of different
perspectives can come together to meet the solemn obligation our
nation has to those who cannot help themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The award Monday night was given by the nonpartisan Orphan
Foundation of America, formed to help older foster children
transition to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna, Va.-based group cited Clinton and DeLay's
long-standing commitment to children, specifically their work on
two key pieces of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act broke down barriers to
adoption. Among other things, it provides encouragement as cash
bonuses to states that increase the number of adoptions from the
foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   The Foster Care Reform Act became law last year extended
benefits and other assistance for the 20,000 adolescents who ''age
out'' out of foster care each year at 18.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Chavez: Oil Prices Fair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Casting doubt on an immediate OPEC
output hike that could reduce international fuel prices, Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez said late Monday current world market oil
prices are ''fair and just.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We should maintain prices around this level of $28 a barrel,''
Chavez told reporters in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   The comment calls into question Venezuela's commitment to
raising oil production following the breaching of the upper limit
of an oil price band that was approved by OPEC last March.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Rodriguez, who is the current president of the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Venezuela's oil
minister, has been the principal force behind the band concept.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Friday that ''for now, it looks like we're not
going to have an increase in production before June 21,'' when OPEC
oil ministers will meet in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Markets have been watching for signs OPEC will increase its
output since last Wednesday, when the 20-day average price of
OPEC's basket of crudes breached the upper end of the group's
self-imposed price band.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC agreed informally in March to raise or reduce output by
500,000 barrels a day if the 20-day average price of the OPEC
basket of crudes moved out of a range of $22 to $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez failed to order the output hike, once billed as
automatic, saying the rise isn't ''instantaneous.'' Questions about
consensus in the cartel for such an increase have now arisen.
</P>
<P>
   After trading around $30 for the last three weeks, crude prices
Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange rocketed to an intraday
high of $31.80, their highest levels since prices hit a post-Gulf
War high of $34.37 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for July delivery closed Monday at $31.74 a barrel, up
5 percent, or $1.54.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Swimmer Gets Honda Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Columbia's Cristina Teuscher, the NCAA
swimming champion whose times in the 400-meter freestyle and
individual medley were the second-fastest in the world this year,
won the Honda-Broderick Cup as the nation's outstanding collegiate
woman athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Teuscher was honored Monday night at the 24th annual Collegiate
Woman Athlete of the Year dinner. She was selected by a national
vote involving more than 900 NCAA-member schools.
</P>
<P>
   The senior from New Rochelle, N.Y., was undefeated in nine meets
this season, and never lost an individual race during her college
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a way to top off a college career,'' Teuscher said. ''I'm
so happy I could share this with Columbia University. I think this
is probably the most prestigious award I've ever received.''
</P>
<P>
   Teuscher won an Olympic gold medal in the 800-meter relay at the
1996 Atlanta Games and is in training for the Sydney Games in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''Swimming and academics are in the same realm and it's great to
combine academics and athletics because I never put one in front of
the other,'' she said. ''Swimming and college have matured me. I
feel much better prepared heading into these (Olympic) trials.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the Ivy League champion in the 200- and 400-meter
individual medley, as well as the 100 freestyle, in which she set a
school record. Teuscher also was the Outstanding Swimmer of the Ivy
League Championships for the fourth consecutive year, and holds 10
of 14 school individual records and four relay team records.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the Honda-Broderick Cup, she was selected over 11
other candidates, who were voted best in their respective sports
for 1999-00.
</P>
<P>
   They are: Jen Adams, lacrosse, Maryland; Courtney Blades,
softball, Southern Mississippi; Heather Brink, gymnastics,
Nebraska; Lauren Cacciamani, volleyball, Penn State; Jenna Daniels,
golf, Arizona; Lorrie Fair, soccer, North Carolina; Marissa Irvin,
tennis, Stanford; Sally Northcroft, field hockey, Ball State; Shea
Ralph, basketball, Connecticut; Keisha Spencer, track and field,
Louisiana State; and Amy Yoder, cross-country, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball player Jayne Even of North Dakota State was honored
as the Division II Woman Athlete of the Year and Alia Fischer, who
played basketball for Washington University in St. Louis, was the
Division III winner.
</P>
<P>
   Distance runner Johanna Olson of Luther College in Decorah,
Iowa, won the Honda Inspiration Award for twice battling back from
a brain tumor to return to competition and win All-America honors.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda-Broderick Cup is the top honor given women college
athletes and is part of a year-long Honda Awards program to
recognize outstanding achievements.

<HEADLINE> NJ man seeks legal advice from Cochran at airport, ends up at police station </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - A man wanted for kidnapping in New
Jersey sought legal advice from Johnnie Cochran and another
attorney during a chance encounter at the airport Monday and ended
up turning himself in at the police station.
</P>
<P>
   James Allan, 39, is accused of kidnapping a former girlfriend
from a grocery store parking lot in Wayne, N.J., on Friday, Police
Sgt. Bruce Elrod said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan drove Linda Gazda, 51, to Des Moines. He told her he
wanted to take her to Las Vegas to get married, and the two went to
the airport Monday afternoon to catch a flight to Nevada, Elrod
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Allan recognized Cochran, who had been in town
briefly for a news conference. He walked up and spoke with Cochran
and Des Moines attorney Bob Wright Jr., who are working together on
a case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Johnnie told me, 'Look, this could be a prospective client and
he may need help,''' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan told the lawyers there was a warrant out for his arrest
but that Gazda, whom he allegedly had kidnapped, was with him
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's standing behind him and she's mouthing, 'No,''' Wright
said. ''I didn't know what to think of it; she was doing this
rather calmly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said Allan let him talk to Gazda, and she said she did
not want to be there. Wright persuaded Allan to follow him to the
police station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this gentleman really thought I'd take care of the
warrant for him,'' Wright said. ''I couldn't represent him anyway.
I'm a witness now.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and the FBI were interviewing Gazda on Monday evening,
Elrod said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Police Lt. John Reardon said Gazda and Allan lived
together briefly until she obtained a temporary restraining order
against him on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was in great fear of him,'' Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, Gazda and her 86-year-old mother were
shopping at an A&AMP;P when the mother saw Gazda's car speeding away.
She was left on the curb with the groceries wondering what had
happened, Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   Gazda managed to call her family several times before police
were able to track the couple through ATM and credit card receipts
to Buffalo, N.Y., early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gazda slipped a note to a woman in the ladies' room
of a Chicago restaurant, asking her to call her sister in New
Jersey. The note said ''that her life depended on it,'' Reardon
said. The sister called police, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Gazda is expected to return to New Jersey on Tuesday morning,
Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant also charged Allan with violating the restraining
order, which was made permanent on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran and Wright filed a wrongful death lawsuit Monday on
behalf of the family of Charles Lovelady, who died in February
during a fight with two bouncers at a nightclub where he'd been
turned away for a dress code violation.

<HEADLINE> Danforth Said To Reject Vice Pres.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former Sen. John Danforth has withdrawn his
name from the list of potential running mates for George W. Bush,
according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the idea of running for vice president ''very
tempting'' and ''would have been a dream.'' But, after mulling it
over for two weeks, he said he and his wife Sally decided they
didn't want to give up living in Missouri and their close contact
with family here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want politics to totally define who we were,''
Danforth told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in a story for Tuesday's
paper. ''The last six years have been the best years of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 after three terms,
is now the special counsel overseeing an investigation in the Waco
standoff and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports placed him on a short list of vice presidential
prospects for Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he called Bush and former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who heads Bush's vice presidential search team, last week
about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made up his mind after waking up in the middle of the
night with the memory of a visit by then-Secretary of State George
Shultz when Danforth was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a couple of Secret Service people standing in our
back yard in the dark, and I remembered that,'' Danforth said.
''It's the fact that if you do that (high-level of a) job, it
crowds out everything else in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign press secretary Mindy Tucker declined to comment
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Man dies in bar fight; parolee arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) - Police arrested a 22-year-old man on parole
for burglary and accused him of physically assaulting another man
who died after a bar fight on the city's south side.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Chmielewski, 44, was taken to Rome Memorial Hospital
after the altercation Sunday night and pronounced dead at 9:20
p.m., police said. An autopsy was conducted Monday at St. Elizabeth
Medical Center in nearby Utica.
</P>
<P>
   Police apprehended James Vance, who was arraigned Monday on a
manslaughter charge. He requested that the public defender's office
represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Daniel C. Wilson ordered Vance held without bail until it
could be determined if he had more than one felony conviction on
his record. A hearing was set for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police responding to a 911 call found Chmielewski on the floor
of the bar, unconscious and bleeding from his head, nose and mouth.
The two men apparently knew each other, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were together playing pool and some type of dispute broke
out,'' Police Chief Merino Ciccone said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were looking at whether any weapons were
used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Vance and another man were charged with burglarizing
pharmacies in Boonville and Holland Patent. They were accused of
stealing thousands of dollars worth of prescription drugs and
instant lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Vance was sentenced to 2{ to 7 years in state prison. He was
released in September 1998 to the state parole division.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Chmielewski had been injured before in fights
outside at least two other bars in the city in the last three
years.

<P>
   Milton (6-1) allowed both runs and seven hits in seven innings,
showing no ill effects from the bruised leg that caused him to
leave his June 6 start at Houston after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   He won his fourth consecutive decision, allowing a two-run homer
to Grieve. The strikeouts were two short of his career high, set
last Sept. 11 when he no-hit the Anaheim Angels. Minnesota pitchers
struck out a season-high 16 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey broke a 2-all tie in the fourth following a one-out
single by David Ortiz, Huskey sent a drive to left that tipped off
Grieve's glove over the fence. Corey Koskie walked, Matt Lawton was
hit by a pitch and Jones hit a two-run triple, scoring on Denny
Hocking's squeeze bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (8-4) allowed five runs and four hits in four
innings. His ERA, which had been second in the league behind
Boston's Pedro Martinez (0.95), rose from 3.13 to 3.64.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland lost for just the third time in 12 games and dropped
into second place in the AL West, a half-game behind Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, in a 4-for-29 slump, put the A's ahead with an
upper-deck shot in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones, who had three RBIs, had a run-scoring groundout in
the third, and another run scored on a throwing error by Miguel
Tejada on Crs this season, tying their total for last year. ...
Heredia dropped to 6-1 on the road this year. He is 1-2 against the
Twins this season. ... Jones' triple was the Twins' 22nd of the
season, tops in the AL.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Moss Kicked Off Flight  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy
Moss was kicked off an airplane Monday night after a confrontation
with a flight attendant over the storage of carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh-bound US Airways flight had taxied across the
tarmac but returned to the gate at Yeager Airport to have Moss
removed. The matter was turned over to the Federal Aviation
Administration and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation ''was all verbal. Nothing physical,'' said
assistant airport director Dave Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by Moss' agent, Dante diTrapano, called the
incident ''very unfortunate'' and it was ''blown way out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Moss boarded the plane with the same luggage
he routinely carries on board.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant told Moss the bag was too big and had to be
checked. Trying to avoid waiting at baggage claim on arrival, Moss
removed some clothes and placed them in the overhead compartment,
then placed his bag underneath his seat, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendant apparently complained to the captain that
Moss had not followed her instructions, and the captain asked Moss
to leave the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, a former all-America at Marshall, was not immediately
available for comment. A native of nearby Rand, Moss left the
airport after giving a statement to police.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left with a spokesman for US Airways wasn't
immediately returned Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the lead story on all three of Charleston's 11
p.m. television newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Moss hasn't exactly been the darling of his home state in recent
years. He has been a target of contempt ever since he criticized
West Virginia in several 1998 interviews and said he was happy to
get out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he was fined $10,000 for excessive verbal abuse of
an NFL official in a game. In January, he was fined $25,000 for
squirting water at an official during an NFC divisional playoff
game.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Keeps Jordan, Miami Waiting  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leonard Hamilton is holding the University of
Miami in suspense as he decides whether to take Michael Jordan's
offer to coach the Washington Wizards or remain with the program he
built.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Hurricanes nor the Wizards had any coach-related
announcements scheduled as of late Monday, but The Washington Post
reported in Tuesday editions that Hamilton has told the Wizards
will accept the job.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Post said Hamilton had not signed a contract and
could still decide to remain at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The major obstacle to Hamilton's departure from Miami, a buyout
figure for his contract, was settled over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Miami athletic director Paul Dee said Monday he did not know
what Hamilton would do.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things are fairly deliberate, take some time,'' Dee
said. ''We have completed the phase of the negotiation between the
university and the coach ... which releases him to conduct his
negotiations with the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in Part Two now, of which I'm not a relevant player.
When they are able to complete their transactions, then we'll
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at least one Miami booster was already making plans
for Hamilton's exit. Louisville coach Denny Crum told the Lexington
Herald-Leader he was essentially offered the Hurricanes job.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of their prominent boosters called me,'' Crum said. ''He
said the job's mine if I want it. I haven't had much time to think
about it, but I take the offer seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee said a replacement for Hamilton would be hired not by a
booster, but through the standard procedure using a search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever the booster is, I wish they'd give me a call,'' Dee
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hamilton and Miami officials agreed the coach could
buy out his contract for $1 million if he decides to leave.
Hamilton signed a seven-year, $5.5 million contract extension in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Dee said he was hoping the university's demand for compensation
for the long-term contract would itself be enough to keep Hamilton,
but not so.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the business about people, people making commitments
and institutions making commitments,'' Dee said. ''You try and be
fair. You're not looking to cash in, you're looking to deter and
defer. And this time it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the Wizards' president of basketball operations, and
Hamilton reportedly agreed in principle to a five-year deal worth
about $10 million, not including incentives, to coach the Wizards
should Hamilton accept the job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the allure of the NBA and the prospect of working
with the game's greatest name, Hamilton expressed some reticence to
leave a secure job and a program he overhauled from perennial loser
to national prominence over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can honestly say I've wrestled with it,'' Hamilton said over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 51, coached the Hurricanes to six consecutive winning
seasons and three straight trips to the NCAA tournament. The
Wizards haven't won a playoff game in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Hamilton and Hamilton's attorney did not return calls
seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has already been spurned by one Big East coach, St.
John's Mike Jarvis. Jordan said he has other candidates should
Hamilton turn him down, but no other names have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Crum, 63, who won two national championships with Louisville
over 29 seasons, seemed intrigued by a possible huge pay raise
should the Miami job come open. Crum's last contract, signed two
years ago, was a four-year deal worth about $1.4 million, not
counting incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me I would make more money than Leonard Hamilton was
making,'' Crum told the Lexington newspaper. ''I've never had any
interest in leaving here, but there are a lot of coaches out there
who have not done what I've done, yet are making a lot more money
than me.''

<HEADLINE> Solomon Island P.M. To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Facing threats from rebels who
have captured the capital, the embittered prime minister of the
Solomon Islands said Tuesday that he will resign in two days, a
move he warned could cause more fighting and the break up of the
South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu told The Associated Press
in an exclusive interview that he had no safe choice but to stand
down Thursday, regardless of the outcome of a parliamentary vote of
no confidence on his leadership set for that day.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the result of a deal with rebels who seized
Ulufa'alu at gunpoint on Monday and demanded that he resign. A few
days later, they released him and allowed him to stay in office
until the parliament decided his future.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu said it was just an attempt to give the change of
leadership the appearance of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu called the entire process ''a sheer mockery of
democracy'' because he was still resigning under duress, fearing
that the rebels would harm his family and cabinet ministers if he
stayed in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be part of the new government,'' Ulufa'alu
said in his small wood-paneled office. ''This (the vote) is an
insult to my integrity, to my family and the people in my
constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Malaita Eagle Force raided an armory one week
ago and used the weapons to stage a stunning seizure of Honiara.
The militants, made up of migrants from the neighboring island of
Malaita, have been fighting to stay on the main island of
Guadalcanal, where the capital is located.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' foes, the indigenous Isatabu, have been trying to
oust the Malaitans from Guadalcanal -- the scene of a major turning
point in World War II when U.S. Marines began their island-hopping
Pacific assault against Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff said Ulufa'alu
had shown ''remarkable courage'' since the Malaitans took over the
capital. The rebels were holding the prime minister at gunpoint,
but released him late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a situation in the Solomons where a prime minister is
in fear of his life,'' Goff told a foreign policy conference in
Wellington, the capital of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu ''will resign this week, I am sure, because the cost
of staying in power ... is too great,'' he said. Goff was with a
delegation of leaders who visited the Solomon Islands last weekend
and attempted to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Isatabus, vastly out-armed by the Malaitans, have
retreated to the countryside, where their support base is located.
It was unclear who was leading the loosely organized group, which
rarely makes statements.
</P>
<P>
   Malaitan rebels, armed with machine guns and grenade launchers,
have set up checkpoints at roads that lead to Isatabu-controlled
areas outside the capital. In the city, the rebels have taken over
police duties, preventing looting and unrest. They have also
imposed a temporary ban on alcohol, which has helped them maintain
order.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and foreigners have been flooding out of the capital,
fearing Thursday's parliament vote could bring more violence to
Honiara. It was uncertain if the 50-member parliament would have a
quorum to vote on the prime minister's fate, since many lawmakers
might not dare to return to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a third group of militants sailed into the
islands and killed a man in Gizo, northwest of Honiara in the
Western Province, said Gizo police chief Aloysius Ora. The
militants, including men from neighboring Papua New Guinea, thought
the man was aligned with the Malaitan rebels, Ora said.
</P>
<P>
   The militants said they would serve as a security force to
protect citizens from attacks by the Malaitan rebels, he said. Many
of the Papuans have relatives on the western islands.
</P>
<P>
   Ora said his forces lacked the weaponry to apprehend the
well-armed, battle-hardened fighters from the Papuan island of
Bougainville, where a 10-year secessionist war took thousands of
lives before a 1998 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   A Malaita leader in Honiara, former lawmaker Andrew Nori, has
said the Papuan rebels appeared intent on evicting Malaitans from
the Western Province. Nori could not be reached for comment Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Dole Attend Dodd Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was the headliner at a party
in honor of Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., on Monday night, but
his old rival Bob Dole stole the show with a playful surprise
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The former Senate Republican leader, who lost to Clinton in
1996, poked fun at Democrats, the president and himself in a series
of one-liners that kept the audience of about 600 in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has been a spokesman for the anti-impotence drug
Viagra, joked that it's tough to get work since his unsuccessful
presidential campaign, so he keeps busy with speaking engagements
and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told a Viagra side effect for some men in their 50s is
that their hair turns gray,'' he said, a shot at the silver-haired
Dodd, who was celebrating 25 years of public service in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his speech to compliment Dodd on his
accomplishments over the years, but also noted Dole's new career in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''He owes me a lot, Bob Dole,'' Clinton said. ''I mean, if it
weren't for me, he'd be just like all us gray-haired 50-year-olds.
He'd have to pay for his Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole and Dodd were often at odds over legislation in the Senate,
but Dole said he spoke at the $1 million fund-raiser because he
recognizes there is a time for campaigning and a time for working
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud to call him my friend and I wish him many more years
in the Senate,'' he said. ''All, of course, in the minority.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Opposes Execution Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Al Gore supports DNA testing where he says
it can make the justice system ''more accurate and fair,'' but does
not favor a moratorium on federal executions.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about the issue during a televised women's forum
Monday night, Gore, who supports capital punishment, referred to
Illinois, where the Gov. George Ryan earlier this year suspended
executions after 13 death row inmates were exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to all be able to agree that anything that makes our
criminal justice system more accurate and fair ought to receive our
full support because if somebody is unjustly executed that is one
of the worse tragedies you can imagine,'' Gore, the likely
Democratic nominee for president, said during the event sponsored
and televised by the Oxygen cable television channel.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he supports DNA testing where it can
improve the administration of justice and that if such testing in
another state led to the kind of record uncovered in Illinois ''it
would in my view justify a moratorium as in Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Gore said: ''I do not think in the federal courts that the
evidence justifies a moratorium and I have not been supportive of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment has come under increased scrutiny of late,
particularly in Texas, which has executed more people than any
other state and where George W. Bush, Gore's rival for the
presidency, is governor, as well as in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton earlier this year rejected calls for a
national moratorium on capital punishment, but urged the nation's
governors to examine their systems to make sure innocent people are
not executed.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promotes Campaign Finance  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Al Gore promoted campaign finance reform at
a Democratic fund-raiser Monday, then hit the trail with Jon
Corzine, the Senate candidate whose $33 million primary bid is this
year's symbol of spending excess.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to Gore on a counter stool in a diner, Corzine
maintained an uneasy smile as the Democratic presidential contender
weighed in on the phenomenon of a candidate spending tens of
millions of his own dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's for the voters to decide,'' said Gore. ''There's no
campaign reform bill from any of the reform groups that I've seen
that would have an effect on an individual spending his or her own
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the problem is special-interest money in campaigns. He
added that Corzine, a New Jersey Democrat, ''will make a great
United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore spoke at a fund-raiser that brought in $400,000
for the Democratic National Committee -- at least some of it in the
unregulated ''soft money'' that he says he will try to outlaw as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will leave Tuesday on a three-week ''progress and
prosperity tour'' to celebrate good economic times and claim at
least partial credit as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign ridiculed that as ''Al Gore's
I-Invented-Prosperity Tour.'' Spokesman Ari Fleischer said,
''Americans -- not government -- deserve credit for our nation's
prosperous times.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Gore participated in a 90-minute televised forum
sponsored by Oxygen, the new cable television network developed by
Oprah Winfrey and devoted to women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator was former White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl
Mills, who played a key role in President Clinton's impeachment
trial. Mills is now Oxygen's senior vice president of corporate
policy and public programing.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen promoted the event as: ''Al Gore gets in touch with his
feminine side.'' Facing a studio audience of 150 women, Gore
promised more money for special education, pledged his support for
affirmative action and said he does not believe enough doubts have
been raised about capital punishment to warrant a moratorium on
federal executions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also detailed his support for a woman's right to an
abortion and added, for emphasis, that the next president is likely
to appoint enough justices to shape the Supreme Court for 30 to 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue in the forefront of this year's debate in
this presidential election,'' Gore said, ''and let me just state
clearly again: I support a woman's right to choose. My opponent
does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, much of the talk was about campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, worth an estimated $400 million, relied mostly on his
own money in the record-breaking spending that helped him win last
week's Democratic primary against former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Corzine said he shares Gore's support for
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said over and over again during this campaign that we
have to open up the airwaves,'' said Corzine, the former chairman
of Wall Street's Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ''When people sit down and
look at how we used the resources we had, it was buying media.
Media is very expensive, and if we had not done that, we would not
have been competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   At a late-morning fund-raiser at a private home on Long Island,
Gore acknowledged the irony in raising money and preaching reform
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ''If you entrust me with the presidency, the very
first bill I'll send to the Congress will be the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance reform bill, and then I want to go beyond that to
reform our electoral process and the way campaign money is
raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would outlaw soft money raised by
parties. Gore has also proposed creating a $7.1 billion ''Democracy
Endowment'' that would pay for campaigns of candidates who elect
not to accept any political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Previewing his prosperity trip, Gore told the 100 supporters
present, ''Instead of the biggest deficits we now have the biggest
surplus. Instead of a triple-dip recession we've seen a tripling of
the stock market. ... And officially as of two months ago, we now
have the longest economic expansion, the strongest economic
recovery and the healthiest economy in the entire 211-year history
of the American economy. That is a success story.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip begins Tuesday with a speech in New York City, then
an address in Pennsylvania on health care. Gore travels to Ohio on
Wednesday to discuss tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee suggested a better name for
his trip would be the ''Broken Promises Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said Congress and the nation's
governors share credit for prosperous times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the height of hypocrisy for the man who claims to have
invented the Internet to now claim he's invented prosperity,'' said
Pataki, who leads Texas Gov. George W. Bush's New York presidential
campaign effort.

<HEADLINE> Drug Traffickers Threaten Stability  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SCHUSLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Drug traffickers are endangering
democracy in small nations and leaving a trail of violence across
the Americas, speakers told a major anti-drug conference Monday
attended by Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the international community does not work together against
drug traffickers, this region's stability and the economic
stability of the world are at grave risk,'' Trinidad's Attorney
General Ramesh Maharaj said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference in Trinidad's capital, aimed at
overcoming international obstacles to law enforcement, brought more
than 100 law enforcement officials from the Caribbean, Britain,
Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of a drug rehabilitation center in rural Trinidad
Monday, Reno also urged more cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boundaries mean less when it comes to crime,'' she said. ''We
are going to have to join together ... to talk about how we can be
partners, large and small, but all equally important in dealing
with the issues of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj called drug trafficking ''the greatest threat to
democracy in the region,'' noting U.N. estimates that the illegal
drug trade generates $500 billion a year, more than the world's oil
and gas industries combined.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Reno and Trinidadian officials signed an
agreement setting ground rules for the deportation of Trinidadian
nationals imprisoned in the United States. Such deportations are a
touchy issue with many Caribbean countries, who claim they are
being flooded with U.S.-trained criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, the United States promised to better identify
deportees and the charges against them, while Trinidad agreed to
issue travel papers within five working days for convicts who had
documents identifying them as Trinidadian nationals. Those without
proof of Trinidadian citizenship would get papers within 30 days
after an investigation into their nationality.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also promised to send deportees back on
commercial flights instead of charters when possible. Many
countries complain that the unscheduled charter planes dump
deportees on them without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean countries are also under pressure to loosen secretive
banking laws, which U.S. and European drug agents have said attract
the fortunes of drug barons.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of balancing anti-drug operations and
international relations was underscored last week, when U.S. drug
agents lured a suspected trafficker out of St. Kitts on a boat in
order to arrest him in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smugglers don't pay attention to international borders, but
law enforcement has to, not only in tracking them down, but also in
taking action against them,'' said Jay Carmichael, chief counsel
for the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the two-day meeting were scheduled to discuss money
laundering, street gangs, how to fight organized crime and
extradition. They were also to consider proposals for specialized
''drug courts'' to speed trials.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Hillary Clinton-Lazio race tight, and a different contest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A fourth statewide poll in less than three
weeks has found Hillary Rodham Clinton in a close race in New York
with her new Republican opponent for the U.S. Senate, Rep. Rick
Lazio, and a very different contest.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS News/New York Times poll out Monday had Clinton with a
very slight lead over the little-known congressman from Long
Island. Clinton was backed by 44 percent of likely voters surveyed
to 39 percent for Lazio. Seventeen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times poll out in April had Clinton leading
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, 49 percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent
undecided. Giuliani quit the race May 19 to deal with his prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that in many ways the Senate race has become a
whole new contest with Lazio replacing Giuliani on the Republican
side.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the number of undecided voters increased, but
while Clinton and Giuliani were running even in traditionally more
conservative upstate New York in April, the new poll had Lazio
leading in that region, 46 percent to 35 percent, in the new poll.
</P>
<P>
   And in the category of who would be better at working with other
senators, Clinton's edge has largely evaporated. In April, Clinton
led Giuliani, 57 percent to 30 percent, on that front. In the new
poll, 42 percent said Clinton would work better with other senators
while 38 percent said that about Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   And while 30 percent of voters said Lazio was spending more time
attacking Clinton than talking about issues, 52 percent said that
was the case with Giuliani back in April.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is that many New Yorkers would
prefer to have a senator who was born in the state. Almost four in
10 voters in the new poll felt that way. Lazio has been stressing
the carpetbagger issue, presenting himself as the ''Made in New
York'' candidate. Until January, Clinton has never lived in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also found that many voters really don't know much
about the new Republican candidate. Forty-seven percent said they
didn't know enough about Lazio to even decide if their impression
of him was favorable or unfavorable. Twenty-six percent said they
had a favorable opinion of him while 10 percent said they had an
unfavorable opinion of the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The new telephone poll of 1,187 likely voters was conducted June
4-10 and has a margin of error of plus of minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent polls have also shown the race to be close.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, the Zogby International Group had the race a
statistical dead heat with Clinton at 46 percent and Lazio at 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a poll conducted by Blum &AMP; Weprin for the New York
Daily News and cable television's New York 1 all-news channel
reported Clinton with a slight, 46 percent to 42 percent, lead over
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute had
Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent each.
