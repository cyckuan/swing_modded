ROME, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The secretary-general of the
Italian Olympic Committee (CONI), Raffaele Pagnozzi, is under
investigation for his alleged role in a cycling doping scandal,
reports said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Rome prosecutors are looking into whether
Pagnozzi played a role in hiding positive drug tests of a
cyclist, but Pagnozzi himself has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Cycling was plunged into crisis this summer by a series of
arrests and investigations into doping in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
In Italy, a wide doping scandal has hit the soccer world,
prompting the resignation of the Italian Olympic Committee
president Mario Pescante and the closing of the country's
drug-testing laboratory.

<HEADLINE> EU to Fund Mine Clearance in Bosnia, Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
approved a fund of 2 million European Currency Units (ECUs) (2.2
million U.S. dollars) for mine clearance in Bosnia and 1 million
(1.1 million U.S. dollars) for a similar purpose in Croatia, the
European Commission said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the EU's executive body has learned
that about a million mines are still dispersed throughout Bosnia
and that there are up to 300,000 mines in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The new support, the commission said, will enhance the Bosnian
Civil Protection Agency, reinforce training of local mine
clearance workers and fund the provision of equipment.
</P>
<P>
This work is being closely coordinated with the commission's
efforts to rebuild housing and essential infrastructure needed for
returning refugees, and with the United Nations and Council of
Europe activities in this field.
</P>
<P>
So far, the most urgent part of the job, which began in the
immediate aftermath of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, has
already been completed, for example in the vicinity of Sarajevo
airport.
</P>
<P>
Along with the fund for mine clearance, the commission also
approved a grant of 2.6 million ECUs (2.86 million U.S. dollars)
for the continuation of the reconstruction of Sarajevo airport.
</P>
<P>
The new funding will be used for the rehabilitation of the
interior of the airport terminal building, which was severely
damaged during the war in Bosnia, according to the EU commission.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders 3rd Wave of Air Attacks on Iraq: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States ordered a
third wave of air attacks on Iraq Friday, senior U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
An administration official said a third wave of attacks would
begin later in the day. "There will be another wave of attacks
today," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say how long Washington was prepared
to continue the air campaign against Iraq, brushing aside
speculation that the Muslim religious observance of Ramadan would
force an end to the effort.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have indicated that Operation Desert
Fox would take several days to complete because of the large
number of targets.
</P>
<P>
Officials said U.S. military and intelligence experts were
still conducting an assessment of the damage from the attacks,
which were made primarily with long-distance cruise missiles.

MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Friday expressed satisfaction with the Russian-Croatian
relations, saying the visit by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
to Russia is an important landmark in the bilateral relations.
</P>

After meeting with the Croatian president, Primakov said their
talks showed that the Russian-Croatian relations were "of much
importance, which goes beyond the framework of bilateral
relations."
</P>

Primakov noted the development of relations between Russia and
Croatia was certainly consolidating stability in the Balkan
Peninsula and in Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Russian and Croatian sides also signed a number
of important agreements, including an agreement on cooperation
between the defense ministries of Russia and Croatia, agreements
on cooperation in the sphere of culture, on automobile transport,

<HEADLINE> Leaders See Iraq Diplomacy Gone Down: Blair Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Friday talked with other leaders about the air-strikes on
Iraq and concluded there was broad understanding that diplomatic
efforts had been exhausted, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"While of course there are difficulties about this, and while
there is a genuine debate about how we take this forward, there is
a widespread understanding that the diplomatic track had been gone
down," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"There was no other course than military action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair telephoned German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French
President Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and intended to call Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah later in the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We think it extremely important that we inform and consult our
allies throughout this process," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair had agreed with his European Union partners in particular
that there was a need "for a longer term strategy to keep (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein in his box, as it were," the spokesman

<HEADLINE> British Youth Take More Illegal Drugs Than Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Young people in Britain are
taking up to five times more illegal drugs than their European
counterparts, according to a report issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
The annual report of the European Monitoring Center for Drugs
and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), based in Lisbon, shows that British
people in their teens and 20s are more likely to take illegal
drugs than young people in countries like Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
Britain topped the western European league on ecstasy and
amphetamines and came second for cocaine and cannabis, BBC quoted
the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nine percent of young people in Britain said they had tried
ecstasy, compared with only 2.8 percent of Germans, 3.1 percent of
French and 1 percent of Belgians and Swedes.
</P>
<P>
And as many as 16 percent of British young people said they had
tried amphetamines, compared with 1.6 percent of French people and
4 percent of Germans.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Britain came second in the amount of
young people who take cocaine while Spain topped the league.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that around 36 percent of Britons
admitted to taking cannabis -- the most common illegal drug in
Europe, compared with 25.7 percent of French people, 21 percent of
Germans and 22 percent of Spanish people.
</P>
<P>
The British government issued a White Paper on tackling the UK
drugs problem earlier in the year. It stressed the need to reduce
use among young people.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Conference on Drug Abuse says use of illegal drugs
has increased eightfold among 15 year olds in the last 10 years
and fivefold among 12 year olds.
</P>
<P>
It believes the problem is bad in Britain because of cultural
and supply reasons.

<HEADLINE> No Definite Deadline for Air Strikes on Iraq: Berger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger said Friday that the air strikes against Iraq
would not necessarily end this weekend with the beginning of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
"That is not an automatic deadline," Berger said in a
interview.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to proceed (with the air-strike campaign)
until we believe we have done what we can with the targets," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said it was "too early to tell" whether the first two days
of air raids had achieved their objectives.
</P>
<P>
But he added the strikes had already succeeded in making it
clear to Saddam Hussein "that he cannot defy the international
community and not face consequences, because once he reaches that
conclusion there is no restraint on Saddam Hussein, and if there's
no restraint on Saddam Hussein there's another Gulf War down the
road."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials, providing assessments on the first round of
attacks launched Wednesday night EST, said that more than 70 U.S.
warplanes, as well as some 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, hit more
than 50 targets.
</P>
<P>
A second wave of attacks began soon after sunset Thursday in
Iraq, when B-52 bombers took off from the Indian Ocean island of
Diego Garcia armed with air-launched cruise missiles, they added.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton made a flurry of phone calls to foreign
leaders to gauge the reaction abroad, speaking to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Jordan's King Hussein and French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore spoke to Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who urged Washington to call off the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Russia also has recalled its ambassador to Washington and
London to show its strong disapproval to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British air strikes have divided the U.N. Security
Council and drew protests from Russia, China and France.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Arrives for Talks on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi arrived here Friday for talks with
Pakistani and Taliban leaders on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters upon his arrival from Iran on a two-day
visit to Pakistan, Brahimi said the U.N. would not send a
fact-finding mission to Afghanistan to probe into the killing of
Iranian diplomats unless the security situation there is improved.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is expected to exchange views with Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz and other officials on his talks with Iranian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the special envoy held talks with Iranian leaders on
the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban
fighters in Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is also to meet a Taliban delegation led by Maulvi
Wakil Mutawakil, which arrived here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is Brahimi's second visit to the region in three months. He
visited Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and some Central Asian
countries in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the U.N. envoy said that he would also
hold talks with Pakistani officials on matters relating to the
proposed meeting of the six plus two group in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Kamilov, during his visit to
Pakistan in November, had invited the Taliban to participate in
the Tashkent meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan militia, however, had set a condition that they
should be invited as a government rather than a group.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover Key Molecule Causing Asthma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from two
universities have identified a molecule that causes symptoms of
asthma.
</P>
<P>
Reporting this discovery Friday, Science says that it may lead
to new treatments for the disease that affects 15 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the
University of California in San Francisco independently found in
laboratory mice that a molecule called interleukin-13 (IL13) was a
primary cause of the inflammation, clogging and restricted air
flow that cause breathing problems in asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Johns Hopkins University team found that mice treated with
the drug IL13 blocker do not have symptoms when exposing to asthma
allergen. The California team got the similar results, and further
they found another molecule IL4 also plays a role in asthma.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed Up at US Consulate in Peshawar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Security has been beefed up
at the American consulate in Peshawar, a major city in
northwestern Pakistan, on Friday to avert any incident in the wake
of protests against the U.S. attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Heavy contingents of police and other paramilitary forces were
seen deployed around the U.S. consulate while new barricades were
also erected at the Hospital road where the consulate is situated.
Roads leading to the consulate are already partially closed
following the American missile attacks on Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
The security was increased apparently due to a strong reaction
in Peshawar, provincial capital of the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP), and other parts of the NWFP to protest the U.S.
strikes on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, a bomb hoax at the U.S. embassy
in Islamabad forced the entire staff to evacuate the building
Friday morning, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The staff was immediately evacuated soon after the U.S. embassy
received an anonymous call around 9:30 a.m. that a bomb has been
planted in the building to avenge the American attack on Iraq. The
building was searched thoroughly and the call proved a hoax.

JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) Friday deplored the air strikes against Iraq by the United
States and Britain, saying the military action violated the U.N.
Charter, South African Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Movement of Non-Aligned countries deplores the ongoing
military actions against Iraq by individual countries without any
authorization from the (UN) Security Council in flagrant
disregard of the United Nations Charter," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa currently chairs the movement of 113 developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The NAM called for the immediate cessation of all military
strikes against Iraq and the avoidance of any actions that might
further aggravate tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
It urgently called for a peaceful solution to the crisis,
saying such a solution will contribute positively to the
promotion and preservation of peace and security.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Doubts UNSCOM's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- France Friday expressed doubt
over the role played by the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) headed by Australian diplomat Richard Butler, and called
for a quick ending to the U.S.-British strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"These heavy strikes have created a new situation which cannot
but have consequences on the UNSCOM, on its role and its methods,
as well as all others," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The French daily Liberation said that according to U.N.
sources, Butler had deliberately given an alarming conclusion in
its report on Iraqi cooperation in disarmament in order to give a
motive to the United States to strike Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler exaggerated a small number of Iraqi non-compliances and
left out more than 300 examples of full cooperation by Iraq,
Liberation quoted the unnamed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The (Butler's) report contains many imprecisions. We would
have questioned him about the degree of graveness of the incidents
(of non-compliance)," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She said that France regretted that the debate engaged by the
United Nations Security Council had not been able to avoid a
military action which is costing heavy loss of life in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that the examination of the report of Butler had not
taken place," she said. "If there had been a debate at the
Security Council, France would have posed questions."
</P>
<P>
She also criticized the withdrawal of U.N. personnel from Iraq
by Butler without consulting the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Friday, French President Jacques Chirac called for an ending
to the strikes as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Blair also discussed the post-strike relationship
between the U.N. and Iraq, said French presidential spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Chirac suggested that the international community have a
long-term strategy toward Iraq to end the cycle of crises which
keep coming up in the relations between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"The present situation is not satisfactory. We should go out of
it as soon as possible," said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Issues Plea For Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- First lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, speaking as the U.S. House of Representatives debated
impeaching her husband, issued a plea Friday for reconciliation
"to end divisiveness" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton, asked to comment on the impeachment
proceedings, spoke of the need to deal with the problems facing
many in the country rather than with the woes facing President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
She said Americans share her "approval and pride" in the way
the president does his job. And she added, "In this holiday
season... we in our country ought to practice reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
Four articles of impeachment against Clinton, approved by the
Republican-dominated House Judiciary Committee last week, include
two counts of perjury, one of obstruction of justice and one of
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The debate was scheduled to start Thursday, but delayed in the
wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders decided Thursday to debate the
impeachment articles despite the objection by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to avoid
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  Saddam Calls on Iraqis to Resist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Friday called on his nation to resist the U.S. aggression against
Iraq, saying he would not make any comprise with two big powers.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to the Iraqi people, the first since the
U.S. and Britain launched missile and air strikes early Thursday,
he said, "Continue your resistance and, by God's will, you will be
victorious."
</P>
<P>
Saddam, in his military uniform, told Iraqis, "You are
representing justice and all the great characteristics against
injustice."
</P>
<P>
He said, "You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the
Iraqi flag and you have proved again that you are heroic."
</P>
<P>
"Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In
the name of God, strike them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice.
We will not let evil triumph over virtue."
</P>
<P>
Saddam praised the Iraqi armed forces and the
air defense troops, who have firing anti-aircraft guns at the
cruise missiles fired by the U.S. and British forces in the Gulf
targeting Baghdad during the past two days.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. Shame will be on
them, the followers of Satan and evil."
</P>
<P>
He concluded his five-minute speech with the slogans: "Long live
great Iraq! Long live the great Arab nation! Long live Palestine,
and doomed are our enemies!"
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq on pretext
that Iraq had failed to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors who
were on a mission of disarming Iraq. During the two-day air
strikes, at least 25 people have been killed and another 75
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military officials said that some military targets in
and around Baghdad have been destroyed and further strikes will
follow until facilities capable of producing weapons of mass
destruction are destroyed and the ability of Iraq to threaten its
neighbors is reduced.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The visiting
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao Friday called for closer
cooperation between China and Vietnam in face of the challenges
they meet in economic development and the changing international
situation.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with General Secretary Le Kha Phieu of the
Vietnamese Communist Party, Hu said Sino-Vietnamese friendship has
a long history and the two countries have forged profound
friendship in their protracted revolutionary struggle and
socialist construction, according to a spokeswoman for the Chinese
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Since they normalized their relations seven years ago, he said,
the two countries have seen smooth development of their ties and
increasing cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have similar national conditions and common
ideals and they face the similar challenges in their economic
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
"These similarities and the changing international situation
require us to carry on the traditional Sino-Vietnamese friendship
and cooperate more closely to bring into the 21st century a
lasting and stable relationship of neighborly friendship and
all-round cooperation," said the vice president who arrived here
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will explore together with Vietnam the
framework for bilateral relations in the new century and endeavor
to carry out the political consensus reached by the two countries'
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the
Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to Phieu's visit
to China early next year and is looking forward to extensively
exchanging views with him on major questions concerning the two
countries' relationship and the regional and international
situation.
</P>
<P>
Phieu noted that Vietnam and China are close neighbors and the
Chinese people provided selfless and precious assistance to the
Vietnamese people in their struggle for independence and
liberation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the Vietnamese Communist Party and people's thanks
for the support.
</P>
<P>
At present, he pointed out, the two countries are working
toward the same goal and "we have every reason to join hands and
strengthen cooperation in various fields."
</P>
<P>
He called for the careful handling of the border issue and
other questions left over by history in the interests of the two
countries' relations and from a strategic point of view so that
the friendly relations between the two countries will continue to
develop.
</P>
<P>
The two sides briefed each other on the situation in their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Phieu said China is an important country in the region and the
world as a whole and Vietnam is pleased to see that China has
further boosted its national power and enhanced its position in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Hu praised Vietnam for its progress in
renovation and opening-up and wished the country more success in
its revolution and construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Royal Air Force
(RAF) confirmed on Friday that there was a mechanical problem in
one of its Tornado planes while conducting a raid on Iraq
Thursday, but denied it was hit by Iraqi fire.
</P>
<P>
RAF spokesman Captain Bryan Collins said at a press conference
here that there emerged a mechanical failure in one of the British
aircraft taking part in the strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the technical problem to intensive missions
conducted by the warplane.
</P>
<P>
Collins said that despite the mechanical failure, the plane
evaded Iraqi anti-aircraft fire and flew back to the base.
</P>
<P>
None of the crew members aboard the plane was hurt, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that British RAF Tornadoes carried out two waves of
"successful" raids. But he did not give the number of Tornadoes
taking part in the operation.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 Tornado jets of the British air force stationed at
Kuwait's Ali Al-Salem air base.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Accepts Neeman's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned his Finance Minister Yaachov Neeman
Friday that his resignation has been accepted, Netanyahu's office
said.
</P>
<P>
Citing his opposition to the internal political struggle
within the coalition government and the lack of progress in
passing the 1999 state budget in the parliament, Neeman tendered
his resignation to Netanyahu earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Neeman told Israeli Radio Friday that he can not tolerate
the coalition parties' hunger for seeking public funds for their
parties interests and its better for him to leave the
government.
</P>
<P>
During their telephone conversation, Neeman was reportedly told
Netanyahu that he was glad that Netanyahu at last choose to
support early elections in the country, but the former finance
minister advised Netanyahu that the best way to solve the
current political crisis is to form a national unity government
with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Neeman was the only one non-partisan cabinet minister in
the Netanyahu's government and his resignation could cause
political damage to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced Wednesday that will initiate early
elections next Monday if no majority is found for his
policies. Israeli Knesset (parliament) will vote on Monday on a
bill, calling for early elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The coalition partner the third way stated again Friday
that its four Knesset members will vote for the bill, thus
the bill could probably be passed in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu spent a busy day Friday in consulting with his key
Likud members and cabinet ministers on this issue, saying he
prefers the next elections be held next March or April or June.

ADDIS ABABA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) says Friday that natural disasters in
the outgoing 1998 have seriously damaged or destroyed tens of
thousands of school facilities in various parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the UNICEF said China was the
hardest hit country where more than 9,000,000 children were
affected by severe floods, which damaged 48,766 schools. The
estimated value of the destruction is 1.242 billion U.S. Dollars,
the press release added.
</P>
<P>
It said that Bangladesh has also lost about 14,000 schools to
natural catastrophes in the year.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that torrential rains from October
1997 to January 1998 flooded most of central and southern
Somalia, damaging or destroying 100 schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, a total of 1,419 schools in
the Dominican Republic were affected by hurricane georges in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is offering on-the-ground expertise and help,

traumatized and dislocated by 1998's natural disasters, the press
release quoted UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy as saying.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov on Friday
condemned the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers exchanged views on the developments of the
Iraqi crisis in a telephone conversation, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the U.S.-British "aggressive measures"
against Iraq cannot be explained, and any use of force needs the
ratification of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Britain launched air strikes against Iraq, without
warning, Wednesday night for what they called Iraqi
non-cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called for immediate stop of military action against
Iraq, saying that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, as chairman
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), was eager to
see the 55-nation body play an active part in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government also needs to bolster its cooperation
with the U.N. Security Council and refrain from giving the U.S
excuses, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that the U.S. and British measures against Iraq
should have been approved by the U.N. Security Council before they
were executed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Security Council needs to assume an
active role to end the crisis and expressed his desire to see the
OIC find a way in resolving the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Knowledge of Stray Missile in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A Pentagon spokesman on Friday
denied any knowledge of a stray cruise missile hitting the Iranian
port city of Khorramshahr on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reporter in Washington that
U.S. Defense Department knew "nothing" about the missile that fell
in Khorramshahr at the start of the joint U.S.-British air strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. and Britain launched combined air strikes midnight
Wednesday, a missile went awry and hit downtown Khorramshahr, a
southwestern port city close to the Iraqi border, causing no
injury but some property losses.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged a strong protest to both London and Washington
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iran considered the stray missile attack as a "violation of
Iranian territorial integrity" and warned the United States and
Britain not to repeat such a mistake.
</P>
<P>
A British Defense Ministry spokesman on Friday also rejected
responsibility for the stray missile attack.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman told IRNA in London that Iran should
"really speak to the Americans" about the errant missile that fell
in Khorramshahr.
</P>
<P>
It is "not for us to comment" on what was reportedly a
U.S. missile, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson on Thursday declined
to comment on the incident, saying that he had no information of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman from the British Foreign Office said
that it was an "operational matter," which would concern the
Defense Ministry rather than the Foreign Office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Starts Impeachment Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives began debate Friday on four articles of
impeachment against President Bill Clinton about his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The four articles, approved by the Republican-dominated House
Judiciary Committee last week, include two counts of perjury, one
of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The debate began with the reading of the four articles of
impeachment by Paul Hays, the House reading clerk.
</P>
<P>
Illinois Republican Ray LaHood presided over the impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
Republicans argued President Clinton should be ousted for
betraying "the people's trust." Democrats demanded the lesser
penalty of censure.
</P>
<P>
"No man or woman, no matter how highly placed, no matter how
effective a communicator, no matter how gifted a manipulator of
opinion, or winner of votes, can be above the law in a democracy,"
House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde declared, laying out the case
against the president.
</P>
<P>
Democrats argued for the lesser punishment of censure, saying
Clinton's transgressions in covering up the Monica Lewinsky affair
did not warrant removal from office.
</P>
<P>
"Some of our colleagues have been too quick to pick up the
hammer of impeachment and swing it with reckless abandon," said
Representative John Lewis, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
John Conyers, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee, who served in Congress during Watergate, said,
"Impeachment was designed to rid this nation of traitors and
tyrants, not attempts to cover up an extramarital affair."
</P>
<P>
The debate was scheduled to start Thursday, but delayed in the
wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders decided Thursday to debate the
impeachment articles despite the objection by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly object to this matter coming up tomorrow or the
next day or any day in which our young men and women in the
military are in harm's way," said Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to know when the troops will have completed
their mission," said House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston.
"We cannot refrain from advancing the people's business on this
critical issue."
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to void
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> France to Propose UNSCOM's Replacement </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- France will propose to other
members of the United Nations Security Council the replacement of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) with a new control system of
disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry officials said Friday that France
believes that the UNSCOM will not be able to resume its work in
Iraq again in the wake of the on-going U.S.-British strikes.
</P>
<P>
A new control system should be "acceptable, efficient, and not
a creator of tensions," said French officials.
</P>
<P>
France also wishes to impose an international control on the
financial influx into Iraq, which is made possible by the "oil for
food" program, in order to prevent the Iraqi regime from re-arming
itself and to make sure that the humanitarian program with Iraq
really benefit Iraqi civilians.

LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday its
warplanes had struck a base close to Baghdad where Iraq was hiding
remotely piloted aircraft designed to deliver chemical and

Prime Minister Tony Blair's government played down criticism
from an angry Russia, which withdrew its ambassador from London,
and sought to rally international support for the air strikes,
which have left the international community divided.
</P>

Meanwhile, Moscow pulled its top diplomat out of London for the

telephone to his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, according to
local media reports.

"They agreed the UK and Russia should work together in the
post-military phase (of the Iraqi crisis) and the tone was
friendly throughout," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair discussed the progress of the campaign for 15 minutes
from his Downing Street office with President Bill Clinton, their
first conversation since the start of the offensive by U.S. and
British forces against President Saddam Hussein's military assets.
</P>
<P>
He also telephoned German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French
President Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, seeking to rally support for
Britain's decision.
</P>
<P>
"While of course there are difficulties about this, and while
there is a genuine debate about how we take this forward, there is
a widespread understanding that the diplomatic track has been gone
down," a British spokesman was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry released film of a precision-guided bomb
from a Royal Air Force Tornado GR1 destroying a hangar housing the
planes at Talil air base southeast of the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson said the target was one of
several hit by Britain's 12 warplanes based in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Other clips of infrared video showed British bombs hitting a
radio mast, a hardened fighter aircraft shelter, and a
surface-to-air missile radar installation at unidentified sites in
Iraq, part of a vast air and missile offensive in which British
forces have joined the United States.
</P>
<P>
The pilotless planes could be equipped with crop spraying
devices and used to deliver deadly anthrax spores against Iraq's
neighbors, according the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Defense Staff Sir Charles Guthrie said it was known
that Iraq had upwards of a dozen of the pilotless planes. "How far
the program has developed I am not sure, but we do know it is work
he has placed great urgency on and given it a high priority," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson and Guthrie told a news conference the attacks had
caused significant damage to Iraq's military machine and would
diminish Saddam's hold on power by undermining his control over
his forces, including the Republican Guard.
</P>
<P>
Robertson repeated his warning to Iraq that "we are not going
away" once the military operation was completed.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Begin 3rd Wave of Air Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
launched a third wave of strikes on Iraqi military installations
at noon Friday as the list of targets widened to include
television transmitters and oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen confirmed that the total
number of cruise missiles in the operation "Desert Fox," which
started Wednesday, has exceeded the total during the Gulf War in
1991.
</P>
<P>
"We have ongoing operations," Cohen said. "The United States
and British forces are continuing to attack a wide range of
military targets."
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also said there have been no American or
British casualties from the strikes on Iraq in the previous two
days.
</P>
<P>
Working against relatively light Iraqi resistance, U.S. and
British forces were for the most part, hitting their intended
targets, but "not all have gone as planned," said Army Gen. Henry
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
The third day of strikes was going on in darkness over Iraq as
the House debated whether President Bill Clinton should be
impeached and senior military officials held a noontime news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Shelton admitted that there's some news in the operation which
is "not quite as good" despite some success the U.S. and Britain
have achieved.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Thomas Wilson, a senior official on the Pentagon's
Joint Staff, said Iraq has yet to fire any surface-to-air missiles
at the attacking aircraft.
</P>
<P>
One reason is Iraqi reluctance to expose hard-to-replace
military equipment to attack; another is the destruction of air
defense radar systems during the first phases of the strike.
</P>
<P>
"The southern Iraq air defense system has been degraded,"
Wilson said. "It has not been completely destroyed."
</P>
<P>
In a reflection of the difficulty of precision airstrikes even
against light resistance, Wilson showed charts indicating only a
handful of targets were judged to have been destroyed, with some
misses and some moderate damage.
</P>
<P>
Of 27 Iraqi surface-to-air missile facilities attacked, eight
suffered no damage, two had light to moderate damage, two had
severe damage and one was destroyed, said Wilson.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Lebanese held
protests on Friday across the country against the U.S.-led
airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 university students held a sit-in in front of the
United Nations office of Economic and Social Commission for
Western Asia in downtown Beirut.
</P>
<P>
They held up banners and pictures of dying Iraqi children, and
sang songs of solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"Stop killing Iraqi people and lift the sanctions on them,"
read one banner held by a student.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests also erupted in other areas, including the
southern coast cities of Tyre and Sidon, eastern province of Bekaa
Valley and southern town of Nabatieyh.
</P>
<P>
The independent Central News Agency reported that the
protesters denounced the U.S. aggression and violence against
Iraq, demanding the international community intervene immediately
and halt the "genocide" of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
After months of disputes over weapons inspections, the United
States and Britain Wednesday night launched the first wave of
their biggest airstrikes on Iraq since the 1991 Gulf war triggered
by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The second attack fell on Iraq Thursday night. At least 25
Iraqis were killed and 75 others wounded in the two attacks,
according to an Iraqi military communique.

<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Friday that the U.S.-led attacks on Iraq are
significantly damaging its military capability.
</P>
<P>
Blair, confirming that British Tornado fighters had again
joined the latest wave of attacks, said Britain and the United
States were on course to achieve their military objectives against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are on course to achieve our military
objectives," he told reporters at his Downing Street residence in
London.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt at all that we are significantly damaging
Saddam Hussein's military capability and reducing therefore, again
significantly, the threat that he poses to the region and to the
world."
</P>
<P>
The targets were Saddam's air defense systems, command and
control systems, missile production and ability to deliver weapons
of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a very great deal of understanding right
 round the world that Saddam Hussein does indeed pose a threat,
that it is necessary indeed to make sure that we reduce that
threat that he poses," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives decided Friday to cast a final vote on impeachment
articles against President Bill Clinton about his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached by Republican and Democratic
leaders, the House will debate the four articles of impeachment
until 10 p.m. EST Friday (0300 GMT Saturday) and then resume for
one hour at 9 a.m. EST (1400 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Following that, they will debate a procedural motion to send
the issue back to the House Judiciary Committee to include a
motion to censure, rather than impeach, the president.
</P>
<P>
When that debate ends, the House will start voting on the four
impeachment articles including two counts of perjury, one of
obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges End to Iraq Strikes: Ivanov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has ordered Russia's diplomats to make every effort to put an
immediate end to U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq, Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday after talks with the president.
</P>
<P>
At the talks Ivanov reported to Yeltsin the latest information
on the development of the situation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Moscow believes that "as soon as the military
actions against Iraq are stopped, it will be essential to make a
comprehensive review via the U.N. Security Council of the
situation with Iraq, including checking whether relevant
resolutions on disarmament have been implemented."
</P>
<P>
This will make it possible to see the true state of affairs and
not only what was said by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. Security Council must make political
decisions, while the Special Commission is a technical body of the
council.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing the military action has done is to aggravate
this situation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia "is ready to continue playing an active and constructive
role in the political settlement process and invites all others to
join in these efforts," Ivanov said.

MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-U.S. relations may
seriously suffer from the continuation of using force against Iraq
by the United States and Britain, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation Friday evening, Ivanov told
Albright that "this is not our choice," if the relations between
Russia and the United States became worse, according to the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov "urged Washington (to) stop using force and return to
the search for a political settlement to the situation involving
Iraq within the framework of the U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
If this happened, he said, "Russia will be ready, as before, to
interact constructively with the other U.N. Security Council
members in the interests of restoring a durable peace to the
Persian Gulf zone and fulfilling the appropriate Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was quoted as telling the U.S. secretary of state that
"the continuing military actions against Iraq are already having
serious adverse effects, not only on the situation in the Persian
Gulf, but also on a wider scale."
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister said, "It is necessary to do everything to
prevent a rollback in our relations.""This is important for both
our two nations as well as for stability and security in the world
as a whole," he added.

Albright, for her part, "fully agreed with this assessment,"

WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to maintain
broad-based relations despite differences over Iraq, the State
Department said Friday after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the message

solution and that we didn't come to this decision easily, that we

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Continues in Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The rebel UNITA troops are
launching constant attacks at the cities of Huambo and Kuito in
central Angola despite a series of losses, the Angolan military
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Angolan general staff, Daniel Dala, said that
the forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) are still surrounding Kuito and attacking the
provincial capital of Bie Province, although they lost 200
soldiers in Wednesday's fightings in Cunje of Bie and Boas Aguas
of Huambo Province.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that among the killed UNITA soldiers,
three white mercenaries were found but their nationalities are
not identified.
</P>
<P>
Dala said that in the battle for the control of Kuito, the
Angolan government troops destroyed seven UNITA's BMP armored
combat vehicles and captured three same vehicles, two Shut
missiles and 46 AKM and PKM automatic weapons and weapons which
the government troops are not familiar with.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that the situation in central
Angola remains "desperate", saying that the UNITA is building up
troops in Cunhinga, 30 kilometers northwest of Kuito in
preparation for launching new attacks.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the rumor that the UNITA troops gunned down five
government bombers.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the government troops are capable of
controlling the situation, Dala pledged that the government
forces will defeat UNITA's attacks and bring about peace to the
people again.
</P>
<P>
Since early December when the UNITA launched attacks against
the government, more than 100 civilians have been killed and a
large number of others wounded while some 100,000 people have
been forced to flee their homes, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that UNITA rebels Friday attacked the
northeastern Angolan city of Malanje in a further sign of
escalating fighting in the country.
</P>
<P>
The northern Malanje Province borders UNITA's highland
headquarters around Andulo in Bie Province. Malanje City lies on
the main road connecting Angolan capital Luanda and the
diamond-rich northeastern provinces of Lunda North and Lunda
South.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting between Jonas Savimbi's UNITA and government
troops erupted on December 5 with heavy battles taking place
outside Kuito in Bie.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has shattered 1994 peace accords signed in
Zambian capital Lusaka between the Angolan government and the
UNITA, which ended two decades of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament President Criticizes U.S. for Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis on Friday criticized the U.S. for the air
strikes against Iraq, saying that nobody could applaud the
military actions jointly launched by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis told the state-run Ant1 Radio that the reasons put
forward by Washington for the air strikes were "a pretext only."
</P>
<P>
It was clear that Washington used the principles of
international law and the decisions of the U.N. Security Council
whenever it believed it was in its interests, whether for
strategic interests or even for domestic reasons, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also accused the U.S. of using double standard in
regard to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkish troops had for 25 years occupied 40
percent of Cypriot land and despite U.N. resolutions which Turkey
was indifferent to, the U.S. had not shown interest in bringing an
end to the occupation.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister Yannos Kranidiotis Friday also
said after a cabinet meeting that the international community must
exercise its influence so that international law and international
rules were always employed and avoid the phenomenon of double
standard.
</P>
<P>
"The case of Cyprus is another such phenomenon, on which the
international community is not as consistently displaying the same
zeal it is showing on Iraq," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has not openly condemned the air strikes
against Iraq but expressed its concern over the developments in
Iraq and hoped the military actions could end as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
reportedly condemned the U.S. Thursday for launching the air
strikes against Iraq without informing the U.N. Security Council
in advance.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Greece was against the practice of
the strong attacking the weak.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament President Attacks U.S. for Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis on Friday criticized the U.S. for the air
strikes against Iraq, saying that nobody could applaud the
military actions jointly launched by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis told the state-run Ant1 Radio that the reasons put
forward by Washington for the air strikes were "a pretext only."
</P>
<P>
It was clear that Washington used the principles of
international law and the decisions of the U.N. Security Council
whenever it believed it was in its interests, whether for
strategic interests or even for domestic reasons, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has not openly condemned the air strikes
against Iraq but also expressed its concern over the developments
in Iraq and hoped the military actions could end as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos reportedly
condemned the U.S. Thursday for launching the air strikes against
Iraq without informing the U.N. Security Council in advance.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Greece was against the practice of
the strong attacking the weak.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, The youth group for Greece's
Coalition of the Left and Progress Party Friday held a rally
outside the U.S. embassy in Athens to protest the attacks against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Oman, UAE Consider Issuing Joint Tourist Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Oman and the United Arab
Emirates are studying a proposal to issue a single tourist visa
enabling visitors to travel freely between the two neighboring
Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
The Khaleej Times reported Friday that the two sides are also
considering setting up an Oman-UAE tourism company.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Bin Khamis Al Balushi, Omani Tourism Under-Secretary
held talks in Muscat with Khalid Bin Sulayem, Dubai's director
general of Tourism and Commercial Marketing.
</P>
<P>

and promotion operations, sea cruises, combined tourist trips to
Oman and the UAE, setting up infrastructure projects, cooperating
in training and simplifying border crossing procedures for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
"One suggestion," he said, "has been that a single tourist
visa be issued entitling tourists to travel freely between the
two countries. We also looked at ways of boosting bilateral
tourism between the Sultanate and the UAE."
</P>
<P>
He said a study would be carried out on setting up a joint
Oman-UAE tourism company, and a working group set up to follow up
decisions taken during the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreeed that Oman and the UAE "are well qualified
to operate as a single tourist destination," he said.

<HEADLINE> Strikes Against Iraq Prompt Surge of Internet Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Traffic on the Internet has
jumped as users worldwide turn to their computers for the latest
news update covering the strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Many of the news sites in America and in the UK were able to
beat national newspapers and television stations in getting
information about the air strikes to the public first.
</P>
<P>
While millions of people were able to tune in to television for
the coverage of the air strikes in Iraq, millions more were at
work with no TVs in sight.
</P>
<P>
For these people, the Web, unhindered by many of the
territorial boundaries inherent in traditional media, offered a
way to get what otherwise would have been inaccessible news.
</P>
<P>
As many as 500 people streamed into the chat rooms of the Web
site of CNN, American's cable news network, just after the first
strike was announced 22.00 GMT time Wednesday. The traffic of
CNN's Website peaked at 475,000 hits per minute at one point.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing a vital link to breaking events, the
Internet has also been used as a vehicle for public opinion, with
users registering their feelings live online as each new
development occurs.
</P>
<P>
CNN's site, for example, features a message board where
Internet users from around the world have given a mixed response
to the military action.
</P>
<P>
Most sites were also giving users the chance to vote on whether
air strikes should have been made on Iraq. Britian's Sky News web
site reflected much of the public opinion, with the voting split
60-40 in favour of the action.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Online service AOL conducted an online chat session
between users and a journalist in Baghdad, and said up to 12,000
people took part.

<HEADLINE> Arab and Muslim Americans Protest Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab Americans and
Muslim Americans, outraged by President Bill Clinton's order to
launch air strikes against Iraq, have been protesting the
military action, saying it could only devastate the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
"It is appalling that after eight years of sanctions ... the
United States government would seek to cause further death, pain
and suffering of the Iraqi people," said the American-Arab
Anti-discrimination Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that economic sanctions and military strikes
are the answer," James Zogby, president of the Arab American
Institute, said.
</P>
<P>
Zogby said he expressed those concerns to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in a conference call on Thursday night that
included other Arab-American leaders.
</P>
<P>
Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, is sending an open letter to
President Bill Clinton urging him to halt the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Awad said Clinton's decision to launch the strike on
Wednesday before the fasting month of Ramadan has been "overused."
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Muslim Public Affairs Council gathered a
group of scholars and Iraq experts on Thursday to discuss U.S.
policy on Iraq and the repercussions of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
"The attack will severely damage America's image in the
region," said Salam al-Marayati, director of the council.

<P>
BEIRUT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, Saturday announced two fighters of its group have
been killed by Israeli forces in south Lebanon, the Voice of the
People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two guerrillas were killed on Friday in their attack
on the Israeli post of Masharoun inside its occupied zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualties raised to 30 the number of Hezbollah
guerrillas killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Twenty three Israelis were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also said one of its units on Friday afternoon
launched an offensive on an Israeli post at Dair Harfai in the
central sector of the border zone.
</P>
<P>
In repsonse, Israeli artillery troops heavily pounded several
villages on the edge of the so-called security zone, which
was set up by Israel in 1985 to protect its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
There has been no immediate report of casualties from the
latest conflits inside the zone, the radio said.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Call for Halt to Military Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia today urged
the United States and Britain to immediately cease military
actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov issued the call in verbal messages.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China supports peaceful solutions for international
conflicts, and opposes the use of force in international relations.
</P>
<P>
"The American and British use of force against Iraq without the
authorization of the Security Council runs counter to the United
Nations Charter and norms of international law," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He added that the most urgent thing is for the United States
and Britain to immediately cease military actions in order to
avoid more civilian casualties and prevent escalation of tension
in the Gulf and in the Middle East as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"China is consulting with relevant parties to find a political
solution to the crisis," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that American and British military actions against
Iraq will not only reverse the process of Iraqi disarmament, but
will also undermine the international relations system centered on
the United Nations in safeguarding international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not allow the world to go back to the Cold War time
which allowed might to outweigh the rule of law, according to
Ivanov.

WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Speaker-Elect
Bob Livingston, a Republican lawmaker, said Saturday that he would
not serve as the next House speaker and will leave Congress next
year.
</P>
<P>
Livingston apologized for having engaged in extramarital
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow... I will not stand for speaker of the House on January 6
but rather will remain as backbencher in this House I love so
much," Livingston said as the House fell silent. He said he would
quit Congress after six months.
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker and I
believe I had...to do a fine job, but I cannot do that job."
</P>
<P>
Livingston began his speech by calling on Clinton to resign
after being impeached, but then said he could not do so unless he,
too, resigned.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Continues Impeachment Debate Against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives began the second-day debate Saturday morning on
the four impeachment articles against President Bill Clinton about
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The four articles, approved by the House Judiciary Committee
last week, include two counts of perjury, one of obstruction of
justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's debate, the Democratic Party said that the
impeachment was designed to "rid this nation of traitors and
tyrants, not attempts to cover up an extramarital affair." While
the Republican Party insisted that the impeachment was "unrelated
to sex, and was being sought because of perjury and obstruction of
justice."
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to cast a vote on the impeachment
articles on Saturday afternoon after debate in the morning.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to void
impeachment.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy, Taliban Hold Talks in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy
on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi held talks with a top level Taliban
team here on Saturday focusing on the investigation into the
killing of Iranian diplomats and the security situation in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, senior advisor to Taliban's
supreme leader Mulla Muhammad Umar, led the militia team in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides reviewed the Afghanistan-Iran ties, the
U.N.-Taliban relations and the internal security situation in
Afghanistan," said a Taliban leader who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We apprised the U.N. envoy of the process of investigation
into the killing of Iranian diplomats and journalists in
Mazar-I-Sharif as well as the progress on the implementation of
security agreement signed between the two sides in Islamabad in
October this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations earlier announced that a fact-finding
mission had been sent to Afghanistan to probe into the killing of
Iranian diplomats and mass killings of people in Northern
Afghanistan. But Brahimi said on arrival on Friday that the team
would only be dispatched after the security situation was improved
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. staff and other humanitarian workers pulled out of
Afghanistan in August following the killing of an Italian worker
in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Taliban reached a security agreement in October
for the safety of the world body's staff as a precondition for
their return.
</P>
<P>
"We called for the return of U.N. international staff to
Afghanistan under the security agreement ... as Taliban have
implemented most of the conditions in the accord," the Taliban
official said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Taliban also renewed their demand for the
release of Taliban prisoners in Iran, saying that they have freed
all the Iranian prisoners, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Celebrities in Macao shared the
view that Macao's return to the motherland next year will proceed
smoothly and will be an exciting event for the people in Macao
and the people in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return will represent another great event for the
Chinese nation and the second step toward the peaceful
reunification of the motherland after the return of Hong Kong, Ma
Man Kei, president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, said
Saturday afternoon at a seminar marking the one-year countdown to
the return.
</P>
<P>
"We can say for sure that Macao will return to the motherland
smoothly, and the Macao people will march into the 21st century
together with the people of various ethnic groups throughout the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hoi Sai Iun, vice-president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce,
said that "people of industrial and commercial circles in Macao
will continue to make concerted efforts in creating a new future
for Macao while relying on the strong and stable motherland."
</P>
<P>
Pun Iok Lan, vice-president of the Macao Federation of Trade
Unions, said that Macao residents' enthusiasm for loving the
motherland and Macao has laid a good foundation for various kinds
of the work related to a smooth return.
</P>
<P>
"We totally believe that Macao can witness a steady transition
and maintain long-term development with the strong backing of the
motherland and the active participation and concerted endeavor of
the Macao people," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ieong Sau Man, chairwoman of the Council of Macao Women's
Federation, said that women in Macao will take an active part in
the affairs in Macao's post-transitional period with a pioneering
spirit and make sure that Macao returns to the motherland
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Ng Si Meng, director of the Macao Association of Neighborhood
Communities, said that "the return will make Macao residents get
rid of the colonial rule over the past 400 years" and that "the
400,000-odd people in Macao are ready to greet the exciting
historic moment."
</P>
<P>
Leong Chong Kao, vice-chairman of the Macao Association of
Returned Overseas Chinese, said at the seminar: "We have a deep
feeling that overseas Chinese will be bullied by others without
the reliance on the strong motherland."
</P>
<P>
Wang Wende, chairman of the Macao Association of Chinese
Enterprises, said that Chinese-funded enterprises have been
contributing to Macao's economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
"In the final year of Macao's transitional period, we will work
hard to ensure its steady return and the smooth handover of
political power," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Shing Chun, director of the Macao Daily News, noted that
Macao residents are marching toward the return with firm steps and
aspiring spirit.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the seminar, Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Macao Branch, pointed out Macao's development is the
result of the endeavor of the local people. "I believe the Macao
people are capable of governing Macao well after the return," he
said.
</P>

More than 100 people from all walks of life in Macao attended
the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Hosts Clean Asian Games, Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok Asian Games is one
of the most drug-free international sports meets, organisers said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"In this Asian Games we have found the lowest level of drug use
compared to other major sports events," said Ruangsak Siriphol,
chairman of the organizing committee's medical control
sub-committee.
</P>
<P>
Siriphol, the doctor in charge of testing for the 13th Games,
said "I cannot say whether it is the cleaneast Games, because we
have not conducted tests on every athlete, but we think so, as we
did random tests for prohibited drugs on athletes as specified by
each sport's federation."
</P>
<P>
Up to Saturday, more than 700 tests had been conducted on the
6,700 athletes with two announced drug cases of weightlifters, one
from Jordan and one from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jaber Rashid al-Ajmi of Kuwait, who finished 10th and last in
the men's over 105kg class on Monday, tested positive for the
steroid nandrolene.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Ayed Jassar Khawalder, in the 56kg competition, was
sent home after taking triamterene, a diuretic, to lose weight.

<HEADLINE> Wong Kam Po Wins Hong Kong's First Asiad Cycling Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AYUTTAYA CITY, Thailand, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Wong Kam Po
from Hong Kong, China, on Saturday beat intense heat and a strong
field to win for Hong Kong its first ever Asiad cycling gold here.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 100-km race, Thailand struck their second gold in
cycling when Banna Kumfu emerged as the winner.
</P>
<P>
Wong, 25, finished the 200 kilometers road race in four hours, 39
minutes and 27 seconds, edging early leader Makoto Iijima of Japan to
second by a margin of half a bike in the final sprint for the
checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy that four years' effort was not wasted," said
Wong, who added he bet correctly by following the Japanese rider
to dash out of the pack only 50 kilometers into the race.
</P>
<P>
Iijima won the silver medal while Victor Espiritu of the
Philippines carried home the bronze.
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Japanese Kaori Sakashita seemed to close
her grip on the gold in the final one kilometer when Banna dashed
forward.
</P>
<P>
Sakashita had to be contented with a silver while the bronze
went to Wang Shuqing of China.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorites Ma Huizhen of China failed to sprint into
the first pack as the race neared its end while her compatriot
Tang Quan squandered her chance by falling with 30 kms remaining.

<HEADLINE> UK Defense Chief: Latest Air Attacks on Iraq Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson said on Saturday the third wave of U.S.-British
bombardment on Iraq was successful.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Robertson said the United States
and Britain had so far attacked 100 targets in Iraq, but he
stopped short of promising that the allies would stop the attacks
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
He said British Tornado bombers hit the headquarters of Iraq's
crack Republican Guard in the latest wave of air attacks. Iraq's
biological and chemical war machine had been substantially
damaged, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Attacks last night were prosecuted successfully with precision
weapons against key military installations. I am glad to say all
of our planes have returned safely," he said at the news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Damaging the Republican Guard means damaging Saddam's capacity
to threaten his neighbors," he said. "It is a key target for us."
</P>
<P>
"We are still assessing the full impact of the damage we have
inflicted," he said. "However it is already clear we have
inflicted substantial damage on Saddam's chemical and biological
war machine and set back his ambition to threaten his neighbors."
</P>
<P>
"Some 300 Tomahawk Cruise missiles have been fired and around
100 air-launch Cruise missiles have been used. Coalition forces
have attacked about 100 separate, precise military targets," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The cruise missiles hit Ba'ath Party headquarters and
presidential sites, he said, adding that the attacks were 75
percent successful.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the attacks will stop any time soon, he said that
the allies will stop the attacks when the objectives are
achieved.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The House of Representatives kept an "appointment with
history" on Friday as lawmakers debated whether to impeach a
president for the first time in 130 years and split sharply along
party lines about whether the ultimate constitutional punishment
fits the nature of President Bill Clinton's alleged crimes.
</P>
<P>
-- The American-led bombardment of Iraq struck hard from the
first night at five Republican Guard divisions deemed essential to
protecting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from an armed uprising,
attempting to kill large numbers of the regime's most loyal
soldiers in their beds, according to a high-ranking defense
official with firsthand knowledge of the target list.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As the House of Representatives moved toward a vote on
impeaching President Bill Clinton, the Republican Party's standing
with the public dropped significantly matching its lower rating in
the past 14 years, the latest New York Times/CBS poll shows.
</P>
<P>
-- On the third day of the air assault on Iraq, the Pentagon
said that it was able to confirm that only 18 of its 89 targets
had been severely damaged or destroyed, despite waves of bombers
and more laser-guided cruise missiles than were hurled at Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's manufacturers
are displaying their products in over 500 booths in the 33rd Hong
Kong International Industrial Products Exhibition (Hong Kong
Products Expo), which opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), attended the opening ceremony of the
exhibition organized by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association
(CMA) of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, CMA President Herbert Liang
said that he hoped this exposition could enhance the confidence of
people from various sectors upon Hong Kong's industry and help to
promote Hong Kong's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that in addition to traditional products, a
technology zone has been established in this exhibition as a
response to the chief executive's call to promote Hong Kong's
economy with innovation and technology.
</P>
<P>
What's more, there are exhibitors from Macao, Taiwan and
China's mainland in this exposition, which will last for 25 days,
Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Making its debut in 1938, the exhibition has been organized by
the CMA to enhance Hong Kong's trade and industrial development,
and to promote Hong Kong's external trade. It has made enormous
contributions towards promoting Hong Kong's manufacturing industry
as well as local and foreign sales.

<HEADLINE> France Prepares to Evacuate Its Nationals from Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- France is preparing to evacuate
its nationals from Brazzaville, capital of the Congo Republic,
once the fighting between government forces and the rebels gets
out of control.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry officials said Saturday that no word
has been given to evacuate the expatriates so far, as the airport
of Brazzaville remains open and a regular Air France flight took
off from Paris Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the situation in Congo is now
confusing, as gunfires from heavy arms were heard Saturday morning
in the southern part of Brazzaville, until now untouched by the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The French government has set up a crisis-reaction group in
preparation for an evacuation, said officials.
</P>
<P>
There are from 300 to 450 French nationals in Brazzaville, of
whom many are now taking refuge in the French embassy, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government confirmed on Saturday that "armed
elements in civilian clothes and uniforms have infiltrated into
the southern districts of the capital, spreading terror and
looting."
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been going on since early this week between
government forces loyal to President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and
supported by Angolan troops, and "Ninjas" militiamen supporting
former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas.
</P>
<P>
Government troops massed last week in the Pool region around
Brazzaville following growing incidents of clashes with the
"Ninjas," who were hiding in the jungles of Pool after being
driven out of Brazzaville in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
French troops organized a large-scale evacuation of foreign
residents from Brazzaville in September 1997, when the city was
plunged into chaos due to fighting between forces loyal to
Sassou-Nguesso and those of Kolelas and former President Pascal
Lissouba.

<HEADLINE> China Retains Top Spot in Athletics with Sorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite its unbeatable 15-12
edge over chief rival Japan in the track and field, China is short
of cheers as its future rivals are emerging from everywhere -- the
former Soviet republics, Japan and South East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
With the Bangkok Games' last event of the men's marathon left
for Sunday without any Chinese entry, China is fated not to
achieve its pre-Asiad athletics goal of 18-20 golds, not to say
its glory in Hiroshima where it savored a rich harvest of 22 golds
against five for Japan.
</P>
<P>
"In Bangkok, we've suffered the worst in the long-distance
events," said Shan Xiutang, secretary general of the Chinese
Athletics Association.
</P>
<P>
From 200m to 5,000m and the marathons, neither its men athletes
nor women runners had ever awarded a single gold medal to China
that once dominated the long-distance events through the famous
protegees of coach Ma Junren who were kept away from the Bangkok
Games.
</P>
<P>
After a hiatus of four years, China lost some of its strong
bids, with a lone track gold achieved by its male athletes through
Chen Yanhao in the 110m hurdles, while the Japanese more than
doubled their tally.
</P>
<P>
"We cann't simply blame our athletes for their low-key notes as
both Japan and the former Soviet republics are tough enough and
South East Asian countries are upbeating in a rather quick pace,"
said the Chinese athletics official.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan sliced off four from the biggest cake of 45 golds,
fairly by its men and women athletes from both the track and field
events, including pole vaulter Igor Potapovich and woman hurdler
Olga Shishigina, while Uzbekistan licked the gold medals twice in
the javelin and decathlon.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had the most athletics gold of three in South East
Asia as Damayanthi Darsha triumphed twice in the women's 200 and
400 meters, and both Mohammad Sulaiman and Jyotirmoy Sikdhar
awarded to Qatar and India respectively with two golds apiece.
</P>
<P>
"Former Asian legend P.T. Usha, a quadruple gold medalist in
the 1986 Asian Games, has a great successor of Sikdhar," said Shan
after Sikdhar crossed the finishing line first in both the 800m
and 1,500m events.
</P>
<P>
After winning a double from his third and last Asian Games, the
29-year-old Sulaiman, who was crowned in the 1,500 and 5,000
meters here, has set his sights upon the Olympics, saying "I've
got five gold medals from the Asian Games and that's enough. I'm
going to prepare myself for Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Against the big win for the trio of Qatar, India and Sri Lanka,
China, apart from three walking golds, only got four track golds
in the 110m hurdles, the women's 100 meters and two relays, while
Japan had its national anthem echoed seven times in the track
events, including men's 100m and 200m through Koji Ito who set a
lone Asian record of 10.00 seconds in the 100m semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Blessing for the rapid progresses achieved by the South East
countries, and a strong warning for the once formidable sports
power.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Two Iridium Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 2C
carrier rocket lifted off this evening at 19:30 (Beijing time)
from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north China's Shanxi
Province carrying two U.S.-made iridium satellites into a
predetermined orbit.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch, the 13th since the Long March carrier
rocket family was introduced in October 1996, represented the
completion of China's 1998 launch schedule and highlighted the
progress of China's commercial launch service.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from the Xi'an Satellite Monitoring and Control
Center indicate that the distributor module carrying the satellites
separated the second stage and followed a predetermined flight
plan before entering the orbit some 11 minutes after the launch.
</P>
<P>
After sliding for 40 minutes, the distributor module altered
its course and boosted the two satellites into their predetermined
orbit at a perigee of 629.9 km, apogee of 646.92 km and bank angle
of 86.35 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The particular updated version of the Long March 2C carrier
rocket used for the launch was 40 meters long, 3.35 meters in
diameter and weighed 213 tons at launch.
</P>
<P>
The center designed an internationally advanced satellite heat
preservation technological system in order to ensure a successful
launch in freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
The iridium satellite system developed by Motorola is a global
telecommunications network which provides worldwide coverage
with 66 satellites in low-earth and land-based wireless
systems. Related satellites were designed for launches by carrier
rockets manufactured in the United States, Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
China fulfilled all launch contracts involving iridium
satellites before successfully completing the first make-up launch
on August 20. Today's second make-up was the 55th launch for the
Long March family.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 2C
carrier rocket successfully carried two U.S.-made iridium
satellites into a predetermined orbit today, marking China's 13th
successful launch since a previous failure more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Today's successful launch indicates that China's space industry
has stepped out of the shadow of the previous failure and shows the
increasing maturity of the nation's space technology.
</P>
<P>
China's space industry suffered serious setbacks in February
and August 1996 when two launch failures tarnished its reputation
and resulted in the cancellation and temporary suspension of
contracts, as well as the lose of potential contracts.
</P>
<P>
The space industry faced the difficulties squarely and staged a
comeback by adopting a series of measures to improve management
quality.
</P>
<P>
The industry launched one satellite in October 1996, eight
satellites involving six launches in 1997 and 10 satellites
involving six launches during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center's first launch in 1998 that
took place on March 26 was the 50th flight for the Long March
rocket family. The rocket carried two iridium satellites
manufactured by the U.S.-based Motorola Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The three subsequent launches of iridium satellites took place
on May 2, August 20 and today. China has recorded five successful
launches of iridium satellites since the first launch of two
satellites on December 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year was a particularly prominent year in China's space
history with the three records set for the Long March carrier
rocket family -- the greatest number of commercial launches, total
number of commercial satellites and overall total number of
satellites launched within a single year.
</P>
<P>
China's space industry, which entered the global market 13
years ago, experienced rapid growth in the early 1990s, but
witnessed a noticeable decline in the fall of 1996. The industry
regained its good reputation in 1997 by carrying out six
consecutive successful launches.
</P>
<P>
The industry has signed 25 international commercial satellite
launch and five satellite carrier contracts, and achieved 22
commercial launches and sent 23 foreign satellites into
orbit.

<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A home-made bomb exploded in an
entertainment house in Zamboanga City, the Southern Philippines,
Saturday afternoon, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency said that the house was some 40
meters away from the Sta. Maria Cathedral, about four kilometers
from the city proper.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the explosion, which occurred before
15:00 (07:00 GMT), because the occupants of the entertainment
parlor had vacated the area after the bomb was discovered 15
minutes before its explosion.
</P>
<P>
City Police Director Karib Muammil said the bomb was home-made
and contained a timing device.
</P>
<P>
Experanza Atilano, owner of the house, said her "customers"
noted two men who entered the place at 14:00 and sat for a while.
</P>
<P>
She said she got suspicious when the two men left minutes later
and upon inspection, she saw a plastic bag containing an object
which was "ticking" like a clock. Then she asked the police and
everybody to rush out of the house.
</P>
<P>
Muammil said his men will conduct an investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, a bomb exploded in the Shoppers Plaza, a
department store along Cesar Climaco Avenue in the city. At least
17 people were injured in the blast.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Sends Messages to U.S., Iraqi Presidents on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat has sent messages to
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
calling for an end to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA, following a cabinet meeting in the West
Bank town of Nablus Saturday, called on Arab leaders to join
forces to persuade Saddam to implement relevant U.N. resolutions,
the Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the radio did not disclose details of the messages.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have launched three rounds of air raids on
Iraq over the past three nights with the declared aim to avenge
Baghdad's defiance of the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 3,000 Palestinians continued demonstrations to
protest against the air strikes and 44 protesters were injured in
violent clashes with Israeli border police in the West Bank town
of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators burnt U.S., British and Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Palestinian police dispersed hundreds of demonstrators
at the small town of Rafal. Local journalists have been banned
to cover the anti-U.S. demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has kept a low-profile during current confrontations
between the U.S. and Iraq, refraining from publicly condemning
Washington, the major mediator in its peace-making with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes on Iraq came just a day after U.S. President
Bill Clinton wrapped up his three-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule area Tuesday to try to convince the two
sides to stick to the items of the Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement, which was signed
October in Washington, provide that Israel phases out its troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank within three months in
return for tougher Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, 750 Palestinian prisoners will be released by
the end of January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has suspended the implementation of the accord due
to the widespread Palestinian demonstrations over prisoner dispute
with Israel, which boiled over into violent street clashes.
</P>
<P>
Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners under the accord last
months, but most were common criminals, not the political
prisoners demanded by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In his message to Clinton, Arafat also urged Washington to
press Israel to carry out the land-for-peace agreement.

SHENZHEN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A shipment of 32,000 tons of
wheat the Australian government contributed to the United Nations
World Food Program (WFP) arrived in Shenzhen today.
</P>
<P>
David Gowry, a diplomat with the Australian Embassy to China,

</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the Australian government, one of the major
WFP donors, has donated a total of 312,000 tons of grain to China
in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Taib Doubles Up as Usha Bows Out (Day 14) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Mohamed Taib wrapped
up a golden double on the penultimate day of the Asian Games while
Indian track legend P. T. Usha succumbed to age and injuries in a
sad ending to her 19-year-long career.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China lifted 16 golds to boost its total to 129,
four more than the haul registered in the 1994 Games.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Japan overtook South Korea by one gold after it
was awarded most of the titles which Chinese swimmers handed over
after testing positive. But this time, Japan is set for third
overall.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which has snatched 64 golds against Japan's 52,
proved it was only second to China.
</P>
<P>
Taib, 29, completed an impressive track double Saturday,
winning the 5,000m to add to his 1,500m title.
</P>
<P>
"This was a great win for me because I have not done a 5,000
meters since the Asian Games gold in 1990," he said.
</P>
<P>
Injury-laden Usha ended her international athletics career on
Saturday after India dropped her in its runner-up performance in
the women's 4x100m relay which was won by China.
</P>
<P>
Usha, who has won 33 medals including 18 golds in Asian Games
and Asian Championships, had been hoping to end her career in
glory. "I'm very disapointed," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Usha, who won four golds and a silver at the
1986 Asian Games, failed to qualify for the 200m, finished sixth
in the 400m and missed the 4x100m medal.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yanhao became the first Chinese man to win a track gold as
the 26-year-old hurdler took the 110m event in 13.65 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"There was much pressure upon me since the Chinese male
athletes failed to win a gold from the track," Chen said. "I
thought about it a lot and didn't sleep well last night."
</P>
<P>
The women's 100m hurdle was won by veteran Olga Shishigina of
Kazakhstan in 12.63 seconds, who returned to track early this year
after serving two-year ban for using the same drug that Ben
Johnson did in the 1988 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Asian record holder Cai Weiyan of China took the women's pole
vault gold with a mediocre height of 4.00 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Voinov of Uzbekistan grabbed the men's javelin title
with a throw of 79.70 meters and the men's triple jump champion
went to Sergey Arzamassov of Kazakhstan, who soared to 17.00
meters in the fourth jump.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rowers, who received advice in training from world
known track coach Ma Junren, completed a sweep of their 11 Games
golds after taking six on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hongying, head coach of the Chinese rowing team, told
Xinhua earlier that Ma went to a training camp set up to toughen
up the rowers after their setbacks in the World Championships in
Germany in September.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wushu masters on Saturday added six golds to three they
won earlier. The other two golds went to Chinese Taipei and Hong
Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
In two showcase events, Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 in the men's
soccer final and China downed South Korea in the men's basketball
title game.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian soccer team, which lost to Oman 4-2 in a group
game, recovered well to score a string of victories to take the
most prestigious gold medal at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Karimi Homammadali got a perfect corner kick in the other side
of the post, beating the Kuwaiti goalie with a powerful header
just seven minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
At the 26th minute, Karim Baghari grasped one of their
scoring chances with a right footer after a fast break-through.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, China beat Thailand 3-0 for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion China won its fifth straight men's
basketball gold by beating South Korea 112-92.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoyong hit the game-high 24 points to lead six Chinese
players to finish in double figures.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players used their height advantage to control the
boards on both ends and out-rebound their South Korean rivals
26-15.
</P>
<P>
Seo Jang-Hoon led South Korea with 20 points and teammate Kang
Dong-Hee came from the bench to add 16.

<HEADLINE> Editorial on Macao Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, one of China's
most influential newspapers, will carry an editorial tomorrow
hailing the nation's resumption of sovereignty over Macao at the
end of the next year.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been an integral part of China since ancient
times. China's long-term objective has been to resume sovereignty
over Macao and safeguard territorial integrity of the nation,
according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao will represent yet another monumental event
in the history of the Chinese nation. Macao's return will not only
mark an end to Portugal's colonial rule, but also the complete
termination of the colonial rule in China. The end of colonial
rule is the common aspiration of all Chinese people, including
compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
Preparation for related celebrations are of great importance
for ensuring a smooth transition, as well as promoting the
development, stability and inspiration of the patriotic zeal of
all Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for selecting the chief executive of the Macao
Special Administrative Region and work relating to a smooth
transition are progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The capitalist system in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will
remain unchanged under the precondition that there is only one
China and the nation's strict adherence to the socialist
system. The editorial points to the aforementioned prerequisites
as an important part of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the "one country, two systems" formula has
been successfully implemented in Hong Kong and will undoubtedly
be realized in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Five-Nation Meeting Concludes in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The second ministerial meeting
of the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic
Cooperation (BIMST-EC) forum ended here Saturday afternoon after
issuing a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"We resolve to fully exploit the complementarities within our
region ... to develop short, medium and long-term plans and
strategies and to implement them in systematic and coordinated
manner, and to act as a bridge between South Asian and Southeast
Asian Regions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The five countries also resolved to strive to develop the
grouping into a free trade arrangement and to focus on activities
that facilitate trade, increase investment and promote technical
cooperation within the bloc, which was officially launched in
Bangkok, Thailand in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to remove constraints and facilitate trade in
goods and services and in people-to-people contacts, to pursue
sub-regional energy cooperation and to work towards transport and
communication network and linkages, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting, which was attended by state or deputy
ministers of the five countries, all situated around the rim of
the Bay of Bengal, adopted "the criteria for admission of
Observers and Guests."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the delegations from the five countries emphasized
"the need for establishing a BIMST-EC Economic Forum ... as an
important engine of greater economic cooperation and progress" in
the sub-region, which would serve to promote government-private
sector cooperation among the member countries, the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
They identified six sectors for cooperation -- trade and
investment, technology, transportation and communication, energy,
tourism and fishery.
</P>
<P>
Calling upon the concerned authorities and private sectors to
take steps towards implementing the recommendation to declare the
year 2001 as Visit BIMST-EC Tourism Year, the leaders said there
was significant potential for cooperation in the tourism sector in
"promoting people-to-people contact and reinforcing the
historical, cultural and economic synergies of the BIMST-EC
sub-region."
</P>
<P>
As transport and communication linkages play an important role
in enhancing commercial, industrial, cultural and social
interaction and tourism, it was very important to develop rail,
road, shipping and air linkages in the sub-region, to reinforce
complementarities among the five member countries, according to
the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Efforts would be made to draw up appropriate action plans and
to work out arrangements for the enhancement of cooperation in the
areas of natural gas, wind, solar and water-tidal wave energy
resources, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall seek to forge stronger links with development
partners and international organizations" and "reiterate ... the
importance of Asian solidarity, enhancing South-South cooperation
among developing countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
There was a need to coordinate positions and policies among the
member countries on major issues relating to international flows
of goods, services and capital within the framework of
international institutions, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting, which was inaugurated by Bangladesh
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad, was preceded by a two-day
senior officials' meeting here on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The next BIMST-EC ministerial meeting will be held in New
Delhi, India in late 1999.

Thailand in the semifinals, brought them the coverted title on Saturday.

seven minutes into the match.
</P>

they took the chance to launch their counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
At the 26th minute, Karim Baghari grasped one of their
scoring chances with a right footer after a fast break-through.
</P>
<P>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. president
Richard Nixon visited China in 1970s and received a porcelain
screen as a gift symbolizing the friendship between the United
State and China.
</P>
<P>
Similar works from Jingdezhen, a town located in east China's
Jiangxi Province which has been known as the nation's porcelain
manufacturing center for hundreds of years, are currently on
display in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The 20-day Guangzhou event is reportedly the largest of its
kind held in China to date.
</P>
<P>
Porcelain, or either china or chinaware as it sometimes known
in English, is considered to be one of China's most important
inventions. Experts note that the porcelain
manufacture can be traced to the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century
B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Jingdezhen emerged as one of China's most important porcelain
centers in the 11th century. Jingdezhen porcelain was initially
exported to and production techniques later spread to Japan, and
countries in both south Asia and east Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Two wars are disputing the screens of television and the
frontline of newspapers during "one day without any precedent in
the memory of the American," as it was put by the New York
Times. The explosion of bombs dropped by U.S. Army illuminated,
for the third day the nightly sky of Baghdad, while the
representatives of the people in the U.S. Congress began to debate
in Washington the impeachment procedure against the
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- Violent fighting between opposing forces in the Congo
Republic are spreading to the southern part of Brazzaville. Many
refugees are trying to flee to the neighboring city of Kinshasa in
the Democratic Republic of Congo under heavy artilleries fired by
the rival forces loyal to President Denis Sassou N'Guesso and
former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- This will be a dangerous weekend for U.S. President Bill
Clinton who will fight on all the fronts at the same time. The
House of Representatives opened on Friday debate on his
impeachment, at the very moment when the U.S. are engaged in the
most important military campaign since the end of the Gulf War,
which has triggered a diplomatic tension between Washington and
many countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The emergency psychiatric clinics of Paris received 1,500
patients of less than 25 years old last year. The young patients
were from all walks of life and many of them sought consultation
with psychiatric experts on their own will. One third of the
parents of these patients refused to contact the doctors.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Nahdlatul
Ulama (NU), Indonesia's largest Islamic Organization, Abdurrahman
Wahid Saturday held talks with former president Soeharto for a
"dialogue that would determine the fate of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Wahid told a press briefing after his one-and-a-half-hour
meeting with Soeharto that the former president expressed his
willingness to meet with President B.J. Habibie, Defense
Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said the dialogue will be limited to the four, as
inviting too many people would prevent it from producing a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
"Habibie will represent the civilian bureaucrats and Wiranto,
the military bureaucrats," Wahid, popularly known as Gus Dur,
said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he will represent his followers while Soeharto will
be invited because he still has many loyalists.
</P>
<P>
He said he will present the plan to Habibie. He, however, did
not mention when it would take place.
</P>
<P>
Wahid quoted the former president as saying that all parties
should work together to continue the government's development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Wahid has met Wiranto and Habibie separately during which they
agreed that a national dialog is needed to solve national problems
and an earlier presidential election will be held following the
general election on June 7 next year.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who had ruled the country for 32 years, stepped down
on May 21 this year amid the serious political and economic
crisis. But Wahid said the former president still has "real power"
because many people follow him.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Asks Zero-Tariff for its Export to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bangladesh Minister
for Commerce and Industry Tofail Ahmed Saturday called upon India
to allow 'zero-tariff' access for Bangladesh's exports to the
Indian market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce
and Industry in Calcutta, 1,461 km southeast of New Delhi, Ahmed
said that the balance of Indo-bangla trade was in favor of India.
While progressive tariff reduction by Bangladesh had helped Indian
exports, restrictive tariff still being imposed by India was
hampering exports from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
India's listing of 2,000 items for import without quantitative
restrictions had also not helped much as most of these were not
exported by Bangladesh, he said, adding that India should
especially consider zero-duty import of melamine, ceramic and
leatherware from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"Charity begins at home. If the developed countries within the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) do not
take steps to increase imports from its least developed countries,
one of the basic objectives of the South Asian Preferential Trade
Agreement (SAPTA) will remain unfulfilled," he further said.
</P>
<P>
Seven SAARC member nations have decided to put SAPTA into
effect by the year 2001 in the region. SAARC comprises Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

GENEVA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Austria's World Cup overall
leader Alexandra Meissnitzer won her first career World Cup
downhill to widen the scope of her supremacy after Saturday's
competition in Veysonnaz, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Meissnitzer stormed down the 2,500-meter Piste de l'Ours with
a time of one minute and 42.68 seconds, to add the downhill
victory to her wins in the super-G and giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, who has won five of 12 races this season, was
the only skier to break the 42 second barrier, with runner-up
Regine Cavagnoud of France was timed in 1:43.00.
</P>
<P>
World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl of Austria was third
in 1:43.17.
</P>

<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- All Iranian pilgrims who
were on a pilgrimage to the holy shrines in Iraq returned
home safely by Friday night, an Iranian official announced on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shahriyar Sorouri, an official in charge of hajj and
pilgrimage affairs told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
that 1,000 pilgrims arrived in the Iranian border port Khosrawi
on Thursday while another group of 1,500 returned home on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization Mohammad Hussein
Rezaei announced on Thursday that Iran has suspended the dispatch
of pilgrims to Iraq after the U.S. and Britain launched air and
missile strikes against its neighbor early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq reached the agreement in April, allowing Iran
to send 3,000 pilgrims every week to visit southern Iraq,
including Najaf and Karbala, as a step toward normalization of
relations between the two former enemies.
</P>
<P>
Iran started in August to dispatch pilgrims to Iraq according
to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Noted Macao Businessman Envisages Good Future By Zhang Yongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A well-known businessman in
Macao said that local residents will certainly have a brighter
future after Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I feel all sorts of feelings well up in my mind," Ma Man Kei,
president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, told Xinhua in an
interview just a few days before the one-year countdown to Macao's
return, which falls on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
For more than 400 years, Macao people have not been able to
control their own fate. In one year's time, Macao is returning to
the embrace of the motherland and the concept of "Macao people
governing Macao" will be achieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
"How can I, an old man having lived in Macao for over half a
century, refrain from feeling excited and happy!" said Ma, who
also serves as vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and
vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
What Ma Man Kei ponders most is how a steady transfer of
political power and smooth handover can be ensured. He noted that
the localization of civil servants and laws and the use of Chinese
as an official language have scored marked headway.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that China and Portugal should further
make concerted efforts in sincere cooperation so that the issues
can be handled well before the handover.
</P>
<P>
"It is also of great significance to better publicize the Macao
Basic Law, for the law is a fundamental one in the future Macao
SAR and embodies the principles of 'one country, two systems' and
'Macao people governing Macao'," Ma Man Kei said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Portuguese Macao government should be urged to
improve public security, reassure civil servants and make
preparations for the stationing of troops by the central
government of China in the Macao SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If each person has a feeling of stability and works hard to
build a new Macao, there will be no difficulties that cannot be
overcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the day of Macao's return to the motherland drawing near,
Macao residents are paying more attention to the current
situation with a stronger sense of participation. "That is a good
basis to manage well the work next year and ensure a smooth
return," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the problems in the local economy and public
security, Ma said, "we should see they are a combined result
of interior and exterior factors, and the effect of the factors
can be reversed with our endeavors."
</P>
<P>
With the strong backing of the motherland and the policy of
"Macao people governing Macao", the intelligence of the Macao
people can surely be exhibited fully, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that Macao will develop, and the future will
be better," Ma Man Kei said.

<HEADLINE> China Retains Basketball Gold in Asain Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China won
its fifth consecutive gold medal of the men's basketball at the
the Asian Games here on Saturday, beating South Korea 112-92 in
the final.
</P>
<P>
China led the first half 59-43.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men cagers won their first Asian Games' basketball
gold in 1978 and repeated it for four times in 1986, 1990, 1994
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoyong hit the game-high 24 points to lead six Chinese
players to finish in double figures. Gang Xiaobin also added 16
points and eight rebounds for China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players used their height advantage to control the
boards on both ends and out-rebound their South Korea rivals
26-15.
</P>
<P>
Seo Jang-Hoon led South Korea with 20 points and teammate Kang
Dong-Hee came from the bench to add 16.
</P>
<P>
China opened the game with an early fly of 10-3. With four
3-pointers and two fast-breaking dunks, the Chinese jumped to a
comfortable lead of 38-20 before building a 59-43 lead at the
interval.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, who snapped China's five-time title run in last
September's Asian Championhip, rallied with full-court press
defence to cut the gap at 61-53 in the first five minutes of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
That was the last time the Koreans looked up at the Chinese
players within 10 points before China surged away with a 16-0 run.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoyong's 3-pointer gave China a 77-53 lead with 13:04 on
the clock and the defending champion turned the rest of the time
into a showcase of layups and dunks and lang-range shots before it
sealed the victory by another 20 points.
</P>
<P>
China was 9 for 16 from the lang range while South Korea was 6
for 25 behind the arce.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Wang Fei said: "we played very good defence
to cover their sharp shooters like Moon Kyung-Eun and Kang
Dong-Hee."
</P>
<P>
South Korea head coach Choi Bu-Yung agreed with Wang Fei,
saying "the taller Chinese players just outbeat us in every
aspects of the game. We are not as tall as they are and not as
good as they are, both in offence and defence."
</P>
<P>
Before the final, the Philippines defeated Kazakhstan 73-68 to
win the bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Urges Firms to Prevent Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Commission on Year 2000 Compliance Saturday urged firms in key
sectors to submit their compliance reports on their efforts to
prevent the Y2K or "millennium bug" problem from afflicting their
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Establishments in the public and private sector that fail to
submit their monthly compliance reports face stiff sanctions
should they fail to comply, the commission warned in a statement.
</P>
<P>
These firms are supposed to submit their monthly reports on or
before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"All our hardware, software and electronic systems must be
Y2K-compliant on or before 30 September, 1999 to avert
infrastructure failure," stressed the Y2K commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission also warned that the Y2K may also affect vital
computer systems such as those in traffic units, airports and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K commission, in its earlier report to President Joseph
Estrada identified seven sectors as the most likely to be affected
by the Millennium bug. The seven sectors are: transportation,
power and water, telecommunications, government services, health,
manufacturing, and banking and finance.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in-flaw in older computer units
that use two digits to determine the date, thus raising the
possibility that such system might mistake the year 2000 for the
year 1900 when January 1, 2000 comes.
</P>
<P>
"The problem may be corrected, provided that the solutions are
timely made. Thus, all hardware, software and electronic systems
must be Y2K-compliant on or before 30 September, 1999 to avert
infrastructure failure," the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Israelis Not Panic For Possible Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Haim, who is in his fifties,
went out of make-shift mask distribution center set in a school in
central Jerusalem with seven small cardboard boxes, but he was not
eager to open them, in which were fresh gas masks.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the five mask distribution centers in Jerusalem
operating after the U.S. and Britain launched missile and air
strikes against Iraq during the last three days. They were set up
for possible Iraqi retaliation attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Like Haim, most of Israelis went to the gas mask centers with
a "better than nothing" attitude, rather than out of the thought
that Iraqi attack on Israel is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Joseph, a chocolate seller, who lives near the school and only
gave his first name, said, "Why did I come here? Because other
peoples have come."
</P>
<P>
Joseph's neighbor Anna, a Holocaust survivor, felt both
confused and frustrated over what was happening. "No matter what
happens, the Jews are always blamed. War after war, crisis after
crisis... Every time my heart pounds with worries. I just want to
live peacefully with my grandchildren, when will this day come?"
</P>
<P>
When a middle-aged man asked if he feared possible Iraqi attack
again, he, without giving his name, said "are you a newcomer
here? If you live here long enough, you will know nothing will
happen."
</P>
<P>
The gas mask distribution centers were the only disharmonious
signs on the streets. The life goes as normal, people go shopping,
buying daily necessities rather than plastic sheeting and masking
tapes used to seal windows and doors in possible missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israelis have developed iron nerves after experiencing several
false alarms, most believing no pending threat.
</P>
<P>
Iraq launched 39 scud missiles on Israel, the closest ally of
the U.S. in the Middle East, in the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent weapons inspections authorized by the U.N. to
eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have repeatedly run
into problems due to the disputes between Iraq and the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which monitors Iraq's
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said, the current air strikes on
Iraq starting three days ago, were the retaliation for Baghdad's
defiance of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has urged citizens to update their gas
masks in case Iraq launched another retaliatory missile attack on
Israel after the U.S.-British air strikes, although it said the
chance is low.
</P>
<P>
The make-shift gas distribution center in the Noam's Girls
School was deserted most of the time and some of the soldiers for
registering and distributing just sat idle. Dozens of big
cardboard boxes remained unopened behind them.
</P>
<P>
This posed as a sharp contrast to the hustle and bustle in the
country in the February Iraq - U.N. standoff, when long lines were
seen for gas masks, plastic sheeting and masking tapes, for
possible Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
The government and the media were blamed for the panic
then. The government, despite reassuring the Israelis that the
possibility of Iraqi attack was near zero, repeatedly urged the
people to get prepared for possible chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
Radio, TV and newspapers invested a lot of time and pages to
report about a possible attack.
</P>
<P>
This time, the government has chosen to take a low-key tune on
the air strike, calling on the people to go about their business
as usual while making necessary preparations, such as stocking and
updating their gas masks.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Premier Returns Home From Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Prime Minister
Hun Sen returned home Saturday afternoon by special plane at the
end of an official visit to Vietnam and an audience with King
Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing, China.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said at a press conference held in Pochentong
International Airport that he was very satisfied with his first
Hanoi visit and Beijing trip, including the decision of ASEAN to
admit Cambodia as the 10th member in the near future.
</P>
<P>
It was Hun Sen's first trip abroad since he became the sole
prime minister of Cambodia at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress of China, held a
meeting with Hun Sen and entertained him and his party on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is a unofficial visit, it has helped to strengthen
the traditional friendship between our two countries," said Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
"I also briefed current domestic situation to the monarch. The
King was very glad and said he hoped to return home next month,"
the premier added.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Beijing, Hun Sen had made a two-day visit to
Vietnam at the invitation of his Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van
Khai.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hanoi, he participated in the Sixth
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit as an
observer and held meetings with leaders of ASEAN members as well
as visiting Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Two agreements were signed between the two neighboring
countries on tourism and water transportation during Hun Sen's
stay in Hanoi, further strengthening and consolidating the
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen expressed his hope that a special admission ceremony
should be held in Hanoi as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's entrance into ASEAN was postponed after the July
1997 factional fighting, leaving it the only Southeast Asian
nation that is not a member of the regional grouping.

<HEADLINE> Government Forces Placed on Red Alert in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Government troops and police
forces in Basilan and Zamboanga City, the Southern Philippines,
Saturday were placed on red alert for possible attacks by Abu
Sayyaf extremists following the killing of their leader Abdurajak
Abubakar Janjalani.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, Director General Roberto T.
Lastimoso, acting chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP),
placed all police forces on the island of Basilan and Zamboanga
City on red alert for possible retaliatory attacks by Janjalani's
followers.
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso also ordered intensified pursuit operations against
remnants of Janjalani's group.
</P>
<P>
Janjalani, the country's most wanted criminal, was killed in
clash with a police patrol in Lamitan, Basilan, late Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Janjalani gained notoriety when he led in the raid of the town
of Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur, in April 1995, killing 54 civilians.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the southern Philippines, police
forces in the two areas have put up checkpoints in strategic
places to thwart any attacks by the Abu Sayyaf Group.
</P>
<P>
Government troops there have also increased security measures
together with the police forces.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Saturday
that the government is ready for possible attacks by the Abu
Sayyaf group following the killing of its leader.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to make sure this does not get out of hand," he
said in a radio interview.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Halt to Strike against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has called for an immediate stop of the U.S. and British
air and missile strike against Iraq, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The attacks on Iraq, which have been launched on the eve of
the holy fasting month of Ramadhan, should be halted immediately,"
Kharrazi said made in telephone conversations Friday night with his
British, Syrian, Egyptian and Saudi Arabian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the concern of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
who is also the chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) about the continuation of military strikes
against Iraq, which have so far claimed the lives of many innocent
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian, Egyptian and Saudi Arabian foreign ministers also
underlined the need for continuation of such contacts until a
proper solution is found to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his call to British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Kharrazi
voiced Iran's protest against a stray missile strike on Iran's
southwestern port city of Khorramshahr in Khuzestan province on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British unilateral strikes against the Iraqi nation
have caused serious concern in the Muslim world, he said, Iran, as
the OIC chairman, demands an immediate halt to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that the attacks against Iraq were aimed at
destroying Iraqi weapons of mass-destruction and Iraq should be
responsible for the preset situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would take into consideration Iran's
views as the OIC chairman.

<HEADLINE> Chen Yanhao First Man to Win Track Gold for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yanhao became the first
male athlete to win a gold medal for China from the track at the
Asian Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 26, claimed the 110 meters hurdle with a time of 13.65
seconds, beating Andrey Sklyarenko of Kazakhstan (13.68) and Hamad
Al-Dosari of Qatar (13.99) into second and third places.
</P>
<P>
"There was much pressure upon me since the Chinese male
athletes failed to win a gold from the track," Chen said. "I
thought a lot and did not sleep well last night."
</P>
<P>
Chen, who lost to compatriot and Asian record holder Li Tong in
Hiroshima four years ago, said his dream eventually came true.
</P>
<P>
"In home competitions, I always beat Li. But at abroad, he
always enjoyed an edge," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Li, who holds the Asian record of 13.25 seconds, retired last
year after losing to Chen at the Chinese National Games.
</P>
<P>
"If Li was here, I think the competition would have been more
fierce," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100m hurdle was won by veteran Olga Shishigina in
12.63 seconds, followed by Liu Jing of China in 12.89 and M. A. K.
Fonseka of Sri Lanka in 13.08.
</P>
<P>
Shishigina, 30, also gold medalist at the Asian Athletics
Championships last July in Japan, showed she is still the fastest
female hurdler in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakhstanian, silver medalist in the 1993 World
Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden, just returned to track last
February after being suspended for two years for taking banned
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Suleiman of Qatar completed a gold double by winning
the 5,000m in 13 minutes 55.79 seconds to add to his 1,500 title.
</P>
<P>
"It was so hot out there I did not think I was going to make it
to the end," said Suleiman, who has won five gold medals in four
Asian Games with three from 1,500 and two from 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"This was a great win for me because I have not won 1,500m
since the Asian Games gold in 1990," he said.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Ahmed Hashim won the silver in 13:56.65 and Baek
Seung-Do of South Korea the bronze in 13:57.11.
</P>
<P>
Asian record holder Cai Weiyan of China took the women's pole
vault gold medal with an unimpressive height of 4.00 meters.
</P>
<P>
Cai, who holds the Asian record of 4.35 meters, said this was
the worst performance in her career.
</P>
<P>
"I have never expected that, it's terrible," she said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ono Masumi and Cai's compatriot Sun Caiyun finished
second and third respectively, both with 4.00 meters.
</P>
<P>
All the three failed to clear higher and Cai took the gold
since she jumped over 4.00 and 3.90 meters in her first attempt.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women captured the final gold medal for their nation
from track and field competition in the 4X400m relay.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese quartet trailed India in the first two rounder, but
Li Yulian took the lead from the third and Chen Yuxiang anchored
the victory in 3:32.03.
</P>
<P>
India, without sprint legend P.T. Usha, finished second in
3:32.20 and Kazakhstan third in 3:37.16.
</P>
<P>
Usha, 34, who was expected to win the last medal in her career,
was dropped by the Indian officials at the last minute complaining
Usha was not fit, an Indian official said.
</P>
<P>
The gold was China's last from the track and field since no
Chinese takes part in the today's last event of men's 4X400m
relay, which was eventually taken by Japan.
</P>
<P>
China will not run in Sunday's men's marathon, the last event
of the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Voinov of Uzbekistan claimed the title of men's javelin
with a throw of 79.70 meters. Zhang Lianbiao of China finished
second in 78.58 and his compatriot Li Rongxiang third in 78.57.
</P>
<P>
The men's triple jump champion went to Sergey Arzamassov of
Kazakhstan, who soared to 17.00 meters in the fourth jump. He
registered only two jumps in six attempts.
</P>
<P>
Duan Qifeng of China came second in 16.98 and Nattapon Namkunha
of Thailand third in 16.42.

PYONGYANG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States' military

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Papers Slam U.S. Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian newspapers on Saturday
lashed out at the United States and Britain for launching military
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried by Al-Ahram daily accused the U.S. and
Britain of breaching international laws and norms by taking
unilateral actions without the approval of the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain has been firing missiles at Iraq since
Wednesday night for what U.S. President Bill Clinton said a
retaliation for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian most influential newspaper contended that the
military attack on Iraq will only serve to prolong the Iraqi
crisis rather than a real solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's Al-Gomhuria daily said the U.S. attack has
fed skepticism over the credibility of the international
legitimacy in dealing with the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government expressed regret Thursday at the U.S.
strikes against Iraq, calling for quick action to contain the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian newspapers, which used to keep silent over U.S.
activities in the Middle East, have recently been criticizing the
world's sole superpower for its policy towards Iraq and inability
to pressure Israel into carrying out peace agreements signed with
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Thailand to Win Bronze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANGKHLA, THAILAND, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China claimed the
bronze medal here on Saturday when they trounced the hosts 3-0 in
a lackadaisical soccer match of also-rans.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Ma Mingyu scored China's last goal in the 84th
minute after Fan Zhiyi and Wang Peng's goals, dashing Thailand's
any hope to claw back.
</P>
<P>
After losing in the semifinals, China and Thailan had to move
to this seaside resort, some 1,000 kilometers south to Bangkok, to
play the third-place playoff, which China's English head coach
Bobby Houghton deemed as dispensable.
</P>
<P>
"I see no point in holding a third-place playoff," the
golden-haired Englishman said after China losing to their nemesis
Iran 0-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate that both sides losing in the semifinal share
the bronze medal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, apparently still smarting from their 0-3 loss to
Kwuait in the semifinal, failed to find the scoring touch when
they saw their shots always flying over the crossbar in the first
20-minutes spurt of attacks.
</P>
<P>
China, after weathering through Thailand's early offenisives,
was awarded a freekick in the penalty area in the 26th minute when
Thailand Goalkeeper C. Khumplam was ruled intentionally
procrastinating.
</P>
<P>
Captain Fan, who plays in Crystal Palace of England, fired a
low ball which slashed open Thailand's badly organised defensive
wall and flew into the net.
</P>
<P>
Wang Peng, substitute for Frankurt-based Yang Chen, sent in
China's second goal in the 66th minute when he latched onto a
teammate's pass and chipped the ball over falling Khumplam into
the net.
</P>
<P>
Then Ma put the icing on the cake when he dribbled the ball
from the middle field and fired a sudden long shot on the left top
of the area.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Baghdad Residents Suffer Another Sleepless Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- For the 4.5 million Baghdad
residents, Friday night was another long and sleepless night, as
fierce U.S.-British bombing kept them awake and frightened.
</P>
<P>
People first expected air raids at 10 p.m. as was the case
Thursday night. But the raids did not come.
</P>
<P>
Then, people thought attacks might come around mid-night as it
did Wednesday night. But again nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
Even reporters got confused, because earlier reports from
Washington and London said a third round of strikes on Iraqi
military installations had been launched.
</P>
<P>
Some people thought maybe Baghdad would not be raided Friday
night, but they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
Around 01:00 a.m. local time Saturday, after a piercing gust of
sirens, thunderous explosions were heard. The sky over Baghdad was
lit up by Iraqi anti-aircraft gun fires.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that these explosions were not as big as those
Thursday night, and the duration was relatively shorter.
</P>
<P>
But that was not the end of the third round of U.S.-British
strikes.
</P>
<P>
At around 4: 38 a.m. local time Saturday, shortly before
daybreak, a new round of ear-deafening and continuous explosions
occurred in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On top of the two-story building of Xinhua office located in
the city center, traces of shells fired by Iraqi anti-aircraft
forces could been seen rising in all directions. Everyone could
feel the earth shaking at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the locations of those explosions, it was obvious
that more targets in Baghdad had been attacked by U.S-British
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
A local resident named Ziyad told Xinhua over telephone that
the most fierce explosions were very close to his home, which is
located in another district of the city center.
</P>
<P>
His wife and mother-in-law were horribly frightened by the huge
explosions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday morning, Mr. Jasim, another local resident and
a neighbor to the Xinhua office in Baghdad, said his wife and
children were very frightened during the U.S.-British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Only after the day broke, did my wife and children go to
sleep," he said, adding that "I hope they will stop bombing us
during the month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Moslems in Iraq and several other Arab countries began to
observe the holy month of Ramadan as of the daybreak of Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislators Condemn Air Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chairwoman of the Foreign
Affairs Commission of Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR)
Aisyah Aminy Saturday criticized the missile strikes by the United
States and Britain against Iraq, and called for reform of the
United Nations for acting "more fairly".
</P>
<P>
"The attacks should not merely be settled and stopped but
should also be criticized strongly by all peace-loving communities
because the deeds are contemptible and against human rights," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Aminy said the actions of the United States and Britain, who
claim to be champions of human rights, are against the basic
principles of human rights.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the people of Iraq, who have long been
suffering from the economic embargo imposed by the United Nations,
now have to bear heavy bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Aminy said the U.N. Security Council is still dominated by
superpowers who protect their own interests and not those of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in its upcoming general session, must make
efforts to restructure itself to enable it to act more fairly in
carrying out its functions, she added.
</P>
<P>
Lukman Harun, another legislator and a noted figure of the
Muhammadiyah Muslim organization, said peace-loving people must
criticize the attacks which belittled human rights principles.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Harmoko on Friday also criticized the air strikes
on targets in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said the United States and Britain acted unilaterally
without notifying the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian government through its foreign
affairs ministry has expressed regret over the attacks, calling on
the United States and Britain to halt the "onslaught".
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also called on Baghdad to abide by the United Nations
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Condemns U.S.-led Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro Friday condemned U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq, saying
it was a mistake to attempt to resolve international disputes
through violence.
</P>
<P>
In his traditional end-of-year speech to foreign diplomats at
the Quirinale Palace, the Italian president's residence, Scalfaro
said his "hope and urgent invitation" was for "the guns to be
silent in order to avoid innocent victims and useless destruction."
</P>
<P>
He also lamented that the principle of international justice
was compromised by the presence of a single super-power. "There
can be no justice when the strong win out only because they are
strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the stance taken Thursday by Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, Scalfaro said bombs
had fallen before all reasonable hope of a diplomatic resolution
died away.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro drew attention to the failure of the United States and
Britain to get United Nations approval for their military
action. The UN Security Council was, or should be "the supreme
arbiter in all international controversies," he added.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Baghdad Comes Under Worst Attack in Three Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain
attacked Baghdad early Saturday for a third consecutive day in an
offensive against the country that started in the early hours
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Missiles were seen exploding in the city center and lighting up
the dark sky.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners opened fire, filling the sky with
booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets streaked high
up.
</P>
<P>
A local resident, named Ziyad, told Xinhua the explosions were
very close to his home in the city center and his wife and
mother-in-law were frightened by the huge explosions.
</P>
<P>
The raid was in two series, in the second of which some bombs
landed only a few hundred meters away from the press center in
the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
One building in the center of Baghdad had been the target of
three bombs in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
Throughout both waves of bombing, cars and even buses continued
to drive on Baghdad's roads and the city's lights remained on.
</P>
<P>
After the second wave of bombing, silence came once again on
Baghdad and no smoke could be seen from the press center roof.
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Persian Gulf or by
B-52 bomber aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to
1,365 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Friday 25 people had been killed in the capital and
75 injured in the first two nights of attacks.
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures from the provinces were not available, and
access of foreign journalists to sites of bomb damage has been
restricted.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's bombing ended shortly before the holy month of
Ramadan started officially at 05:18 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Loudspeakers from mosques across the city announced prayers for
the start of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Britain said they were "sensitive" to
Ramadan, the most holy period in the Islamic calendar.
</P>
<P>
"But we will not put any artificial limitation on the military
operations. The military operations are paramount now, and we will
continue to carry it out," U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
But Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed he would not back down.
</P>
<P>
In a speech carried by the official Iraqi news agency Friday,
Saddam told the Iraqi people that "We will make no compromise with
the enemy, we fear only God and we will not yield without reason."
</P>
<P>
The Operation Desert Fox was triggered by a report of the Chief
U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, on Baghdad's lack of
cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Pentagon said key pillars of the Iraqi
government were being hit, which included military and
intelligence units, radio and television transmitters, airfields,
air defenses, and missile production centers.
</P>
<P>
An oil refinery in the southern city of Basra was damaged in a
"very limited" attack, Cohen said, because it was allegedly the
source of oil smuggled out of the country through the Gulf. Iraq
confirmed an attack on the refinery.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi armed forces claimed military successes in a
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi anti-aircraft fire destroyed 77 of the 305 missiles
launched on Iraq since midnight Wednesday until 4:00 p.m. local
time," the Iraq military said.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. missiles had targeted communications centers,
warehouses of the Trade Ministry and residential areas in addition
to military units.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Send More Aid to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Red Crescent Society of
the United Arab Emirates will send a third consignment of relief
goods to Sudan on Saturday, as part of its program to help the
famine victims.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa Nasser Al Suwaidi, the society's chairman of the Board
of Directors, said the medicines and equipment worth 600,000
Dihrams (178,571 U.S. dollars) will be supplied to various
hospitals in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Society, led by Suwaidi and Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al
Nahyan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, started the aid
program in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The first relief of 168 tonnes of food and medicine was sent to
Sudan in August in five planes. The second consignment of
medicines, worth 1.14 million Dihrams (about 340,000 dollars), was
delivered on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Al Suwaidi said that the society had also purchased 920,000
Dihrams (273,809 dollars) worth of food and medicines in the
Sudanese markets.
</P>
<P>
The money was contributed by Sheikh Zayed Establishment of
Charitable and Humanitarian Activities, as part of the
cooperation between the two organizations in humanitarian and
charitable activities.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old civil war, coupled with famine in Sudan, have
killed 1.5 million Sudanese.

U.S. dollars, of which domestic debt was at 12.81 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the rate of increase in the domestic debt slowed to 11.9
percent from 12.3 percent in October, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments showed a rise of 247.9 million dollars
in net foreign assets at the Central Bank and a decline of 174
million dollars in the assets of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Since October, Lebanon witnessed a series of significant
changes on political spectrum, which ranged from the election of
Emile Lahoud as the country's president to the resignation of
former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in November.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the veteran politician and economist Salim
Hoss was designated as premier and formed a 16-man cabinet of many
technocrat ministers.
</P>
<P>
Many financial experts fear that the surprise change of power
would shake the local currency's stability and bring about sharp
demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that there was a continued move toward
deposits in Lebanese pounds as the Central Bank intervened on the
market to purchase foreign currencies and prevent fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
It added that the exchange rate remained stable at 1,508 pounds
for one dollar.
</P>
<P>
In November, Lebanon's gross foreign reserves hit 6.9 billion
dollars, while total foreign reserves, including gold, stood at
9.629 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report singled out construction activity in November,
saying the industry measured by cement deliveries rose 7.4 percent
to 333.300 tonnes, although the number of new construction permits
fell 22.3 percent in the month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yanhao became the first
male athlete to win a gold medal for China from the track at the
Asian Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 26, claimed the 110 meters hurdle with a time of 13.65
seconds, beating Andrey Sklyarenko of Kazakhstan (13.68) and Hamad
Al-Dosari of Qatar (13.99) into second and third places.
</P>
<P>
"There was much pressure upon me since the Chinese male
athletes failed to win a gold from the track," Chen said. "I
thought a lot and did not sleep well last night."
</P>
<P>
Chen, who lost to compatriot and Asian record holder Li Tong in
Hiroshima four years ago, said his dream eventually came true.
</P>
<P>
"In home competitions, I always beat Li. But at abroad, he
always enjoyed an edge," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Li, who holds the Asian record of 13.25 seconds, retired last
year after losing to Chen at the Chinese National Games.
</P>
<P>
"If Li was here, I think the competition would have been more
fierce," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Get 466 Million Dollars for F-16s Refund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said here Saturday that his country has resolved a
dispute with the United States over suspended sale of F-16s with
the latter agreeing to pay a refund of 466.97 million U.S. dollars
to Pakistan before December 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will receive 326.97 million dollars in cash before
December 31 and the remaining 140 million dollars will be paid in
the next two years in the form of wheat and other commodities.
</P>
<P>
"The two governments have closed the issue with an exchange of
letters. Accordingly, the entire sum paid by Pakistan is being
returned to us in cash and kind," Sharif said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said this agreement was a "concrete and positive outcome" of
his recent visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had paid a total sum of 658 million dollars to the
United States almost a decade ago to purchase 28 F-16 aircraft.
However, the U.S. side has held the aircraft in light of its
Pressler Amendment banning arms sales to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pakistan already received 157 million dollars in cash
refund. After deduction of U.S. services charges, 466.97 million
dollars out of the remaining 501 million dollars for refunding are
to be returned to Pakistan, according the prime minister's
statement.

medal of the men's basketball at the 13th Asian Games here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
I. Lastimosa scored 19 points, including his team's last six to
overtake the lead and lift the all-professional stars to outscore
their tough rivals.
</P>

11 apieces for the Philippines, who was fourth-place finisher in

<HEADLINE> Office Development Outside Johannesburg City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Gauteng, the central
province of South Africa, is to ban further office development
outside the Johannesburg Central Business District (CBD) to force
business back into the city, Saturday Star quoted government
sources as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Permission will no longer be granted for office block
develpments, especially in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg,
while thousands of square meters of office space lies unlet in
the CBD.
</P>
<P>
Only when occupation levels in the CBD have recovered to what
they were in the 1970s and early 1980s, will outside office
projects be allowed to continue, government sources was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Office buildings and shopping centers have in recent years
mushroomed in Randburg, Sandton and Midrand, all in northern
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of property in northern Johannesburg was
reportedly prompted by increasing violent crimes in the city
center.
</P>
<P>
The situation has now reached crisis point, according to the
provincial government, and the tough "affirmative action"
building policy is "non-negotiable".
</P>
<P>
The process of rejuvenating Johannsburg has been identifeid by
Gauteng Premier Mathole Motshekga as one of the most urgent
things to conclude, said Sicelo Shiceka, who is responsible for
development planning and local government in Gauteng Province.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, all applications for land-use property right
will be scrutinized carefully and should be compatible with our
new policy," Shiceka said.
</P>
<P>
S'bu Buthelezi, chairperson of the Inner City Management
Committee, said that the municipal government is to "make
Johannesburg the pulse of the (African) continent" by keeping the
city busy 24 hours a day.

<HEADLINE> Technology Put On Sale In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The market economy in China
has given technology greater importance in the country's economy
and it has now been turned into one of the most valuable products
on the market.
</P>
<P>
China now has 54,000 organizations trading in technology and
employing more than a million people. About 250,000 technological
developments changed hands in China in 1997 for 35.1 billion yuan,
according to a division chief of the Ministry of Science and
Technology's market service center.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation said that the country exported 2,532 items of
technology last year, worth 5.52 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This would have been unthinkable before the economic reforms
started in the late 1970s. Under the planned economy that was in
force for nearly four decades after the national liberation of
1949, however, all technological developments were under
government control and state-owned enterprises used them free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
China's first technology market was established in Tianjin in
1980, the major port city for northern China. The day it opened,
the market was as crowded as a country fair, recalled Li Shou, the
first head of the technology market.
</P>
<P>
Although it only had 700 items of technology up for sale, 230
contracts were signed on the very first day of operation and the
market has been packed ever since, with the number of clients
averaging 600-700 a day, Li says.
</P>
<P>
The market provides a good place to display the value of
scientific research findings, and, more important, it tells
everyone that technology is no longer free.

<HEADLINE> 180 Americans Leave Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 U.S. citizens
left Kuwait Friday night, bringing to about 180 the total number
of Americans evacuated from the Gulf state since the U.S. air
strikes against Iraq began three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that the withdrawn Americans Friday were mainly women and
children, including a few Embassy staff members.
</P>
<P>
They left by a chartered flight, but the spokesman declined to
disclose the destination.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Thursday ordered the evacuation of
"those under 18, pregnant and over 65" after the U.S. launched
heavy military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have launched three rounds of air raids on
Iraq over the past three nights, with a declared aim to destroy
Iraq's military capabilities and retaliate it for defying the
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors were authorized by the U.N. to monitor Iraq's
disarming of weapons of mass destruction, as required in relevant
resolutions on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, British Embassy issued a press
release Saturday, saying British and unrepresented Commonwealth
citizens can contact their warden should they require information
or advice.
</P>
<P>
The Embassy Friday advised its citizens to refrain from
traveling to Kuwait "in view of the continued allied air strikes
against Iraq." But there have been no reports of evacuation of
British citizens in Kuwait till now.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Embassy held a wardens meeting Friday evening to
discuss queries from Canadian community in Kuwait and reviewed
the embassy contingency plans. No new notice was issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The German Embassy, which on Thursday recommended family
members of embassy staff to leave Kuwait and German citizens to
make their own decisions, said Saturday that a handful Germans had
packed and left.
</P>
<P>
French Embassy organized an information meeting Thursday evening
between the ambassador and French citizens in Kuwait, but did not
issue any special advice.

<HEADLINE> Technologies Put On Sale In China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Zhang Xianmo at Hebei Industrial Engineering University,
said that the technology market serves as a bridge to economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The market has grown from a small shop to a technology zone
over the past two decades and, last year, Tianjin's technological
transfers were worth 1.5 billion yuan (181 million US dollars) and
could reach more than 1.8 billion yuan (217 million US dollars)
this year.
</P>
<P>
The city signed 491 technological cooperation agreements with
other Chinese cities, provinces or autonomous regions last year,
worth 126 million yuan (15.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the technology market has caused great enthusiasm
among technicians and has changed the mechanism of research
institutes. An increasing number of scientists and technicians
have gone to grass-roots units to help them solve production
problems.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the commercialization of research results, 80 percent
of the income of the city's 114 research institutes came from the
transfer of their technology last year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Mines Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola
mines, which account for more than two-third of Zambia's total
copper mine assets, have been sold to Anglo-American Corporation
(ACC) at the price of 72 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new owner is expected to take them over by the end of
March of next year, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Nawakwi as saying Friday
that all that is remaining is legalizing the deal over a period
likely to take three months.
</P>
<P>
ACC has pledged to pump in 300 million U.S. Dollars in three
years into the three mines of the Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said there is a tentative agreement on the sale of the
mines and all that remains is the finalization of the legal
aspects of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will retain a 20 percent shareholding
and establish a team to monitor ACC, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
She said the purchase price of the mines is not very important
to Zambia but the benefits to be accrued from privatization.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good deal that we have and we are hoping that
there will be no other unforeseen problems cropping up," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the progress made on the sale has impressed the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) fact-finding mission which was
in the country two weeks ago, and there was sufficient confidence
that the IMF will give Zambia's other donors the go-ahead to
release funds that have been pledged in May this year.
</P>
<P>
In May this year donors pledged the country an aid of 530
million Dollars. However, they have withheld the money to
pressure it to speed up the privatization of ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the cost of Nkana and Nchanga mines,
Zambia discontinued the negotiations with Kafue Consortium last
April over the sale of the two biggest mines in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that originally Zambia demanded 400
million Dollars for the two mines from Kafue.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Regards MSC as New Engine of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday Malaysia needs a new engine of
growth for the economy and regards the Multimedia Super Corridor
(MSC) as the next engine of growth to leap-frog the country into
the information age.
</P>
<P>
In line with the vision of making the MSC the next engine,
Mahathir reiterated that the MSC initiative would continue to be
given priority.
</P>
<P>
MSC stretching southwards from Kuala Lumpur is a 50 km by 15 km
zone specially designed for high technology development.
</P>
<P>
A thriving information technology and multimedia industry would
bring new added value to Malaysia's own economy besides fueling
productivity gains in other economic sectors, Mahathir said at an
opening ceremony for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's
(NTT) MSC Center in Cyberjaya, most important component of MSC.
</P>
<P>
He said that while recent developments would make affordability
a necessary criterion, adequate resources would be given for the
implementation of the MSC programs and for developing Cyberjaya
into a multimedia haven.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was optimistic that the country's overall vision to
attain a developed country status by 2020 remains intact despite
the current economic problem.
</P>
<P>
"Although efforts to attain Vision 2020 may be slowed down due
to the uncontrollable nature of recent events, our vision to
attain a developed country status by 2020 remains intact," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While hoping for the positive outcome of various external
initiatives to revive the world and regional economies, Malaysia
is aware that the destiny of its national economy lay largely in
the hands of Malaysians, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides taking immediate corrective measures to
meet short-term threats, Malaysia would continue to invest in
priority sectors to ensure sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of Japan's role in helping the Asian countries,
particularly those affected economies including Malaysia, saying
Japan's prosperity would inevitably lead to opportunities for the
rest of the region.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Philippines Sign Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai and Philippine officials
have signed two agreements on promoting cooperation in various
fields, a TV report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed here Friday during a two-day working
visit to Thailand by Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who
arrived here earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, one on cooperation in tourism and another on
cooperation in the prevention and fighting of criminal activities,
reflected the efforts by the two countries to further refine and
enrich an already excellent relationship, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai said in a welcoming speech.
</P>
<P>
Estrada and Chuan held bilateral talks at the Government House
on bilateral and regional issues before witnessing the signing of
the two agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under the tourism agreement, both will jointly promote the two
countries in one package in selected areas in Europe, North
America and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
Under the crime-fighting agreement, both countries will
strengthen their cooperation in fighting activities like illicit
manufacturing and trafficking of drugs, arms and explosives,
trafficking in women and children and illegal immigration as well
as economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will include coordination in planning and
carrying out related measures, exchange of information related to
anti-crime activities, research, personnel training and exchange
of visits between implementing agencies.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six Filipino businessmen are part of Estrada's 160-member
delegation.
</P>
<P>
By September, trade between the two countries totaled 1.024
billion U.S. dollars, with Thailand running a slight surplus.
</P>
<P>
With the regional economic crisis chilling the interest of
foreign investors, the two leaders hope they can convince their
native entrepreneurs to kick-start growth in each other's
countries through investment.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Passenger Train Derailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA) Dar es Salaam-bound train was derailed, bringing
the company's operations to a standstill for about 24 hours,
Zambia's Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The TAZARA management described the accident as the worst
involving a passenger train in the past 23 years since the
opening of the railway which runs from Tanzanian capital Dar es
Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi, about 200 kilometers north of Lusaka,
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The accident, which took place at about 04:30 hours Wednesday,
forced thousands of passengers on board, including tourists and
missionaries, to spend the night at the accident scene.
</P>
<P>
The management suspected sabotage by some disgruntled former
employees who had been retrenched from TAZARA.
</P>
<P>
The train got into a disused rail at Kalulu Station, about 800
kilometers from Kapiri Mposhi of Zambia, causing extensive damage
to the locomotive and two cargo wagons which went off the track.
</P>
<P>
The accident rendered it impossible for all other transporters
through the railway line to use it until rescue workers finally
managed to clear the track at about 15:00 hours.
</P>
<P>
Passengers on the Kapiri Mposhi-bound train who were earlier
scheduled to arrive at 09:00 hours on Thursday could not proceed
because of the blockage and were forced to spend a night at
Chozi, a few kilometers from where the accident occurred.

<HEADLINE> 5-Nation Economic Meeting Begins in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A one-day ministerial meeting of
the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic
Cooperation (BIMST-EC) forum started here Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The second BIMST-EC ministerial meeting, inaugurated by
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad, is being attended
by state or deputy ministers of the five countries, all around the
rim of the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
BIMST-EC "hopes to take advantage of complementarities among
our economies, and benefit from one another's experience and
resources," Azad said at the inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting his country's unique role in the newly-established
bloc, the foreign minister said that "Bangladesh's geographical
location positions it in a convenient situation to act as a bridge
between South Asia and Southeast Asia and in fact, link up the
whole of West Asia to East Asia."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh could serve as the gateway to the outside world for
this whole region, which holds nearly a quarter of the world's
population, he added.
</P>
<P>
The BIMST-EC forum, which contains three members of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and two members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, could play a significant
role in achieving greater cooperation between these two groupings,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While delivering his country's report at the session, former
chairman of BIMST-EC and Deputy Foreign Minister of Thailand
Sukhumbhand Paribatra proposed the establishment of working groups
for six identified areas of cooperation within the grouping -
trade and investment, technology, transport and communications,
energy, tourism and fishery, and the appointment of a "chair
country" to oversee the work of each working group.
</P>
<P>
Vasaundhra Raje, India's state minister for foreign affairs,
stressed the importance of "direct, most convenient and
cost-effective" transport and communications among BIMST-EC
members.
</P>
<P>
Direct and convenient road, rail, water and air linkages will
speak louder for BIMST-EC cooperation than all BIMST-EC meetings
put together, she said.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the five countries gathered here on
Thursday and Friday to consider a report of the chairman of the
BIMST-EC working group, which was set up to coordinate the
activities of the member countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan
Chowdhury assumed the chairmanship of the working group on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, four countries
situated along the rim of the Bay of Bengal, formally formed the
BIST-EC forum in Bangkok, Thailand, in June 1997. Its name was
changed to BIMST-EC after Myanmar joined the sub-regional grouping
in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Life Improving for Tibetan Carpenter (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Dola, a 34-year-old Tibetan, has
become general manager of the Xigaze Zhufeng Agricultural
Machinery Corporation, which has five million yuan (600,000
U.S. dollars) worth of assets and is one of the major taxpayers in
Xigaze in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"I was only a carpenter in the 1980s, and lived on what I had
earned," Dola recalled, "but the reform and opening up policy in
Tibet introduced in the 1990s encouraged me to try other fields
and I was sure about my success from the very beginning."
</P>
<P>
Dola's father was also a carpenter who had six sons and who
bought a tractor for 2,800 yuan (338 US dollars) in 1980 for Dola,
his youngest, even though he had hoped that Dola could carry on
his career.
</P>
<P>
Dola started hauling goods at the age of 16 for the department
stores of Xigaze, from the city of Golmud in western Qinghai
Province, at least two-days drive away, making only 0.21 yuan per
kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Dola then turned to selling tractors he'd bought in Golmud at a
low price when he found that tractors were badly needed in
Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
He got a loan of 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars) in 1982 and
bought a second-hand truck at the priced of 15,000 yuan (1,800 US
dollars) to expand his business in Lhasa and Ngari and, three
years later, he bought a new "Dongfeng" brand heavy-duty truck for
31,000 yuan (3,740 US dollars).

<P>
KAMPALA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were
killed and many others injured as a Kampala-bound bus was
ambushed in northern Uganda by rebels of Joseph Kony's Lord
Resistance Army (LRA) Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the second attack on West Nile bound traffic. The
most recent was on November 26 in which seven people were killed
and 28 abducted, the New Vision paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 passengers on the bus were injured and three are still
missing. One child was reportedly rescued by government soldiers
patroling near the scene of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Katumba Wamala, the commander of the Fourth Division based in
the northern district of Gulu, was quoted as saying that a total
of 25 rebels attacked the bus at around 10:00 a.m. at Got-Afonyo,
about 12 km on the Karuma-Pakwach road.
</P>
<P>
The driver was among the four dead, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the injured were in Nebbi Hospital but the commander
said the army was arranging to transport them to Arua due to lack
of facilities in Nebbi.
</P>
<P>
Katumba said the patrol responded fast and managed to reach
the scene before the rebels burnt and looted the bus.

"It may be hard to imagine now that we had to sell agricultural
machinery on the sly," he says, "because the local government then
prohibited individuals from getting involved in the business. But
the great changes since 1992 have allowed me to do business
openly."
</P>
<P>
He set up a retail center in Xigaze in 1993, selling
agricultural machinery parts, and founded a corporation a year
later. His corporation has now employed 31 people and have retail
outlets in Xigaze, Lhasa, and Gyaze in Tibet and an agency in
Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, what he has seen in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou
has made him see the big gap between Tibet and other provinces and
the need to make use of the opportunity to develop local economy
through the aid from the central government and other provincial
or autonomous regional governments.
</P>
<P>
Dola also hired a tutor when he saw that his three years of
schooling hindered the development of his career and he plans to
open a building materials wholesale center on 6,000-sq.m. of
rented land, to move into transportation and construction.
</P>
<P>
Dola, now a Standing Committee member of the Tibetan Autonomous
Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said that he doesn't just do business for the
sake of making money, but to help people live still better lives.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Teenager Killed by Israeli Gunfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A 17-year-old Lebanese boy had
been killed in south Lebanon by Israeli commandos, the Daily Star
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Khallaf died instantly in a hail of Israeli gunfire late
Thursday night beside his house on the edge of Shaqra village
inside the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said that he had been struck by an Israeli
artillery shell during a bombardment of the area.
</P>
<P>
But evidence emerged Friday suggesting that a team of Israeli
commandos had killed the boy, the paper said, adding the Israeli
army has made no comments on the killing.
</P>
<P>
This is the 20th Lebanese civilian killed during conflicts
between Israeli forces and guerrillas in the border zone since
the start of this year. Twenty three Israelis were also killed
over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israeli occupation trying to oust them out of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The cause of Dayan (Wild Goose)
Tower's continued tilt, in the northwest China city of Xi'an, has
been found out and this may help the project to save the
1,000-year-old tower.
</P>
<P>
A team of archeologists and architects spent 15 years on
monitoring and field studies and recently came to the conclusion
that the leaning was caused by several factors, including a
badly-distributed foundation, overuse of groundwater and the
movement of the geological structure.
</P>
<P>
The tower was built in the early period of Tang dynasty
(618-907) to house Buddhist scriptures brought back by the monk
Xuan Zang from India.
</P>
<P>
Relevant studies showed that the foundation has subsided nearly
a meter in the past 13 years, because of its large size. The tower
weighs 38,195 tons.
</P>
<P>
It was partially damaged by a major earthquake during the
period of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), and although some repair
work was done on it later, it could hardly restore it to its
original shape.

<P>
AYUTTAYA CITY, Thailand, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Wong Kam Po of
Hong Kong, China, beat scorching heat and a strong field to win
the men's 200-km road cycling race here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy that my four-year-long efforts were not wasted,"
said Wong after edging Japan's Makoto Iijima by half of a bicycle
in the sprint to the finish line, clocking a time of four hours,
39 minutes 27 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Wong, 25, said he bet correctly by following the Japanese rider
to dash out of the pack only 50 kilometers into the race.
</P>
<P>
Wong, Iijima and Victor Espiritu of the Philippines then
accelerated gradually to form a first pack which finally led the
rest by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
His coach Shen Jin Kang said Wong was aiming for the gold since
finishing fourth at Hiroshima four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Wong is well prepared for the race. He has stamina and good
skills. His next objective will certainly be the Sydney Olympics,"
said Shen.
</P>
<P>
Iijima won the silver medal while Espiritu carried home the bronze.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves 135M Dollar Emergency Aid for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has approved an emergency assistance worth 137 million U.S.
dollars for Bangladesh to rebuild the infrastructure damaged by
this year's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Under a flood damage rehabilitation project, Bangladesh will
use the ADB aid to restore water supply and sanitation facility in
27 municipalities, according to an ADB Dhaka Office release.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency package will help people resume normal life by
restoring access to basic social infrastructure and contribute
towards cleaning up the environmental damage caused by the flood,"
said a senior ADB officer, who is working on the project.
</P>
<P>
With this aid, Bangladesh will repair schools and training
centers, roads and bridges, flood and water-control structures,
embankments, rural roads and markets, railway facilities and urban
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the restoration work is expected to be
completed before next July with the rest by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ADB aid consists of a concessional loan of 104 million
dollars and 33 million dollars in loan savings from other ongoing
projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
This is part of an international effort to relieve a natural
disaster which caused over 1,000 deaths, made millions homeless
and caused severe economic disclocation in Bangladesh, which
experienced the most severe flood in a century during
July-September this year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB credit covers 80 percent of the project costs while the
balance will be met by the government, and it is repayable over 40
years, including a 10-year grace period, with a service charge of
one percent per annum, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Different donor countries and international agencies have
already provided Bangladesh with 407 million dollars in emergency
relief aid and rehabilitation package.
</P>
<P>
With the ADB credits, the foreign aid Bangladesh has received
stood at 542 million dollars, apart from donations from different
charities and philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government, in the wake of the flood, made an
international appeal for over 900 million dollars in aid.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Clash Over Impeachment Articles Against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives, in its first-day debate, was deeply divided
Friday over the four impeachment articles against President Bill
Clinton over his affairs with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The four articles, approved by the House Judiciary Committee
last week, include two counts of perjury, one of obstruction of
justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
"Perjury and obstruction of justice cannot be reconciled with
the office of the president of the United States," said House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde during the debate.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt urged Republicans to allow a
vote to censure Clinton so as to spare a scandal-weary public the
spectacle of a Senate trial on allegations that the president
tried to cover up the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
"You get to vote your vote of conscience and I respect that
right," the Missouri Democrat said to majority Republicans. "All
we're asking for is that we get to vote our conscience."
</P>
<P>
Representative Charles Schumer, a Democrat, conceded that
"unless a miracle occurs", Republican votes will impeach Clinton
on at least one of four articles.
</P>
<P>
In the House, the proceedings were partisan from the outset.
Democrats, underscoring their desire to put the impeachment
proceedings on hold until the airstrikes against Iraq were over,
failed to adjourn the House before debate began.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, a ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, who served in Congress during Watergate,
said, "Impeachment was designed to rid this nation of traitors and
tyrants, not attempts to cover up an extramarital affair."
</P>
<P>
Only two lawmakers had announced they would cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
Republicans insisted that impeachment was unrelated to sex, and
was being sought because of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
From the White House, first lady Hillary Clinton voiced support
for her husband.
</P>
<P>
"In this holiday season ... we in our country ought to practice
reconciliation," she said, adding that Americans shared her
"approval and pride" in the president's work.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers used the occasion to condemn a culture of
savagery that has developed in recent years, as political leaders
and appointees of both parties have been brought down.
</P>
<P>
Illinois Republican Ray LaHood presided over Thursday's
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
The debate was scheduled to start on Thursday, but was
postponed in the wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to vote on the four impeachment articles
on Saturday afternoon after debate in the morning.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to void
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
If any of the articles are approved by the House, the Senate
would convene only the second impeachment trial of a president in
the U.S. history. A two-thirds majority would be needed to remove
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: COMESA Striding Forward in Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) is striding forward to achieve a
full free trade area by the year 2000 and a customs union by the
year 2004.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, COMESA that replaced the Preferential Trade
Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in 1994 has recruited
two new comers of Egypt and Djibouti and therefore, become the
largest regional economic grouping in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
It now has 21 numbers with a total of 385 million consumers
and an area of 12.9 million square kilometers, representing over
60 percent and 43 percent of Africa's population and land area
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also in the past year, the COMESA Court of Justice which is
modeled on the European Union's Court has been established. Its
primary functions are to uphold the rule of law in the operation
of the grouping's treaty, and ensure the adherence to law in
interpretation and application of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
This arbitration organ, based in Lusaka, exercises judicial
independence. This, no doubt, is a landmark in COMESA's efforts
to strive for economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics obtained from the COMESA
Secretariat, as of October 1, 1998, nine countries had reduced
their intra-COMESA tariff rates lower than 10 percent, five had
cut them between 10 and 19 percent and another five between 23
and 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade liberalization and facilitation measures instituted
by COMESA are now bearing fruit. Intra-COMESA trade has grown
from 834 million U.S. Dollars in 1985 to about 2.5 billion
Dollars in 1997. And it is estimated that this level of trade can
be further increased following the admission of Egypt, an
economic power in north Africa and the mid-east region.
</P>
<P>
To promote and liberalize regional trade, COMESA members are
implementing a program called the Automated System for Customs
Data and Management (ASYCUDA), which has the advantage of
simplifying customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
Steady progress has also been made in elimination of
non-tariff barriers such as in liberalization of import
licensing, removal of road blocks, easing of customs formalities,
and extending times for opening border posts, etc.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to form the customs union, COMESA has reached an
agreement to implement a Common External Tariff (CET) by the year
2004 and the CET will be 0, 5, 15 and 30 percent on capital
goods, raw materials, intermediate goods and final goods
respectively. At present, members are allowed to reach this
target at various rates.
</P>
<P>
In the area of transport and communications facilitation, the
COMESA Secretariat is implementing the Harmonized Road Transit
Charges; the COMESA Transit Plates; COMESA overload controls;
maximum vehicle dimensions; the COMESA third party vehicle
insurance (Yellow Card) scheme and the high frequency
cross-border land mobile radio communications system.
</P>
<P>
As a result of COMESA transport facilitation measures,
transportation cost has been reduced by about 25 percent and
efforts are underway to reduce it further.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the sector of telecommunications, special emphasis has been
placed on network development to enable direct telecommunication
links.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Council of Ministers responsible for
telecommunications decided in July this year to build a
telecommunications network known as Comtel, a private liability
company, that will link all member states via digital terrestrial
network and satellite system.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the project will provide a reliable and
homogeneous network across the region. This will eliminate the
current practice of transmitting via third countries (in most
cases European countries or the U.S.), resulting in substantial
reduction in communications cost.
</P>
<P>
As for monetary and financial matters, COMESA members have
agreed to cooperate in accordance with the COMESA Monetary
Harmonization Program which, among other things, provides for the
use of market determined exchange rates; the harmonization of
fiscal policies; the moderation of monetary expansion;
eliminating direct controls on bank lending and deregulating
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional organization also faces serious
challenges in the process of economic integration. A major one is
to create sufficient jobs for the growing labor force in the
region, about 160 million at present.
</P>
<P>
Food security in the region, is another basic minimum
requirement and COMESA perceives trade liberalization within the
region, and increased trade with the rest of the world, as
crucial to meet this and other development challenges.
</P>
<P>
The burden of debt facing the region (over 120 billion
Dollars) implies that, in addition to more trade, massive private
investment will be necessary to build up infrastructure and
create productive employment.
</P>
<P>
The economic development of the COMESA region must take place
within the context of "globalization". COMESA is an "outward
oriented" organization with the objective of creating a regional
trading bloc to be able to compete in the global markets,
according to a Progress Report on Priority Programs of COMESA
released in early October, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these challenges, COMESA Secretary General Erastus
Mwencha is optimistic about the achievement of a free trade area.
He said recently that "We will definitely make it as we have now
come a long way toward implementing tariff reduction schedule
which will create a free trade area by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
COMESA has been developing in the course of economic
regionalization and globalization as an example of south-south
cooperation in Africa, and it consists of 21 members such as
Angola, Burundi, the Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Sudan, the Seychelles, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Its speedy expansion, as observers here put it, will not only
promote the economic development and trade in Africa as a whole,
but also provide precious experiences for other countries and
regional economic groupings in their struggle for economic
cooperation and integration.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 10 Injured in California 38-Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 18 (Xinhua) -- One woman was killed and
10 others injured in a fiery 38-vehicle pile-up on a foggy
California highway Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Dense fog had cut visibility to about 30 feet or less on
Interstate Highway 5, north of Sacramento, capital of California,
when the accident occurred, said Jim Harris, of the Sacramento
Transportation Management Center.
</P>
<P>
Ten trucks and 28 automobiles crashed, he said, adding, "It's
looking pretty ugly out there."
</P>
<P>
The woman who was killed apparently was struck by another
vehicle when she got out of her car, said Captain Ed Prieto, of
the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
Ten people were hospitalized, three with serious injuries.
Police said they were checking into the possibility that a
northbound driver suffered a heart attack and crossed the median
into the southbound lanes, causing the pile-up.
</P>
<P>
Such chain-reaction pile-ups are common during the winter
months, when heavy fog descends on Interstate Highway 5, a major
traffic artery connecting California's north and south.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production in India Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The industrial performance
of India in the first half of the current year painted a dismal
picture with the production growth rates of 52 sectors falling in
comparison to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Associations Council of
the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) for April-October 1998,
only 37 sectors recorded improved rates while 52 sectors fell and
one sector showed no change.
</P>
<P>
With respect to key sectors that suffered declining production
growth, the rates were 4 percent in aluminum (5 percent last
year), -13 percent in ball and roller bearings (-12 percent), 3.4
percent in cement (7.5 percent), -2.8 percent in steel (2
percent), -30 percent in machine tools (8.5 percent), -9 percent
in caustic soda (3.5 percent), 8.2 percent in earth moving,
construction and mining equipment (18 percent), 12 percent in
electronic components (15 percent), 5 percent in fertilizer (20
percent), -18 percent in industrial furnace (1.5 percent), -32
percent in textile machinery (4 percent) and -2.7 percent in
tractors (17 percent).
</P>
<P>
Among the sectors that have recorded improved production growth
rates in April-October this year was the automobile industry (6
percent against -5 percent in the same period last year). However,
the automobile sector growth was powered mainly by the growth in
motorcycles, scooters and mopeds.
</P>
<P>
Other automobiles continued to languish with rates being -45
percent in medium and heavy commercial vehicles (-28 percent), -26
percent in light commercial vehicles (-27 percent), 1 percent in
cars (3 percent), -19 percent in multi-utility vehicles (6
percent) and -17 percent in all three-wheelers (7 percent).

<P>
PATTAYA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China clean swept the 11
gold medals of rowing tournament at the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
After taking all the five golds on offer on Friday, the
Chinese rowers further proved their depth by pocketing the
remaining six title in Saturday's competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese rowers enjoyed a greater advantage in Saturday's
races, winning all the six events with a bigger margin.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time for China to clean sweep all the rowing
gold medals at Asian Games. They won all the four golds at 1982
New Delhi Asiad and repeated that feat in Beijing at 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The results are quite satisfying," said Zhang Qing,
director of Chinese Aquatic Sports Center, "the most important
thing is all our rowers are in high spirit this time."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiuyun, Olympic silver medalist who took the gold here
in the women's open class single sculls, said the competition in
Asia was an easy job for her.
</P>
<P>
"I was quite relaxed and felt no pressure. The competition was
not tough for me." said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese rowers might feel the same way as they met no
serious challeng in the races.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qing said that was because Japanese rowers failed to
put up a good performance:"Now it's clear China holds an obvious
advantage in Asian rowing."

<HEADLINE> More Missiles Attack Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Wave after wave of missiles
attacked Baghdad early Saturday as the United States and Britain
continued air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Loud explosions shook the downtown area shortly before dawn as
Iraqi anti-aircraft fire lit up the sky, a Xinhua correspondent
there said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions were the most powerful heard since Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The bombing started at 4:38 a.m. local time and seemed to come
in three waves within a space of five minutes.
</P>
<P>
The city center was rocked by more than a dozen ear-deafening
explosions, and its outskirts also appeared to be hit.
</P>
<P>
No aircraft could be seen or heard and there was no sound of
warning sirens in the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
Standing atop the two-story building of Xinhua office located
in the city center of Baghdad, correspondents could see tracer
shells fired by Iraqi anti-aircraft forces rising in all
directions. One could feel that the ground was shaking and so was
the office.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi friend named Ziyad told Xinhua that the explosions
were very close to his home which is also in the city center and
his wife and mother-in-law were so much frightened by the huge
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Ziyad told Xinhua not to close the windows of the office so
that the windows will not be broken by the impact of the
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the locations of those explosions, one can tell
that obviously more targets in Baghdad have been bombarded by the
U.S-British cruise missiles.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Asks PSUs First to Buy back Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to ask cash-rich public sector undertakings (PSUs) to buy
back their shares before proceeding with their divestment,
official sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the government's strategy to ensure that it
meets its disinvestment target of 50 billion rupees (1.17 billion
U.S. dollars) for the current financial year (April 1, 1998 -
March 31, 1999). Only 2,250 million rupees (52.75 million U.S.
dollars) have been raised from the sale of Concor equity so far.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is to convene a meeting next week of the
PSUs to finalize the buyback details. The new strategy would
ensure higher disinvestment collections for the government on
account of buyback by the PSUs. It is also expected to result in
enhanced share prices at the time of the public offering. In the
process, the government would also be able to restructure the
bloated equity base of some of the PSUs, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"In the cooling-off period after the buyback, we have allowed
the companies to float alternate instruments like debentures, etc.
This is to ensure that they are not hamstrung for resources in the
two-year period," a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office
said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Vows to Crack Down on Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's new government
has vowed to curb and crack down on increasing kidnapping which
has hampered foreign investment in the last two years, the
Cambodia Daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National Police Director General Hok Lundy said Friday the
government has made up its mind to battle the criminal act, and
Interior Co-Minister Sar Kheng urged concerned authorities to wipe
out the kidnapping problem in the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hok Lundy said he has ordered spreading his resources
throughout the country, using "undercover agents to every commune,
every village to watch and investigate."
</P>
<P>
Hok Lundy was speaking after an anti-kidnapping training
session held at the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern about the deterioration of the
society's values and the general security, especially that for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Most of the kidnapping victims in the past year have been
prominent business figures or their family members, particularly
ethnic Chinese. Western aid workers and high-ranking government
officials have not been immune.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hok Lundy attributed the failure to bring an end to
kidnapping to the families of victims not reporting and the lack
of policemen training in handling kidnapping cases as well as the
lack of equipment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy to Slow Down: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Growth of the U.S. economy
will slow to 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year from
3.9 percent in the third quarter, and further decelerate to 1.9
percent in 1999, a survey said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth is slow, but steady," said the Livingston
Survey, the United States' oldest continuous survey of economic
expectations released Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The 54 participating economists in the semiannual survey expect
the U.S. economy to slow down from its rapid pace earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters see economic growth rising 2.4 percent in the
fourth quarter, a deceleration from 3.9 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the forecasters expect just a 1.7 percent growth in
the first half of the year, with the economy picking up to 2.1
percent in the second half. They foresee a two percent growth rate
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In June, the forecasters expected consumer prices to rise 2.5
percent in 1999. Now they have cut it to just 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Along with the forecast of slow but steady economic growth, the
forecasters see the unemployment rate rising slowly from 4.5
percent in December this year to 4.7 percent in June 1999, then to
4.9 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the interest rate on the 30-year
Treasury bond is expected to rise from 5.1 percent at the end of
this year to 5.2 percent in December 1999, then to 5.3 percent by
the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Livingston panelists forecast that real U.S. GDP (gross
domestic product) growth will average 2.6 percent per year over
the next 10 years, while the consumer price index will rise an
average of 2.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, economists at the Detroit-based, 150-year-old
Comerica Bank released their 1999 forecast on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
They expect a 2.5 percent GDP growth and a 1.8 percent
inflation rate in 1999. They also expect the Federal Reserve to
cut the interest rate one or two more times in 1999, more than
one-half percent to reach 4.5 percent by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
With incomes growing faster than inflation, the bank said,
consumer spending will prove the lion's share of economic growth
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Housing and domestic construction will slow, but remain at
robust levels. Recession in Latin America and slow growth
throughout most of the world will continue to slow U.S. exports
and widen the deficit in the balance of trade, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of young
people in the city of Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, are joining throngs in an effort to acquire professional
certificates so they can compete in a changing economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a local judicial department, more than 1,400
people sat for the lawyers' examination in the city this year, an
increase of 26 percent over last year, and more than 83 percent of
those participating were under 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, over 5,700 people took the registered accountant
exam in Hangzhou this year, a marked rise from 1991 when fewer
than 3,000 attended the exam in all of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Certificates for tour guides, insurance agents, car drivers and
translators are also hot choices among local youths.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Xiong, a postgraduate student at Zhejiang University who
has got two professional certificates, explained that more
certificates mean more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
This craze for more certificates is not only promoting the
sales of reference books, but is also giving local colleges and
universities the opportunity to offer additional training courses.
</P>
<P>
A teacher at the Hangzhou Tourism School said that more than
400 people attend the school's courses every day.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air Force Ready to Evacuate Thais in Mid-East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Air Force is ready to
send aircraft to the Middle East to evacuate Thai nationals there
if U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq threaten their lives, the
Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Air Force Commander Thananit Niemthan as
saying that the country has C-130 aircraft on alert for the
possible evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has 4,000 nationals in the Middle East, including some
3,000 in Kuwait which may be in danger from neighboring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the air strikes entering their third day, Thai Deputy
Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra said the U.S.-British air
attacks may be sustained for a longer time than earlier expected.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand is most concerned about the Thai workers in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Thais in Israel could still remain there because preparations
have been made earlier this year with the cooperation of the
Israeli government to provide full protection and assistance in
case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Thailand and other
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will work together to help their nationals in the Middle East to
evacuate if the situation escalates.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand would work with Indonesia and the Philippines
if more U.S.-led raids against Iraq threaten their nationals in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders have expressed concern over the strikes while
some have urged Baghdad to immediately comply with U.N.
resolutions in order to resolve the crisis.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Sri
Lanka (CPSL) has strongly condemned the missile attacks and air
raids on Iraq carried out by the United States and Britain, the
official Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"No single nation or two or more can take into its own hands
the enforcement or punishment of any country or nation for any
failure to comply with resolutions of the United Nations," said a
release issued by the party's General Secretary Raja Collure.
</P>
<P>
The release said the control of international relations is the
responsibility of the international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, military actions cannot be condoned as a means of
settling international disputes, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The CPSL calls on the United States and Britain to hall all
military actions against Iraq forthwith and to let the United
Nations alone handle the problems it is confronted with.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soldiers Getting Farm Skill Certificates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Late Chinese leader Chairman
Mao Zedong once said the People's Liberation Army was a big
school, and more than two decades later, that still seems to
remain true.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight PLA servicemen, who have attended training courses
at Zhejiang University, recently became the first Chinese soldiers
to get farm skill certificates as part of an official program to
help soldiers acquaint themselves with farm technology to increase
their employment possibilities after they leave the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The 58 were part of the first group of 66 trainees, the rest of
whom failed to pass the tests, according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The training courses taught them about cultivating farm crops
with advanced technical know-how. "Before I entered the army, says
one of the soldiers, Gao Baolin from a village in east China's
Jiangxi Province, "I used to do farm work, but now I know that
there were many useful skills that I didn't know about."
</P>
<P>
In China, most service personnel are recruited from the
countryside and most will likely return to their home villages
after they leave the service.
</P>
<P>
These days, many ex-servicemen have found work in industrial
and commercial enterprises, some of them run by former soldiers,
some of whom have even gained international reputations for their
products.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Beefs Up Security to Prevent Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Argentinian
government has reinforced its security measures in several "hot
points" that could be terrorist targets following U.S. strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Security Minister Miguel Angel Toma told a local radio station
that the measures were "elemental, and even routine", for a
country that suffered two attacks on Jewish targets between 1992
and 1994, with 116 deaths and hundreds injured and maimed.
</P>
<P>
Those attacks destroyed the Israeli embassy and the Argentine
Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA), and Argentinian law
enforcement agencies have blamed Islamic fundamentalists for the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies have assumed custody of potential targets,
mainly in the Jewish, as well as the Islamic and United States
communities, in view of the situation going on in the Middle East,
said Toma.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that security has also been reinforced
in other "hot points" such as airports, ports, borders, and the
"triple border" Argentina shares with Brazil and Paraguay, where
there is an Islamic settlement which is believed to have terrorist
links.
</P>
<P>
"There are no countries more or less vulnerable than others.
All the world is exposed to these kind of attacks," said Toma.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 65.64 million cubic
meters of water from the Yellow River, the second longest river in
China, has been diverted to north China's Hebei Province along a
350-km waterway.
</P>
<P>
This recent diversion represents the fifth since the first
water from the Yellow River was diverted to the Weihe River in
Hubei Province in 1994. This year's plan called for the diversion
of some 330 million cu.m. meters of water.
</P>
<P>
Severe dry spells in Hebei Province throughout the year have
lowered water levels in many reservoirs to the danger level. Water
diverted from the Yellow River will at least to some extent ease
shortages of water for daily use, industrial and farm production.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls To Alleviate Cuban Alimentary Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Friday
called on the international community to help Cuba overcome a
serious food shortage and lack of resources to import food.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs on the basis of information gathered by its
agencies on the island.
</P>
<P>
A long drought and hurricane Georges severely affected Cuba's
agricultural production this year, which was also hit by the
international economic turmoil and the United States embargo, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Cuban agriculture registered its worst production
figures since the 1959 revolution, and that because of the crisis,
the Cuban government could not allocate more resources to import
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
"All this results in a nutritional deficit which, despite the
government's efforts, will affect the daily life of hundreds of
thousands of Cubans in the short and medium term," the UN document
said.
</P>
<P>
One UN agency, the World Food Program, approved last September
a 20.5 million U.S. dollar emergency food assistance project for
the island, after ascertaining the needs caused by the drought.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Education institutions in
China will offer farmers additional long-term support in
agro-technologies, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Regional education institutions are required to accelerate
vocational and adult education development to help young and adult
people learn farming skills, according to a regulation issued
yesterday by the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Vocational schools will do more to spread techniques for
planting and breeding and how to make high-valued-added farm
products, the regulation said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation urged agricultural colleges to regularly
introduce advanced agro-technology into rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Broadcast and Television School of the Central TV College
will help teach about 2,000 farming skills in rural areas through
radio and television programs, video compact disks and computer
networks, said the school's official Zhang Shaogang.
</P>
<P>
The school will make more easy-to-learn farming skills
programs, such as water-saving irrigation and fine seed
cultivation techniques to help farmers get richer, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The TV school was set up in 1990 to step up educational reforms
in rural areas. Its educational programs have covered 22 provinces
and more than half of China's counties.

BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- New round of ear-deafening
explosions could be heard at around 4: 38 a.m. local time Saturday
(1:38 a.m. GMT) in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft fires lit up the sky over Baghdad, and huge and
continuous explosions can be heard.
</P>
<P>
Standing atop of the two-story building of Xinhua office located in
the city center of Baghdad, we could see traces shell fired by Iraqi
anti-craft forces rising in all directions. One could feel that the
earth was shaking and the office was shaking.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi witness Ziyad told Xinhua that the explosions were
very near to his home which is also in the city center and his wife
and mother-in-law were so much frightened by the huge explosions.
</P>
<P>
Ziyad told this correspondent not close the windows of the
office tight so that they will not be broken by the impact of the
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the locations of those explosions, one can tell that
obviously more targets in Baghdad have been bombarded by the
U.S-British cruise missiles.

The U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq entered the third
consecutive night by Friday mid-night and early hours of Saturday.

Bangkok Saturday to voice dissatisfaction with the strikes and to
call on Washington to stop the attack.
</P>
<P>
Manso said he suspected U.S. President Bill Clinton had ordered
the air raids only to escape possible impeachment at home.
</P>
<P>
The protest note also can be accessed through the Internet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the association would launch campaigns to raise
donations to help the Iraqi people injured in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Moslems in provinces of Hat Yai, Songkhla,
Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat gathered at several mosques Friday to
pray for the safety of Iraq and its people and curse the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Parliament President Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, himself a Moslem,
said the U.S. should rather seek to solve problems with Iraq
through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  Air Strikes on Iraq May Halt in Hours: U.S. Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British air
strikes against Iraq could be nearing to an end and halt as early
as Friday night, Washington time -- early on Saturday in Iraq --
U.S. defense officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A final decision was likely to be made after assessment of
damage from three days of bombing and missile raids, the defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, senior officials stressed the air strikes, which
began on Wednesday night, could go on until they believe the
U.S. forces have completed their missions by hitting all the targets
listed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
"There is no fixed end time," Defense Secretary William Cohen
said in an interview with CNN. "We have set very specific targets
that we intend to attack and when those missions are completed
then the mission will end".

<HEADLINE> East China City Vows to Become Medicine Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The city of Bozhou in east
China's Anhui Province reiterated its goal to become Chinese
medicine center by fully exploring the pharmaceutical sector,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Bozhou Mayor Wang Chunjing was quoted as saying that the city
is determined to amplify its herb processing and manufacturing,
medical health care and medical education.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 31 percent of the city's 1.351 million residents are
engaged in herb planting, processing and medicine sales. So it is
one of the four largest Chinese cities in terms of traditional
medicine production and trade.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, Bozhou has implemented policies to encourage
farmers and urban dwellers to plant herbs and sell medicine to
increase their income. And the city is trying to make the trade a
pillar in its quest for higher budget income, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that to date, the city has already been given the
distinction of being the world's largest "China's Traditional
Medicine Trade Center", selling 3,000 kinds of medicinal materials
and drawing about 60,000 traders from across the country every day.
</P>
<P>
Following the center, which has an annual sale volume of 6.5
billion yuan (785 million US dollars), there is another grand
market in Bozhou that sells western medicine, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The trade has made a few millionaires in the city, which
administratively covers 26 townships outside the city proper, the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
He said the city plans to set up a medical college and open two
medical majors in its industrial school to train more people in
the medical field, while increasing the current herb planting
area, which now covers 26,600 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its also intends to set up some herb processing
plants and medicine factories in the next three or five years to
make more medicinal products, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tobacco Firms Accused of Breaking Thai Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Thailand
Tobacco Monopoly (TTM) has accused manufacturers of some foreign
branded cigarettes of breaching regulations requiring health
warnings to be printed on the packets.
</P>
<P>
But cigarette importers said they held large stocks before the
government's order for all producers to print warnings by November
15.
</P>
<P>
TTM managing director Gen. Ong-ard Champoonta branded as
unacceptable the response by the importers, according to
Saturday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Supplies currently on sale should carry the warnings as the
stocks must have run out by now, Ong-ard said.
</P>
<P>
Four foreign brands -- Benson &AMP; Hedges, JPS of British American
Tobacco, USA Nouvo of SKS Purity Co., and State Express of
Universal Consumer Products Co. -- now carry warnings.
</P>
<P>
But Ong-ard said the warnings failed to meet Public Health
Ministry requirements. The warnings are supposed to be across
one-third of the top of both the front and back of the packet, in
white lettering on black.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the ministry had strictly imposed the regulations on
local producers, placing them at a disadvantage to foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
Ong-ard said he had complained to Deputy Finance Minister
Pichet Phanvichartkul.
</P>
<P>
Last fiscal year ending September, the TTM sold 35.87 billion
cigarettes or 40.3 billion baht (1.12 billion U.S. dollars), down
by 23 percent from sales the year before.

<HEADLINE> More Missiles Attack Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Wave after wave of missiles
attacked Baghdad early Saturday as the United States and Britain
continued air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Loud explosions shook the down area shortly before dawn as
Iraqi anti-aircraft fire lit up the sky, a Xinhua correspondent
there said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions were the most powerful heard since Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The bombing started at 4:38 a.m. local time and seemed to come
in three waves within a space of five minutes.
</P>
<P>
The city centre was rocked by more than a dozen violent
explosions, and its outskirts also appeared to be hit.
</P>
<P>
No aircraft could be seen or heard and there was no sound of
warning sirens in the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
Standing atop of the two-story building of Xinhua office
located in the city center of Baghdad, correspondents could see
tracer shells fired by Iraqi anti-craft forces rising in all
directions. One could feel that the ground was shaking and the
office was shaking.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi friend named Ziyad told Xinhua that the explosions
were very near to his home which is also in the city center and
his wife and mother-in-law were so much frightened by the huge
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Ziyad told me not to close the windows of the office tight so
that they will not be broken by the impact of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the locations of those explosions, one can tell
that obviously more targets in Baghdad have been bombarded by the
U.S-British cruise missiles.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Spends Less on Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is set benefit
with big savings from the steady drop in world oil prices this
year.
</P>
<P>
The "Jornal do Brazil" newspaper said the country spent 1.64
billion U.S. dollars during the first nine months of the year on
crude imports, more than 31 percent less than in the same period
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in expenditure is attributed to the rise in
domestic oil production as well as the steep drop in world oil
prices. The price fell last week to 9.6 dollars per barrel, the
lowest since 1972.
</P>
<P>
Official data shows that domestic crude output surpassed 1.05
million barrels a day, and domestic consumption is almost 1.8
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The countries who sell oil to Brazil are Nigeria, Argentina,
Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Floods Threaten Rare Birds Habitat in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- This year's serious flooding
in Poyang Lake in east China's Jiangxi Province has put rare
Siberian cranes at risk as the tubers of water plants, important
food for cranes and many other birds, were damaged, said today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The 220-sq-km lake is the winter destination of nearly 3,000
Siberian cranes, or about 98 percent of the rare cranes in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Ji Weitao of the Poyang Lake Nature Reserve said only one of
nine small lakes within the nature reserve, has some eelgrass,
which is a favorite food of cranes.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 1,400 Siberian cranes have arrived at the
nature reserve. Ji counted two groups of more than 700 cranes in
a day.
</P>
<P>
"It was an exciting experience to see 700 Siberian cranes in
one day within 200 meters," said Jim Harris, deputy director of
the International Crane Foundation (ICF), who visited the lake
late last mouth.
</P>
<P>
But both Harris and Ji are worried that the birds may not have
enough food at the nature reserve in deep winter or early
spring. If they move to other areas, the birds will not be as
protected.
</P>
<P>
The ICF has donated 5,000 US dollars to the reserve office to
carry out a survey of the cranes and other rare birds, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
But because of bad weather, they have postponed the survey
until mid-month. Once they spot large bird groups, Ji said they
will probe the area on land to study the effects of the floods on
the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Harris said this year's floods provide a rare chance for
special research on the relationship between water levels, aquatic
plants and the birds.
</P>
<P>
But for local farmers, the floods have put them in dire
straits. It's difficult for them to make a living and some farmers
have resorted to birds.
</P>
<P>
Ji said they have caught several farmers who killed birds
either for trade or food.
</P>
<P>
Although such incidents are becoming rare, Ji is deeply worried
because the reserve is too large to manage with only 30 staff
members.
</P>
<P>
"Birds are human being's friends," Ji said. "It is beyond our
reserve's ability to protect so many precious birds."
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that ICF can start similar projects like
those at Caohai reserve in Guizhou for the Poyang Lake. "We have
to find a way to involve local farmers in our protection work."
</P>
<P>
Harris said if the new projects at Caohai are successful, they
plan to expand them to other important crane reserves in
China. Yet it is still unrealistic to hope that international
donations can solve all problems once and for all.
</P>
<P>
After working with ICF for 15 years, Harris said he feels
wetlands conservation is an inclusive work that involves not just
wildlife and the environment, but also poverty alleviation,
pollution control and may other aspects.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA player Richard
Dumas was arrested Thursday evening for possessing drugs and
paraphernalia, but released today, a press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Dumas' career was ruined by drug troubles.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about that," Dumas said. He said he planned
to contact his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Dumas and another man after getting
information of possible drug activity. Officers saw drug
paraphernalia and a bag containing rocks that allegedly tested
positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Dumas said he bought the crack cocaine and intended to give
it to a friend.
</P>
<P>
Dumas played two years at Oklahoma State before drug probles
ended his college career. He turned pro in Israel and the Phoenix
Suns dragted him in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He entered the team but failed a random drug test just before
the 1991-92 season. He played 48 games and started 33 in 1992-93,
averaging 15.8 points and 4.6 rebounds. He ended his career in
1996 with a foot injury in the Philadelphia 76ers team.

<HEADLINE> China's Interior Becoming More Appealing To Coastal Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in
China's eastern coastal areas are looking for ways to make money
in central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhumadian Prefecture in central China's Henan Province has got
some 1.58 billion yuan (190 million US dollars) in investment in
the past two years. It has held the '98 National East-West
Cooperation Trade Talks.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises generate approximately a third of the
country's GDP and half its industrial added value products. They
also provide employment for a large number of unemployed rural
laborers.
</P>
<P>
The eastern part of China has two-thirds of its township
enterprises, but many of them suffered a slowdown last year,
because of various problems. Things were made even worse by the
Asian financial crisis, which caused orders from abroad to drop.
</P>
<P>
So it was natural for these enterprises to look for new markets
in central and western parts of China, says Sun Longshan, deputy
director in charge of the township enterprises in eastern Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has many township enterprises and has reportedly signed
three cooperative agreements with Altay Prefecture in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The interior areas, in spite of its relative backward economy,
have abundant natural resources and the country's cheapest labor
force and energy, even though many workers are unskilled. A
kilowatt of electricity for industrial use costs only 0.3 yuan in
the interior, as compared with over 1.2 yuan in coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Make More Efforts for Stronger Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
Friday announced a series of measures to promote trade and
economic relations, including a plan by U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Daley to visit China in March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the 12th annual
meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade
(JCCT), Daley said he would lead the first-ever multi-agency
infrastructure mission to China during his trip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first long-term U.S. trade finance officer will
be placed in Beijing in accordance with an agreement signed by the
U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Export-Import Bank at the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, Chinese foreign trade minister Shi
Guangsheng provided the U.S. a list of major projects which China
would like to pursue in 1999 and also "important and detailed
information" on products and services China wants to import.
</P>
<P>
On trade balance, Shi told reporters that the problems can only
be resolved through joint efforts from both sides. Currently the
U.S. has a trade deficit of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, according to
the Chinese statistics
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides still differ over the size and causes of
trade imbalance, China and the U.S. agreed to settle the issue
through cooperation, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts by the U.S. side in reducing the
imbalance by ending the annual review of normal trade relations
status with China, lifting the restriction on exporting high-tech
products to it and completes the negotiations on China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident of the realization of trade balance between
China and the U.S." he told reporters through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Daley indicated that the Clinton administration does not enjoy
the annual review of the normal trade relations status with China
and also asked the Congress to stop the process, adding "the best
way to address the issue" is the accession of China to WTO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's accession to WTO, Shi stressed that China
is firmly against any attempt that allows Taiwan, a separate
customary territory, to join the organization before China does.
</P>
<P>
"That would complicate and politicize the issue and is totally
unacceptable to China," Shi affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Daley reiterated that his country, like other WTO members,
supports an early membership of China in WTO. "We would like to
see it sooner rather than later," he said, but adding more offers
should be made by the Chinese side.

<HEADLINE> Stern Sends NBA Proposal to Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- As time for reaching a
labor agreement that would salvage the season dwindles, NBA
Commissioner David Stern has sent a summary of the league's
latest proposal to all players.
</P>
<P>
The document indicates that the league has moved lcoser to the
union on several key issues but that a wide gulf exists on the
core issue of how to divide league revenue.
</P>
<P>
"In reviewing these proposals, I urge you to focus on the
extent of the compromises the owners have made from their initial
bargaining demands," Stern said in the letter released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Union chief Billy Hunter said in his 19-page memo, "Every time
you see the word 'concession' or 'compromise' i Stern's memo, he
is referring to a compromise from the owners initial bargaining
demands. In other words, the owners asked for everything but the
moon when the negotiations started."
</P>
<P>
The two sides remain 41/2 percentage points apart on the
amount of league revenue the players are to receive in salaries.
Each percentage point would be worth at least $20 million in a
full season.
</P>
<P>
"This deal can be negotiated in 48 hours," the union's outside
lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, said recently. "The thing is we don't
know which 48 hours the commissioner will choose."
</P>
<P>
According to Stern's eight-page memo, the league has moved
closer to the players on several other key issues, including
annual pay raises, the establishment of minimum salaries base on
experience and more liberal exceptions available to teams that
exceed the salary cap. The league also has dropped its demand to
eliminate the Larry Bird Exception.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the union has agreed to accept a maximum salary on
players with less than seven years experience, if the league
accepts certain union proposals.
</P>
<P>
The NBA wants a maximum salary on all players, except for
players already above those limits.

WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley, one of
the 50 greatest players in NBA history and would-be governor of
Alabama, will make his coaching debut Saturday in "The Game on
Showtime" at Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
The contest will feature locked-out NBA players, with proceeds
going to UNICEF and charities in Atlantic City and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Barkley will coach the Red team, which consists of Patrick
Ewing, Karl Malone, MItch Richmond, Tim Hardaway, Dominique
Wilkins, Reggie Miller, Dan Majerle and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston, Penny Hardaway, Shawn Kemp, Chris Webber, Tom
Gugliotta, Vin Baker, Glen Rice and Alonzo Mourning make up the

</P>
<P>
Game organizers said that more than 7,000 tickets have been
sold, and they expect a sellout for the 12,500-seat Convention
Hall.
</P>
<P>
Several players who are not participating in the game have
bought tickets that will be distributed to charities.
</P>

Philadelphia area.
</P>
<P>

anticipating making $700,000 for charity from the game.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard for them to raise a lot of money," NBA d
eputy commissioner Russ Granik said. "I know what the economics
of putting on games are. If they net $700,000, they've done a
very good job."
</P>
<P>
Polk said organizers will explore staging more games of this
magnitude in the USA and abroad if the season is canceled.

ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- No Italian military bases have been
used in the two nights of U.S.-British Strikes on Iraq, Italian
Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the defense and foreign affairs committee of
Parliament's Lower House, Scognamiglio said the UN should work
toward the "quickest end" to the conflict, but also noted that
Europe is the "big absence" in the search for a solution.

<P>
Valdo Spini, the chairman of the committee, also expressed concern
about the lack of involvement of European alliances in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Spini said, it was reassuring that NATO wasn't
asked Italy to provide bases, men or military means, but on the other
hand no one in Rome was consulted on a Mediterranean regional issue.
"Thus we don't talk about Europe," he said, "in this crucial episode,
Europe was not there."

students in Shanghai have appealed for wild animal protection by
signing their names to a public letter.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Guichun of East China Technology Institute was the first
to write her name on the long white horizontal scroll, and the
energy major also wrote a few words which said, "Words are not
enough for protecting wild creatures."
</P>
<P>
The letter, drafted by a student organization at East China
Teachers University, calls for public support against such illegal
activities as trapping, killing and trading wild animals
including ostrichs and frogs.
</P>
<P>
It letter informs the public that the lives of wild animals are
being severely threatened and that it is in the interest of people
themselves to protect them and maintain an ecological balance.

<P>
Ten of the municipality's elite institutions of higher learning
have staged signed-letter drives, including Fudan University, East
China Teachers University, Shanghai Jiaotong Univerity and Tongji
University.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province continues to make efforts to improve its environment for
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
According to a document titled "Opinions on Improving the
Software Environment of Liaoning Province for Overseas Investment"
recently drafted by the provincial government, departments dealing
with overseas investment should publish their working procedures
and related rules and regulations, as well as their table of fees
and charges.
</P>
<P>
Departments responsible for customs clearance, commodity
inspection, and the quarantine of animals and plants must
institute around-the-clock operations at coastal and inland
ports, and increase duty shifts at airports in order to improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions from overseas-backed enterprises will be welcomed
in drafting local government policies concerning investment from
overseas, and random inspections of overseas-backed enterprises
will be banned, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, an old industrial base built under the planned
economy, has approved more than 17,000 overseas-financed
enterprises involving a total of 33 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment. Last year, the province abolished 118

<HEADLINE> Consumer Credit China's Latest Fad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Chinese
consumers are delighted to use credit and loans to buy products
according to a recent survey conducted by the Economic Climate
Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 urban residents were polled for their views about
buying on credit and 56 percent said they would not hesitate to
use loans for buying houses and other items.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial experts noted that China's central bank
has announced that it is relaxing its strict rules on offering
credit in a bid to boost consumer credit business in the
future. Indeed, under new regulations banks can now provide loans
for home and car buyers .
</P>
<P>
However, the survey discovered that 31 percent of people are
still cautious about getting into such debt and yet, despite such
concerns, only a mere 13 percent are totally opposed to the
facility.
</P>
<P>
Of those polled a total of 64 percent - some 602 households -
were aware of the availability of consumer credit facilities.
</P>
<P>
Amongst those in favor of using credit, 16 percent indicated
that they would buy cars and other electrical goods valued at over
10,000 yuan (1204.8 U.S. dollars) in this way. And a further 12
percent said they would be happy with bank overdrafts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those who are a little reluctant to use credit say
that this is because they are worried that they would not be able
to pay off the debt in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some of those surveyed are also nervous of the complicated
procedures involved and the high interest rates that are applied.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian player Paolo Di Canio
has been fined another week's wages by Sheffield Wednesday for
failing to return to the club.
</P>
<P>
The troubled Italian was supposed to report back for training
at Hillsborough last week after a brief trip to his homeland to
help his family move back to South Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
The club only received a certificate from the player's doctor,
saying that he was suffering from stress and depression but
Wednesday said he is close to being placed on the transfer list.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time the club has fined him over the incident
during the game with Arsenal when he pushed referee Paul Alcock,
and its aftermath - and it has now cost him around 107,000 pounds
in total.
</P>
<P>

Boxing Day after serving an 11-game ban.

<P>
But manager Danny Wilson said: "I am very disappointed with
him, but it's the chairman I feel sorry for because he has bent
over backwards for him.
</P>
<P>
"As a football club we have shown tremendous loyalty and
patience with him, but that has not been reciprocated."
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we get in contact with him, which would be a lot
easier if he was in the country, then we will take it from there.
But it's difficult to liaise with people via a fax machine," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday are unbeaten in their last five games, with Di
Canio's compatriot Benito Carbone in his best form.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the pressure has been taken away from him and now he is
enjoying his football," said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
"He is the focal point and he is showing what type of player
he can be in a relaxed environment, which is important," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Cleared of Betting Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England accepted Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear's explanation over
comments he made about players betting on their own matches.
</P>
<P>
The FA cleared the club of allegations that players had backed
themselves to win the Worthington Cup at 66-1.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear and midfielder Robbie Earle were asked to explain the
comments after Wimbledon's quarter-final victory over Chelsea on
December 2.
</P>
<P>
The FA had wanted the explanation as a "matter of urgency" but
have accepted that the remark was simply another of the club's
legendary pranks.
</P>
<P>
Betting on games by players and officials directly involved in
those matches is strictly banned by the FA, and Wimbledon could
have been thrown out of the competition and fined.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear had said after the Chelsea win that the controversy
was an "absolute joke" and maintained that "the lads" he referred
to as having the bet were friends of his rather than players.
</P>
<P>
FA Spokesman Steve Double said: "Joe said he made the remark
as a joke and we have accepted that."

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Under U.S.-British Air Attack Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi anti-aircraft guns
opened fire as U.S. and Britain launched a new wave of strikes
against Baghdad in the third night in a row.
</P>
<P>
At around 1:30 a.m. local time Saturday (2230 GMT Friday), huge
explosions can be heard in the city center of Baghdad and
anti-craft fire lit up the sky in the direction of northeastern
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes seemed less intense than in the previous two
nights, and far away from the city center so that the impact
appeared a bit subdued.
</P>
<P>
Big explosions lasted about 30 seconds, then sporadic
explosions followed for about 15 seconds. All these were about
five hours after U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in
Washington that third wave of attacks had begun.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched their first wave of air strikes
against Iraq in an operation codenamed "Desert Fox" at around 0:49
a.m. local time Thursday (2149 GMT Wednesday), and the second wave
came 10 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi official said at least 25 people have been killed and 75
wound in the air strikes. The U.S. said the targets of the attacks
were military and security institutions, but Baghdad claimed they
also included radio and television stations, communication
facilities and oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met
with his tops aides Friday, but failed to disclose any detail
about what they talked about.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a recorded speech on TV, Saddam called on the people
and armed forces to continue their resistance against "the
aggression launched by the U.S. and Britain."
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq will not back down and kneel in the face of the
combined military operation.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told a press conference
that his country will not accept any conditions in order to end
what he called U.S.-British "criminal act."
</P>
<P>
He said the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 have to be lifted if U.N. arms inspectors are to
return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The punitive attack against Iraq came after chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler in his report accused Baghdad of failing
to cooperate fully with his Special Commission in the inspections.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the air strikes will stop soon as the
Muslim world around the globe begins observing the holy month of
Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Lower Fertility Rates in Epileptic Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Women with epilepsy have
reduced fertility rates, according to a report published Friday in
The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The study, by Professor Simon Shorvon and colleagues from the
Institute of Neurology in London, showed that women who receive
treatment for epilepsy are up to 33 percent less likely to have
children than other women of the same age.
</P>
<P>
The research, based on a database containing details of 3.6
million patients in the UK, also found that the lowest fertility
rates were among women aged 25-39 years old.
</P>
<P>
Although the study firmly establishes that women with the
disease are less likely to have children, the researchers cannot
say why.
</P>
<P>
Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by repeatedly
occurring seizures. The drugs used to treat it, antiepileptic
agents, have been known to affect the hormone system in ways that
could lead to conditions that in turn result in infertility.
</P>
<P>
"There are, however, a number of possible explanations."
Professor Simon Shorvon said, "they could include social factors
such as the stigma induced by epilepsy and that the marriage rates
among people with epilepsy are slightly lower."
</P>
<P>
"It may reflect a reluctance of women who have epilepsy and are
on treatment to have children because of the risks of the
treatment to the unborn foetus.
</P>
<P>
"It is also possible that the treatment itself, or indeed
epilepsy itself, results in lower fertility."
</P>
<P>
He said that the third possibility was alarming and further
research would be needed to establish whether or not it was
related to the differences in birth rates.

<HEADLINE> ERT Effective in Cutting Heart Attack Deaths in Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Oestrogen replacement therapy
(ERT) provides "a striking decrease in cardiovascular mortality"
in women, Finnish doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from the University of Turku, Finland,
examined 7844 women born between 1923 and 1930 who were screened
for breast cancer and followed up from 1987 to 1995. Among them,
988 women were current users of ERT.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in The Lancet medical journal, the researchers said
that their study found that deaths from heart disease were 79
percent lower in women taking (ERT) compared to other women.
</P>
<P>
"Our findings provide evidence that current ERT in post
menopausal women improved survival from cardiovascular disease and
decreased sudden cardiac death," they said.
</P>
<P>
ERT and hormone replacement therapy HRT have been shown to
prevent osteoporosis, or brittle bone disease, and to protect
women against heart disease. Research has also linked it with a
slowing of memory loss.
</P>
<P>
But the studies have also shown that women who take ERT or HRT
have a slight increased risk of developing breast and endometrical
cancers.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish researchers found no increase in the risk of breast
cancer but the chance of developing cancer of the lining of the
womb was five times higher in the ERT women than those not taking
the hormone.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Friday that the latest developments of the
situation in Georgia could undermine the United Nations
peace-making efforts in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
said he was deeply concerned about the alarming news of sharply
rising tensions between Georgia and Abkhazia (Republic of Georgia).
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, both sides are mobilizing
troops and using tough rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
Annan said these developments were particularly regrettable in
view of the United Nations efforts to promote political dialogue
and reconciliation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The escalation of tensions negatively affects the on-going
sixth session of the Coordinating Council," said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General appealed to both sides to exercise
restraint and to avoid any action which could lead to violation
and undermine the peace-making efforts of the Untied Nations and
the international community.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Consumption of Chocolate Is Good For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Indulging in chocolate and
sweets a few times a month can help you to live longer, U.S.
doctors have suggested.
</P>
<P>
People who eat chocolate and sweets up to three times a month
live almost a year longer than those who eat too much or those who
abstained, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health
reported Friday in the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
They studied 7841 American men aged around 65 for a five-year
period and found that people who consumed a moderate amount of
chocolate survived longer than those who ate sweets three or more
times a week and those who never touched sweets.
</P>
<P>
"As with most things in life, moderation seems to be
paramount," the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
Although the test included both chocolate and sweets, the
researchers said chocolate is the key to a longer life. They
believed it contains substances that protect against heart disease
and cancer.
</P>
<P>
Chocolate, like red wine, which is also said to protect against
heart disease, is believed to contain chemicals called phenols,
which reduce the presence of free radicals that damage cells and
DNA, causing disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also think cacao, the key ingredient of
chocolate, may restrict the formation of the type of cholesterol
which damages the heart as well as boosting the immune system.

<HEADLINE> 26 Zimbabwean Soldiers Killed in Congo (K) War: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six Zimbabwean soldiers
have been killed and 33 others wounded in the war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which began on August 2 this
year, a Zimbabwean minister announced in Harare Friday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Defense Minister Sydney Sekeramayi told a news
conference that 17 Zimbabwean defense forces men had been
captured while the other five missing.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, with allies Angola and Namibia, is engaged in a
bitter war in the DRC to support the government of President
Laurent Kabila to fight the rebels against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
However, Sekeramayi said, the rebels had suffered much heavier
losses with 2,060 having been killed and 1,000 captured by the
allied forces.
</P>
<P>
"I must emphasize that it is our policy to make available to
the people of Zimbabwe details of our casualties," he said. "We
have nothing to hide and have managed to bring home bodies of our
fallen heroes for decent burial."
</P>
<P>
The number of dead soldiers included two senior officers who
died in a helicopter crash behind enemy lines Sunday, said the
acting defense minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that heavy fighting still continues around the towns
of Kubalo, Kalemie, Moba and Nyunzu with the allied forces
determined to fend off the rebels from advancing to the
particularly strategic town of Lubumbashi.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's involvement in the DRC, which like any war
cost money, was being co-financed with the other SADC allies.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Zimbabwe is losing about 30 million
Zimbabwean Dollars (over one million U.S. Dollars) a day for
maintaining its 6,000 troops in the former Zaire.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Debates Clinton Impeachment amidst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of a deeply
divided U.S. House of Representatives on Friday clashed over
impeachment articles against President Bill Clinton over his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Perjury and obstruction of justice cannot be reconciled with
the office of the president of the United States," Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt urged Republicans to allow a
vote to censure Clinton so as to spare a scandal-weary public the
spectacle of a Senate trial on allegations stemming from the
president's efforts to cover up the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
"You get to vote your vote of conscience and I respect that
right," the Missouri Democrat said to majority Republicans. "All
we're asking for is that we get to vote our conscience."
</P>
<P>
Representative Charles Schumer, a Democrat, conceded that
"unless a miracle occurs," Republican votes on Saturday will
impeach Clinton on at least one of four articles. A Senate trial
of uncertain duration would follow next year, with Supreme Court
Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding.
</P>
<P>
Not since Andrew Johnson sat in the White House has Congress
brought impeachment proceedings to the floor of the House. Johnson
was impeached by the House in 1868, but remained in office when
the Senate fell one vote shy of the two-thirds majority needed to
remove him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has vowed repeatedly not to resign, and his spokesman
renewed that vow at the White House as debate was under way.
</P>
<P>
In the House, the proceedings were partisan from the outset.
Democrats, underscoring their desire to put the impeachment
proceedings on hold until the airstrikes against Iraq were over,
failed to adjourn the House before debate began.
</P>
<P>
Hyde, who presided over the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
inquiry, was first to speak. "The people's trust has been
betrayed," he said. "The nation's chief executive has shown
himself incapable of enforcing its laws, for he has corrupted the
rule of law by his perjury and his obstruction of justice."
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, who served in Congress during Watergate, said,
"Impeachment was designed to rid this nation of traitors and
tyrants, not attempts to cover up an extramarital affair."
</P>
<P>
Only two lawmakers had announced they would cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
The four articles of impeachment all stem from Clinton's
efforts to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Republicans insisted that impeachment was unrelated to sex, and
was being sought because of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
From the White House, first lady Hillary Clinton voiced support
for her husband. "In this holiday season... we in our country
ought to practice reconciliation," she said, adding that Americans
share her "approval and pride" in the president's work.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers used the occasion to mourn an inside-the-Beltway
culture of savagery that has developed in recent years, as
political leaders and appointees of both parties have been brought
down.
</P>
<P>
Illinois Republican Ray LaHood presided over the impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to void
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> Germany Plans  EU Initiative to Resolve Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer plans a European Union initiative early next year aimed at
resolving the Iraqi crisis, Media reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer made his remarks during a closed session of
parliament's foreign affairs committee at which all major
political parties backed the air strikes against Iraq except the
party of Democratic Socialism.
</P>
<P>
Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the 15-nation
European Union (E.U.) for the first half of 1999 and Fischer vowed
the bloc would play a leadership role in the search for a
political resolution of the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a senior member of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
Social Democratic Party called for Germany to offer logistic aid
for U.S. military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We are a partner (of the United States) and have to give a
political signal to show that we are on their side," said
Hans-Ulrich Klose, the Social Democratic (SPD) chairman of
parliament's foreign affairs committee, in a Rheinische Post
newspaper interview.
</P>
<P>
Klose noted Germany's aid to the U.S.-led alliance in the 1991
Gulf War "had not been especially strong, to put it mildly". Bonn
refused to send troops but helped fund the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We must naturally now be prepared to give logistics aid if it
is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokesman in Bonn said there had been no
requests for aid so far from the U.S. or Britain.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party Chief Criticizes Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The national secretary of the
French Communist Party Robert Hue Friday criticized the
government's stand on Iraq as "ambiguous" and urged a "much
stronger reaction" to the U.S.-British strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We really need a much stronger reaction. I found the position
of France ambiguous. We should say things with force. We should
stop the step of (U.S. President) Clinton," he said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Prime Minister Lionel Jospin for making a
contradictory statement over the Iraqi situation on Thursday in
Ottawa, Canada, where Jospin is on a visit since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the U.S. strikes against Iraq were
"inevitable" but "not necessary."
</P>
<P>
"If the position of France was said clearly and without
ambiguity: `I don't approve this intervention, it is completely
unacceptable,' Clinton could have listened more. We should make
more pressure," said Hue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British strikes have been widely criticized by the
French political figures in both right and left camps and the
French media.
</P>
<P>
But French President Jacques Chirac and the leftwing government
Thursday held Iraqi President Saddam Hussein primarily responsible
for the present situation.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse said on Friday that the French authorities
are apparently embarrassed by the gap between their stand and that
of the French public.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Says Iraq Not to Accept Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will not accept any
conditions in order to end the U.S.-British aggressions, said
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Aziz accused the U.S. and
Britain of committing "criminal aggression" against Iraq,
violating the U.N. Charter and contempting the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will not accept any conditions. If they want to continue
their aggression, let them do it," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq, saying
their objective "is to show that the U.S. is the sole superpower
in the world."
</P>
<P>
"The first aim is to show their arrogance and their will to
impose its will on the whole world. That is main aim behind the
criminal aggression," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said either sanctions or UNSCOM (the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq) should stay in Iraq. "We cannot
tolerate both. If they want to continue the sanctions, let them
keep UNSCOM in New York."
</P>
<P>
"If they want to lift the sanctions, then there could be an
arrangement to implement U.N. resolutions, correctly and
honestly, not the way that (chief U.N. arms inspector Richard)
Butler did," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from Xinhua, Aziz said that sanctions have
to be lifted if U.N. arms inspectors are to return to Iraq. "When
the sanctions are lifted, we can accommodate the work with the
U.N. and the Security Council on correct and honest basis."
</P>
<P>
However, Aziz stressed that Iraq would not accept Butler as
UNSCOM chairman, saying "Butler has killed his job" by providing
excuses for the "criminal aggression against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused Butler of coordinating with the U.S. government,
citing a New York Times article that Butler reported the content
of his report to U.S. President Bill Clinton on Sunday, two days
before its submission to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"That report of Butler was written to justify the criminal
aggression," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"Butler decided to withdraw his inspectors from Iraq before
reporting to the U.N. Security Council ... he did so for the
second time, he did it in November, and he did it again in
December," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "this tells this man (Butler) is a cheap
pone in the hands of the U.S., use whenever the U.S. wants to use."
</P>
<P>
Aziz called Clinton and (British Prime Minister Tony) Blair
"cheap liars," and said the timing of the U.S.-British raids
against Iraq "was connected with failure of his (Clinton's) visit
to Israel," hinting it also was connected with Clinton's sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be personal. How could the American nation
believe the lies of a person who has lied to the American nation,
the Congress, to the nearest people who work with him," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and Britain attacked the old Ministry of
Defense with several missiles which he said was visited by
U.N. arms inspectors for several times.
</P>
<P>
Other targets included presidential sites in Baghdad and other
provinces, radio and television stations, oil refinery in Basra
and warehouses belonging to the Ministry of Trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the "what Clinton and Blair said about the connection
between their aggression Ramadhan is an insult to the Arabs and to
the Muslims."
</P>
<P>
He reminded reporters that the 1991 Gulf War broke out during
the holy month of Ramadhan. "So Ramadhan is not in their mind," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Link Between Height, Season of Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A baby's height at birth varies
according to season of birth, with the tallest being born in the
spring and autumn and the shortest in December, scientists said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Danish study, published in The Lancet medical journal,
supports an earlier study linking the month of birth to height.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jan Wohlfahrt and colleagues from the Danish Epidemiology
Science Centre in Copenhagen, Denmark, investigated 1,166,206
children born in Denmark between 1973 and 1994 from the Danish
National Birth Registry.
</P>
<P>
The researchers reported that they have found "seasonal
variation in mean length and weight at birth", and the seasons
during which length at birth peaked were spring and autumn.
</P>
<P>
It showed that babies born in April were on average 2.2mm
taller than those born in December. Those born in midsummer were
also shorter than spring and autumn babies.
</P>
<P>
"The seasonal pattern at birth was similar across strata of
birth year, sex and gestational age, which supports the hypothesis
that month of birth is important for adult stature. " the
researchers concluded.
