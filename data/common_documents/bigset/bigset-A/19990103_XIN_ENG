<HEADLINE> Chicago, U.S. Murder Capital: Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Chicago is the United States'
1998 murder capital, despite experiencing a 10-year low in
murders, according to preliminary data from cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's
homicide totals for the first time ever. New York has seen a
dramatic drop in its homicides. There were 629 there last year,
compared with a 1990 high of 2,262.
</P>
<P>
When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more
than double that of New York.
</P>
<P>
"One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the
numbers go down," Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said.
</P>
<P>
He credited the city's community policing program for much of
the decline. But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is
expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight
largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently
in the last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and
1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities. In that same
period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese New Leaders Committed to Policy Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 2 (Xinhua) -- With a pragmatic Salim Hoss
having replaced an ambitious Rafik Hariri as prime minister,
Lebanese are undergoing a major shift in the government policy
from huge expenses to financial austerities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Emile Lahoud, sworn in as Lebanese president only
about two months ago to replace his predecessor Elias Hrawi, has
vowed to fight corruption rampancy amid mounting public calls for
a clean government and politics.
</P>
<P>
In a policy statement approved by the parliament on December
17, Hoss said a major challenge facing his government is how to
halt the financial drain caused by past policies such as the
reconstruction policy.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the new government will strive to tame huge public
debts and budget deficits by pursuing "austerity in the extreme,"
and will stop borrowing from abroad in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to rebuild the country from the devastation of the
1975-90 civil war, the former prime minister Hariri had been
pushing forward a multibillion dollar reconstruction program since
he came to power in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's government borrowed heavily from local banks and on the
international market to finance huge infrastructure projects in
road, telecommunication, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The projects, despite being necessary to attract investment in
a postwar Lebanon, resulted in a staggering public debt of about
18 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1998 and an annual budget
deficit of more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Hariri government issued 1.45 billion dollars of Euro
bonds on international market, adding one more heavy financial
burden on the new administration.
</P>
<P>
However, Hoss has pledged that signed contracts will be honored
though his government is being confronted with financial
difficulties. But he said priorities will only be given to those
that do not exceed the financial capabilities of the state.
</P>
<P>
Any new project will be subjected to careful study before it is
carried out, and some non-urgent ones will be shelved, the new
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Besides taking measures to tighten the nation's purse strings,
Hoss has also planned to explore ways to increase revenues.
</P>
<P>
He said privatization will be cautiously introduced in certain
public sectors to ensure receipts from non-productive state-run
ventures such as the ailing Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's
national carrier, the cash-strapped state TV station Tele Liban
and the Casino du Liban, the biggest gaming house in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tax collection, the main source for the country's
coffers, will be intensified. It is reported that only 55 percent
of the country's 4 million population paid their electricity bills
and taxes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As an economist, Hoss appointed many fresh faces and a number
of specialists to his cabinet to seek pragmatic solutions to the
problems of the country. "This government will inspire great
confidence and reassure people. It augurs well," Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
The deep-rooted corruption has long been considered a hallmark
of Lebanese politics. Many officials in Hariri's administration
were reportedly involved in taking bribes and squandering public
funds.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who amassed nearly 3 billion dollars of fortune in
Saudi Arabia, was also accused by opponents of increasing his
wealth through country's reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected president Lahoud, a former army commander and
well-known for honesty, hard working and success in rebuilding a
non-sectarian army, has demonstrated his resolution to eliminate
corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
"No one is allowed to be above the law and I will be under the
law," Lahoud said in his inaugural speech October 24.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's speeches, rekindling the hope of disappointed
Lebanese, met with warm welcome and praises from various political
and religious factions.
</P>
<P>
For sure, there must be many unexpected obstacles ahead as Hoss
admitted, but most Lebanese believe that as long as their country
is run in the hands of honest leaders with realistic measures, it
will take off in a positive and bright direction.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 was a turning point in our history," said Sami
Sfeir, senior official at Lebanese Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese PM on Tasks in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minster Phan Van
Khai said Saturday that in the New Year, his government will focus
on developing agriculture and rural areas, tackling hindrance in
industrial production with an aim of maintaining the economic
growth rate, mobilizing and effectively utilizing all sources of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here this afternoon, the prime
minister said activities in external economic relations should be
boosted, while negative factors, especially those in the finance
and banking sectors, should be corrected.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country would continue solving urgent social
issues and reforming the national administrative system.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also pointed out three weak points that
needed to be addressed immediately so as to fulfill the
socio-economic development plan for 1999, namely the economy's low
competitiveness, red tape, and social evils, particularly drug
trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Vietnam now was on a new position and had new
strength, and with the precious experiences from over ten years of
carrying out renovation, the country had favorable conditions to
achieve this year's development plan.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of equalization of state-owned enterprises, Khai
affirmed that Vietnam would continue to equalize those
enterprises. The aim of the process was to enhance the key role of
the state-owned enterprises in the economy.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Saturday that he would propose an increase of over 12
billion dollars in U.S. defense spending in his upcoming budget.
</P>
<P>
"The budget I will submit to Congress... will provide an
increase of over 12 billion dollars for defense readiness and
modernization," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for an overall six-year increase of 100 billion
dollars, if approved by congressional appropriators, would be the
first increase in Pentagon spending above inflation since 1991,
the year of the Persian Gulf War, and the largest since the Cold
War buildup of the mid-1980s.
</P>

"We must undertake this effort today so that our nation will

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has not been
requested to send troops to Angola and remains committed to the U.N.
diplomatic initiatives in the war-torn country, South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rumors that South Africa was going to send troops to help quell the
renewed civil war in Angola were untrue, Ronnie Mamoepa was quoted by South
African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the U.N. has deployed a force in Angola and there has been no
request for further deployment of troops in Angola."
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said South Africa unequivocally threw its weight behind
statements made by the president of the U.N. Security Council calling
for the observation and implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the
demobilization of warring parties and an end to hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that the ultimate solution remains a peaceful
negotiated settlement," Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
Angola was plunged back into civil war between the government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the past
nine months.
</P>
<P>
Many of the rebel UNITA troops failed to demobilize and disarm in
line with the Lusaka Protocol signed in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Calls for Scrapping of Parades Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble made a renewed appeal to the government Saturday to
scrap the body which banned Orangemen from parading down the
mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
As members of the Orange Order in Portadown were preparing to
stage two separate rallies in protest at the bar on their
traditional marching route, Trimble said the Parades Commission
which imposed it could not resolve the stand-off.
</P>
<P>
The commission ordered the Protestant marchers to keep away
from the area in July after objections from Catholics and fears of
sectarian clashes.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, also the Ulster Unionist leader, told Radio 4's Today
program that the problem needed to be solved but added, "I cannot
see it being solved within the structures of the Parades
Commission."
</P>
<P>
The Parades Commission was still a "major obstacle," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who recently received the Nobel Peace Prize, said,
"What we need is to move away from this sort of confrontational
approach, the approach which says this is our territory and we
won't allow anybody else to walk along it."
</P>
<P>
"My own view is that we can't solve it while we have the
present legal structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on paramilitary organizations to begin disarming
and disbanding to give Northern Ireland a secure peace in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We have a peace at the moment -- it is an armed peace
punctuated by beatings and occasional incidents but we want a real
peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sanctions Committee Accused of Blocking Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday accused the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of obstructing contracts it signed with
world companies under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Iraqi Trade Ministry official told the Iraqi News
Agency that the U.S. representative in the Sanctions Committee
deliberately held back the punctual delivery of food, medicine
and humanitarian supplies to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Until the end of 1998, the Sanctions Committee had blocked 193
contracts which Iraq signed with foreign companies under the
second, third and fourth phases of oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Of the 193 contracts, 60 were for purchasing food and medicine
and 133 for oil spare parts badly needed for increasing its
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which had been in force since
December 1996, allows Iraq to export a limited amount of oil in
every six months to buy food, medicine and other daily necessities
for its 22 million people. Under the program, the U.N. had allowed
Iraq to export 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in each of the first two
six-months and from the third phase, starting early in 1998,
onward, the amount increased to 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current fifth phase of the program came into force on
November 25 of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said the U.S. hostile attitude toward Iraq
"is another evidence of the U.S. aggressive policy to kill the
innocent Iraqis."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. resorted to different means to enforce its
aggressive policy by prolonging sanctions, putting contracts on
hold and launching military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British forces raided Iraq for four consecutive
nights on December 16-19 in an operation code-named "Desert Fox."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Blasts Israeli Attack Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Saturday strongly
condemned the renewed Israeli threat to attack the country's
infrastructure when its north was hit again by Lebanese
guerrillas' Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli threat clearly showed its intention of aggression
against Lebanese civilians," Lebanese Minister of Refugee Affairs
and Information Anwar Khalil told the country's Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli threat, which seemed like a respond to Katyusha
attack on its north, was designated in fact to cover its criminal
act against a Lebanese family, seven members of which were killed
in Israeli air raids, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli warplanes raided Lebanon's eastern Bekaa
Valley, killing a woman and her six children. Israel later claimed
that was a "mistake" and made a public apology for the victims.
</P>
<P>
The next day, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
slammed scores of Katyusha rockets into Israeli northern areas in
retaliation, wounding at least 16 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The development forced the Israeli security cabinet to review
its policy on south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In its meeting last Thursday, the Israeli government decided
to attack Lebanon's infrastructure when its north was hit again by
Hezbollah's rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Lebanon's resistance movement is a
legal right and will continue till the day the country's all
occupied lands were liberated.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,843 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the military
operations launched by the security forces in eastern and
southeastern Turkey in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency Saturday quoted officials as
saying that the security forces also wounded 29 PKK militants and
captured 155 others in their operations in the region last year.
</P>
<P>
And 118 PKK guerrillas surrendered to the government.
</P>
<P>
However, 311 soldiers of the security forces died in the armed
clashes with the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 generals and 39,500 government troops
participated in the "Murat Operation", the largest one against the
PKK in the region last April.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war for
autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed
over 37,000 lives in conflicts since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Capital Depends on Wells to Ease Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Nkhangaa said the
country plans to drill 250 new wells, finish 23 wells under
construction and rehabilitate 200 existing wells as a measure of
dismissing worries of three million Dar es Salaam residents.
</P>
<P>
When all these wells are completed, a total of 22.5 million gallons
of water will be produced per day, compared with 18 million gallons
at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
The water projects need a cost of 3.8 billion Shillings (about 5.58
million U.S. Dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on residents in the city to save water by using treated water
for irrigation and car washing, and appealed to people to understand the
current problem and avoid being selfish in using water at will.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the situation at Ruvu river, the source of water for Dar es
Salaam and Coast regions, the minister said the water level has
dropped to 15.8 meters above level, against a normal level of above 16
meters.
</P>
<P>
Nkhangaa attributed the fall of water level to the below-average
precipitation during the short rains season starting November last
year. "We are now praying for long rains starting in January to March,
otherwise the possibility of drought is 100 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has sent a team of experts to the
Ruvu River to see if there is an alternative to make the river produce
more water.
</P>
<P>
The experts are expected to make recommendations in two to three
days, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the permanent solution to water shortage in Dar es Salaam
is to build more water works in the upper reaches of Ruvu. However, he
said poverty is the major problem in Tanzania. "If money will be
obtained, the problem will be solved quickly."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the government has decided to privatize the Dar
es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) by the end of this year or
early next year to increase production of water, expand the service and
renovate water plants.
</P>
<P>
DAWASA has said it will supply water on rationing basis whenever
necessary.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

"The budget I will submit to Congress... will provide an

</P>
<P>
"We must undertake this effort today so that our nation will
remain strong and secure tomorrow," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president was responding to complaints by military leaders
and Republicans critical of Clinton for the armed force's
declining readiness in the face of increased commitments abroad
and aging weaponry and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposal, which will also include a 4.4 percent
military pay raise, the largest since 1982, "will help us to do
right by our troops by upgrading and replacing aging equipment,
barracks and family housing," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The 12 billion dollars, part of a proposed six-year program,
would also pay for joint exercises, flight training, badly needed
spare parts, recruiting, and "the next generation" of ships,
planes and weapons systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, officials said Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget will
seek a 12 percent, 105 million dollar increase in food safety
programs, most of it to upgrade Agriculture Department inspections
at smaller meat and poultry processing plants.
</P>
<P>
White House budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget, due
to Congress in early February, would "balance defense needs with
an aggressive domestic agenda in the context of the president's
overall policy to save the surplus until we fix Social Security."

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Probe Cape Town Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- South African police are
examining photographs and video footage of Friday's bomb blast in Cape Town,
in the hope of identifying those responsible, local media
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted police spokeswoman Anine de Beer
as saying that bomb experts were still trying to establish what
sort of explosive device was used and forensic experts from Pretoria
would assist in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
She said the bomb was believed to have been placed in the boot of a
stolen Toyota which was parked in Cape Town's most popular tourist
attraction known as the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront.
</P>
<P>
Two people were slightly injured and three cars were badly damaged. So
far nobody has claimed responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Friday's blast was the second in the area in five months. A pipe
bomb placed in an American-franchised Planet Hollywood restaurant
claimed two lives and left 26 injured in August.
</P>
<P>
After the August incident, security in the area was beefed up with
surveillance cameras being installed, patrols stepped up and sniffer
dogs deployed.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the examination of video tapes could provide
some clues for the latest blast.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Socialist Party to Leave the Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Socialist Edek Party is
considering leaving the government, said party leader Vasos
Lyssarides Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, tabled to the Central Committee of the party, has
gained overwhelming support from party members, Lyssarides told
reporters after a party convention which started Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It came after President Glafcos Clerides announced his decision
not to deploy Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, ordered
by the Cyprus government in January 1997 in a bid to cement its
air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had threatened to launch preemptive strikes, should the
missiles arrive on the island. Other countries, including the
U.S. and Britain, have voiced objections to the purchase of the
missiles, saying it would increase tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The party joins in the government by holding two ministerial
portfolios when President Clerides was re-elected in February 1998
for a second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Lyssarides said the decision not to deploy the missiles
in Cyprus was wrong and warned of dire consequences for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision, declared in late December 1998,
will inevitably be interpreted as "an adjustment to pressure and
threats from Turkey and others".

HANOI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at the Tan Son
Nhat airport in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city of Vietnam,
detected a Taiwanese passport holder who intended to illegally
bring out of Vietnam 95,000 U.S. dollars on December 29, local
press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ho Hua Liang, born in 1968, was found hiding 95,000 U.S.
dollars in his luggage while clearing customs procedures for
boarding a Ho Chi Minh City-Taipei flight.
</P>
<P>
The money has been temporarily confiscated and forwarded to
relevant agencies for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Vietnamese customs officers totally detected 1 million
U.S. dollars and 45 million Japanese yen (roughly 320,000 U.S.
dollars) being illegally transferred through the airport.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's current effective regulations require declaration by

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's First Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah
said here Sunday that relations between Kuwait and Jordan would be
resumed if his Jordanian counterpart pays a visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, after a parliament meeting, on
resuming the bilateral ties and reopen the Jordanian embassy
here, Sabah said "when the Jordanian foreign minister comes to
Kuwait everything will end."
</P>
<P>
He has invited Abdul Ilah al-Khatib to come to visit Kuwait,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti foreign minister also praised the recent
statements made by Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan on the issue of
Kuwaiti and other detainees in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Arab Parliament Union meeting convened in
Amman last Monday to examine the situation in Iraq after the
U.S.-British military strikes, Hassan said that "all the Kuwaiti
and Arab detainees must return to their homelands."
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Kuwait and Jordan were severed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 when Amman, along with few
other Arab states, sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A reconciliation process between the two countries began in
May 1997 when Kuwait declared it "likes to improve ties with all
Arab countries except Saddam's Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Since then the two sides have exchanged a number of
middle-level visits.

<HEADLINE> Timely Defusing of Bomb Saves Train Mishap in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The timely defusing of a bomb
weighing six pound saved a passenger train from explosion in
Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The timely defusing of the device planted under the railway
track saved a passenger train from the provincial capital of
Lahore to Sialkot, about 110 kilometers north of the city, from
explosion, said a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Police sources were quoted as saying that the bomb was planted
underneath the railway track near Jhodewali, about five kilometers
from Sialkot.
</P>
<P>
The railway guard on patrol duty saw something with a dim light
under the track at 3:30 a.m. (local time) and informed the
district administration, railway authorities and the police,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The bomb disposal squad rushed to the place and defused the
bomb, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the device was defused only 45 minutes
before a crowded Lahore-bound passenger train was to pass.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth bomb placed on this track in the recent
past, the report said.

64-51 at halftime, finally handed a 102-101 defeat to visiting
Aoshen, which was coached by former women's international Li Xin.
</P>
<P>
Newly-promoted Aoshen, the Division Two League winner last

</P>
<P>
Aoshen pulled away in the second quarter, leading by 13 points
at halftime.

Rockets didn't give in and narrowed the score to three points
at the end of third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports to Grow 3 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports are expected
to grow by 3 percent because of improving domestic factors, the
Department of Business Economics said.
</P>
<P>
The revival of local financial institutions, a stable baht and
improved efficiency by exporters are behind the optimistic
forecast, said Karun Kittisataporn, the department's
director-general, as quoted by Thai News Agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As government measures to reform the domestic financial sector
bear fruit, local lenders are expected to resume extending credit
to exporters. As well, the stability of the baht would improve
Thai exporters' confidence in entering new transactions with
foreigners, Karun said.
</P>
<P>
Many exporters postponed transactions in 1998 because of
fluctuations in the value of the baht, especially in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Changes of one or two baht to the U.S. dollar in a single day
made it very difficult for exporters to calculate costs and
prices.
</P>
<P>
"A group of exporters who attend a seminar held in December by
the department on export prospects in 1999 felt the baht had
already stabilized," Karun said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the exporters complained that the current
rate of the baht, at around 36 to the dollar, was too strong. They
favored a rate closer to 39.
</P>
<P>
Thai exporters had developed greater flexibility, particularly
in marketing, as a result of managing their businesses amid the
domestic economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Despite stiff competition in the world market, many had
maintained impressive market shares in major destinations such as
the United States, the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 54-billion-dollar value of exports in 1998 was
six percent lower than in the previous year, but the department
was sticking with its forecast of three percent growth for this
year.
</P>
<P>
This was not quite as optimistic as the 5.2 percent growth rate
foreseen by the National Economic and Social Development Board.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1998, exports in baht terms were up
by 3.6 percent on the same period in 1997 to 1.91 trillion baht
(53 billion U.S. dollars). But in dollar terms there was a 6.4
percent decline to 45.27 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports in October alone were down by 12.7 percent from the
same period of 1997 to 4.83 billion dollars. The agricultural and
agro-industry sector showed a big drop.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Official Addresses Cross-Straits Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland and Taiwan
Province have enjoyed a boom in trade and business exchanges over
the past two decades, according An Ming, an official with the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
An Ming, a MOFTEC assistant minister, said that cross-Straits
trade hit 19.84 billion US dollars in 1997, up dramatically on
only 77 million dollars in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated trade volume during the 20 years ending
November of 1998 reached 134.71 billion US dollars, including
mainland exports totalling 21.6 billion dollars to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Cross-straits trade enabled the island province to achieve a
surplus, said An. He added that funds and management expertise
from Taiwan have contributed to the mainland's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said historical changes have taken place in cross-Straits
relations since January 1, 1979, when the National People's
Congress Standing Committee issued its "Message to Compatriots in
Taiwan". The message called for a halt to decades of hostilities
and the establishment of direct mail service, trade, air and
shipping services.
</P>
<P>
Cross-straits trade and business exchanges have contributed to
the common development of the two sides and have laid a solid
material foundation for the peaceful reunification of the
motherland, said An.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, The mainland has adopted a series of
laws and and regulations to encourage investments from Taiwan and
protect the rights and interests of investors.
</P>
<P>
Mainland authorities had approved a total of 41,115 projects
involving investment from the island province by the end of
November 1998. An said the mainland has actually used 21.1 billion
US dollars in investments from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that political disputes between the two sides
should neither affect nor interfere with cross-Straits economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Iraq vs. U.S. in Rocky 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- 1998 featured intensive
diplomatic maneuvering and military standoff between Iraq and the
U.S., which eventually led to the U.S.-British air raids against
Iraq in the waning days of the year.
</P>
<P>
Three crises over U.N. weapons inspections, crowned by two
military confrontations and an air strike, are surely what the
past year is to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
All these came as a desperate Iraq, already crippled by the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions, was striving to have the embargo
lifted, while the U.S. appeared preferring to keep the lid on
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad said it had fully complied with the U.N. resolutions
which ended the Gulf War sparked by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, and eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction, thus
demanding the sanctions be removed.
</P>
<P>
It accused the U.S. of obstructing, both in the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) overseeing the disarmament process and in the
U.N. Security Council, a fair evaluation of Iraq's disarmament
progress in the past eight years, and of trying to prolong the
sufferings of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can only be called off by the Security Council
after UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has scrapped all its long-range
missiles, and nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of last year, Iraq denied U.N. weapons
inspectors access to presidential sites, setting off a military
standoff with the U.S., which had stepped up military buildup in
the Gulf. Saddam backed down after U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan brokered a deal hinting there could be a comprehensive
review in the near future.
</P>
<P>
But in August, talks between Iraq and UNSCOM over disarmament
achievements broke down and Baghdad announced to suspend
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. It called for a
restructuring of UNSCOM, which it alleged served U.S. interests
rather than the U.N..
</P>
<P>
On October 31, Baghdad, with its hope for a comprehensive
review dashed, further decided to halt activities of U.N. weapons
inspectors in Iraq. The U.S. again got ready to deliver its threat
of a punitive military attack.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reversed its decision at the last minute just to avert an
imminent air bombardment by the U.S. and Britain on November
14. Exasperated by Saddam's playing of "mouse and cat," the
U.S. threatened that any future strikes would be "without
pre-warning."
</P>
<P>
The time finally came a month later. On December 16, no sooner
had UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler reported to the Security
Council that Baghdad renegaded its promises and did not fully
cooperate in weapons inspections, than U.S. President Bill Clinton
called the shoot.
</P>
<P>
The four-night-long Operation Desert Fox dealt another blow to
a weakened Iraq, but also fueled questioning over U.S. motives and
justification for the use of force, and set rift in the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Some believed the air strike lacked U.N. authorization and was
executed without provocation, and others asserted that its timing
was dubious because Clinton was facing impeachment in the House of
Representatives for "perjury" and "obstruction of justice."
</P>
<P>
What made U.S. objectives hazier and more elusive was that
Clinton publicly announced that his administration would plot for
the overthrow of Saddam, in collaboration with Iraqi opposition
factions, a tactic used but failed.
</P>
<P>
As Washington claimed victory and said the strike further
weakened Saddam and put back his lethal weapons ability, most
people are almost certain that it did little in solving any
problems, but killed the weapons monitoring regime that had been
hailed as "effective" in the past eight years and made a defiant
Saddam even more defiant.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cruise missiles, Iraq claimed, hit places under
permanent U.N. monitoring, which made no sense, and U.N. weapons
inspectors, order to evacuate for the second time in a year by
Butler before the attack began, are now unable to return.
</P>
<P>
Iraq challenged the U.S. by declaring it does not recognize the
"no-fly" zones, imposed by the U.S. and its allies in the south
and north of its territory soon after the Gulf War, saying they
were without U.N. mandate and therefore "illegal," and began
firing at patrolling allied warplanes last week.
</P>
<P>
And the air strike goes well beyond the Iraqi issue by setting
a dangerous precedent for some powers to get around the Security
Council and take unilateral actions against an independent
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
The other permanent members of the Security Council - Russia,
France and China - had repeatedly called for a peaceful solution
to the confrontations, a fair comprehensive review of what Iraq
has achieved in ridding weapons of mass destruction and a
relaxation and early lifting of the harsh sanctions.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that Iraq comply fully with the U.N. resolutions
in order to close each and every prohibited weapon file so that
Iraqi people's ordeal can be put to an end and the country can
return as a member of the international community.
</P>
<P>
But if the U.S. and Britain go their own way of "containment"
against Iraq and continue flexing their muscles, and if Iraq keeps
pushing brinkmanship, the year 1999 threatens to be rockier than
1998.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Achieves Grain Self-sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province has achieved grain self-sufficiency as a result of good
harvests over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou's 1998 grain output hit 11 million tons, or more than
350 kg per capita in rural areas, according to provincial Party
secretary Liu Fangren.
</P>
<P>
"Guizhou's grain imports from other parts of China are
essentially limited to levels needed to regulate varieties,"
according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The province's grain production stood at 10 million tons
annually between 1995-1997.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said the 1998 per capita net income of farmers grew
four percent on the previous year's level of 1,298 yuan. In
addition, the number of rural residents living in absolute poverty
dropped from 50 percent in the early 1990s to around 10 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou, one of China's most underdeveloped provinces, covers
176,000 sq. kilometers. Karst formations cover some 73 percent of
the province's total land area, with poor geological conditions
formerly requiring the province to import grain.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributed Guizhou's increased grain production in recent
years to rising investments in agriculture and accelerated efforts
to improve land conditions. Related efforts have in turn resulted
in the substantial increase in per unit output.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Purchase of Ballistic Missile from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday denied a Japanese
television report that Tehran had purchased ballistic missiles
from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi termed the
report as "unfounded," and said the Islamic Republic of Iran has
announced time and again that it has no missile cooperation with
other countries, including the DPRK, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Japan broadcasting corporation (NHK) reported on Saturday
that the DPRK has built 30 of its first-generation ballistic
Rodong missiles and exported some of them to Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the Iranian Defense Ministry Kivan
Khosrow said that Iran has never purchased any missile from the
DPRK and the report by foreign media in this regard was a "mere
lie."
</P>
<P>
Iran does not need to buy missiles from any country and it has
the capability to meet the defensive needs, he said, adding that
a country, which can produce a long-range missile like the
Shahab-3 (Meteor-3), does not need to buy missiles from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Iran tested its first missile of Shahab-3 with a
range of 1,300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Tehran said that the missile was designed and produced by
Iranian experts, but western reports said that the missile was
produced with assistance from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Khosrow said that at the time of the test, "some foreign media
affiliating to the Zionist (Israeli) circles also claimed that
the test was not successful."
</P>
<P>
At the meantime, they also claimed that the missile was a
threat to the region, the spokesman said, adding that such
anti-Iran propaganda is doomed to failure because the regional
countries have shown their positive reaction to Iran's defensive
capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Haikou Enjoys Healthy Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, capital of south China's
Hainan Province, continues to enjoy an unprecedented economic
growth momentum due to years of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures show that the city's gross domestic product
grew by a healthy 8.6 percent in 1998, compared to the national
level 7.8 percent. The 1997 growth stood at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The relatively high economic growth rates over the past two
years resulted from extensive economic restructuring carried out
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The city's economy registered a record annual increase of 83.3
percent in the early 1990s due to the unchecked real estate
bubble, according to one local official.
</P>
<P>
Haikou's economic growth plunged to 3.9 percent in 1993 and 3.5
percent in 1994 as a result of a prevailing credit squeeze, with
the figure falling to only one percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1996, Haikou has introduced a number of measures to
reform the state-owned sector, including mergers, bankruptcies,
asset restructuring and auctions. Consequently, the average
liability-asset ratio of state-owned enterprises has dropped from
89 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Haikou's state-owned enterprises succeeded in reversing losses
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city has attached great importance to introducing high
technology, and to controlling pollution, according to the
official.

<HEADLINE> Guiyang Uses Overseas Funds for Infrastructure Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou, capital city of
southwest China's Guizhou Province, has effectively used overseas
funds for infrastructure improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank and Japan have pledged to provide
close to a third of the 4.8 billion yuan used to construct the
expressway linking Guiyang with Xinzai, a city on the border with
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to Guiyang Mayor
Sun Guoqiang.
</P>
<P>
Sun said construction of the 260-km expressway will be
completed in three years.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a major water treatment plant in the western
suburbs will be completed at an estimated cost of 1.07 billion
yuan, including Japanese loans totalling 5.5 billion yen, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
"China's strategy of attracting increased investment to promote
economic growth has created unprecedented opportunities for
Guiyang," according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
He said Guiyang plans to introduce more policies to encourage
the influx in overseas capital for infrastructure sectors such as
transportation, telecommunications and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have agreed on launching a number of
environmental protection projects in the city. Total investments
of two billion yuan, including Japanese government loans totalling
100 million US dollars, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
He added that arrangements for BOT (build-operate-transfer)
projects and various other forms of cooperation include the
increased use of overseas capital.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces New Code on Take-overs, Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The new Malaysian Code on
Take-overs and Mergers 1998 became effective January 1, 1999,
Malaysia's Securities Commission (SC) announced.
</P>
<P>
The new code, replacing the Malaysian Code on Take-overs and
Mergers 1987, seeks to ensure that minority shareholders are given
a fair opportunity to consider the merits and demerits of an offer
and to enable them to decide whether they should retain or dispose
of their shares, the SC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new code has new provisions relating to "creeping"
take-overs which have been amended to allow an acquirer who holds
between 33 percent and 50 percent of the voting shares in a
company to acquire two percent within a period of six months
instead of 12 months. Such persons were not allowed to acquire
more than two percent of the voting shares in the company in any
12-month period previously.
</P>
<P>
This would effectively reduce the time taken to "creep" into
control of the company.
</P>
<P>
The SC said the amendment was made in order to be more
consistent with international practices such as those of Hong
Kong, Singapore and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The new code is a testimony of the commitment of the SC towards
ensuring higher standards of disclosure and corporate behavior and
greater professionalism from all involved in mergers and
acquisitions, SC Chairman Mohd Munir Majid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SC also announced that approving a proposal
submitted by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to amend its Listing
Requirements. The Listing Requirements, part of the regulatory
framework governing take-overs and mergers, are amended
consequently to the coming into force of the new code.

technology are the primary productive forces".
</P>
<P>
"Resolving deep-seated contradictions and problems in economic
construction will depend on improving the level of science and
technology and innovativeness, as well as on improving the
scientific and technological education. Related efforts will
determine the extent of the gap between China and developed
countries," according to the premier.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Former Aide Launches New Immigrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- One of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's former aides launched a new immigrant party
Sunday to compete in the upcoming elections, posing a threat to
the largest existing immigrant party.
</P>
<P>
Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu's former director-general,
announced at a news conference the establishment of Yisrael
Beiteinu, or Israel Is Our Home, a right-wing immigrants' party
with a platform focusing on social justice.
</P>
<P>
His party is expected to split the votes of Yisrael Baaliya, a
party representing immigrants from former Soviet Union and headed
by Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, whose party occupies seven seats in the parliament,
has failed in his efforts to put pressure on Netanyahu to
dissuade Lieberman from establishing a new party.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman's office said that while there is "coordination"
between him and his former boss, Netanyahu, the party is
completely independent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local daily The Jerusalem Post reported Sunday that
Leah Rabin, the widow of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, has
said that former chief of general staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak must
join Labor Party leader Ehud Barak in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Her position would put more pressure on the popular former
military chief to join Labor and not to split the center and
left. Shahak and Barak were both preteges of Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Shahak has rejected the invitation from Barak to join the
Labor and is expected to announce his candidacy for prime
minister at the head of a new centrist party Tuesday or
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He and Likud defector Dan Meridor, who is also forming a
centrist party, have held rounds of talks to coordinate their
campaign but failed to reach agreement on issues like when to
unite their forces and who should be the head of the list.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu stressed the necessity for taking full advantage of the
role of enterprises as one of the main force in industrial
applications of science and technology and bringing it into full
play, and ensuring that enterprises become a principal force of
technological innovations.
</P>
<P>
"Medium- to large-sized enterprises should attach great
importance to scientific and technological progress and improving
the quality of the labor force. They should also intensify
technological development and applications of scientific and
technological achievements while promoting the market potential of
high-tech items and related products," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The premier also cited the need for effective policies to
transform institutes involved in applied scientific research into
development enterprises. He said more scientists and technicians
from research organizations and universities should be encouraged
to work closely with the manufacturing, or otherwise help improve
the technological innovativeness of enterprises by forming
different forms of economic entities.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that related efforts will fundamentally change the
current status of the nation's scientific and technological forces
which are for the most part dissociated from manufacturing
enterprises and the market.
</P>
<P>
Research academies and institutes should also improve the
distribution of resources, expand reform of internal management
systems and release redundant personnel. He called for introducing
measures such as the bid system for research projects in order to
advance the reform of research institutes.
</P>
<P>
"We should use means provided by the socialist market economy
to advance the application of scientific and technological
achievements and form an effective system based on the integration
of science, technology and the economy and production," noted Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Participants discussed a report Minister of Science and
Technology Zhu Lilan presented on preparations for a national work
conference on technological innovations and issues related to the
innovativeness of small- to medium-sized enterprises of the
sector. They also finalized matters concerning a national
conference scheduled for later and discussed another report by

</P>
<P>
"I am demanding a clear statement: Do we want national teams
or do we only want club football?" said FIFA president,
interviewed in the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick.
</P>
<P>
He said his plan would see the competition taking place in
all even-numbered years, instead of every four years as at
present.
</P>

"The existing four-yearly tournament is out-of-date. It dates
from the 1930s when teams chugged from one continent to another

</P>
<P>
Qualification for the finals would happen in odd-numbered
years when national teams would take part in continental tou
rnaments.
</P>
<P>
The existing system of qualification, where teams play
international matches in groups over the course of the years
leading up to the finals, would be dropped.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on Pakistan to Mend Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Sunday called on the Pakistani government to take
"practical steps" to mend the strained relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Only "practical steps" by Islamabad can repair the ties between
the two neighbors, Kharrazi told visiting Pakistani Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmad Khan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the close bonds between the two nations, he said,
terrorist activities in Pakistan had left adverse impacts on
Pakistan's national interests, security and its relations with
Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi urged Islamabad to take practical and urgent action to
punish those responsible for the killing of Iranian nationals in
Pakistan to appease the public opinion in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past years, terrorist operations in Pakistan have
hurt the feelings of the Iranian nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Pakistan soured following a series
of killings of Iranians living in Pakistan and the slayings of
Iranian diplomats and a reporter in Afghanistan by the
Pakistani-backed Taliban militia last August.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, a number of Iranian nationals were
killed in Pakistan. In the latest incident in February last year,
two Iranian engineers in charge of a bridge construction in
Karachi were shot dead by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged strong protest to Islamabad and urged it to
take serious measures to punish the killers and ensure security
for Iranians in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmad Khan said Islamabad-Tehran ties were based on
numerous historical, cultural and religious commonalities and
voiced his government's resolve to remove the existing
misunderstandings and indignation hidering bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is determined to investigate the
killing incidents and punish the terrorists, he said, expressing
regret that some deficiencies in the Pakistani judicial system had
caused failures or delays in prosecuting the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Ahman Khan arrived here Saturday morning to convey a message
from Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Oman will take actions to curb
software piracy as an effort toward joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the Gulf News of the United Arab Emirate
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now set to cleanse the software market," Mudrik Al
Musawi, the director of Agencies and Trademarks of Commerce and
Industry Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of software piracy is a must to join the
WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance to implement the Copyright Law enacted
in Oman last June, Musawi said the law was a prerequisite for a
country to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is not in a position to give a specific date
for the ban. "All I can say is that it will be done as soon as
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al Musawi said Oman has imposed a new year ban on pirated
video-tapes and audio-cassettes.
</P>
<P>
Inspection teams started raiding shops in Muscat on
Saturday. "We shall not sit idle until each and every shop sells
genuine cassettes," Al Musawi said.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Workers to Be Retrenched in Singapore in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's top union leader
has expected more workers will be retrenched in Singapore in 1999
and predicted the retrenchment figure will be over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Lim Boon Heng, secretary-general of the National Trades Union
Congress (NTUC) and minister without portfolio, said at a local
ceremony Sunday that his prediction was based on retrenchment
figures before the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, an estimated 25,000 workers lost their jobs in
the city state.
</P>
<P>
But Lim said the current economic downturn has not been as
difficult on workers as expected according to initial feedback
received by NTUC from its members.
</P>
<P>
Citing the expected very low or no growth in the country's
economy, Lim urged moderation in wage expectation.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry has forecast that
Singapore economy will grow by between minus one percent to plus
one percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lim also promised to help workers and their families in
difficulties, saying that NTUC plans to raise a few million
Singapore dollars to provide children of unions members with
education grants.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted the number of education applicants is not as
high as projected, suggesting things are not as difficult as
feared.

<HEADLINE> HK Airport Handles 100,000 Passengers A Day for 1st Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong International
Airport has established a record of the smooth handling of over
100,000 passengers and their baggage in one day during the
Christmas and New Year holiday season, the Airport Authority (AA)
said today.
</P>
<P>
All passengers services were delivered without any incident
throughout the period of December 19 to January 3, despite the
numbers of passengers and flights were much more than that at Kai
Tak airport during the same period last year, AA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's international airport moved from downtown Kowloon
to Chek Lap Kok at the Lantau island in July last year and met
some troubles at the beginning of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that some 250 additional flights were operated
during the final two weeks of December and the daily passenger
throughput ranged from about 80,000 to more than an estimated of
100,000 on December 27, the highest daily figure so far at the new
airport.
</P>
<P>
The average daily number of departing and transfer bags also
increased from 33,000 on a normal day to 42,000 during the holiday
period -- an increase of some 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher passenger throughput had no impact on the efficiency
of passenger services, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of all flights continued to leave on time
or within 15 minutes of schedule; 90 percent of passengers waited
no longer than 10 minutes for their bags; and 98 percent of all
arriving and departing passengers completed immigration
formalities within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Ng Ki-sing, general manager of the Terminal Operations of the
airport, said that the passenger figures are encouraging given the
current economic climate, and the experience during the Christmas
and New Year holidays will prove useful in planning for the
Chinese Lunar New Year period, which traditionally is an even
busier time for air travel in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The airport has recently won the Critics' Choice Award of the
Travel and Leisure magazine, a leading travel magazine in the
United States, for its outstanding performance.

<HEADLINE> Indian Science Congress Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The 86th Indian Science
Congress Opened in Chennai city 2,095 kilometers south of New
Delhi Sunday, the largest annual science gathering in the country.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the meeting, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
asked Indian scientists to spend more time on research and must be
prepared to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
Outlining a four-pronged strategy for science development in
India, Vajpayee said that Indian scientists must focus not only on
quantity, but also on quality that withstand international
scrutiny. Indian scientists must resolve not to remain recipients
of scientific and technological knowledge from outside, but also
become major contributors.
</P>
<P>
He asked scientists to re-focus on solving problems of Indian
industry and agriculture to create a hunger-free society.
</P>
<P>
He said that another important task before scientists is to
train "our children and young generation" in a spirit of
scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"Looking to the future, India should concentrate on information
technology and biosciences, the two knowledge-based sciences
having the widest possible applications," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also asked Indian scientists not to allow themselves
to be arm-twisted by countries denying technologies and to become
trendsetters by shedding their image of being mere recipients of
technologies.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Inputs Still Dog Zambian Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thirty four years after independence,
Zambia's agricultural sector is still characterized by desperate cries
from farmers over the no-availability or late delivery of inputs, Sunday
Times of Zambia reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted agricultural sector insiders as attributing this
perennial problem to a number of factors which need lasting solutions,
otherwise there may be an adverse effect on the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Cooperative Federation managing director , Grieve Sibale said
the
inputs problem is likely to remain unchanged as long as the there is no
body set up to deal specifically with it.
</P>
<P>
"Each year we have this problem of inputs, it is either they come late
or when they do come, then we have distribution bottlenecks. This problem
is likely to be there as long as there is no institution to deal with
inputs specifically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sibale said that the problem has been further exacerbated by the
increasingly prevalent loans defaulting culture among some farmers
especially small scale ones, who are unwilling to repay their loans even if
they have a bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for a streamlined approach to the inputs issue,
Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) chief, Ajay Vashee, said that at the
moment, a clear-cut policy relating to this is lacking.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the market might have been liberalized and there
are now a number of private sector players, there appears to be no guiding
parameters within which they can operate.
</P>
<P>
Vashee proposed establishing a national fertilizer committee to be
composed of representatives from the government and fertilizer dealers, the
ZNFU and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, while acknowledging the necessity of private sector
participation in the agricultural sector, veteran leader of Truckers
Association of Zambia, Charles Madondo, said that this involvement has on
the
whole, had a very token effect.
</P>
<P>
Madondo, who has had a 30 year involvement in the agriculture marketing
sector, noted that the private participants concentrate their efforts
in urban and peri-urban areas at the expense of the productive rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Expressing similar views, Program Against Malnutrition director Friday
Luhila said the private sector appears to be more interested in selling and
battering agricultural products instead of ensuring inputs reaching their
intended beneficiaries.

<HEADLINE> Bombings of Iraq Not to Ease Tensions: UAE Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic bombings of Baghdad
will do nothing for easing tensions between the U.S., Britain and
Iraq, United Arab Emirate's Ambassador to Britain Easa Saleh Al
Gurg was quoted Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the special relationship between the UAE
and Britain, Al Gurg said the current tactics being adopted by
Washington and London had proved harmful to the Iraqi people and
not to bring the conflict closer to a resolution, Dubai-based Gulf
News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has to be looked at on a deeper level. If the
present approach was achieving something, then it would be fine.
But killing 50 people here and 100 people there is not the way,"
said Al Gurg.
</P>
<P>
Al Gurg said that UAE nationals sympathized with Iraqis
affected by sanctions and intermittent air strikes, but also
enjoyed fruitful and historical trade and cultural ties with
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19, with a declared aim of
punishing it for not cooperating with U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The inspections began in 1991 after the Gulf War, sparked by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to ensure Iraq's elimination of
all weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Women favors Pursuit of World Fashion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Zheng
</P>
<P>
XI'AN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ancient Chinese women favored the
pursuit of world fashions back 1,200 years ago, according to an
observer of the fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of contemporary fashions centers on the
avant-garde. Dior, a brand-name in the fashion industry, recently
introduced its new line featuring styles popular during ancient
China's Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The economic-booming dynasty wanted to incorporate the aspects
of diverse cultures, according to Jia Yun, a researcher at the
Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
"The shaping of Western tradition and the ensuing integration
of Chinese and Western cultures," according to Jia, "reflected the
imperceptible process of mutual study and popularity.
</P>
<P>
She said that "fashion trends in Tang Dynasty epitomizes the
cultural panorama of the times."
</P>
<P>
The longstanding peace existent in most periods of the dynasty
enabled people to lead a secure life. And imperial courts helped
create a highly developed economy and mixed culture.
</P>
<P>
Females no longer wore loose-fitting garments that were popular
in the preceding dynasties and they preferred simpler yet stylish
clothing introduced from the West, which subjects in Tang dynasty
referred to as "Hufu" dresses.
</P>
<P>
Hufu was characterized by turned collars, straight sleeves,
chemises, straight slacks and tall boots. Common people preferred
wearing shorter and more flexible trousers similar to those worn
by Persians and Byzantines in the sixth century.

<P>
Furthermore, a few stylish women of Tang dynasty could easily
put on elegant garments the same as Italian women did.
</P>
<P>
These garments gave a vivid expression of nomadic features
which heralded a far cry from the Chinese tradition, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Turndown-collared garments suited swift and violent movements
when riding on horses, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, historical records show that the Tang women were
particularly keen to wear boots. But they would replaced high
leather boots by medium-size or lower or even flat ones to fit
their own use.
</P>
<P>
"Only the people fully confident in themselves are eager to
accept things new from outside," Jia said, "and only in peaceful
and relaxed environment can the foreign-imported culture thrive."
</P>
<P>
Besides garments, other things such as pop music, varied
dances, acrobatics, other recreations, food and even poetry then
were greatly influenced by foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
For a certain period of time, subjects from imperial concubines
to commoners went enthusiastic in performing dances to the
accompaniment of vivid and lively rhythm, just like performing
disco or breakdance in modern times.
</P>
<P>
"Having experienced prolonged wars, the people finally escaped
poverty. They then concerned themselves more with easy way of life
and recreations," Jia said, adding that "their pursuit of novelty
and change among them in turn spurred economic booming and
ideological, political opening-up."

<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A minor earthquake jolted the
Ninglang Yi Ethnic Group Autonomous County in southwestern Yunnan
province on 1:55 A.M. Beijing time today.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are investigating into damages of the
quake which is measured 5 on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was located at 27.2 degrees north latitude, and
101.0 degrees east longitude.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that strong shocks were felt at Ninglang and
adjacent Yanyuan county in Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Seismological Bureau, the latest quake
was part of the series of earthquakes that started in Ninglang on
October 2, last year.
</P>
<P>
The Seismological Bureau of Yunnan province has sent a
five-member team to the site of the quake to look into
damages and monitor seismic movements.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have so far been reported.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Reforms Way of Budget Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) --- The Philippine government will
use a new system on 1999 budget implementation in an effort to cut
graft and speed up the development of vital projects, a
Presidential Palace news release said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Diokno, secretary of Budget and Management, was quoted
as saying the new scheme simplifies funds release procedure.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the development of projects, Diokno said his
department will release funds in cash on a quarterly basis rather
than on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Local governments will get the full amount of
their share in the budget, he added.
</P>
<P>
Diokno believed the reform will ensure the government to
release the necessary funds for essential public services on time.
</P>
<P>
It would also ensure transparency, and guarantee the national
budget free from corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada signed the 1999 budget into
law last December 30 following close coordination between the
executive branch and Congress.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says No to Meeting Sharon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has refused to meet with Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon during his upcoming visit to the United
States, English-language paper the Jerusalem Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is scheduled to travel to New York this week to attend
a convention of Israeli consuls-general, and efforts were made to
arrange a meeting with Albright during his stay.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted U.S. sources as saying that Sharon wanted to
discuss final status topics with his U.S. counterpart, but his
request was rejected. He was told that there was no reason to
talk about final status matters while Israel refused to implement
even the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Washington viewed with gravity the freeze in
the peace process that was announced on the heels of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region last month, as
well as reports of increased building activities in Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has not openly accused Israel of
sabotaging the process in order to avoid the appearance of
interventing in Israeli electoral politics. But the U.S. does
view Israel as responsible for the collapse of the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources stressed that the Wye accords, achieved with
maximal U.S. involvement, was approved by the Israeli government
and Knesset (parliament), and there was no reason to freeze its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye accord signed with the Palestinians in October,
Israel should withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
three stages.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out the first phase of the withdrawal, Israel
suspended the implementation of the second phase, citing
Palestinians' failure to stop anti-Israel rhetoric and cancel the
plan to declare an independent state next May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians are preparing for a joint
Clinton-Arafat summit sometime in March or April, which will
discuss issues including the halt in the peace process and its
ramifications for the expiration of the Oslo accords on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Arekat, head of the Palestinian negotiation team, termed
on Saturday the expansion of settlements, expropriation of lands
and demolition of Palestinan houses a "declaration of war against
the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday after its weekly meeting, the
cabinet of the Palestinian National Authority said "the
government of Israel will bear responsibility for the implications
of freezing the Wye Memorandum and the vicious settlement
offensive waged against the Palestinian lands."
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that during 1998, about 9,000 housing units
were build for Jewish settlers in the territories, and tenders
for construction at Har Homa will be completed this week.

<HEADLINE> China's Army-to-Army Foreign Relations Forge Ahead (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China's military relations with
other countries left the world impressed last year with active
and fruitful exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's
(PLA) active relations with foreign armies have enhanced mutual
understanding and trust, and at the same time demonstrated China's
sincerity in seeking a long-term peaceful environment in both
neighboring regions of Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the PLA welcomed 75 ranking army groups
from over 50 countries, and sent more than 30 delegations led by
senior PLA officers to visit over 60 countries. Moreover, the PLA
carried out some 180 exchanges of visits with the armies of over
50 countries in special professional fields including technology,
culture and art.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, analysts called attention to the PLA's fruitful
exchanges and cooperation with some major countries, noting that
they have done well in promoting the establishment and development
of China's partnership with these powers.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. army relations witnessed a comprehensive growth
following the resumption of such relations in 1997. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen visited China in early 1998, whereas
General Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Chinese Central
Military Commission, made a trip to the United States in
September, which produced arrangements, in line with the consensus
the two presidents reached concerning military relations, to add
new substantial contents to the further growth of army-to-army
exchanges and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Sees His Chance Boosted with Sampras Absent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Patrick Rafter said
on Sunday Pete Sampras' decision to skip this month's Australian
Open might boost his chances of taking the top ranking.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think I can be number one by the end of the
year, hopefully," Rafter said in Adelaide for the Australian
men's hardcourt tournament starting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Pete, as you know, is not coming to the Australian Open now,
so it might give me a little bit more of a chance... Him missing
from the Australian Open just makes it a little more promising,"
Rafter said of the American world number one.
</P>
<P>
Australian Open officials was told by Sampras' agent that he
was too exhausted to vie for the year's first grand slam event.
</P>
<P>
Rafter said, "He's obviously very tired, he's had a very heavy
year last year and he doesn't like to play too much," said Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Rafter is scheduled to play in Adelaide and then a tournament
in Sydney as warm-ups to the Australian Open.

<P>
Also in 1998, quite a number of senior U.S. military officials,
including a number of former defense secretaries and assistant
secretaries, came to Beijing, and consultations on maritime safety
and defense were held right on schedule, both of which displayed
the mutual trust that has been established between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China's military exchanges with its
neighbor Russia exhibited good momentum last year, with a series
of senior Russian army officials, including the Russian defense
minister, coming to Beijing. The two countries acknowledged their
identical or similar stance on world issues, and unanimously
voiced concern over some countries' developing missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, new developments were achieved in China's military
relations with another important neighbor -- Japan. Chinese
defense minister and the Japanese defense agency director-general
exchanged visits last year, which was the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the Peace and Friendship Treaty between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Army-to-army relations with important countries such as those
in the European Union and Australia and Canada were also enlarged
in 1998, as their level and scope were broadened compared with
those of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
As always, China attached great importance to keeping friendly
military ties with neighboring countries. The PLA dispatched
delegations to 17 neighboring countries last year, while receiving
army leaders from over 10 nations, thus further helping China's
friendly bilateral ties with its neighbors to be strengthened, and
mutual trust to be enhanced.

It is worth noting that the defense ministers of both China and
Kazakhstan reached agreement concerning joint efforts in striking
against national splittists during an informal meeting in China's
western city of Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
China's northern border is likely to be more stable, thanks to
a Lanzhou Military Area Command delegation's visit to Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, all of which are on China's northwest
border. A Heilongjiang Provincial Command's visit to Russia's
easternmost border regional command played a positive role in
boosting prosperity and stability in China's northern border area.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, China, as always, retained its traditional ties
with the armies of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exchanges in special professional fields were also
significantly expanded last year, as China became increasingly
active in multi-lateral security forums and arms-control
activities.
</P>
<P>
As stated in the White Paper on national defense issued in
1998, China's progressing military diplomacy signifies that the
country is a responsible nation and an adamant force in

MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Drug trafficking will be the main
target of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force of the
Philippines in 1999, the Philippines News Agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Panfilo Lacson, commander of the task force was quoted as
saying in a radio interview that his unit has already started
building up an intelligence network against drug traffickers and
their contacts abroad.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said his task force is likely to intensify its
coordination with other law enforcement agencies because of the
international nature of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Tackling the drug trade would mean a more orchestrated effort
and better coordination with other agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials of the Philippine National Police said they
will shift its operations to the fight against drug trafficking
this year following the neutralization of 15 kidnap-for-ransom

<HEADLINE> Banks Plan Remedies for Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China is planning organizations
similar to bridging banks, to rescue staggering amounts of bad
loans that are sapping the strength of State-owned commercial
banks, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the country's biggest
State-owned commercial banks, is creating a separate organ within
itself to resuscitate its non-performing assets.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for such institutions is being supported by the
central government. Other commercial banks will likely set up
similar institutions of their own.
</P>
<P>
The new internal bank is expected to go to work soon, but it's
uncertain if it will be a bridging bank or an assets management
company specializing in the treatment of bad loans, a CCB
official said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Songqi, deputy director of the Financial Research Center
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is quoted as saying
that the success of the new organization is believed to hinge on
the actual internal mechanism and the necessary protection of law.
</P>
<P>
Against banking rules, vested interest groups and lobbying
concerning personal benefits have interfered in lending and
debt-clearing affairs for years, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
And it is hard to be 100 percent impartial in selecting
professional managers for the new organization, if the CCB is to
follow the examples of the United States and Sweden, where bad
loans are bought at a discount, regrouped or managed by
specialized companies made up of experts, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A big leap in the action is that the government has at last
started the painful process of slicing off the ailing parts of
State-owned bank's lending, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzania's Economic Growth Slows Down in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) --The growth rate of
Tanzania's economy, which remains heavily dependent on
agriculture, has slowed down over the past year due to the El
Nino related bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania failed to achieve a porjected five percent economic
growth rate due to devastating floods between late l997 and early
this year which paralyzed roads, railways and bridges and
affected movement of goods for both imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
The 1997/98 fiscal year ending June 30 with an economic growth
rate of 3.5 percent was seen as a recessional year in Tanzania,
compared to the previous two years with economic growth rates of
4.2 and 4.0 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Central Bank said in its latest monthly economic
review that export receipts declined by 18.7 percent during 1997/98
to 644.9 million U.S.Dollars from 793.7 million recorded in the
previous year, with both traditional and non-traditional exports
performing poorly.
</P>
<P>
Government revenue reached about 930 million Dollars, below
the target of one billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture contributes around 55 percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP), employs 80 percent of the labor
force and accounts for 58 percent of its export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Affected by floods, growth of agriculture which lacks modern
irrigation systems, slowed down to 2.5 percent in 1998 from 3.6
percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message delivered on January 2, Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa said that his country is short of up to
450,000 tons of food due to adverse weather and destructive
pests.
</P>
<P>
Continuing floods had caused up to 30 percent or more losses
to some agricultural crops. Hardest hit were cotton and coffee,
Tanzania's key foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
The output of cotton lint, called "white gold" by Tanzanians,
dropped to 69,970 tons in 1997/98 from 84,500 tons in the 1996/97
season, the Tanzanian Cotton and Seed Board disclosed.
</P>
<P>
As the country's leading cash crop, coffee accounts for nearly
20 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings estimated
at about 700 million Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the bad weather, coffee's output went down to 38,000 tons
in 1997/98 from 41,000 tons in the previous season.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from coffee, cotton and cashew nuts declined
by 5.7 percent, 33.8 percent and 27 percent respectively when
compared with levels recorded during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that had it not been for El Nino, Tanzania's
economy could have moved onto the fast track. Tanzania's future
looks fine as bright aspects lie in its potential.

<P>
The potential exists in, among others, encouraging political
situation, macro-economic stability and bold economic reform
steps.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has enjoyed high-level stability as opposed to
neighboring Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Even other two east African neighbors, Kenya and Uganda, can't be
a match for Tanzania in this regard in the eyes of foreign
diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
Inflation hit a 17-year low to 12.1 percent in last November,
thanks to the tight monetary policies adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Bold liberalization steps like the divestiture of the National
Bank of Commerce in October 1997, the establishment of the
Tanzania Investment Center in August 1997, the launching of the
Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and the adopting of new Mining Act
in April 1998, had satisfied the international financiers and
increased investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
With more red tapes cut, over 1,000 development projects worth
3.2 billion Dollars have been approved with 168,570 new jobs to
be created, since the former Investment Promotion Center was
transformed in August 1997 into Tanzania Investment Center, which
is rather an investment facilitator than a regulator.
</P>
<P>
To ensure economic recovery, President Mkapa has
expressed the determination to continue with the privatization
drive.
</P>
<P>
The government has started the process to restructure and
eventually privatize utilities such as the Dar es Salaam Water
and Station Authority, Tanzania Harbors Authority, Tanzania
Telecommunications Ltd. and Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
But unusual dry weather linked to La Nina in the past three
months has cast a shadow over the hope for a quick recovery
as the country's economy is generally at the mercy of Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tanzania is heavily indebted. Its domestic debt
stood at 1.4 billion Dollars in late October, up by 8.7 percent
as compared to that of the corresponding period of the previous
year, while its external debt reached 8.28 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, economic analysts here still fear that if the rain
season next year from March to May continues to be unusually dry,
the economic prospect could become doubtful in the country.

<HEADLINE> Growth Up, Inflation Down in Maldives: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Maldivian President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom said the economy of the Maldives has enjoyed another
good year with high growth, low inflation and macroeconomic
stability, reports reaching here from Male said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been brought down from 7.5 percent in 1997 to a
mere 3 percent in 1998, said President Gayoom, who is also
Minister of Finance of the republic, in his annual budget speech
early this week.
</P>
<P>
In details presented to the Maldivian People's Majlis
(parliament), he pointed out that the country's economy in 1998
grew faster than the previous year at 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
High rate of growth were achieved by most sectors of the
economy in the country, such as tourism, trade and construction,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
As in previous year, tourism remained strong, with arrivals for
the first nine months in 1998 showing a nine percent increase over
the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the budget speech, he said the policies of fiscal restraint
will be continued and new efforts will be made to increase the
economic benefits to the nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget estimates for the year 1999, there will
be a 3.1 percent and a 3.3 percent increase in government outlays
on education and health respectively. Social services will account
for 38.8 percent of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget indicated that investor confidence and private
sector investment in 1997 had remained strong. An increase of 22
percent in commercial bank loans to the private sector was
registered for last year. At the same time, the Maldivian
government has ear-marked 22 percent of its 1999 budget for its
investment program.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Earnings Lag Behind Target in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh collected 53.23 billion
taka (1.10 billion U.S. dollars) as revenue earnings during the
first five month of the current fiscal year, 10 percent short of
the targeted 59.22 billion taka (1.22 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection during the July-November period, the
first five months of the 1998-99 fiscal year, however, was 2.57
percent higher than that of the corresponding period of last year,
the English-language The Independent newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Negative growth was recorded at almost all sources of revenue
income, such as import-export tax, customs, value-added tax,
income tax and supplementary duties.
</P>
<P>
The flood hitting the country from July to September in 1998
was a major reason for the shortfall. Fall in export and import
prices in the international market and withdrawal of import duties
from many items after the flood were also responsible for the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's revenue income in the budge for the 1998-99 fiscal
year was projected at 157 billion taka (3.27 billion dollars), 11
percent higher than the actual collection during the previous
financial year.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Americans to Eat Less Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading U.S. experts urged
American people to eat less sugar to avoid obesity and other
health problems, reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There was medical evidence that diets high in sugar could
promote obesity, kidney stones, osteoporosis, heart disease and
dental problems, leading health and nutrition experts from 46
U.S. health groups said in a letter to the secretaries of the
U.S. Departments of Health and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"With all the focus on fat, we've forgotten about sugar. It's
time to rethink our national infatuation with sweets," said
Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest (CSPI).
</P>
<P>
The health experts said soft drinks, with about nine teaspoons
per 12-ounce can, were a main cause of the rise in sugar usage.
Soda could contribute to osteoporosis as many teen-age girls and
women drank sugary soft drinks instead of calcium-rich milk.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a daily diet
of 2,000 calories should include no more than about 10 teaspoons
of added sugar. Surveys conducted by the department show that
most Americans eat roughly double that amount daily.

<HEADLINE> India's Trade Deficit May Top 10 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit for the
1998-99 fiscal year would climb to an unprecedented level of 10
billion U.S. dollars due to unrelenting increase in non-oil
imports, "The Hindustan Times" said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"If the trend persists and global oil prices climb up, the
country would slide towards a balance of payments (BoP) crisis
which might force recourse to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) loans as in the case of 1990-91," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade deficit for the April-November period 1998
has widened to 6.7 billion U.S. dollars as much as the deficit for
whole of 1997-98. According to highly placed government sources,
trade deficit for the 1998-99 fiscal year (April 1 ,1998-March 31,
1999) would exceed 10 billion U.S. dollars as the spurt in non-oil
imports has shown no indication of tapering off.
</P>
<P>
"The frightful trend has triggered off alarm bells at the
ministries of finance and commerce as the country is also under
pressure to scrap all import curbs maintained on BoP grounds," it
s aid.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) ruling in the dispute
with the United States over quantitative restrictions of imports
has also left the government in a sensitive position. Unless an
amicable settlement is worked out with the United States, the
threat of reprisal affecting the country's exports would hang on
precariously.
</P>
<P>
"The picture is not rosy on the exports front as well since
the decline that has been witnessed throughout this financial year
is yet to be stemmed. The decline in exports was highest for the
first quarter at 7.94 percent. Though there has been subsequent
increases and decreases in the level of decline, the constant
factor till now is that negative growth has gripped the sector
firmly," it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund will provide 4072 million
rupees (60 million U.S. dollars) to the Sri Lanka government for
flood control, a ministry communique said.
</P>
<P>
The communique available on Sunday was issued by the Ministry
of Industrial Development. It said the money would be used in the
flood control project in the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia-Ratmalana and
the Greater Colombo areas.
</P>
<P>
The project will come under the third stage of the Greater
Colombo Flood Control, and in the first stage Dehiwala, Mount
Lavinia, Attidiya and Kawdana areas will be covered, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
For the past 15 years, these areas have suffered difficulties
due to flooding during rain, the main cause of which due to
unauthorized constructions, closing of the drains by unscrupulous
persons, and neglect of maintenance of canals and drains.
</P>
<P>
In the Kawdana and Attidiya areas several large concrete tanks
will be built to hold the rain water which will then be sent down
through specially prepared pipes to the sea so that these areas
will be flood free in the future, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Major work on this project will be completed this year. Six
large bridges, several culverts and roads will also be built and
main roads repaired, the communique added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Intensifying Anti-drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is intensifying
anti-drug efforts to stem the inflow of drugs from neighboring
countries, military sources said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As part of the anti-drug campaign, the Thai army is stepping up
border checks against drug shipments by smuggling rings which have
turned to new trafficking routes in Northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The northernmost province of Kanchanaburi has recently become
a hotbed of drug smuggling as drug rings used the area as a
springboard for the illegal trade, said one source, requesting
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Thai anti-drug forces arrested a growing number of
suspected drug smugglers in the province in the past year, and
seized 250,000 amphetamine tablets in one single haul on December
22. This was an indication that drug smuggling rings have changed
their route to the region, Third Army Commander Sommai Wichaworn
said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, which slipped through the border checks, are usually
carried through hill tribe villages along the border before being
taken past mountainous and forest terrain to the plains of
Kamphaeng Phet and on to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It has been discovered that drug traders from other provinces
and Bangkok have traveled to these villages to buy the drugs
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities have set up the National Narcotics
Operation Center to counter the mounting illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Infantry Regiment has been instructed to boost
surveillance along the border to stem the flow of the drug on this
route, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The military has divided its operations into two different
targets. Military units will be sent into the area where massive
drug trafficking was reported but will leave the job to the police
and the civilian agencies if the situation was not serious.
</P>
<P>
Sommai admitted that Thailand faced difficulties in stemming
the drug trafficking because of the many trafficking routes and
the high financial return offered in the business. But he said the
Thai military is determined to continue the fight against the
illegal trade.

75 percent in 1997 to 60 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
There is also considerable drop in the unregistered departures
from November 1998 because of the strict monitoring at the airport
with more checking officers, said the study.

The SLBFE has also taken steps to strictly enforce the Foreign
Employment Act which requires registration for foreign employment.

<HEADLINE> Thai Senate Speaker Says Recession May Worsen This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The recession of the Thai
economy could go from had to worse this year as the agricultural
sector, which has helped prop up entire economy, might suffer a
severe drought, Senate Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shortages of rainfall would cause farm output to drop sharply,
meaning a significant reduction in the country's earnings while
farmers' purchasing power would also weaken, Meechai was quoted
Sunday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The stronger baht and a cut in the Generalized System of
Preferences for some Thai products by the European Union would
also greatly affect exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover enforcement of laws on foreclosure and bankruptcy
would make many more firms collapse and cause non-performing loans
to swell, Meechai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the people could expect a rise in crime rates and
social problems this year.
</P>
<P>
Meechai, however, said he now saw tourism as a "savior" and
suggested that the government inject one or two billion baht into
the industry for promotion campaigns and development of tourist
attractions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says American Aboard Plane Downed in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Saturday that at least one American was aboard a U.N.-chartered
aircraft that went down in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is shocked and saddened by the loss of a
second United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) plane in
one week," said acting spokesman Lee McClenny of the U.S. State
Department.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft reportedly was downed over UNITA-held territory
with eight passengers and crew. This is the second such incident
in one week.
</P>
<P>
Angolan state radio said the plane was hit near Bailundo, a
UNITA stronghold some 80 km (50 miles) north of Huambo. "The
aircraft... tried in vain to make an emergency landing at Huambo
airport," it said.
</P>
<P>
On December 26, a U.N.-chartered C-130 transport plane with 14
people aboard was reportedly shot down near the same city. The
fate of its crew and passengers is unknown.
</P>
<P>
"While the final passenger list is not confirmed, we are aware
of at least one American citizen aboard. The fate of the passeng
ers and crew is uncertain, since the crash site has not yet been
reached," McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States insists that UNITA provide immediate, full
cooperation with MONUA in the face of this latest air disaster,"
McClenny said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Angolan government had given assurances of
its willingness to provide assistance.

<HEADLINE> Annan "Outraged" by Downing of Second U.N. Plane in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said late on Saturday that he "is outraged by reports
of a second United Nations aircraft apparently shot down in
Angola within the past week."
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement that he "expects the Government of
Angola to honor its pledge to provide all possible assistance in
the efforts to rescue survivors. Furthermore, the
Secretary-General demands that UNITA cooperate without delay in
the search-and-rescue missions."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that he urges, in the strongest possible
terms, the Angolan Government and the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) achieve "an immediate
ceasefire which will permit the conduct of search-and-rescue
missions as well as the relocation of United Nations staff to
safer areas."
</P>
<P>
"All threats to United Nations personnel -- in the air and on
the ground -- must cease immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no excuse for any delay on any side in
disclosing all relevant information about the fate of the
passengers and crews of the two United Nations aircraft," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the Angolan capital of Luanda, the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA) said on Saturday that a U.N.-chartered
C-130 transport plane, which belongs to the South African
TransAfrik company, with eight passengers and crew aboard, was
shot down 20 minutes after taking off from Huambo airport in the
UNITA-held territory, central Angola.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said that the aircraft carried one American,
four Angolans, two Filipinos and a Namibian. Their names were
still unknown at the moment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Amadou Toure said in Luanda that the aircraft
had been evacuating U.N. personnel out of Huambo to Luanda
despite fierce fighting in the area.
</P>
<P>
Angolan state radio said the plane was hit near Bailundo, a
UNITA stronghold some 80 kilometers north of Huambo after the
pilot tried in vain to make an emergency landing at Huambo
airport. However, there was no immediate comment from UNITA.
</P>
<P>
On December 26, 1998, another U.N.-chartered cargo plane C-130
from TransAfrik, with 10 passengers and 4 crew members aboard,
crashed in the same area, scene of fierce fighting between
Angola's two conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government claims that UNITA is holding survivors
from the crash, but UNITA denies this and the United Nations
could not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council, at the request of the Russian
Mission to the United Nations, held an emergency meeting on
Thursday to condemn "the incomprehensible lack of cooperation
clarifying the circumstances of this tragedy." The 15-member
Council said it would assess the situation in Angola on January
11.
</P>
<P>
At present, the United Nations has a 1,000-member peacekeeping
contingent in Angola to monitor 1994 peace accords, shattered by
the on-going fierce fighting in central Angola, which has long
been at war since its independence from Portugal in 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The South American
Common Market (Mercosur) countries will have to import 800,000
tons of wheat this year because of a predicted reduction of
grain production, the Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted data from the National Brazilian Staples
Company (Conab) as saying that the total 1998-1999 harvest of the
four Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay)
will be 13.3 million tons, which means a 25.3 percent drop from
the previous harvest of 17.8 million tons.
</P>

Argentina, the major wheat producer in the region, will have a
dramatic grain production reduction of 31.3 percent, from 14.7
million tons to 10.1 million tons.

<P>
The total demand of the four countries is 14.1 million tons of
wheat, of which 8.6 million tons is required by Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Partners Help Expand China's Offshore Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with overseas
partners has enabled China's offshore oil production to grow over
200 times in the past 15 years, the "Business Weekly" reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC),
the country's leading offshore oil developer, extracted 16.28
million tons of oil and 4.05 billion cubic meters of natural gas
in Chinese waters.
</P>
<P>
Taking account of the oil production of CNOOC's overseas
shares, its total annual production amounted to 20.33 million tons
of oil equivalent, more than 200 times that of 1982, when China's
offshore crude oil production was less than 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC President Wei Liucheng attributed its expansion to
cooperation with overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
To date, the CNOOC has signed 137 petroleum contracts and
agreements with 68 overseas oil companies from 18 countries and
regions for oil exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has attracted at least seven billion U.S. dollars of
overseas capital, of which more than three billion has been used
for exploration, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC is now implementing 41 oil contracts and agreements
with 37 foreign companies, including Chevron, Texaco, Phillips,
Arco and Amoco, Cao Yunshi, manager of CNOOC's contracts and
regulations departments.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, CNOOC and Royal Dutch Shell officially
announced to jointly build the world-class Nanhai petrochemical
project in the Guangdong city of Huizhou.
</P>
<P>
With a total contracted investment of around 4.5 billion
U.S. dollars, the joint venture is China's largest Sino-foreign
cooperative project.
</P>
<P>
Following the progress of offshore cooperation, China also
opened 11 southern provinces and autonomous regions to foreign oil
explorers and developers in 1985. In 1992, another 10 northern
provinces and regions were opened.

</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese exporters will enjoy more policy support
that will enable them to have better access to export credit,
export credit insurance and guarantee policies.
</P>
<P>
Starting from January 1, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) began to grant import and export
authority to more Chinese firms, especially privately-owned
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
China will also encourage its firms to start processing
industries overseas with their self-supplied equipment and raw
materials as a way to expand exports.
</P>
<P>
"Transferring some surplus processing industries to countries
who need them, especially in Latin America and Africa, will be
beneficial to both China and those nations," Sun Weiyan, president
of the University of International Business and Economics in
Beijing, said earlier in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It will help China expand exports on one hand, and help those
nations to develop processing industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hard hit by the Asian financial turmoil, China's exports is
predicted to reach a zero or negative growth in 1998. The export
volume in the first 11 months of 1998 inched up 0.2 percent from
the same period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Five Men Shot Dead in Sicily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Five men were shot dead Saturday
evening in a cafe bar in Vittoria, a town in Italy's southern
Sicily, in an incident which had all the hallmarks of a Mafia
settling accounts.
</P>
<P>
Police said the five men, who were drinking coffee and
reading newspapers in the bar, were killed by two gunmen carrying
large-caliber automatic weapons. The gunmen then fled the scene
by a Fiat car.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the cafe bar, 62, was immediately questioned,
after police arrived.
</P>
<P>
The five victims, aged between 20 and 30, had criminal records
and had been under police watch for suspected involvement in drug
trafficking, police said.
</P>
<P>
The killings, police said, may have been a reaction from the
local Mafia to the young men's failure "to observe the rules" in
trying to carve out a share for themselves in the lucrative drug
smuggling.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Invest More in Farm Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The capabilities of research and
development (R&AMP;D) in the agriculture sector will largely determine
how well can China deal with food security problems in the next
millennium, according to China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
It's predicted that by the the year 2030, China will produce
more than 1.5 times the current grain volume to feed a population
of 1.6 billion people, while the demand for livestock and aquatic
products will double.
</P>
<P>
This means that the real grain demand will hit 640 million tons
with a per capita rate of 400 kg by then. The output growth per
hectare should reach 1.4 percent annually, jumping 60 percent from
the current basis, if China attempts to meet all its food needs
domestically.
</P>
<P>
"The application of advanced technologies will play a central
role in sustaining grain output growth at the time, given China's
limited land resources and the world's largest population," said
Huang Yikun, director with Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy
(CCAP).
</P>
<P>
Huang said the government should take effective measures to
bolster the current unsatisfactory levels R&AMP;D progress in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
But, Huang noted, China's investment ratio in agricultural
research is less than half the developed world's average in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from CCAP, China's agricultural
research investment accounted for only 0.36 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1996, lagging 0.29 percent behind that
of the world's 30 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
However, China has to feed 22 percent of the world's population
with seven percent of the world's total arable land.
</P>
<P>
"Under current growth pace, it will take us 45 years to keep up
with middle income countries in terms of agricultural development
investment," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The CCAP statistics indicates that the government's financial
allocations for agricultural research had an average negative
growth of 0.8 percent in the 1985-96 period.
</P>
<P>
At present, many research items are designated by government
departments, ignoring feasibility and market demand, China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the research results cannot maintain sustained
development since the whole process is divided by different
administration, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Unemployment Reaches 20 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless people
plus people who were laid off from their work in Indonesia now
totals 20 million, more than 22 percent of about 90 million people
in the labor force, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment figure is expected to diminish now that the
government had launched labor-intensive projects with funds taken
from the state budget," Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris said on
Saturday in Denpasar, capital of Bali province, according to
reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the funds for the 1998/1999 fiscal year (ends
March 31) labor intensive projects amounted to 1.3 trillion rupiah
(one U.S. dollar equals 8,000 rupiah now).
</P>
<P>
He also hoped the Indonesian economy would improve further so
that the allocation of state budget for the 1999/2000 fiscal year
would increase to cope with unemployment in different areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts estimated that more than 70 million people out
of a population of 202 million have fallen below the poverty line.
Some 30 million of them have experienced absolute poverty by the
end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Renminbi to Remain Stable, Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese currency Renminbi (RMB)
will remain stable in the last two years of the century whereas
the status of the currency will be consolidated and assume
increasing importance as a stabilizing force in world financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted economist Li Guobin, a noted
economist from the State Information Center saying that RMB assets
will remain minimum risk and maximum yields during 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the actual interest rate of RMB at present is
already two percentage points higher than that of US dollars and
major European currencies, which has resulted in high yields for
RMB assets. Even if the central bank cut the interest rate by one
percentage point in the next two years, he added, the actual
interest rate for RMB could still remain between 3.3 to 2.27
percent.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the state foreign exchange reserves will
remain higher than 145 billion US dollars. Counting 110 billion of
foreign exchange assets shared by individuals, enterprises and
financial institutions, China has foreign exchange reserves of
about 250 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, China will see annual demands for
foreign exchange amounting to 60 billion US dollars, including 20
billion US dollars for foreign debt repayment and 30 billion for
three-month imports payments.
</P>
<P>
Li further predicts that the State foreign exchange reserves
and the supply capacity for hard currency will keep growing in the
next two years, as China is expected to maintain the favorable
balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, sustained economic growth in China will
enhance the international appeal of RMB assets because of higher
yields.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, China can keep its economic growth around
eight percent in 1999 and 2000 while the world economic growth can
only maintain 1.2 percent growth this year.

<HEADLINE> Launch of Euro a Mixed Blessing for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The launch of the euro is a
mixed blessing for China's foreign trade and foreign direct
investment inflows, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chinese firms will benefit from a huge market in
one currency, rather than 11 fragmented markets, which makes it
easier to penetrate, according to Michael Oliver of the Hong Kong
Branch of Germany's Commerzbank AG.
</P>
<P>
This will reduce exchange risks and trading costs in trade
between China and the euro-zone, and hence meaning bigger profit
margins for Chinese firms, said Wang Yuanlong, a researcher with
the Institute of International Finance.
</P>
<P>
Faster EU economic growth prompted by the adoption of a single
currency will mean larger demands for products outside the
European Union, said Zhou Wenming, a researcher with the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Zhu Min, director of the Bank of China's Institute
of International Finance, warned that Chinese firms will have to
reposition themselves in the European market, as European banks
and big companies will experience consolidation and restructuring
to adjust to the new market environment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese firms will face strong competition from East
and South European countries, which also offer low-priced
labor-intensive products, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Price transparency will also set spurs to trading within the
euro zone, lead to lower prices and hence lower profit margins,
and force European companies to be more efficient. All these will
make market competition more fierce for Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
It will also put an end to the strategy of differential
pricing, which is usually employed by Chinese firms in trade with
European countries to achieve maximum benefits, Zhou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, Zhou noted, Chinese firms will have to shoulder
mounting currency conversion costs incurred by the launch of
euro. They have to resolve the technical aspects of trade
settlements and valuations, training their employees, employing
new computer software and preparing new sets of financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, there are also exchange rate risks, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The euro is expected to be strong in the long run, considering
the economic strength of the 11 countries. However, the short-term
adjustment after the debut of the euro also means exchange rate
risks, according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This is especially so during the transitional period from 1991
to 2001, Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
As for the impact of the euro on China's foreign direct
investment inflows, the researchers agreed that it will to some
extent divert some foreign direct investment from China. The
reduced investment costs in the EU resulting from a single
European currency are expected to attract more international
investment. Meanwhile, the EU's integration efforts also encourage
investment from developed EU countries to backward ones.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Central Bank to Include Euro in Exchange Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Venezuela
(BCV) will change part of its foreign exchange reserves
denominated in dollars for the new unified European currency, the
euro, Antonio Casas Gonzalez, president of Venezuela's money
issuing institute, has said.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying the percentage of euros we will introduce
into the reserves. It is an important alternate to the dollar,"
Casas was quoted as saying Saturday by "El Universal," the only
newspaper that circulates via Internet in Venezuela during the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Casas said the new currency has many advantages for Europe and
that it will make commercial transactions more agile and less
costly.
</P>
<P>
The BCV president said the bank will include the euro as a
reserve currency since it is considered more important than the
Japanese yen and that it is almost at the same level as the U.S.
dollar.

LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Milion Wolde and Gete Wami gave
Ethiopia a double triumph in the International Amateur Athletic
Federation World Cross Challenge series, winning the men's and
women's races in Durham, England on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wami, the 1996 World cross country champion, ran away from her
rivals in the second half of the women's 6.5 km race, crossing
the line in 21 minutes 58 seconds, 13 seconds clear of
second-placed Jackline Maranga of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Annemari Sandell was third while European champion
Paula Radcliffe of Britain, still recovering from the
after-effects of a cold, managed only fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Wami, who won the opening race in the series two weeks ago in
Belgium, leads rankings with 50 points with Sandell second on 41.
</P>
<P>
Wolde, the reigning world junior cross country champion, had a
tougher time as he won the men's 9 km race.
</P>
<P>
John Kosgei made all the early running and led into the last
of seven laps but then the Kenyan ran out of steam leaving the
race to be decided between Wolde, Kenya's Thomas Nyariki and
Britain's Jon Brown.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian proved the quicker in the three-man sprint for
the line, finishing in 27:02.
</P>
<P>
Nyariki finished second, just two seconds adrift, but moved to
the top of the rankings with 39 points.
</P>
<P>
Brown, the 1996 European cross country champion, had to be
content with third place in 27:05.

<HEADLINE> Leukaemia Could Be Inherited: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- British scientists, by
pinpointing a gene responsible for some cases of the most common
type of leukaemia, have found the first evidence of a hereditary
link to the disease.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, published Saturday in The Lancet medical
journal, showed that almost 20 percent of sufferers of chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) could have a mutated version of the
gene known as ATM.
</P>
<P>
Of these, one in three may have inherited the fault, reported
Professor Malcolm Taylor and colleagues from Birmingham
University.
</P>
<P>
"We have suspected for some time that a number of patients with
this type of leukaemia could be carriers of a faulty gene."
Professor Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
"But the fact that we have been able to isolate the specific
gene and show that it could run in families is certainly a major
scientific step forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the discovery should help scientists develop
new ways to repair the defective gene and ultimately prevent CLL
developing.
</P>
<P>
CLL, the most common type of leukaemia affecting people over 50
in 90 percent of cases, is not immediately life-threatening and
its progression can be effectively controlled by drugs for many
years.
</P>
<P>
Its main danger is in weakening the patients' immune system and
leaving sufferers susceptible to other serious infections.
</P>
<P>
Professor Taylor's team believe, however, that problems with
the ATM gene could be responsible for a more aggressive form of
the disease.

<HEADLINE> Personal Stereos Can Damage Hearing, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Personal stereos can seriously
damage the hearing of people who have suffered middle ear
infections as children, French researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
The investigators assessed hearing status in 1,208 young men
aged 18-24 years who were having medical examinations at selection
centers for the army in France.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the medical journal The Lancet, the researchers from
the Centre de Recherche du Service de Sante de Armees at La
Tonche, said that the use of personal stereos for at least one
hour a day was found to harm the youngsters' hearing.
</P>
<P>
Approximately one in five of those youngsters who used personal
stereos with the volume turned up high experienced problems with
their hearing.
</P>
<P>
The level of noise at which they could detect a sound was much
higher than those with normal hearing. The phenomenon was found
for sounds at all normal human hearing frequency range.
</P>
<P>
The harmful effect, however, was strongly dependent on whether
the men had suffered repeated middle-ear infections in infancy or
in childhood.
</P>
<P>
Personal stereos had no effect on men without a history of ear
infections. For those who had suffered childhood ear infections
the loudness threshold at which they could hear sounds was on
average 11 decibels higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
"Young people with a history of repeated episodes of otitis
media should be warned that personal stereo use is a risk factor
for deafness." the researchers suggested.

<HEADLINE> Women Suffering Migraine at Higher Risk of Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Women who suffer from migraines
are much more likely to have a stroke than those who do not,
British scientists have claimed.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from the Imperial College School of Medicine
in London and the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, found that young
women with a history of migraines are three and a half times more
likely to have an ischaemic stroke.
</P>
<P>
An ischaemic stroke is caused by a lack of blood to the brain
due to constriction or blockage in a blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
In their research, Dr Limmie Change and colleagues have
examined in five European countries 291 women aged between 20 and
44 who had suffered strokes.
</P>
<P>
The result, published in the latest issue of the British
Medical Journal, showed that 20-40 percent of strokes in women who
had a history of migraine seemed to develop directly from a
migraine attack.
</P>
<P>
They found that the risk is increased further if they also
smoke, have high blood pressure or use oral contraceptives. A
woman who suffers from migraine, smokes and takes oral
contraceptives is 35 times more likely to have a stroke.
</P>
<P>
"The data presented here suggest that women who have migraine
should be advised strongly not to smoke, and that their blood
pressure should be carefully monitored and controlled," wrote the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, cautioning that further research was needed,
also found that a family history of migraine, regardless of
personal migraine history, upped the risk of not only an ischaemic
stroke but also a haemorrhagic stroke, where a burst blood vessel
leads to a lack of blood to the brain.
