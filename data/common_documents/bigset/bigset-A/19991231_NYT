WHEN composing a list, one should keep in mind there are two kinds
of people in this world: those who divide people into two kinds and
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we push bravely forward to the year 2000, we have been
bombarded with the 10 best of this and the 100 best of that; a
thousand ways to measure greatness and cling to the past, even as
we blow a kiss to tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The intention here was to offer a list of not the best or the
brightest, but simply the most colorful athletes and coaches we
have known and truly enjoyed. That collection would have included
such distinctive figures as Muhammad Ali, Bo Belinsky, Jimmy
Demaret, Al Davis, Larry Dierker, George Foreman, A.J. Foyt, Abe
Lemons, Shelby Metcalf, Calvin Murphy, Joe Namath, Bum Phillips,
Pete Rose, Darrell Royal, Doug Sanders, Rusty Staub, Bill Veeck,
Bill Yeoman and
</P>
<P>
   That was the problem. There was no end to this catalog. When the
number reached 30, and climbing, it became clear an alternate plan
would be needed. As luck would have it, we hit upon one that was
wonderfully personal: My Favorite Sports Icons Whose Biographies,
In Some Meager Way, I Helped Co-author. To minimize the
self-serving nature of such a list, it should be pointed out that
most or all of the books are out of print. We refer to them now for
memories, not sales, offering excerpts, not discounts:
</P>
<P>
   George Allen _ He never suffered a losing season with the Rams
or Redskins, then came out of retirement, at 72, to take over a
thankless coaching job at Long Beach State. ``It's the first time
in my career,'' he said, ``that I had players who wore their hair
in ponytails and had rings in their ears, and the trainer was a
girl.'' He then added: ``I got rid of the first two.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry _ As the owner of the California Angels for 30 years,
he never made it to the World Series, just as he failed to get the
girl in his heyday as the Singing Cowboy. ``I never kissed the
horse,'' said Autry, dispelling one myth. Of another, he said, ``It
always surprised me when people were surprised to learn that I was
rich. The two things I was never good at were singing and acting. I
was always good at numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   George Blanda _ He played quarterback until he was 47 and kicked
field goals until he was nearly 50. He loathed the hippie culture
of the 1960s. When an NFL player boasted about making a big play
while high on mescaline, Blanda countered: ``I once punted the ball
72 yards, and I was high on Polish sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear Bryant _ At Texas A&AMP;M, he once stopped practice to watch me
throw a football on the sideline to a student manager, Joe Schmidt.
Hey, his practices were long, and I was bored. After Bryant blew
his whistle, his players, including John David Crow, froze. Walking
slowly toward me, his voice echoed over the field. ``Oh, I'm
sorry!'' said the Bear. ``I thought you were Sid Luckman.'' Then he
blew his whistle, and everyone scurried bacy of thisly workou the

NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS FIT INTO TIGHT BUDGETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Notebook computers once were used only by corporate
types who'd fallen into favor with the hardware gods at the office,
or who checked out a battered model from the departmental pool.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years, computer makers have realized that
there's more to portable life than just customers at the Fortune
1000. They've discovered that your Uncle Barry, with his
on-the-side phone-card business, needs a notebook to keep track of
his sales while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those sales are still piddling, so Uncle Barry can't
afford much, but he still needs a decent machine that can run
office applications in a frisky manner. And because it may be his
only machine, it may need to have some consumer features, too.
</P>
<P>
   Computer manufacturers feel Uncle Barry's pain and, sensing a
market opportunity, have churned out models such as the three
below:
</P>
<P>
   ThinkPad 1480 _ $2,300, IBM
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is a member of IBM's iSeries line, sold primarily at
retail, but also online. IBM aims this portable at small- and
home-business users, as well as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1480 comes with a 466-megahertz Intel Celeron processor, 64
megabytes of memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM drive,
a 14.1-inch active matrix display, a built-in 56K fax modem, a
built-in floppy drive and all the usual ports and slots. That
includes an S-video connection, so you can play DVD movies on a TV.
</P>
<P>
   While the model I had came in basic black, looking very much
like most other ThinkPads, it is available in seven different
colored covers. Open it up, and you'll see yet another departure
from IBM's basic black color scheme _ a festive set of Internet and
program-launching buttons.
</P>
<P>
   This notebook was a great performer, launching programs quickly
and playing most games smoothly. The screen was crisp and clear and
very bright, looking best in its native 1,024-by-768 resolution. It
played DVDs particularly well and has external controls so you can
listen to music CDs without turning the computer on.
</P>
<P>
   ThinkPads all come with IBM's familiar TrackPoint pointing
device, which looks like an eraser jammed between the G and H keys.
While I like this device, others find it hard to get used to. And
it's fairly easy to hit the nub accidentally, which sends your
cursor careening into the paragraphs above.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life was excellent; I got well over three hours of power
on a charge.
</P>
<P>
   IBM cuts costs by not even pretending to make this machine a
lightweight. It's quite wide, which makes room for a 15-inch screen
available in other models. I had a hard time jamming it into my
notebook carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plastics used on it are fairly cheap as well. A
switch for the nightlight _ which illuminates the keyboard in the
dark _ popped off, as did a latch for securing the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosignia 150 _ $2,200, Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosignia brand is the one Compaq sells online and through
its DirectPlus mail-order operation, but it's very similar in
design and features to some of its Presario notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 uses a 475-MHz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 chip, 64 MB
of memory, a 6.4-GB hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive (though the model I
tried had a 24X CD-ROM instead), a built-in 56K fax modem, a
built-in floppy drive, a 14.1-inch active matrix screen and the
usual set of ports.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosignia line uses a touchpad as a cursor, and I really
like Compaq's implementation, which is very responsive. However, I
found myself brushing it with the base of my thumb while typing,
which again hurled the cursor northward.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 also has a set of Internet buttons on it, as well as
external CD controls.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, was a snappy performer _ the K6-2 chip ran everything
that was thrown at it. Battery power was adequate, lasting just to
the three-hour mark. The screen was gorgeous, though not quite as
bright as the IBM.
</P>
<P>
   And like the ThinkPad, don't plan on nimbly dashing through
airports with this one, either. It's quite heavy, though not as
wide as the IBM model.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiron 3700 _ $2,400, Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also has discovered the joy of color, though the Inspiron
3700 only gives you two choices for an accent color that graces the
inside of the machine _ dark blue or hunter green. I had a blue
model, which my oldest daughter succinctly described by saying,
``Uh, Daddy, that's really ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath its skin, though, the 3700 has a 466-MHz Celeron
chip, 64 MB of memory, a 6-GB hard drive, a 6X DVD-ROM drive, a
modular floppy drive, a 14.1-inch active matrix screen and the
usual ports.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it does not come with a built-in modem. Instead,
Dell includes a 56K PC-card modem. It also comes with a DVD
controller in the form of a PC card, so once you pop both of these
into the two PC-card slots, you're full up.
</P>
<P>
   Also note that, of the three machines, it does not accommodate
both a floppy and the CD or DVD drive at the same time, unless you
use an optional external adapter for the floppy. Otherwise, you
have to swap between the two drives.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a touchpad controller, which I found was not quite
as responsive as the Compaq's. On the other hand, it also didn't
have the jumping cursor problem.
</P>
<P>
   While the screen had a crisp look, it was the darkest of the
three. In bright light, such as a shaded outdoor area, it was
almost unviewable.
</P>
<P>
   It also had the least amount of battery life, giving me only
about two hours of juice between charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspiron 3700, like its competitors here, is a heavy, bulky
machine. I look forward to the day when machines in this class
don't double as weightlifting devices.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Storming a shabby Brooklyn apartment block at dawn on
Thursday, a black-clad antiterrorist task force seized a man they
alleged was an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian charged
with trying to smuggle powerful explosives and four sophisticated
timing devices across the border near Seattle two and a half weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man arrested on Thursday, identified as Abdel Ghani, a
31-year-old Algerian, traveled to Seattle earlier this month to
meet with Ressam as part of an elaborate Islamic terrorist bomb
plot, federal authorities said. But their role in the plan was
foiled when Ressam, nervous, suddenly bolted off a ferry at the
border when a Customs Service agent looked in the trunk of his car,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani was arrested on a day that agents from the FBI fanned out
to question, and in some cases detain, Algerian immigrants in
several cities. In Vermont, federal prosecutors said that a
Canadian woman arrested while crossing the border with another
Algerian man was linked to Ressam. In successfully arguing that the
woman be kept in federal detention, prosecutors said that Ressam
and the Canadian, Lucia Garafolo, were friends of Said Atmani,
identified in court papers as a member of the Armed Islamic Group,
`'a violent Algerian terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents acknowledged privately that they hoped the sweep
would serve as a warning or a deterrent to potential terrorists. In
Boston, federal officials arrested five men, one of whom fled from
his workplace, and officials chased him with guns drawn, but the
men were charged only with immigration violations, not with
anything related to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani was charged with helping Ressam's efforts to bring
explosives into the country with the intention of setting off a
bomb, and with trying to conceal his assistance. At a news
conference on Thursday night, however, Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant
director of the FBI in charge of the New York office, said
officials were not aware of any threat to a specific target in New
York City or elsewhere. He also noted that no explosives were found
in connection with the arrest of Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, federal law enforcement officials said they had
concluded that the Ghani and Ressam were part of a broad plot. They
speculated that because Ressam was caught in mid-December, he could
have been contemplating an attack close to New Year's, but
acknowledged that they had no evidence indicating that such an
attack had been planned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that yesterday's arrest did not mean the ring was
broken up. `'The most interesting thing is there are more,'' one
official involved in the investigation said. `'We know there are
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The question left unanswered was why the Armed Islamic Group
would plan a strike in the United States. The criminal complaint
filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Thursday said that
based on information from a confidential source, federal agents had
concluded that Ghani and another associate believed that ``Allah
will shake up this world, that a new generation will punish
America, and that Islam's renaissance will rise from Algeria.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint was based on an affidavit submitted by
Bradley S. Morrison, an FBI agent assigned to the Joint Terrorist
Task Force of the FBI and the New York Police Department. In it,
Morrison states that because this affidavit was intended only ``for
the limited purpose'' of establishing probable cause to arrest
Ghani, ``it does not include all the facts that have been learned
during the course of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint did offer a broad-brush image of the plot,
much of which, Morrison's affidavit suggest, was sloppily executed.
It recounts how Ghani left a trail of evidence, from fraudulent
credit card receipts to a destroyed plane ticket hastily dropped in
a Dumpster, as federal agents observed him and listened in through
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was carefully compartmentalized, according to the
criminal complaint, so that in case of an arrest, each person
involved would know only the tasks of two others. Ressam, was to
leave the car, with its cargo of bomb-making material and the keys,
in a parking lot, and someone else would drive it away. Then he and
Ghani were to go to Chicago and other places on a ``fund-raising''
mission, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam is believed to be part of a gangster-terrorist underworld
group that committed a series of armed robberies and shootouts with
the police in northern France and later set up a Canadian base in
Montreal, according to French antiterrorism investigators. The
French authorities say the organization grew out of the Armed
Islamic Group, part of a bloody insurgency in Algeria, and out of
Arab forces who fought on the Muslim side during the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani is to be formally charged with ``willfully and knowingly''
providing ``material support and resources'' for Ressam's attempt
to violate federal anti-explosives laws and concealing and
disguising his role, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he is being charged with credit card and bank fraud
in a series of schemes involving counterfeit credit and bank cards
and illicit bank withdrawals under the false name Eduardo Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mary Jo
White, said that, if convicted, Ghani could face up to 10 years in
prison on the charges of concealing material support of a terrorist
group, and up to 5 years on the fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   At first, four men, including Ghani, were held on Thursday after
the Joint Terrorist Task Force raid by FBI agents and the New York
City Police shortly after 6 a.m. in the Midwood section of
Brooklyn. Two were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The third, Najmeddine Houaichi, a 35-year-old Algerian, was
turned over to immigration authorities on charges that he was in
the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint filed against Ghani suggested that
however complex and sophisticated the alleged bomb plot might have
been, it's execution left something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, according to the complaint, was nervous at the
Washington state customs point because he did not speak English. He
ran off the ferry that had carried him in from Canada, chased by
customs agents, and was arrested after he tried, and failed, to get
into a passing car from the driver's side. In the trunk of Ressam's
car, Customs agents found four timing devices made from Casio
watches and 9-volt batteries and 193 pounds of various explosive
compounds, among them, officials say, a material known as RDX
(cyclotrimethylene trinitramine), widely used by military
demolitions experts.
</P>
<P>
   Also found on Ressam, according to the complaint, was a scrap of
paper bearing the name `'Ghani'' and a telephone number in the 718
area code. The telephone number was traced to 944 Newkirk Avenue in
Brooklyn, a three-story gray brick building with apartments on the
two upper floors and shops _ a laundry, an Afghan kebab restaurant
and a supermarket _ on the street level.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord of the building in the heavily Pakistani
neighborhood, Dr. Iftikhar Dim, said on Thursday that about three
months ago, two men named Najeem and Rashid who lived in one of the
top floor apartments asked him if a friend of theirs named Ghani
could move into a vacant apartment. He did so, Dim said, but did
not sign a lease.
</P>
<P>
   Having traced the phone, FBI agents began staking out the
building, watching Ghani come and go. On Dec. 21, the complaint
said, the agents watched as Ghani threw away several documents in a
Dumpster by a nearby supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Rummaging in the Dumpster, the agents found, torn in half, a
Delta Airlines ticket for a flight from Seattle to Kennedy
International Airport on Dec. 16. There was also a Fleet Bank
account statement in Ghani's false name of Eduardo Rocha that
showed four cash machine withdrawals in Seattle between Dec. 13 and
Dec. 15, three for $390 and one for $329.
</P>
<P>
   This led them to a hotel in the Seattle area, where they found
that a man giving the name Edward Rocha and the address 944 Newkirk
Avenue, Brooklyn, had checked in on Dec. 11 and out on Dec. 16. In
addition, a surveillance camera on one of the Seattle cash
machines, had a picture that matched the FBI surveillance photo
made of Ghani in Brooklyn, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Contingency plans to arrest Ghani had been in place for days, a
law enforcement official said. The raid was planned and directed
from the FBI operations center at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan,
which opened onWednesday as part of the bureau's Year 2000
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The raid sent dozens of police officers and federal agents clad
in black combat fatigues, helmets and bulletproof vests, armed with
assault rifles and shotguns, into the sleeping neighborhood. They
sealed off an entire block and, shouting wildly, raced up stairways
and fire escapes, emerging with their captives, witnesses said.
Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in, but no trace of explosives was
found, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vermont case, U.S. Attorney Charles R. Tetzlaff told the
court that Ms. Garafolo, the Canadian woman arrested for crossing
the border with an Algerian illegal immigrant, Bouabide Chamchi,
also appeared to have ties with the same terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the prosecutor quoted information federal
authorities had received ``from a foreign government'' that linked
her to Said Atmani, who had for a time been Ressam's roommate in a
Montreal apartment. French and Canadian investigators say that
Atmani had been running a ring of Algerian terrorists in Montreal
that stole cell phones and laptop computers from parked cars to
finance their activities. The Canadian government had deported
Atmani to Bosnia, which he had listed as his country of origin when
he entered the country illegally.

100 DEFINING MOMENTS OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (SLANG -- Attn. Sports) 
By MATT McHALE  
 Staff Writer  
When it comes to sports in the millennium, the 1900s haven't been
the best century yet, they've been pretty much the only century
yet. To risk stating the obvious, American sports as we know them
today didn't exist 100 years ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did we get from there to here? The answers begin on page 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News has devised a list of the 100 most impacting,
significant, remarkable developments of the sports century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those developments were momentary happenings (such as
the 1958 NFL championship game), some were the result of lengthy
deliberation (like Title IX) and some took decades to unfold
(improvements in medicine, nutrition and training) _ but all had
far-reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases (Bob Beamon's long jump, for instance), the
implication is simply the imprint on history of a standout
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Not included on our list are all of those dazzling developments
that seemed significant at the time but were merely dramatic _ for
example, the 94 plays that sportswriters instantly labeled The
Catch, The Drive or The Call.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, sports have been shaped not only by their players,
coaches and commissioners but by changes in the nation and world
around them. Advances in communications and transportation, the
growth of leisure time and the forces of immigration and racial
integration have all had an effect.
</P>
<P>
   In no small part, sports have helped to change the nation in
turn, as in the case of the development we've honored as No.1.
</P>
<P>
   No more hints. Enjoy the century one last time. If your favorite
didn't make the list, we promise to do better next time.
</P>
<P>
   100. Birth of the Harlem Globetrotters (1927): Sports is
entertainment, and it can fairly be said the Trotters have served
up more of it to more people in more arenas (and cow pastures and
empty swimming pools) than any other team.
</P>
<P>
   99. Return of the two-sport star: Bo Jackson, Deion Sanders and
others offered some hope that the all-around athlete isn't dead
(even if he seems to be injured a lot).
</P>
<P>
   98. LeMond's Tours: Almost every American learns to ride a bike,
but none had learned as well as Greg LeMond, who became the
nation's first Tour de France winner in 1986 and won again in 1989
and 1990. Having missed two years after being shot in a hunting
accident, LeMond won in 1989 by making up 50 seconds on the final
day in America's greatest moment in that universal sport.
</P>
<P>
   97. Olga Korbut (1972): The 4-foot-11 Belarussian finished
seventh in the all-around gymnastics competition in Munich after
qualifying for the Soviet team as an alternate. But after a tearful
disaster on the uneven bars, she won gold for the balance beam and
the floor exercise, a display of pluck that earned her a place in
U.S. television viewers' hearts as the first of the obligatory
Olympic gymnastics darlings.
</P>
<P>
   96. The designated hitter: With a bases-loaded walk by the New
York Yankees' Ron Blomberg against the Boston Red Sox's Luis Tiant
on opening day in 1973 at Fenway Park, the American League began
its experiment with the DH, inspiring nearly every minor and
amateur league to adopt the rule. Its merits are still being
debated. Its effects on the hitter-pitcher battle are less
debatable.
</P>
<P>
   95. ``White Shoes''' dance: Before wide receiver Billy ``White
Shoes'' Johnson of the Houston Oilers popularized the end-zone
dance in the 1970s, the notion of flashy celebrations of an
athletic job well done were considered bad form. In some corners,
they still are. That hasn't stopped the various high-fivers,
forearm-bashers, chest bumpers and sports-bra flashers from
stretching their camera time.
</P>
<P>
   94. Dr. J's dunk: Professionals had been dunking for years
before Julius Erving made it an art form. His performance in a
halftime contest at the final ABA all-star game in 1976, beating
David Thompson by stuffing the ball through the hoop after taking
off from the foul line, marked the start of an era in which young
individualists seemed to want to do little BUT show off their fancy
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   93. Wrestling's revival (1980s): If the ``legitimate'' sports
seem more and more to be moving in the theatrical direction of pro
wrestling, it seems clear they will never catch up. Wrestling grows
nuttier by the cablecast, and more popular.
</P>
<P>
   92. ``Junk sports'': Where there's a fan or TV viewer with
dollar, there's an inventive promoter trying to pry it away from
him. Thus the attempts to establish arena football, indoor soccer,
team tennis, roller hockey, beach volleyball and other weird
offshoots of the traditional sports.
</P>
<P>
   91. ``X Games'': A generation after Evel Knievel made failure
cool, daredevil athletes and action-hungry cable networks put their
heads together and came up with a junk-sports Olympiad long on
creative ways to dislocate your wrist.
</P>
<P>
   90. Rise of the Winter Games: Was it Peggy or Dorothy or Torvill
and Dean or Tai and Randy or Tonya and Nancy. ...? Sometime in the
past three decades, Olympic figure skating achieved popularity that
seems to transcend sports or soap opera, whichever it more closely
resembles.
</P>
<P>
   89. Ripken's streak: That Cal Ripken played 2,632 consecutive
games proved more than any other feat that no record is
unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   88. Jacques Plante's masquerade (1959): The great Montreal
Canadiens goalie first donned a protective mask in competition _
making it acceptable for scarfaced netminders all over the NHL _ in
an early season game against the New York Rangers. Plante had been
bloodied by an Andy Bathgate backhander, and the Canadiens didn't
have a backup that night. He'd wanted a mask for years but club
management cited tradition and said no.
</P>
<P>
   87. George Mikan: The star of pro basketball's pre-shot-clock
era, the first great Lakers center inspired a pivotal rule change _
widening the foul lane from 6 feet to 12 to keep a dominant big man
from camping under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   86. Wilt Chamberlain: Some players, like some events, are
significant all by themselves, as icons of their sports and times.
Ruth. Grange. Gretzky. Ali. Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   85. Retro stadiums (1990s): A peculiar trend was the
construction of ballparks at the end of the century (notably
Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards) that looked like ballparks
at the beginning of the century. Since such tastes go in cycles,
how long before we grow nostalgic for symmetry and faded artificial
turf, and somebody builds a replica of the Astrodome?
</P>
<P>
   84. Second-generation stars: From Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey
Jr. to Kobe Bryant and J.T. Snow, it seems as if more and more top
athletes are sons of top athletes. Of course, none of the above is
the first or greatest son-of _ 1935 Triple Crown winner Omaha was
the son of 1930 Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox.
</P>
<P>
   83. Jack beating Arnold (1962): It took an 18-hole playoff for
the 22-year-old Nicklaus to knock off Palmer in the U.S. Open at
Oakmont. Their rivalry would stretch through the 1960s until
Nicklaus was recognized as the best golfer of all time and Palmer
merely the most beloved.
</P>
<P>
   82. Parimutuel betting: The arrival, in the century's first
decade, of the French-invented system of wagering ``among
ourselves'' saved American horse racing (not to mention greyhound
racing and jai-alai) from the corrosive influence of bookmakers.
</P>
<P>
   81. Off-track betting: Back in 1973, people who really didn't
attend Secretariat's Belmont claimed they were there. If it
happened today, people would claim they were in the OTB, cashing
the superfecta on the ninth at Calder. The expansion of off-track
and simulcast wagering opportunities has drawn fans away from the
rail and robbed the sport of much of its poetry.
</P>
<P>
   80. Bite of the Century (1997): That was the headline in many
papers after Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear during a title
fight. The incident summed up boxing in the 1990s, when the sport
of Don King and 46-year-old heavyweight champion George Foreman
became a joke wrapped in a rip-off inside a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   79. Decline of the simplest games: Look at an L.A. sports page
from the 1950s. Boxing, horse racing and track and field were all
over page 1. Maybe it's mismanagement and scandal that have caused
these most elemental sports to slip in popularity. Or maybe it's
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   78. The BCS (1998): In a further break from the traditional
college football postseason schedule, the sport reshaped the Bowl
Coalition and the subsequent Bowl Alliance by introducing a
complicated ranking system under the banner Bowl Championship
Series. The BCS' formula was the object of ridicule but seen as a
step (we've heard this before) toward national playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   77. Jim Thorpe: The early leader for the title of Athlete of the
Century, the American Indian star was a football All-American in
1911 and 1912 and won the pentathlon and decathlon at the 1912
Olympics. When it was revealed he had played professional baseball
before all that, he was stripped of his Olympic medals, which were
returned to his family after his death, following decades of debate
on the meaning of amateurism.
</P>
<P>
   76. Pros in the Olympics: Now, of course, there would be no
Thorpe controversy. The crumbling of the amateurism requirement _
winked-at though it might have been anyway in many cases _ has been
gradual. The dam-burst came in 1992 at Barcelona when NBA players
were allowed to represent their countries in the basketball
competition.
</P>
<P>
   75. Formation of Little League (1939): It has taught generations
of boys (and girls, since 1974) the fundamentals of baseball and
sportsmanship. Now, if it can do the same for their parents ...
</P>
<P>
   74. Lowering the mound (1968): Baseball doesn't change its rules
too often. If it did, it would be football or basketball. But it
had to give in after a pitching-dominated 1968 season that featured
Bob Gibson's 1.12 ERA, Don Drysdale's 582/3 consecutive shutout
innings, Carl Yastrzemski's league-high .301 average, a 1-0
All-Star Game and Denny McLain's 30 wins.
</P>
<P>
   73. The shot clock: The NBA's adoption of the 24-second limit in
1954, to prevent stalling, was a rule change as effective as it was
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   72. The Fosbury Flop (1968): The United States' Dick Fosbury
literally turned high-jumping upside down as he won the Olympic
gold medal in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   71. ``Ball Four'' (1970): Pitcher Jim Bouton's kiss-and-tell
diary piqued the public's and press' fascination with the real
lives of professional athletes. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn labeled the
book ``detrimental to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   70. SI: Sports Illustrated hit the newsstands for the first time
in 1954, a literate weekly much different from today's sales
vehicle. The magazine lost $26 million before reporting its first
profit in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   69. Howard Cosell: The imitable Howard, who made Monday Night
Football must-see TV, deserves an entry all to himself for what he
did for sportscasters and for sports media critics. He'd have said
so, for certain.
</P>
<P>
   68. TV's jockocracy: In other words, Cosell changed sports
broadcasting but not enough. What Cosell warned against has come to
pass, every retiring athlete of minimal note being instantly fitted
for a professional broadcaster's costume.
</P>
<P>
   67. Roone Arledge: As the innovative president of ABC Sports
from 1968 to 1975, he revolutionized the technique and substance of
sports television.
</P>
<P>
   66. Instant replay: Introduced by ABC-TV in its 1961 college
football coverage, it has been repeated by every network in every
sport in every possible fashion (slow-motion, Super Slo-Mo,
reverse-angle, with Telestrator ...). And repeated. And repeated.
</P>
<P>
   65. TV sports' debut (1939): For the record, the first of the
major American sports to get live coverage was baseball, which
debuted on New York City station W2XBC with an Aug. 26 game between
the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers. Red Barber did the
play-by-play. Date of first Budweiser ad is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   64. Carlton Fisk's home run (1975): The Boston Red Sox catcher's
12th-inning drive off Fenway Park's left-field foul pole, and the
body English that seemed to keep the ball fair, to end game 6 of a
World Series the Cincinnati Reds went on to win, was the first
great baseball moment to be enhanced by television.
</P>
<P>
   63. The first NIKEs: University of Oregon track coach Bill
Bowerman and Phil Knight put up $500 each to begin a sportswear
empire using running-shoe soles molded in Bowerman's wife's waffle
iron. Bowerman died a multimillionaire last week at 88.
</P>
<P>
   62. The Harris County Domed Stadium: Otherwise known as the
Astrodome, it opened in 1965, introducing the concepts of
climate-control, noisy scoreboard entertainment and (later)
artificial turf to baseball and football.
</P>
<P>
   61. The Seles stabbing (1993): One crazed fan, one vulnerable
player. How is it that this never happened before?
</P>
<P>
   60. Magic Johnson's retirement (1991): Sexually promiscuous pro
athlete has the AIDS virus. How is it that THIS never happened
before?
</P>
<P>
   59. Gertrude Ederle's swim (1926): In the most celebrated
athletic achievement by a woman to that date, the 19-year-old New
Yorker swam the English Channel in 14 hours, 31 minutes _ breaking
the record for women or men.
</P>
<P>
   58. Women's World Cup (1999): The United States women's soccer
team was expected to win, and did. What it couldn't have been
expected to do was to embody the joy of competition while burdened
with responsibility for the very future of the sport, but it did.
</P>
<P>
   57. Billie Jean King: The first woman athlete to earn $100,000
in a year, the dominant tennis player of the women's-lib era was a
leader in the fight (on-going) for equal prize money. King's 1973
``Battle of the Sexes'' victory over Bobby Riggs had more to do
with the popularity of tennis at the time than gender politics.
</P>
<P>
   56. Wayne Gretzky's trade to the Kings (1988): L.A.'s team had
lived on the fringe for two decades _ not only the fringe of the
hockey continent, but the fringe of the city's sports
consciousness. Suddenly, with the sport's greatest player a King,
the Forum was the place to be for hockey. The NHL's expansion to
Anaheim, San Jose and Phoenix was a direct result.
</P>
<P>
   55. Red Grange joining the Bears (1925): Merely by signing a
contract, the University of Illinois' Galloping Ghost gave pro
football legitimacy it hadn't yet enjoyed. By leading the Chicago
Bears on a lucrative barnstorming tour, he put the NFL on the
big-city map.
</P>
<P>
   54. Paul Brown's innovations: The most influential football
coach of the postwar era is credited with giving the sport
sophisticated playbooks and intelligence tests to determine which
players were capable of reading them.
</P>
<P>
   53. Upstart leagues: Competition from the American Football
League and the American Basketball Association in the 1960s forced
the staid NFL and NBA to jazz up their games and to expand.
</P>
<P>
   52. Olympic boycotts (1980, 1984): Politics win the silver
medal, sports win the bronze. There is no gold in years like those.
</P>
<P>
   51. World Series cancellation (1994): It demonstrated Major
League Baseball's weakness (ever-shaky player-owner relations) and
its strength (the inherent appeal of the game, which kept fans
coming back).
</P>
<P>
   50. Al Campanis (1987): Old-worldly but hardly a virulent bigot,
the Dodgers vice president bumbled into a villain's role when, in a
``Nightline'' interview on the impact of Jackie Robinson, he
suggested blacks lack ``the necessities'' for management positions.
Embarrassed baseball officials vowed to integrate the game's front
offices. The decade since has only demonstrated how slow progress
can be.
</P>
<P>
   49. Expansion: Of course, expansion, a necessary response to the
forces of supply and demand, has taken its toll on the quality of
the competition. But the fans of Denver would rather have bad
pitching than no baseball at all.
</P>
<P>
   48. NASCAR's rise: Stock-car racing, once the domain of
moonshiners and small-towners, zoomed past the politically split
Indy-car circuits to claim widespread appeal in the 1980s and
1990s. When you see Bobby Labonte caps next to Steelers jackets in
the stores, you know the sporting landscape is changing.
</P>
<P>
   47. The hardship draft (1971): A lawsuit by Spencer Haywood
forced the NBA, for the first time, to admit players before their
college classes had graduated, providing they proved financial
necessity. By 1976, that ``hardship'' requirement had been
eliminated, and college underclassmen were declaring their draft
eligibility at will, to the detriment of college sports and the
debatable benefit of pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   46. Len Bias (1987): The Boston Celtics draft choice's death
after a cocaine binge focused attention on sports' drug problem.
This is one area of concern in which sports do seem to have made
progress.
</P>
<P>
   45. The Black Sox (1919): The revelation that Chicago White Sox
players took $100,000 from gamblers to throw the World Series
against the Cincinnati Reds could have destroyed baseball. Judge
Kennesaw Mountain Landis, the sport's first commissioner, banned
eight White Sox and is credited with restoring public confidence in
the game. The ban of Pete Rose 70 years later for betting on his
team's games reaffirmed the belief that unchecked gambling poses a
particular threat to sports' integrity.
</P>
<P>
   44. The convenience of air travel: The Lakers' eight-day,
Denver-Washington-Detroit-New York-Miami trip in March doesn't
sound like much fun even in this era _ but imagine making it by
train.
</P>
<P>
   43. Tennis' open era (1968-): A few years after the admission of
professionals to major international events like Wimbledon and the
U.S. Open, tennis moved beyond the country clubs and became a
winner with the masses. If you're old enough, you knew somebody who
swung a Wilson T-2000 two-handed because that's what Jimmy Connors
did.
</P>
<P>
   42. 1994 World Cup: The United States' surprisingly strong
showing _ on and off the pitch in the nation's first shot at
hosting soccer's big event _ created new optimism among the sport's
promoters and led to the creation of the latest U.S. pro league.
</P>
<P>
   41. 12 strokes (1997): The 12-stroke Masters victory by Tiger
Woods was simply the greatest major-tournament performance of the
century by a golfer of any race or races.
</P>
<P>
   40. 31 lengths: Shattering the 1{-mile record, winning by an
unheard-of 31 lengths, Secretariat set himself up as a racing icon
for generations to come and reestablished the Triple Crown as an
attainable standard for thoroughbred brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   39. 751.251 mph (1997): British Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green
became the first to break the sound barrier on land when he drove a
rocket-powered car an average of 763.035 mph in two 1-mile passes
in the Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
   38. Beamon's leap (1968): It doesn't matter that his record has
since been broken. Long-jumping 29 feet, 2{ inches at the Mexico
City Olympics _ an incredible 21 inches beyond the previous mark _
the United States' Bob Beamon turned in the greatest one-shot
athletic performance of the century.
</P>
<P>
   37. 4 minutes (1954): Englishman Roger Bannister's mile run in
Oxford is remembered as the greatest 3 minutes 59.4 seconds in
track and field history.
</P>
<P>
   36. 29,002 feet (1953): Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood
on top of the world after scaling Mount Everest. Before them, 16
climbers had died trying.
</P>
<P>
   35. 56 games in a row (1941): Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak was
the feat that launched a thousand coffee makers.
</P>
<P>
   34. The Miracle on Ice: The U.S. Olympic ice-hockey team's upset
of the Soviet Union _ and its subsequent gold-medal victory over
Finland _ was the feel-good story of the American sports century.
Do you believe it's the standard by which all future U.S. victories
will be judged? Yes!
</P>
<P>
   33. Jesse Owens' four gold medals: The African-American
track-and-field star's performance at the 1936 Olympic Games in
Berlin is remembered for refuting Adolf Hitler's belief in an Aryan
master race. Though, to put the achievement in perspective, it must
be noted that Hitler was undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   32. Jack Johnson's title (1908): Even before beating Tommy Burns
in Sydney, Australia, to become the first black world heavyweight
champion, the Texas-born Johnson was America's first famous black
athlete. His reign inspired the first search for a ``great white
hope'' by the prejudiced public of the day.
</P>
<P>
   31. Louis-Schmeling II (1938): Thirty years after Johnson's
victory, Joe Louis wasn't a black champion, he was an American
champion, and his revenge victory over German Max Schmeling in
Yankee Stadium as World War II rumbled in the distance was an
enormous morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   30. The Intercalated Games: After the failures of the Summer
Games of 1900 (Paris) and 1904 (St. Louis), the Olympic movement
was in trouble. The success of the Intercalated (Interim) Games of
1906 (Athens) steadied the ship even though the International
Olympic Committee considers them unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   29. Rise and fall of the Soviet athletic machine (1940s to
1980s): Every hero needs a villian, and for United States Olympic
athletes, the cheatin' communists played that role until their very
way of life expired. Say what you will about the virtue of keeping
politics out of sports, the Olympics haven't been quite the same
thrill since then.
</P>
<P>
   28. Internationalization of American rosters: The twists of
international politics that have allowed baseball, basketball,
hockey and football teams to raid Latin America, Africa, Asia,
Eastern Europe _ even the old Soviet countries _ and virtually
every other corner of the map are responsible for the greatest
upsurge in talent since Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   27. Munich (1972): Arab terrorists murdered 11 Israeli athletes
and coaches, forcing the Olympic Games to be suspended for the
first time. As for the pretense that sports are immune to the
untidiness of the world beyond the white lines _ to paraphrase Jim
McKay, it was all gone.
</P>
<P>
   26. The L.A. Olympics (1984): The Games had become a political
and economic hot potato. It was a sure money-loser, an invitation
to terrorism and traffic gridlock. Then Los Angeles showed the
world how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   25. Jets 16, Colts 7 (1969): Joe Namath guaranteed the win. The
win guaranteed the AFL-NFL merger by proving the junior league
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   24. Wooden's hiring: John Wooden replaced Wilbur Johns as UCLA's
head basketball coach in 1948. The Bruins embarked on college
sports' foremost dynasty by winning their first NCAA title in 1964
_ an instant transformation, as Wooden-worshipers remember it.
</P>
<P>
   23. The Russell deal (1956): Red Auerbach traded Ed Macauley and
Cliff Hagan to St. Louis to bring Hawks draft choice Bill Russell
to the Boston Celtics. Russell went on to lead pro basketball's
greatest dynasty and become the first black coach in a major sport.
</P>
<P>
   22. Texas Western 72, Kentucky 65 (1966): All five Texas Western
starters were black. The entire Kentucky roster was white. It was
the starkest racial contrast in NCAA basketball championship game
history. The victory by the school now known as UTEP over the
top-ranked Wildcats is credited with further opening the door for
black athletes in the south.
</P>
<P>
   21. Clay's championship (1964): Beating Sonny Liston, who failed
to answer the seventh-round bell in Miami, Cassius Clay began his
rise to dramatic-comedic-tragic icon, a rise that included two
further turns as champion as Muhammad Ali, a ban for refusing
military induction, the classic fights with Joe Frazier, and the
victory over George Foreman in the ultimate triumph of guile over
strength.
</P>
<P>
   20. Pete Rozelle's commissionership (1960-89): Chosen by league
owners on the 23rd ballot, the young Rams GM would lead the NFL
through the decades in which pro football grew to America's most
popular sport and the Super Bowl became a national quasi-holiday.
</P>
<P>
   19. Computers: Once, strategy was something you drew on a
chalkboard and statistics were something sportswriters kept on a
legal pad. Now, coaches and managers analyze performances and
trends with the help of computer printouts that tell them
everything but the future.
</P>
<P>
   18. Specialization: Also known as situational substitution. Once
upon a time you were an athlete. Then you were a football player.
Then you were a lineman. Then you were a defensive lineman. Then
you were a defensive end in obvious passing situations. At this
rate, as roles become more narrowly defined (designated hitter,
set-up man, point guard), someday in the future, an entire career
will last one play.
</P>
<P>
   17. Knute Rockne establishes the pass: Rockne's emphasis on the
forward pass and other elements of finesse as a Notre Dame player
and coach (1918-31) revolutionized football. And you thought he
just gave a hell of a halftime speech.
</P>
<P>
   16. Safer racecars: From break-apart car bodies to transparent
smoke, safety advances have kept pace with advances in going really
fast.
</P>
<P>
   15. The Shot Heard 'Round the World (1951): Bobby Thomson's
bottom-of-the-ninth-inning home run off Ralph Branca wins the
pennant for the New York Giants and crystalizes the frustration of
Brooklyn Dodgers fans. The radio call of Russ Hodges _ ``The Giants
win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!'' _ was as memorable
as the home run.
</P>
<P>
   14. Magic and Bird going pro: The NBA already was on the way
back up in 1979 after a decade of growing pains, violence, drug
scandals and midnight TV coverage. But the rise was hastened when
the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson, using a pick acquired from the
Utah Jazz in a trade, and the Boston Celtics signed Larry Bird, who
had returned to Indiana State after they had drafted him the year
before. Their rivalry _ and the revived Lakers-Celtics rivalry _
helped to make league what it is today (or what it was a couple of
years ago, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   13. Michael Jordan going airborne: We say Bird and Magic HELPED
to make the NBA what it is (or was). It's Jordan who took the ball
and ran with it, carrying the league to unimagined heights, a
fitting role for the greatest finisher in basketball history.
Jordan's Chicago Bulls won six championships in the 1990s. Once
again, amid attempts at ``parity,'' a league's popularity peaked at
a time when a dynasty gave everybody a standard of excellence and a
seasonal storyline.
</P>
<P>
   12. Maris' 61st (1961): By taking advantage of an extended
major-league schedule, Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth's single-season
home-runs record and set off a debate on the hazards of measuring
greatness with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   11. McGwire-Sosa (1998): The last great drama of the sports
century, which ended with Mark McGwire hitting a record 70 home
runs and Sammy Sosa 66, reminded us how awesome Babe Ruth was in an
era when homers were less common. McGwire would have had to hit 150
to match Ruth's impact.
</P>
<P>
   10. Colts 23, Giants 17, OT (1958): Carroll Rosenbloom's
Baltimore Colts won the NFL's first overtime game and the
championship when Alan Ameche tumbled 1 yard for a touchdown 8:15
into the sudden-death period. The entire league celebrated when it
saw how the nationally televised display by Johnny Unitas, Raymond
Berry and Lenny Moore raised excitement about pro football.
</P>
<P>
   9. Aaron's 715th: By perservering through racist threats, Hank
Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career home-runs record and struck a mighty
blow for black America.
</P>
<P>
   8. The point spread: The idea _ whatever its shady origin _ of
forcing favorite-players to ``give'' points to underdog bettors
made sports betting into a billion-dollar industry. NFL officials
publicly deplore gambling, and secretly love it, if they know their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   7. Title IX (1972): The federal mandate for gender equity in
education leads to the rapid expansion of athletic programs for
women, to the more-than-occasional frustration of male athletes
whose programs were cut back.
</P>
<P>
   6. Curt Flood's freedom fight (1970): Flood lost his lawsuit
challenging as ``slavery'' the baseball rule binding a player to
one team until traded or released. He lost his first appeal AND an
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. He sacrificed his career by
refusing to report to the Philadelphia Phillies after a trade from
the St. Louis Cardinals. But he won the war as the issues he raised
prompted baseball to negotiate with the players' union for major
sports' first free-agency system.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Dodgers' move out of New York (1958): The loser _
Brooklyn. The winner _ everywhere else. We can live with that
tradeoff. Before the Dodgers came to Los Angeles, major-league
baseball consisted of 16 teams, all in the eastern and central time
zones. The big leagues have doubled in size since then. Before the
Dodgers came to Los Angeles, major-league sports here meant the
Rams, the racetracks and boxing ring. In the next 10 years we'd add
the Lakers, Angels, Kings and the ABA's Stars, and built the Forum
and Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   4. The growing role of science: Improved nutrition,
conditioning, surgical procedures and competition equipment are
helping the human animal achieve its athletic potential. A scary
thought for time-travel believers: Babe Ruth puts down the booze
and picks up the creatine.
</P>
<P>
   3. Birth of ESPN (1979): The marriage of sports and television
might have been old news by then. But the arrival of ESPN and its
cable cousins made sports and television one complete happy family.
Television dictates tip-off times and rule changes. In return
players and leagues get rich on zillion-dollar network contracts.
If you puzzle over athletes earning 100 times what the previous
generation did, consider that today's ballplayer entertains
millions of viewers, whereas his predecessor entertained 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   2. Babe Ruth's move to New York (1919): The impact on the
Yankees and the Boston Red Sox was enormous. The impact on sports
was bigger: A celebrity-driven sports culture was born. Red Sox
World Series titles before owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth for
$425,000 in cash and loans: six. Since: zero. Yankees World Series
titles before the trade: zero. Since: 25. In the big city, Ruth
became a celebrity of, well, Ruthian proportions.
</P>
<P>
   1. Jackie Robinson's impact (1947): The first black
major-leaguer of the century helped to make baseball a truly
national pastime, became a symbol of the civil rights movement and

   U.N.-ANNAN (United Nations) _ When Kofi Annan,a soft-spoken
aristocrat from Ghana, was elected the United Nations' seventh
secretary-general three years ago, the quiet insider with a gentle
sense of humor was welcomed as a healer in an organization raked by
abuse from American politicians and unsettled by an ugly Clinton
administration campaign to oust his predecessor, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali. Three years later and with two more years to go in
his first term, Annan is turning out to be one of the most
provocative leaders the United Nations has ever known. By Barbara
Crossette.

   NEWYEAR-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ The turn of the millennium is a
confusing time for those who live in the land where Jesus was born,
lived and died. Mostly Jews and Muslims, they do not attach
religious significance to the moment, yet they live, to some
degree, in the modern, secular world. One rabbi who wanted to mark
the moment without commemorating Jesus has scheduled a Y6K benefit
concert (although the year 6000 is still 240 years away on Jewish
calendar). By Deborah Sontag.

   ROMANIA-REVOLT (Timisoara, Romania) _ Of all the rebellions that
toppled communism in Eastern Europe a decade ago, the bloodiest
began in this provincial city where a protest by the parishioners
of an obscure Calvinist pastor somehow exploded into the nationwide
revolt that in nine days shoved Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu,
Romania's megalomaniacal ruling couple, in front of a firing squad.
Ten years after a radio announcer exulted, ``The Antichrist has

New Year's eve is to be rendered, in Y2K argot, ``nonessential,''
and what executive wants that? Not Eugene R. McGrath, the president
and chief executive of Consolidated Edison Inc. Of course he is

Times poll. Asked the same question four years ago, only one out of

   NEWYEAR-CELEBRATE (New York) _ The date is an arbitrary slice of
time; many historians doubt that the Gregorian calendar's starting
point accurately matches the year Jesus was born. Yet the equally
arbitrary milestone it leads to, with the nice round number of
2000, has by now created whole industries of anticipation, revelry,
planning and retrospection. Never have three zeroes added up to so
much. Let all the nitpickers and killjoys insist that today is only
the last day of the 1900's, not the first day of the 21st century
and the third millennium A.D. Everyone else is getting ready to say
goodbye not just to a decade, but also to a century and a
millennium, maybe two. And there's no agreement on the right spirit
for the sendoff. By Jon Pareles.

   NEWYEAR-ART (New York) _ Every New Year's Eve, we would like to
think, one small story closes and another opens. But this year the
story arrives in a deluxe edition. The ball dropping in Times
Square at midnight will punctuate not just a chapter or a volume,
but a boxed set titled ``20th Century.'' And it will be the first
mark of an ellipsis into the future. Epochal transitions are part
of every culture, and they are by no means always occasions for
cheer. Thresholds are worrisome places: you know a good deal about
what you're leaving behind, but not much about what's ahead. And
vulnerability makes emotions run high. No wonder the prospect of
ending one life and starting another _ the millennial concept in a
nutshell _ invites responsive extremes of hope and despair. All
over the world art is called on for guidance and assurance in such
matters. By Holland Cotter.

1999 ATTABOY AWARDS HONOR BEST IN COMPUTER BUSINESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
(REFILING TO RESTORE GARBLED TYPE - and fix hed bust) By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Computing and Internet access became even more
mainstream in 1999, and the products selected for this year's
Attaboy Awards reflect the growing pervasiveness of PCs in American
homes.
 &HT;    The awards, now in their fifth year, recognize the best
computing products crossing my desk.
 &HT;    Because people are doing new things with their computers, I've
added categories for popular new uses for the PC, including MP3
players and software, graphics cards and CD-ROM burners. There's
also a new, top-of-the-heap category, Product of the Year.
 &HT;    As usual, the winners receive unbridled admiration, along with a
nifty Attaboy 1999 logo they can post on their Web sites.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Product of the Year _ Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon
microprocessor
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For years, AMD has offered me-too chips, lagging behind silicon
gorilla Intel Corp. But with the Athlon line, AMD has shot ahead of
Intel on the performance curve.
 &HT;    Even Athlon chips that run at the same clock speed as Intel's
Pentium III do better on most benchmarks. The Athlon even outguns
Pentium III chips in an area where AMD's offerings have
traditionally fallen short _ in what's known as the Floating Point
Unit, which speeds up math processing.
 &HT;    And, systems built around Athlon chips are less expensive. Don't
you just love competition?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best Consumer PC _ Compaq Presario 5900Z
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Compaq Computer Corp. is one of two big-name PC makers that use
Athlon chips in their consumer systems. It has used the opportunity
to build one of the most powerful and feature-rich home PCs around.
 &HT;    The 5900Z line _ available through in-store kiosks and through
Compaq's Web site _ is a screaming rocket with such intelligent
design features as USB and FireWire connections on the front, and
the company's slick Internet keyboard.
 &HT;    Because it's built to order, you can pick and choose the
components that best fit your need for speed _ and your budget.
 &HT;    Recommended: add Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Annihilator video
card to your package, particularly if you're a game fan.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best Business PC _ Dell Dimension XPS T series
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dell's PCs are consistently at the top of the heap, and this
line _ unveiled with the introduction of Intel's Pentium III chips
_ is a great blend of price and performance. Dell's PCs aren't
loaded down with unnecessary software or proprietary hardware _
they're fast, simple and high quality.
 &HT;    T-to-customize XPS T series is not as cutting-edge as the
B series, but the machines are still incredibly fast and very
reliable, backed by what customer surveys repeatedly show is the
best technical support around.
 &HT;    I like this system so much, I own one. Now, if only they came
with Athlon chips.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best Portable Computer _ Compaq Armada M300
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As far as the ultra-portable category goes, Compaq was very late
to the party. But when it arrived, it was with a bang. The Armada
M300 fixes all the problems found in most portable PCs in that
niche.
 &HT;    Yes, it's small, but the keyboard is comfortable to use, even if
you have large hands.
 &HT;    It comes with a full complement of connections and ports. An
optional module, which snaps onto the base, contains either a CD-
or DVD-ROM, so you don't have drives connected by cables. And the
active-matrix screen is a generous 11.3 inches. Compaq also makes a
consumer version, the Armada 300, that's available at retail.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best Video Card _ Creative Labs 3D Blaster TNT2 Ultra
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Based on nVidia's lightning-quick TNT2 Ultra chip set, this
model in the 3D Blaster line is not the fastest nor the most
feature-laden card you can buy, but it's hard to beat when you're
talking bang for the buck.
 &HT;    The 3D Blaster TNT2 Ultra comes with 32 megabytes of fast video
memory for high resolutions and lots of colors. It's an excellent
choice for gamers who want state-of-the-art speed without paying
state-of-the-art prices. Add to that its rock-solid drivers that
can also run games that rely on 3dfx's Glide 3D scheme.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best printer _ HP Deskjet 970Cse
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hewlett-Packard hits a home run with this fast, quiet and
innovative printer aimed at home and small businesses. Even if its
only claims to fame were its impressive speed and excellent print
quality, it probably still would take this year's Attaboy for
printer.
 &HT;    But get this: The 970Cse also automates the usually tedious
process of double-sided printing. It comes with a module that pulls
a sheet back into the unit to print on the back side. It also comes
with an excellent software bundle and, of course, can plug into
either a USB or parallel port.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best scanner _ Visioneer PaperPort OneTouch 8600
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Who would have thought just five years ago that scanners _ once
a device used primarily by graphics professionals _ would have
become a gotta-have item for the average computer user. Visioneer,
with its low-cost PaperPort line, has helped promote that
revolution with inexpensive scanners that also happen to be very
good.
 &HT;    The OneTouch 8600 continues in that vein, with an innovation
that enhances speed and color quality. The scanner handles image
compression for the JPEG file format in hardware built into the
scanner. As a result, this is one of the fastest scanners you can
own in its price range _ particularly when connected to a USB port
_ with some of the best reproduction.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best MP3 Player _ Diamond Multmedia Rio PMP500
 &HT;    
 &HT;    This revision of the original Rio MP3 player is overpriced, but
other than that, it fixes most of the problems found in the first
one.
 &HT;    It connects via USB instead of the pokey and unreliable parallel
port, holds more music and has a simplified set of controls. It
also has software that makes it easier to organize MP3 files and
get them into the device in the RioPort Audio Manager. It also
supports the spoken-word files offered by Audible, so you can
listen to speeches, book readings and news programs.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Best CD-ROM Burner _ HP CD-Writer 8200 series
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Although writable/rewritable CD-ROM drives are gaining in
popularity, they still can be finicky. Adding one to a stable PC
can often destabilize it.
 &HT;    The Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer 8200 line not only is fast, but
it's friendly to your system. Of the CD-RW drives I've tried, it
was the only one that didn't cause my system to burp. It also comes
with a great tutorial, as well as software that inspects your PC
and suggests the best settings for a successful installation. It's
also fast _ writing and rewriting at 4X speeds and reading at 24X
speeds.

 SALUTING SELF-INTEREST WITH THE SMITTY AWARDS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Welcome to the 17th annual Smitty Awards ceremony,
during which we'll recognize deeds and developments during the past
year that best exemplify the spirit of Adam Smith's ``invisible
hand'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   It was this venerable moral philosopher's belief that
individuals acting in their self-interest often created benefits
for the entire community while improving their own lot. Smith also
theorized that business types often conspired to enhance their
wealth and satisfaction at community expense. That's why each
imaginary Smitty statuette comes complete with a wart on its nose.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes, please:
</P>
<P>
   - Emily Litella Award: Bud Selig, major league baseball's top
guy, whose rejection of Miles Prentice's bid for the Royals in
essence told the aspiring owner, ``Never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   - Monty Hall Memorial Award: Heavyweight boxing legend George
Foreman, who made a sweet deal and will pocket more than $137
million in return for allowing a housewares company to use his name
and likeness in its marketing programs forever. And ever. Amen.
</P>
<P>
   - Ned Ludd Memorial Award: Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who
does his writing in longhand, a style more suited to the 19th
century, while presiding over the antitrust trial of computer-age
giant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   - Luddite of the Year: The trade-protesting rioter in Seattle
seen wearing Nike high tops while trashing the downtown Niketown
store.
</P>
<P>
   - The AntiSmitty Award: Bob Thompson, who sold his Michigan
company for $422 million and not only allowed his 550 former
employees to share in $128 million of the sale proceeds but also
paid the resulting taxes for the beneficiaries of his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   - The People-in-Hell-Want-Ice-Water Award: The Coca-Cola Co.,
which was revealed to be investing heavily in developing a vending
machine that would automatically raise prices for its soft drinks
in hot weather with use of a temperature sensor and computer chip.
</P>
<P>
   - Charles Mackay Award: Investors who best exemplified his
concept of extraordinary popular delusions by bidding up VA Linux
Systems stock a record 700 percent when it made its recent initial
public offering debut.
</P>
<P>
   - Lee Iacocca Award: Wendy's burger man Dave Thomas, as the most
effective top-guy company pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   - George Orwell Award: Regulators who sought to impose a Big
Brother role on banks with a mandate to spy on customers for signs
of money laundering, but withdrew the proposal after much public
protest.
</P>
<P>
   - Eyes Wide Shut Award: Americans who believe their elected
reps' promises to use anticipated federal budget surpluses to
benefit the next generation of Social Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   - Year's best economist joke: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who presided over a late-year money supply explosion
while engineering interest rate increases in the name of keeping
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   - Free Enterpriser of the Year Award: Neighborhood activists in
Johnson County who were successful in exacting cash from developers
in return for their promise not to challenge nearby commercial
projects with potentially discombobulative effects.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, one and all!

<P>
   UNDATED: Dec. 31 is a night of war rooms for a conflict that is
likely never to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the nation's top money guys are gathered in a
ready room on the top floor of the Federal Reserve building.
President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser and about 200 other federal
employees are gathered in another D.C. building a few blocks from
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has made its war effort more
mobile. FAA inspectors are fanning out to dispatch centers operated
by the nation's 10 largest airlines. FAA honcho Jane Garvey will be
riding the friendly skies to show that the nation's airspace is
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Companies big and small, utilities, and local and state
governments all have set aside space to monitor operations as the
1900s become the 2000s. They'll be watching for computer blips and
power outages, faulty data and flashing lights.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5 million of us will be working overtime this weekend
to make sure all goes well, and to do triage if it doesn't,
according to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass.,
technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation, we are prepared. Globally, we spent about $320
billion and years getting this way, according to estimates released
this week by International Data Corp.'s Project Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K: You'll see it, but you won't feel it,'' Project Magellan
researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IDC Project Magellan team has forecast that annoying and
embarrassing Y2K computer glitches will be plentiful, starting at
midnight on New Year's Eve and running through the first quarter's
reporting period, but that major infrastructure outages won't
occur.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, IDC cited what happened to Assicurazioni
Generali, the biggest insurance company in Italy. The company
printed more than 600,000 documents reporting 1900 instead of 2000.
In the meantime
</P>
<P>
   Things were back to normal Thursday in Charlotte, N.C., after
the city's 911 emergency dispatch system failed a key Y2K test
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the city's computer-aided dispatch system was
sidelined by a Y2K problem that forced operators to use a manual
system of writing down a caller's location and handing it to a
courier. After verifying the address, the couriers delivered the
address to a dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Although slightly slower than the automated system, the glitch
didn't cause any problems. And the 911 call-in system itself wasn't
affected, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Great Britain, more than 10,000 small retailers spent the
past couple of days on the phone whenever a customer came into the
shop with a credit card. Swipe card machine maker Racal Electronics
said 20,000 of its terminals refused to work when they ran into a
Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card system reads four days in advance, and it froze
up when the machines compared Dec. 28, 1999, with Jan. 1, 2000.
They read the date as Jan. 1, 1900. The problem resolves itself as
of Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Similar systems are not used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The problems ``may be illustrative of the kind of glitches that
are going to occur along the way here and around the world,'' said
John Koskinen, President Clinton's top Y2K expert. E-commerce

</P>
<P>
   Online buyers who use the Netscape Navigator and Communicator
browsers 4.06 and older could have a problem buying goods 
after the clock strikes midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem also affects Macintosh owners who use Microsoft's
Internet Explorer 4.5 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Digital certificates from VeriSign Inc., stored in the browsers,
expire at midnight. The certificates are used to authenticate a
user and, in turn, authenticate a Web site and encrypt electronic
commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape users who have not updated their browsers _ the company
estimates there are up to 10 million of them _ will see a dialogue
box on some secure sites after Dec. 31. They'll be able to click
``continue'' to get a secure connection.

   Apple computer owners using the Microsoft browsers won't be able
to conduct transactions securely. Going offline

<P>
   Hundreds of government and corporate Web sites, including some
run by the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture,
are being shut down for the weekend to avoid hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued alerts warning of
the potential for increased hacking during the holidays. The FBI
said it would keep its computers running.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have left messages on some Web sites in recent days
asking others not to hack Web sites over the weekend.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Houston Cougars, thrown into a tailspin early by the all-around
package of basketball skills that is point guard Khalid El-Amin of
No. 2 Connecticut, appeared to be down and out under a 28-point
deficit with 6:11 left Thursday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Huskies, meanwhile, looked as though they could switch into
party mode and begin bringing in the new year in style, if maybe a
little prematurely, at Hofheinz Pavilion. What happened next, said
Houston's Gee Gervin, might have been expected from any team
sailing along under similar circumstances, even a defending NCAA
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they might have relaxed a little bit,'' he said of the
Huskies. ``Most teams do that when you're up 28 points.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gervin finally getting his game going after an
uncharacteristically slow start, Houston threw a scare into UConn
(9-1) in the second half but lost 82-76 before a sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played 33 minutes of great basketball and then lost our
intensity,'' said El-Amin, who had 21 points in the first half and
finished with 27. ``Great teams don't do that. We're lucky to get
out with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gervin coming alive to score 17 of his 19 points in the
final 20 minutes, what the Cougars (6-6) salvaged from Thursday
night probably won't show until later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played like a team that's battle-tested,
championship-tested,'' UH coach Clyde Drexler said of the Huskies.
``Our guys were looking forward to the competition. Our guys were
not backing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a few possessions where we had easy layups but
we lost the ball or missed dunks, easy opportunities (early). You
tend to lose confidence under those types of incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for the most part, our guys came out to compete. I'm very
proud of their effort. It's a game that went down to the final
wire. That's a building block for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although UH took a 2-0 lead on a feathery jumper by Gervin one
minute into the game, El-Amin took charge from that point forward.
He scored eight straight points during one stretch as the Huskies
rang up a 48-27 halftime lead, despite a modest 12-4 run by the
Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of UConn's destruction occurred during the final six
minutes of the half when a 30-24 cushion ballooned to the 21-point
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five minutes of the first half, we had a mental
lapse,'' Drexler said. ``And a seven-point game turned into a
21-point game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And basically, (in the locker room at the break) I was telling
them to give yourselves a chance, that anything can happen. Stay in
the game, stay mentally tough, stay with the game plan _ good
things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the Cougars alive in the first half was the play of
Kenny Younger, who got 11 of his team-high 24 points in the opening
half and finished with nine rebounds. George Williams contributed
nine points and a game-high 13 boards as the Cougars outrebounded
the taller Huskies 46-41.
</P>
<P>
   For Jake Voskuhl, the Strake Jesuit product who has been one of
the Huskies' stalwarts over the past three years, what had been an
enjoyable homecoming over the last few days turned into a near
nightmare. He was scoreless in the first half and contributed only
two points and eight rebounds to the UConn cause. He had nothing
but praise for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played well, battled hard and made some tough shots,'' he
said. ``I don't want to take any credit away from them; they made
good shots. But at the same time, we made mistakes we don't usually
make.''
</P>
<P>
   After UH shot a paltry 29 percent and fell behind 48-27 at
halftime, Voskuhl opened the second half with a slam dunk that
pointed the Huskies toward a 76-48 lead with 7:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   That 28-point edge came on a fast-break layup by Kevin Freeman,
who finished with 13 points and six rebounds. With the score 78-50,
the Cougars began to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin scored 10 points, sparking a 23-2 run that brought the
Cougars to within 80-73 with 1:25 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to bring up the tempo a lot,'' Gervin said. ``They
got the ball out quick a lot (through the first half and the first
13 minutes of the second half). We were back on our heels a lot. We
started to come out and put a lot of pressure on them, speed up the
tempo a little, make them turn it over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars got to within 81-76 on a trey by Marcus Oliver with
11.2 seconds left. It was as clo NO CARRIER

 &HT;     By DALE ROBERTSON 
 &HT;     c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AS national champions, you write your own ticket. The college
basketball season is almost two months old, yet the Connecticut
Huskies played their first true road game Thursday night. &HT;    And, as expected, they made themselves right at home in Hofheinz
Pavilion. The host Houston Cougars, after the obligatory early bit
of adrenaline-fueled resistance, seemed destined to succumb to the
inevitable and go down in flames, stymied by both their mistakes
and the Huskies' mystique.
 &HT;    Not to mention the remarkable presence of Khalid El-Amin. Amin,
who packs 203 pounds on his 5-10 frame, may be the most deceptive
talent in the country this side of Muggsy Bogues.
 &HT;    El-Amin looks soft. However, he plays hard, in terms of both
toughness and effort. His 21 first-half points _ on 8-for-13
shooting _ were six fewer than UH managed collectively and bested
his shellshocked Houston counterpart, Gee Gervin, by 19. It was,
quite simply, Gee vs. Whiz.
 &HT;    But Gee won the second half 17-6, as did the Cougars 49-34.
Moral victories both, to be sure.
 &HT;    UConn came to Houston _ to the Cougars' delight, given the rowdy
sellout crowd, and perhaps to their distress, certainly early on _
because of Jake Voskuhl. Jim Calhoun likes to let his seniors show
off in front of friends and family, and Voskuhl, a Katy native who
attended Strake Jesuit before Calhoun lured him to New England,
asked his coach to make the phone call to Chet Gladchuk, UH's
athletic director.
 &HT;    The Huskies' other senior, Wane Souleymane, hails from Dakar.
That's in Senegal, as in Africa. Sorry, Wane. Too far, certainly on
the eve of potential Y2-chaos.
 &HT;    Anyway, Calhoun's lads have had a smashing time here this week,
dining on prime beef and real Texas barbecue, and basking in the
stunning weather. The long trip to Houston became equal parts hoops
and golf. Fittingly, the champions got to take their cuts at
Champions. The R-and-R hadn't disturbed their rhythm and
blues-administering any as the score grew worse and worse.
 &HT;    With just over six minutes left, the Huskies led 78-50. A
depressed Clyde Drexler took a seat on top of the press table by
the Cougars' bench, crossed his arms and sighed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, my goodness,'' he said, shaking his head.
 &HT;    Then, suddenly, it was 1983 again. UConn had been U-Conned. No,
Houston is not just another basketball backwater, a number of
humbling seasons by the Cougars notwithstanding.
 &HT;    A couple of unfortunate Gervin turnovers in the final minute
prevented a comeback-of-the-millennium finish, and the Huskies
survived, although Calhoun was clearly not delighted with what he
had just witnessed.
 &HT;    ``The game,'' he said dryly, ``is 40 minutes long. You have to
learn to play 40 minutes on the road.''
 &HT;    Of course, to do that, you have to occasionally go into hostile
environs.
 &HT;    UConn's 82-76 victory was its ninth in a row after an opening
stumble against Iowa. Stanford may still rank ahead of them at
present, but the Huskies remain the beast to beat come March's
Madness _ until someone actually beats them.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the Cougars, with their proud heritage and that
Hall of Famer-to-be who prowls the sideline on their behalf,
proudly refused to behave as just another Fairfield or Fordham,
i.e., pre-Big East fodder.
 &HT;    Not quite a generation ago, back when Drexler was rattling
backboards for the Cougars instead of drawing stuff on a clipboard,
the Huskies were the punies, a terminally sub-.500 program lost in
the shuffle of big-time Eastern ball. During the three seasons in
the early '80s when UH made itself a fixture in the Final Four and
played for the national title twice, UConn was eight games under
.500. Even Calhoun's first team went 9-19 two years later.
 &HT;    The worms do turn, don't they? If the Huskies weren't the team
of the about-to-conclude decade, they finished right up there, and
they appear well-positioned to claim the first title of the new
millennium, never mind a troubling six-minute walkabout here.
 &HT;    Calhoun believes these Huskies may have more raw athleticism
than last year's bunch. As to whether they can accomplish the same
great things
 &HT;    ``Ask me in a couple months,'' he said.
 &HT;    The Cougars can draw inspiration from both UConn's rise to
prominence and their own storied past, delightful memories of which
they resurrected down the stretch. Nothing, be it good or bad, is
forever. Drexler is just another marquee player away from
threatening Top 25 status and perhaps three more away from proving
UH belongs on the same floor with the likes of the Huskies for a
full 40 minutes.
 &HT;    A couple years from now, a Jim Calhoun might not be so eager to
come visiting, no matter how hospitable a clime Houston offers. A
couple years from now, it's to be hoped local good ol' boys like
Voskuhl won't want to go off pretending to be Connecticut Yankees.
They will be playing for Clyde, not against him.
 &HT;    Still, it was fun to have a super-elite team back in the
building, making the place matter again. Next step for Drexler:
ensuring it's the home team at the outset, a NO CARRIER (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ The board that oversees the Haskell Foundation
has asked the FBI to look into the foundation's financial troubles,
a board spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the board wants to know whether the foundation's
former executive director did anything that contributed to the
foundation's financial crisis, board member Lew Llewellyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those funds were federal funds that the foundation
was managing, so it just made sense to us we should ask the FBI,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created in 1984 to help support Haskell
Indian Nations University in Lawrence. It raises money and manages
more than $1 million annually in grants and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald T. Burd, the foundation's former executive director,
resigned Dec. 10 after the foundation received a letter from Ron
Manka, the attorney who represents the Board of Regents, which
oversees Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the regents were concerned about reports that
the foundation was bouncing checks and not paying bills and that
Burd had forfeited his accountant's licenses. It said the
foundation should either let the regents take control of it or cut
its ties to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the regents and the foundation board have been
working on ways for the foundation to stay afloat. Last week, a
tribe in northern Kansas loaned the foundation $47,000 to help it
meet its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Burd did not return a telephone call on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State records show that Burd allowed his accountant's license in
New Mexico to expire on June 30, 1997. He surrendered his Kansas
license on Aug. 5, 1997, and lost his Missouri license on April 10,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a former partner accused Burd of illegally diverting
more than $25,000 from their firm, according to records from the
New Mexico Board of Public Accountancy.
</P>
<P>
   Burd filed for personal bankruptcy on Oct. 1, 1997, in Kansas
City, Kan. He listed assets of $89,463, and liabilities of $1.3
million, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn said board members had not been aware of Burd's
previous problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said the foundation was moving its office back to the
university campus this week so it no longer had to pay rent. Burd
had moved the office off-campus and had told the board that the
foundation could afford the rent, Llewellyn said.

KINGS ROUT OILERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SLANG -- Attn. Sports) 
By MATT McHALE  
 Staff Writer  
The last two weeks had seemed like a millenium, but the Kings vowed
they would party again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six consecutive losses had scalded their promising season,
the Kings routed the Edmonton Oilers 8-2 Thursday night behind five
points by Luc Robitaille and Jeri Karalahti's first and second
National Hockey League goals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1,000 victory in franchise history and right now
there are few that might seem more important. During the last six
games they had been crushed, played hard at times, lost close games
and barely showed up for others.
</P>
<P>
   The only constant was their hold on a playoff spot continued to
dwindle to teams like the Oilers, who were gaining ground after
going 4-2-5 in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   But in front of a raucous sellout of 18,118 at the Staples
Center, the Kings put on a show with four goals in the second
period and five power play goals overall.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake, who by his own admission played one the worst
games of his career in Wednesday's loss at Colorado, scored two
goals.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Robitaille who had the biggest offensive showing with
the sixth five-point game of his career. The last was Feb. 11 1993
against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who has come to life in the past week, scored his
fourth goal in three games and just missed a fifth in the second
period when Glen Murray dislodged the Oilers net just before
Robitaille scored.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a big night for Robitaille in the record book. His
first period assist marked the 1,100 point of his NHL career.
Robitaille is just the 23rd to score 1,100 points and 500 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the Kings built a 5-0 lead did the Oilers score
against Kings goalie Stephane Fiset. With Jaroslav Modry off for
holding, Pat Falloon slipped in his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, there would be no comebacks against the
Kings. Just 3:07 into the third period, Bryan Smolinski scored
after rebounding a shot from Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Even the crowd played its part, taunting Edmonton goaltender
Mike Ranford, who inadvertently helped the Kings score their first
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes of the first period, Ranford tried to clear
the puck and fired it into the crowd. That is a delay of game
penalty and the Kings used it to get a power play goal by Modry.
</P>
<P>
   For Modry, it was his first goal since the 1996-97 season. After
that the crowd chanted Ranford's name every time the goaltender
touched the puck.
</P>
<P>
   But Modry's goal had a greater significance. The Oilers, who had
beaten and tied the Kings earlier this season, allowed just one
power play goal in their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had been converting at only 14 percent (11 for 78)
with the man advantage at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Modry broke the ice, so to speak, scoring the first of four
power play goals on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille opened the second-period rush by scoring in the first
58 seconds. It was his 15th of the season and classic Robitaille,
backhanding a rebound shot past Ranford after Mattias Norstrom
fired from the point.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, Blake scored his first goal with
Alexander Selivanov in the penalty box for a high stick. Ziggy
Palffy, another of the Kings missing stars during the losing
streak, dug the puck oue corner and passed in front to Blake
who made it look easy against Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly two minutes later, or 7:14 into the second, Blake was at
it again on a pass from Jozef Stumpel that beat Ranford. It was his
13th goal of the year, one more than he had last season. It also
was a power play goal, created when the Oilers were whistled for
having too many men on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best snap shot of Blake's night came with 7:16
left in the second when he flattened Edmonton center Jim Dowd with
a crunching hip check along the left boards.

PEOPLE PREPARE FOR Y2K UPS, DOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dominic Berbeo  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Amid widespread uncertainty of possible year 2000
mayhem, people across Los Angeles made last-minute preparations for
either a Y2K meltdown or a New Year's celebration of millennial
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   At supermarkets and camping supply stores, people stocked up on
water, canned goods and other necessities as well as delicacies
from lobster to champagne for parties to usher out the 20th century
and welcome in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking any chances,'' said Mary Wheeler from the Los
Angeles suburb of Chatsworth, as she bought cooking fuel and a
portable stove at REI in Northridge about a mile away. ``Normally
we go out, but this year our family is absolutely staying home for
the New Year, where we won't be a target for any terrorist
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to party,'' said Lee Ann Faeth, who was buying
supplies at Costco in Canoga Park for a company party at da Vinci
Studios in Woodland Hills, both in suburban Los Angeles. ``And I
think everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, firefighters and city officials braced for the worst,
however, as they activated their emergency coordination command
center and appealed for New Year's revelers to keep their guns at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fire your weapon in the air to celebrate the millennium,
you're going to be prosecuted, and you're going to go to jail,''
said Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., the Los Angeles Police Department will require every
officer on duty to remain on duty indefinitely, said police
spokesman Officer Jason Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD plans to dispatch 84 extra patrol cars, each with two
officers. Also, there will be a supervisor on duty for every 10
officers. Every bureau will have a 60-officer strike team.
Additionally, there will be 350 officers assigned solely to gunfire
suppression.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Emergency Operations Center was scheduled
to open at 6 a.m. and remain open through Jan. 3. Information on
Y2K and the county's status is available at (800) 980-4990.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Cameron Williams of Thousand Oaks in Ventura
Countynorth of Los Angeles, said he is not concerned about
terrorist threats because of what he has planned for his New Year's
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll go camping in Joshua Tree, away from all the
attention, and enjoy a little solitude with the sky full of stars.
At midnight, maybe I'll do a handstand or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary _ but it's not that big a deal,'' said
Lucrecia Guillen, who bought about 100 12-ounce bottles of water at
Costco. ``It's good to have the water, and if nothing happens it
won't go to waste because we'll drink it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, Y2K preparation is a commercial boon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is definitely good for business,'' said Costco store
manager Eli Rahhal. He said the store sold roughly $10,000 worth of
water on Wednesday, triple the average.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular sales in the past week, he said, were basic
survival items like lanterns, water containers, generators and
flashlights, all of which sold out days ago as nearly double the
daily flow of customers have barraged the store.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the sold-out items were for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Rahhal said. ``We sold every last lobster
tail, and there's no more Dom Perignon champagne left.''
</P>
<P>
   The sales were a reflection of plans not to let the impending
fears of possible Y2K disaster spoil celebration festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Neil Giuntoli of Topanga, were preparing for the
worst. His shopping list included candles and plenty of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there really is a disaster,'' he said, ``you want to be
ready. You need things with high barter value like cigarettes and
liquor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he only withdrew enough money from the bank for the
weekend because he didn't want to add to ``all the hype.'' But
overall, he said, he was not too worried by the heavy coverage on
television of possible Y2K mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hype, more than anything, just to sell stuff,''
he said.

CRIME DROPS IN L.A.'s SAN FERNANDO VALLEY  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Lisa Van Proyen  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- At odds with years of declining crime, the number
of homicides in Los Angeles in 1999 will match last year's or
exceed it by as few as one, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, homicides were down 5.3 percent,
with 72 as of Dec. 25, compared with 76 for the same period last
year, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide this year, there were 419 homicides as of Dec. 27 --
one more than during the same time period last year, according to
police statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police spokesman Cmdr. Dave Kalish said homicides
have declined sharply since at least 1992, when there were 1,092.
The 1999 figures may not continue the trend, but still remain lower
than previous years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the long-term trends globally and
historically,'' said Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   There were 569 homicides citywide for all of 1997, 707 in 1996,
and 838 in 1995, according to statistics from the LAPD's
Information Resources Division.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish noted that citywide, violent crimes are down 6.5 percent
this year over last. This includes murders, rapes and robberies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few years, there's been a radical decrease in
crime,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, homicides were down in all but one police
division: Van Nuys, where there were 12 this year compared with
seven last year - marking a 42 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those are acquaintance-type homicides, where victims
knew their assailants. They are not random homicides,'' said Lt.
Ann Young, in charge of detectives at the Valley's Van Nuys
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Young said, the figure is actually quite low for
Van Nuys when you consider that last year Van Nuys had only seven
homicides, a remarkably low number.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, there were 15 homicides in Van Nuys, according to
police statistics. In 1996, there were 20, and in 1995 there were
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually down for the five-year average,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Valleywide, violent crimes were down by about 10 percent, said
LAPD Officer Guillermo Campos.
</P>
<P>
   Police attribute this decline to several factors, including
tougher sentencing laws, fewer people aged 15 to 24 who are more
apt to commit crimes, a good economy and community involvement with
police.
</P>
<P>
   Valleywide, the West Valley Division showed the most significant
decline in homicides, with four as of Dec. 14, vs. seven during the
same period in 1998. The division had nine homicides in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Devonshire had 10 homicides during the same period -- down seven
from 1998. Foothill Division had 21 homicides through Dec. 14 this
year, compared with 26 in 1998. North Hollywood had 16, vs. 17 last
year.

OH NO IN OT! BRUINS FALL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ The Bruins sealed their 20th century time
capsule with one last donation of frustration here Thursday night,
a 5-4 overtime loss to the Ottawa Senators that extended their
recent hapless-and-hopeless run to 2-9-4 over the last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Eight decades of ups and downs closed with a thud when Jason
York, trailing ex-Bruin Joe Juneau into the offensive zone,
collected a nifty through-the-legs drop pass and launched a
50-footer by Boston netminder Byron Dafoe with 1:23 gone in sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing like we're afraid to lose,'' said Bruins forward
Anson Carter, aptly describing the excruciating streak the Bruins
have endured since the Thanksgiving break. ``We were sitting back
on our heels and the other club took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fleet and skilled Senators ran off with the triumph
after entering the third period in a 4-2 deficit. Parlaying a
handful of Ottawa penalties and some opportunistic work on the
power play, the Bruins appeared to have win No. 14 in the bank when
they came out for the third period. In a matter of seconds,
however, it was obvious they were about to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1:41 into the period, and only 18 seconds after getting
turned back by Dafoe on a 30-footer, ex-Bruin Shawn McEachern made
it 4-3 with a quick snap shot from the left circle off a Vaclav
Prospal feed. For the most part, Dafoe was sensational. He made
five strong saves in the opening six minutes and his best of the
night came with 1:35 left in regulation when he turned back a Radek
Bonk point-blank attempt with a sparkling toe save. Had it not been
for Dafoe, the Bruins easily could have lost in regulation, by as
many as three or four goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators tied it with 5:23 left, when York sent in a wrister
from the blue line that looked dead in the slot. But Magnus
Arvedsson kept hacking away and eventually jammed it by Ray
Bourque, Don Sweeney, and Dafoe for the 4-4 equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting it. We're nervous,'' said Boston coach Pat
Burns, who was issued a strong backing from general manager Harry
Sinden Wednesday night, only hours before the Bruins lost to the
Devils, also in OT, also 5-4. ``We're trying to win a game so hard.
We do things that get us in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The error first and foremost here was Boston's near refusal to
do anything but flip the puck out of its own end in the third
period. Witness Ottawa's shot edge for the final 20 minutes: 19-6.
It was as if the Senators were storming down Heartbreak Hill for
the Boston Marathon and the Bruins were on the sideline, handing
them gulps of water as they passed (``Way to go, Magnus! Keep with
it, Igor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't seem to find it,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, for once, did find a trace of a scoring touch.
Sergei Samsonov popped in a pair of goals and Joe Thornton and
Carter each had one. The Senators weren't using their trademark
speed for the first 40 minutes and their star captain, Daniel
Alfredsson, kept picking up stupid minor penalties, especially in
his own attacking zone. Ottawa also didn't get help in net, where
the usually steady Ron Tugnutt, burned on 4 of 17 shots in the
first two periods, yielded to Patrick Lalime to start the third.
</P>
<P>
   In five weeks, the Bruins have gone for a frightening tour back
to the past, well beyond their last-place finish in 1996-97 under
Steve Kasper. They are now mid-'60s bad. Two wins in 15 games. They
barely cling to the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? Sinden says Burns is his guy and he made a bold
reinforcement of that point Wednesday when he said the coach has
complete autonomy. He can play whoever he wants. He can play
however he wants. There will be no meddling from the offices high
above Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   When the season's over, the wins, losses, and ties will be
totaled and Messrs. Sinden and O'Connell will say they left it all
in the hands of the bench as of Dec. 29, 1999. Never has Sinden
been so emphatic about the delineation of power in his 28 seasons
as GM. He boldly stated that Burns will stay. Then he as much as
added, ``It's all yours, big guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then the next shoe to fall could be a trade.
As for now, the 20th century has come to an end for the Bruins, and
it ended, somewhat curiously, in the midst of one of their poorest
showings in decades. Time marches on, with the Bruins severely out
of step.

CELTICS FINALLY WIN ON ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News    Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Celtics re-L mained stone-faced throughout most of
the fourth quarter. The visitors did not betray any emotion as
their lead dwindled from 10 points to 1 point. They did not glance
desper- ately at the scoreboard. Instead, the players voiced their
determination during timeouts and in their own heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``No let down'' was the message the Celtics repeated to
themselves. ``Let's not let this one get away.'' They did not think
about the stretch of 11 consecutive road losses that had plagued
them since the season opener. They did not think about their
late-game collapses. They did not think about the poor defensive
efforts that had cost them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But when Antoine Walker sank two free throws with 1 minute 44
seconds left to give the Celtics a 7- point lead, Paul Pierce could
no long- er contain his thoughts. The guard strode down the
sideline and shout- ed, ``Yeah!'' With that cheer, you could feel
the pressure of poor road play lifting off their shoulders. At that
point, Pierce and his teammates knew they were on the verge of a
monumental win. In one of the L league's toughest arenas, Boston L
earned its second road victory of the season with a 102-94 triumph
over Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge relief being on the road and getting the win,''
said L Pierce. ``Once (Walker) knocked L those two free throws
down, I knew we were going to pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief was the Celtics' word of choice when describing the win.
Al- though coach Rick Pitino constantly complimented his players'
positive attitude throughout the road slump, it was clear as the
Celtics smiled and laughed in the locker room that the travel woes
had weighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it's a sense of relief for us,'' said
Walker, who led Boston with 26 points. ``It was a must win for us
because we have been playing well on the road, but not finishing
games. We were put-H ting it together for three quarters, but not
for four quarters. Tonight, we finally did and that's a big plus
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter provided a true character test as the Nuggets
chipped away at the Celtics' lead. But unlike recent losing
efforts, Bos- ton did not collapse and fall into its routine of
poor defense and panicky offense. In the final minutes, they were
aggressive on the glass, tena- cious on defense away from the bas-
ket, and patient on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Boston built its lead back up to 6 with a quick spurt following
a time- out. Kenny Anderson (14 points, 6 assists) scored with a
driving layup, Vitaly Potapenko stole the ball, and Walker capped
the small run with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' lead quickly fell back to 3 points, but a second
timeout helped the visitors regain momen- tum. Boston dug in on
defense (in- cluding a blocked shot by Pota-HL penko) and used a
5-1 spurt to surge ahead, 93-86. Once foul shots by An- derson
stretched the lead to 9 points, the Nuggets lost all hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a perfect opportunity to be four games above .500
tonight and we didn't play like we wanted to be in that position,''
said Denver coach Dan Issel as his team ended a five-game home
winning streak. ``We simply weren't ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pitino, ``This was the best defense we've played the whole
sea- son. We played intelligently.''
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Raef LaFrentz cut the Celtics' lead to 9 points
mid- way through the second quarter, causing Pitino to call a
timeout be- fore matters got out of hand before the half. Foul
shots by Ron Mercer cut the deficit to 7, before a basket by
Anderson stretched the margin back to 9 (41-32).
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets put together a 6-0 run to close out the second
quarter and the Pepsi Center crowd awak- ened. Eric Williams missed
a 3- pointer at the buzzer as a game-high 12 point Celtic lead
dwindled to 5 points (49-44) by intermission.
</P>
<P>
   A reverse layup by Danny Fort-H son stretched the lead to 10
points (74-64) with 1:07 left in the third quarter. A Mercer layup
marked the final basket of the third quarter, drawing the Nuggets
within 8 points before the start of the fourth quar- ter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics stayed tough and hung on for the much-needed
victo- ry.

IT'S TIME FOR BOBBY'S BOY TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They can't say they weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no surprise,'' said one of the NFL's top coaches to
your humble servant on the phone Wednesday at about 5 p.m., just
shortly after the news went out over the league's private wire
service that the Patriots had suspended Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team in the league was told the same thing when this kid
was at Ohio State,'' said the coach, who will be one of the Super
Bowl favorites when the playoffs start. ``That this is the way it
could turn out with him. Their coaches (Ohio State's) were very
honest with everyone. They told us the kid was a big talent, with
big problems, and if you took him, you took his baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the gist of what scouts and coaches were told at Ohio
State four years ago before the annual NFL draft: Glenn is a
terrific talent but doesn't really care about playing football. He
doesn't want to practice. Doesn't work at the game. Won't practice
or play if he's injured. He's from a tough background with some
serious emotional problems. If you can get him on the field and he
feels like playing, he's a great talent, but he doesn't always want
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite what they had been told, the Patriots decided to use the
seventh pick in the draft, filled with a flock of outstanding wide
recievers, on Glenn. He was player personnel director Bobby Grier's
personal pick, and he would become known to Patriots coaches over
the three years after Bill Parcells left as ``Bobby's Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always protected by Grier,'' says a former Patriot
coach. ``Everyone on the staff knew that. Steve Walters (former
receiver coach, now with Tennessee, fired at the end of the '98
season) had his group in a meeting one day. It was Wednesday. A
game plan day. Terry walked out of the meeting and said he'd be
right back. He never came back. Steve went to Pete (Carroll) and
told him he had to do something, that he should fine Terry. Pete
never did a thing. Know why? Terry was up in Grier's office talking
to Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another day, we're on the field, and Terry decided not to
practice,'' said the coach. ``Just walked over to the side and was
talking to Grier. Pete called the team together on the field after
practice and waited for three or four minutes for Terry to come
over. He wouldn't. He just kept talking to Bobby. It was
embarrassing to Pete and all the coaches. Finally, Pete just said
what he had to say to the team, and we all left. This kind of stuff
happened with Terry all of the time, and nothing was done about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From another former coach who spent some time coaching Glenn
with the Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a bad kid. He's not mean-spirited. He's just very
selfish. He wants to do everything on his terms. One minute he's
up, the next minute he's in a deep funk. And once he goes into the
tank on you, you never know when he's coming out. He'll drop a pass
in a game, go to the bench, and start crying. I mean really crying.
Tears down his face. And he doesn't want to play anymore. It's
nuts. But because he's a great talent, everyone kissed his ass.
They kept hoping he would grow up, but I guess he hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 14th game of the 1998 season, playing against the Rams in
St. Louis, Glenn broke his ankle. On the flight back home, he was
told he would need surgery and to report to Massachusetts General
Hospital the next day, where Dr. Bert Zarins, the Patriots' fine
orthopedic surgeon, would repair the damage. Glenn never showed.
For two weeks, the Patriots tried to find him. They couldn't.
Finally, someone tipped the team off. He was hiding in his house,
less than 10 minutes from Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent Ron O'Neil (trainer) and Johnny Parker (strength
coach) over to his house to talk to him,'' says a Patriot employee.
``He hid in the bedroom and wouldn't come out to talk to them. They
were outside the bedroom door, and he wouldn't open the door. They
finally told him that every day he didn't have the surgery was
going to cost him $10,000, so he went and had the operation a few
days later. But he hid out in his house for two weeks and wouldn't
speak with anyone. No one ever knows what this kid is going to do.
He doesn't know himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As great a player as he has been for the Patriots at times,
Glenn has been a major distraction to the team. He is part of the
reason for the major division between the present coaching staff
and Grier's personnel department, which is beginning to become
public. The coaches, and many players, felt there was one set of
rules for Terry and another set for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he can be a likeable kid, the players tried to cut him
a lot of slack, even though they knew he was different, and a
little weird, by their standards,'' says a former Patriots coach.
``He was never one of the guys. He really didn't hang out with any
of the other players. Even if you are the biggest jerk on the team,
you can usually have one or two guys you can hang around with, but
Terry is a loner. He doesn't even like to come out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patriots management is well aware of Glenn's problems from top
to bottom. They had tried to get him counseling and would like him
to go into a regular program to deal with his abnormal behavior. To
this point, Glenn has resisted help, and no one has pushed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deal at Thanksiving pushed everything over the edge,''
says a Patriot employee. ``When he showed up late for practice, he
was still hung over. He couldn't practice worth a damn. And that's
when the other players had it with him. You talk to them privately,
and they say it's time for him to grow up, and time for someone
upstairs to kick his rear end in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are just as responsible as Glenn for what happened
over the weekend. He has always been given special treatment,
except when Parcells was here, when Glenn had the great rookie
season. ``Bill stepped on his neck from Day One,'' says a former
Patriots coach. ``Terry feared him. He was afraid of Bill because
Bill wouldn't put up with any of that crap, and Terry knew it. As
soon as Bill left, it all changed. Terry would go around Pete to
Bobby. Bobby would always cover for him. I bet that's why Pete
didn't call Grier this time he was suspending Terry. Pete must
think he's gone, so he doesn't care what Grier says anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As best as your humble servant can put together, here is what
happened to Glenn, starting a week ago. He came to practice at
Foxborough saying he was sick. O'Neil sent him home to rest. He was
never seen by a doctor and hasn't been seen by one to this day.
Glenn was supposed to report to the nearby hotel where the Patriots
were staying the night before the game. He never showed. The
Patriots, again trying to cover for Glenn, at first said he was at
the hotel and left the next morning (Sunday) for the game. That was
a lie. Glenn stayed at home, but again, the coverup was being
readied. Glenn stayed home Sunday. He phoned to say he couldn't
make it. By any normal standard of conduct in the NFL, the player
comes to the stadium and gets checked out by the doctor, who
determines if he can play. Three other players who had the flu
reported to the hotel Saturday night and showed up at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday and Tuesday, he still had not shown up. Carroll tried
to cover up for him by saying he was told to stay home. Even though
Glenn failed to show, nothing was done. Last Friday, he was told
the flu would run its course in 48 hours. Some 96 hours later, and
just 10 minutes away by car, he didn't drive to the stadium to be
checked out by a trainer or doctor. Still Carroll wasn't going to
do anything, until Wednesday, when Glenn showed up. Carroll had a
meeting and asked Glenn to explain what happened. Glenn wouldn't
talk to him. Basically, he just blew off the coach. This is when
Carroll decided he'd had enough and suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A former Ohio State teammate of Glenn's currently heading to the
playoffs Thursday told one of his assistant coaches: ``Terry pulled
the same stuff at Ohio State. Everyone tried to help him. Coaches.
Players. We knew he had a tough deal (in earlier life), but, man,
he's 26 years old now (actually 25), and it's time to grow up. He's
got to start dealing with his problems and stop running away from
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Glenn doesn't care about what happens to his coaches
and teammates. When Walters, a great guy and great coach, was fired
after the '98 season, Carroll told him he didn't want to let him
go, but ``they'' (upper management) didn't think he had dealt well
with Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's a baby,'' says a former teammate now with another
team. ``He's so immature. He's distracting to be around. For long
periods of time, he might just sit there and say nothing. The guys
on the team want to try to like him, but it's hard. On a team,
you're supposed to be thinking about what's best for the team, and
he's always got his own thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to say good night to Glenn? I don't think so. Irving
Fryar had his own planet farther out in orbit than this kid has,
but he returned to earth once he left New England and showed that
he was a Hall of Fame player. Unfortunately for Fryar, his
spacewalk while he was a Patriot just might be enough to bring him
short of Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has not hit bottom yet. The Patriots will urge him to get
counseling when the season is over. If he doesn't want to go along
with it, they have a hard decision to make. And no matter what, the
next head coach in here should be given authority and make it
crystal clear to Glenn that he is no longer Bobby's Boy, and that
it's time to put away the toys.
</P>

BOSTON TIPS ITS CENTENNIAL CAP TO THE SPLENDID SPLINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No. 9 is No. 1. Naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Was there ever any doubt? Bill Russell, Bobby Orr, and Larry
Bird were great, but as the Globe's countdown from 100 lurched
toward the finish, deep-thinking New England sports aficionados had
to realize who would remain when we reached No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Boston sports in the 20th century was graced by the
extraordinary skills of Russell, Orr, Bird, plus Carl Yastrzemski,
Rocky Marciano, Doug Flutie, Ray Bourque, Drew Bledsoe, Lefty
Grove, Bob Cousy, Clarence H. DeMar, Milt Schmidt, Jimmie Foxx,
Roger Clemens, John Havlicek, John Hannah, Eddie Shore, Bill
Rodgers, Dave Cowens, Marvin Hagler, Cy Young, Joan Benoit
Samuelson, Harry Agganis, Pedro Martinez, and Nomar Garciaparra.
Babe Ruth even played here long enough to win three World Series
before becoming an international icon in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kid who came north from spring training in 1939 stands
alone as the enduring New England sports figure of the century.
Perhaps the next century, too.
</P>
<P>
   First, remember that baseball was the dominant sport in our
region for the vast majority of the last 100 years. And Ted
Williams was baseball. He may have been the greatest hitter who
ever lived. His Hall of Fame career, spanning parts of four decades
produced a career batting average of .344 with 521 homers. He was
able to hit .388 at age 39, won a batting title at 40, and almost
certainly would have been a 700-homer threat had he not missed
almost five full seasons serving his country in World War II and
the Korean conflict. Boston sports had dozens of other spectacular
performers, but only Ted was able to make news for seven of the 10
decades in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, right after Ted retired, President John F.
Kennedy addressed a collection of American Nobel Prize winners at a
dinner in the East Room of the White House. Kennedy said there had
not been such a collection of talent gathered in the White House
since the days when Thomas Jefferson dined alone there. So it is
with Ted Williams. There is Ted, and then there is everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in San Diego and raised by a mom who was dedicated
to the Salvation Army. In his autobiography, he admitted, ``I was
embarrassed about my home, embarrassed that I never had quite as
good clothes as some of the kids, embarrassed that my mother was
out in the middle of the damn street all the
</P>
<P>
   Young Ted always wanted to hit. He went from Herbert Hoover High
School to the Pacific Coast League and arrived at the Back Bay
train station in April of 1939, ready to hit .327. He was 6 feet 4
inches and weighed 172 pounds and became known as the Splendid
Splinter. Sox owner Tom Yawkey had bullpens built in right field
after Williams's rookie season, and the pens were known as
``Williamsburg.'' He hit .344 in his second year, then had his
signature season _ the last .400 season of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem like too big of a deal at the time. Twelve other
players had hit .400 since 1900, none since Bill Terry in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of his final day at .400 is part of New England sports
lore. Young fans coming of age learn the tall tale the way they
learn to recite the midnight ride of Paul Revere. Williams was
batting .39955 going into the final Sunday of the season and
manager Joe Cronin offered to sit him down to protect the
rounded-off .400. Williams walked the streets of Philadelphia with
equipment man Johnny Orlando (Ted stopping for ice cream, Orlando
for scotch), late Saturday night. There was never any doubt that he
would play and he went 6 for 8 in a doubleheader finale to finish
at .406. No player has hit .400 since.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth year, Ted Williams won the Triple Crown, but just
as in '41, it was not good enough to earn him MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1942, Williams reported with 30 other Navy Aviation
Cadets in Amherst. He earned his officer's commission and made it
all the way to San Francisco, where he was scheduled for combat
duty in the South Pacific, but the war ended before Ted was called
and his next assignment was Red Sox spring training in 1946. In
'46, he was American League MVP, leading the Red Sox to their first
pennant since 1918. One of his career highlights came in July when
he went 4 for 4 with two homers in a 12-0 American League All-Star
Game rout at Fenway Park. Disappointment followed when he hit only
.200 (all singles) in the 1946 World Series, which the Sox lost in
seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Sox lost a one-game playoff at Fenway
against Cleveland. In 1949, Boston went to New York needing only
one win in the final two games to make it to the World Series.
Boston lost both. Williams never again came close to postseason
play. He was condemned to finish his starry career carrying
pitching-poor teams that were annually drubbed by the hated
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember all of it,'' he once said. ``It was a thrill,
let me tell you. To get up there and make it and find out I was as
good as anybody, those things were very gratifying to me. But there
was a lot of disappointment, too. All those years when we could
have won. One year we lost the whole pitching staff, and we had
that playoff game and those two games at the end of the year ('49).
I've always thought that the '40s and '50s . . . well, I don't know
of a greater era in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   He was baseball's best player in the 1950s, but never played
another meaningful game in October. He believed his hitting was
diminished after he broke his elbow chasing a Ralph Kiner flyball
in the 1950 All-Star Game at Comiskey Park in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was plenty of opportunity to add to his legend. On
April 30, 1952, 25,000 fans poured into Fenway and sang ``Auld Lang
Syne,'' sending Ted off to the Korean conflict. He flew 39 missions
and twice landed his fighter plane after being hit by anti-aircraft
fire. John Glenn described him as the finest pilot he'd seen.
Williams returned to Fenway Aug. 6, 1953, and finished with a .407
average in only 91 at-bats. Thirteen of his 37 hits were home runs.
Later in the decade, he hit .388 at age 39, and won a batting title
at 40. He homered in his final at-bat against the Orioles at Fenway
in 1960 and inspired John Updike's ``Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to walk down the street and have people say,
``There goes the greatest hitter who ever lived.'' He said hitting
a baseball was the hardest thing to do in sports. He wrote about
``The Science of Hitting,'' and it became the hitting bible for
several generations of young men. Last summer, actor Matt Damon
bragged to Williams that he had read Ted's book (Damon's dad, Kent
Damon, is freshman baseball coach at Newton North). Ted quizzed Mr.
Good Will Hunting, asking him what was the most important message
in the book. Damon answered, ``Get a good ball to hit.'' Bingo. Ted
was happy.
</P>
<P>
   He had many nicknames _ The Kid, The Splendid Splinter, Teddy
Ballgame, Thumper. He had his own shift, created by Cleveland
player/manager, Lou Boudreau. His feud with the Boston press was
legendary. The men from the press skewered him for going fishing
when his daughter was born. He was fined for spitting toward the
Fenway stands. He was fined for tossing his bat after striking out.
The bat came down on the head of Joe Cronin's housekeeper. He made
himself into one of the greatest fly fishermen in the world. He
shot pigeons with a shotgun in an empty Fenway Park. He wrote for
the Saturday Evening Post and the Globe. He was cheated out of an
MVP by a bitter sportswriter. He weighed his bats at the post
office. His eyesight was so good that few umpires dared call him
out on strikes, and it was said that he could read the label of a
78 RPM record spinning on a turntable. He demanded a 30 percent
paycut ($125,000 to $90,000) after slumping to .254 in 1959. He
read Zane Gray. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960. He had his
own baseball camp. He would not tip his cap and never wore a
necktie. When he was enshired in the Hall of Fame, he ripped
sportswriters one last time then said, ``baseball gives every
American boy a chance to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his hitting and war heroics, charity was one of
Williams's lasting contributions to Greater Boston. A friend of Dr.
Sidney Farber, the godfather of modern chemotherapy, Williams
quietly led an army of volunteers in the battle against children's
cancer. His only sibling, Danny Williams, died of leukemia and Ted
took on the Jimmy Fund as his pet charity when the Boston Braves
(cofounders of the Jimmy Fund) left Boston in 1953. He would go
anywhere, and do anything, in the name of the Jimmy Fund _ as long
as there were no cameras to record his deeds. Today there is a
permanent Williams exhibit at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and
members of the ``406 Club'' (named in honor of Ted's .400 season,)
have raised over $2 million for cancer research in Williams's name.
</P>
<P>
   The ``406 Club'' was unveiled at a black-tie (Ted wore a string
tie) Park Plaza event in December 1995 _ just a few hours after the
formal dedication of the Ted Williams Tunnel. It was the final thaw
in the deep freeze that kept Williams distant from the Boston
fandom.
</P>
<P>
   The man who never tipped his cap when he played has become the
godfather of Boston sports. Ted turned 80 in 1998 and returned to
Boston for the All-Star Game festival this past July. He tossed out
the first ball before the game and was engulfed by stars of today
and the past. It was one of the most emotional moments in Boston
sports history, a fitting end to a New England sports century
dominated by baseball, and by Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who
ever lived.

A WONDERFUL REIMAGINING OF `WUTHERING HEIGHTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
WINDWARD HEIGHTS 
By Maryse Conde (translated, from the French, by Richard Philcox) 
Soho Press, 348 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a steely sort of writer's confidence to bring back
Charlotte Bronte. In fact, some of her most ardent fans might catch
their breath at the very prospect, and instinctively shy away from
this reimagining of her classic ``Wuthering Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   But to disregard ``Windward Heights,'' the novel by
award-winning Caribbean novelist Maryse Conde, author of ``Segu''
and ``Tree of Life,'' would be to miss something unrepressed and
thoroughly fresh, and full of love and honor for its English
foremother. Conde writes in her dedication: ``To Emily Bronte, who
I hope will approve of this interpretation of her masterpiece.
Honour and respect!''
</P>
<P>
   Conde, who won the 1999 Marguerite Yourcenar Prize (for fiction
published in French by an author residing in the United States),
has elegantly recast the classic 19th-century tale as one that
spans continents and races, setting one family's almost unbearable
misery in her native French-speaking Guadeloupe at the turn of the
20th century. It is a society of Africans and Europeans wound tight
with tension, scrambling to find its bearings as it emerges from
slavery into colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   Conde's Heathcliff is a black man named Razye, a foundling from
the barren ``razyes'' or heaths in the island's countryside. Her
Catherine is Cathy, the stunning and spirited daughter of the
mixed-race planter Hubert Gagneur, who takes Razye in as a young
boy. Together with Cathy's jealous brother, Justin, they live in a
crumbling estate called L'Engoulvent, which Gagneur inherited from
his white father.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up with Cathy, Razye falls in love with her, a
sentiment that turns to obsession once she rejects him for a
wealthy, French-educated white Creole planter named Aymeric de
Linsseuil. We meet Razye just as he has made his fortune in Cuba,
and is about to return to Guadeloupe to exact his
hurricane-strength revenge _ both on Linsseuil and on Justin,
Cathy's brother, who had taken over the family estate, and demeaned
and banished Razye as soon as he could. ``I must take my revenge,''
Razye says. ``On the man who took the woman I loved and the man who
made me unworthy of her love. . . . I'll bring the second man to
his knees and if I have to kill the first one with both hands, I
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bronte thread is woven throughout the story, it is
here that Conde, a professor of French Caribbean literature at
Columbia University, parts ways with Bronte, and takes over with
her own extraordinary storytelling, imbued with race, culture, and
sexuality against a lush, painstakingly researched historical
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery is a recent memory as the story unfolds, told in the
voices of various servants and others who knew both Razye and
Cathy. Race and social standing dictate almost every scene, every
mood, every decision. Guadeloupe's inhabitant are of ``all colors
of the rainbow from Congo-black to pass-for-white.'' But there is
no question about who holds power and who still suffers in this
color-coded society: ``The rich planters laid down the law and the
blacks lived hand to mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of slavery means nothing,'' says Lucinda Lucius,
Cathy's servant, who can trace her own family's slave history to
the capture of her Bambara grandmother in West Africa. ``It's the
same sadness, the same wretchedness we've been chewing on as long
as we can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in this atmosphere that Cathy, ``the colour of hot syrup
left to cool in the open air,'' rejects the too-black Razye for
Linsseuil, the planter Cathy describes as a ``heavenly Cherub.'' In
fact they even marry, contrary to ``a golden rule that knows no
exception . . . the white male will never marratto girl,
though she may be his mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   It is what Razye overhears from Cathy, as she speaks with her
servant, that breaks his heart _ especially when he hears from her
own lips that it was her brother who turned her against Razye, and
toward a life of white privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Razye is now, I could never marry him. It would be too
degrading!'' Cathy says. ``Living with him would be like starting
over as savages from Africa.'' The calabash of his heart had been
smashed, Conde writes, and he'd never managed to piece it together.

EX-WANG CHIEF SEEN BECOMING PRESIDENT OF EMC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Wang Global chief executive Joseph Tucci is expected to
be named president of computer storage giant EMC Corp. of
Hopkinton, according to people familiar with the company.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Tucci, who struck a deal to sell Wang to
Getronics NV of the Netherlands for $2 billion earlier this year,
is expected to be announced soon. He had resigned an executive
position at Getronics earlier this month, but remains on the
supervisory board of the Dutch company.
</P>
<P>
   In moving to EMC as president, Tucci, 52, will take one of the
titles held by chief executive Michael Ruettgers, 57, who will
continue to be the company's top-ranking executive. Co-founder
Richard Egan is the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers, who was named president and chief operating officer
in 1989, has been EMC's chief executive since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci could not be reached to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   EMC spokesman Mark Frederickson declined to comment Thursday on
any specific executive changes at the company. But he said the
rapid growth of EMC's business has created a need for more
experienced executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been looking for senior executive bench depth for some
time,'' Frederickson said. ``We're on the verge of becoming a $12
billion company and we're going to be one of the 10 largest
software companies in the world. Just like other leaders of
franchise technology companies, Mike has seen the need for more
senior executive depth.''
</P>
<P>
   EMC is expected to record sales of more than $5 billion for
1999, though some expect the company's revenues to grow to the $12
billion range within two years.
</P>
<P>
   EMC has told analysts it plans to hire about 4,500 new employees
in the year ahead, significantly expanding its current work force
of about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for growth and the hot technology stock market
propelled EMC past Gillette Co. this year as the state's most
valuable public company with shares worth a total of $112 billion.
EMC stock reached a record Thursday, advancing 1 13/16 to 110 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci has a long track record as a technology executive, working
at Unisys Corp. for seven years before joining Wang in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He became president of Wang in 1993, when it emerged from US
Bankruptcy Court protection, and began to move the company from its
high-tech hardware roots to a pure computer services business.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci made a series of deals, the biggest of which was Wang's
$390 million purchase of the Euoprean computer services business of
Italy's Olivetti SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growth that had boosted Wang's work force from 6,000 to
20,000 in six years, the company was still relatively small
compared to its computer services competitors. Wang was on track to
record annual revenues of $3.5 billion while a giant like IBM
derived about $32 billion from computer services in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For all the company's expansion, Wang stock did not seem to
respond. In an interview with The Boston Globe at the time of the
company's sale, Tucci noted that Wang stock had been trading within
a relativley narrow price band for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, the Gentronics offer valued at 39
percent premium to Wang's stock price, was hard to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci remained at Getronics as deputy chief executive until Dec.
2. He had previously described the Getronics position as temporary.

FSU'S WARRICK SEEKS REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Peter Warrick wishes it could be different. He
wishes he could find a time machine, step back three months, and
undo what was done.
</P>
<P>
   He can't. And that bothers him. Haunts him even. ``I'm not a bad
person,'' he said. ``I made a mistake. I paid the price.''
</P>
<P>
   But we live in a judgmental world. Perception is reality and the
perception, which sticks for now, is not of an All-American wide
receiver who stayed at Florida State for his senior season and got
his degree, but of the out-of-control athlete of the '90s who has
his hands out with a ``what's-in-it-for-me?'' look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, say those making character assessments, is not
disputable. Peter Warrick went on a shopping spree at Dillard's
department store in Tallahassee earlier this season. He purchased
$412.38 worth of merchandise. He paid $21.40.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no discount. Not even close. Warrick was caught,
arrested, and plea bargained his way into a conviction that brought
no jail time but punished him nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the Heisman Trophy for which Warrick was the
overwhelming preseason favorite. But, even more important for the
6-foot, 190-pound senior, gone was his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of respect, Warrick was ridiculed. Florida fans
traveling to Gainesville for the annual game vs. Florida State had
Dillard's bags hanging out of their trunks in a mock salute to
Warrick. He became the poster child for pampered, spoiled athletes.
</P>
<P>
   People were making comparisons between Warrick and O.J. Simpson.
``How can you treat me like that,'' wondered Warrick, who asked
people to judge him by the person he was, not what they thought
they saw.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the problem. What people saw was the Warrick who at
first fluffed off the incident by saying, ``It was not like I shot
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was remorse, it didn't come until much later, it
seemed.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Warrick's career was in the pause mode. He served
a two-game suspension while his legal problems were being sorted
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman? He went from the front-runner to not receiving
enough votes to even get an invitation to the Heisman festivities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's skills remain the same, as good as any receiver in
college football this season, something that could very well bring
him back to New York next spring as the No. 1 draft pick of the
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes the field at the Superdome in Tuesday night's
national championship Sugar Bowl game against Virginia Tech, he
will be a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   He wants more than a win, and he wants that a lot. He wants some
sort of redemption, some sort of dispensation that people accept
that he made a mistake in judgment, that he is not only a great
player, but a good person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot,'' said Warrick, who still managed to
lead the Seminoles in receiving this season with 71 catches for 934
yards, a remarkable 103.8 yards per game average. ``Winning a
championship would do a lot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing is not an option, although this will be Warrick's third
national championship game; but the Seminoles have lost the first
two (in 1996 against Florida in the Sugar Bowl and last year
against Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl). And he has yet to catch a TD
pass in a title game.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have rallied around him. Warrick was elected the
offensive captain for Tuesday's game. Offensive coordinator Mark
Richt is putting together a game plan that uses all of Warrick's
skills: catching the ball, running the ball, and throwing the ball,
which he has done three times this season.
</P>
<P>
   He's got the respect of the Virginia Tech players, who have seen
the tapes of Warrick's eight touchdown receptions and three
touchdown runs. ``Once he gets the ball in his hands, he can score
anytime, anywhere,'' said Tech wide receiver Andre Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick has always done that. Always been a winner. When he was
at Bradenton (Fla.) Southeast High School, his teams won state
championships in his junior and senior seasons, playing wide
receiver as a junior and QB as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick said he is trying to do things the right way. The cuts
from the Dillard's incident are starting to heal, although the
media attention this week undoubtedly opened up some wounds. ``I'm
trying to do everything right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FSU coach Bobby Bowden has had enough of the Warrick bashing.
``Hasn't he been punished enough?''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dillard's incident had been an isolated act, perhaps. But
there have been other incidents. In his junior year, he exchanged
words with police outside a Tampa fast-food restaurant and was
charged with disorderly conduct. There have been other flare-ups,
none of them epic in nature, but more than one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no one questions his character. Maybe his judgment
sometimes. ``I don't want a bad image,'' said Warrick before the
season. ``I don't want people saying bad things about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to him don't. They see a teammate who does a job.
They see a father who has a 2-year-old daughter he dotes on. They
also see a confused young man who has made bad judgments and is now
suffering the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you knew Pete, you know he's not selfish; he's not that
kind of guy,'' said FSU running back Travis Minor.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is not the cure-all for all things, but in the case of
Warrick, it will soothe the soul. ``If we don't win, the season
will be a waste,'' said Warrick. ``We'd come so close and be so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is perhaps the epiteth for Warrick's final season at FSU.
By next summer, he should be a newly minted millionaire who won't
need discounts at department stores. He can reinvent himself the
way Randy Moss, ironically one of Warrick's closest friends, has
done with the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Warrick is counting days, hours, and minutes until he
can make a statement on the football field that will bring some joy
into what has been a season with very little of it.

MUSIC OF A DIFFERENT COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blue Man Group _ a visual or auditory experience? Most people
would say visual, based on the act's long-running theater success.
But Blue Man Group has always had a stirring audio component, which
finally gets full rein on its new (and first) CD, ``Audio.''
</P>
<P>
   How to describe it? Let's ask cofounder Chris Wink:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribal rhythms . . . where percussion and melody meet . . .
futuristic but ancient . . . with big elements of punk energy and
crazy, spaghetti-western guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aesthetic has been to try to paint with sound,'' says
Wink, one of the three Blue Man Group founders who have seen their
late '80s salon gatherings balloon into a theater phenomenon now
playing in three cities _ New York, Boston, Chicago, and, as of
February, in Las Vegas at the Luxor Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The group's visuals are well-known _ the blue face masks, the
``paint drums'' (where mallets are bashed into different,
electrically lit paints), and the tubular PVC instruments
(polyvinyl chloride pipes) struck with foam-rubber padd's a
child's fantasy for adults, with elements of Pink Floyd (think of
their hypnotic element), the Grateful Dead (think of their ``drums
and space'' segments), and, yes, the Sex Pistols (whose song
``Anarchy in the UK'' is played in the theater show, but not on the
album).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel comfortable with a Pink Floyd influence,'' says
Wink, ``but, interestingly, we're not Deadheads. It's not like
we're anti-Dead _ and I love what (Dead percussionist) Mickey Hart
has done in his exploration of the drums, but we have many other
influences. We like the koto drummers of Japan _ they hit with
incredible passion and there's a lot to learn from hey're
ego-less and submerge into a collective. And I also studied African
drumming at college, with Ed Blackwell at Wesleyan, and learned
about interlocking rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you mention Pink Floyd,  technically a blues
band, though some of their most powerful stuff goes past that. But
we wanted to move away from the blues and go to a place where
nobody went before. What punk did for the guitar, we wanted to do
for the drums.''
</P>
<P>
   Wink and cofounders Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton do just that
on ``Audio,'' which incorporates a number of Blue Man-made
instruments that were too big to fit into the Charles Playhouse.
These include the tubulum, which is similar to the PVC, but has
longer pipes and is struck with sticks. All the instruments are
acoustic (no drum machines allowed) and recorded on analog tape,
not digitally, to get a more organic sound.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an album that veers between rock and ambient
textures with a trance-like fluidity that compensates for the lack
of vocals. The compositions are based on riffs from the theater
shows, but the CD is not a clone of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to just have a soundtrack,'' says Wink. ``So we
thought, `Hey, let's just throw the show out.' Before long we were
completely rearranging songs and creating a different hybrid. You
would still know it's Blue Man, but you wouldn't hear the exact
thing.''
</P>

   The founders, who made the album in their New York warehouse,
enlisted a number of Bostonians to help out. Producer/music
director Todd Perlmutter and guitarist Christian Dyas had been in
the Boston band Orangutang. Boston engineers Andrew Schneider, Carl
Plaister (who had worked at Fort Apache studio), and Billy O'Malley
(who had been in the band Jocobono with Perlmutter) contributed, as
did Ross Humphrey, who worked as a tour manager for the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones. And Boston's Pro Audio put together the warehouse
studio for Blue Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like new ritualistic music,'' says producer Perlmutter.
``Before this, I was more of a punk-rock guy _ get in the studio,
have some booze, do some takes, and get out. But Blue Man was more
intense. They hear a sound and then build an instrument for it. We
were five months working on it, recording all these weird
instruments, with tons and tons of drums. We used all 48 tracks.''

   Top tours: The Rolling Stones were the top-grossing act in North
America this year with $64.7 million raked in at the box office,
followed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band with $61.4
million, according to Pollstar magazine. Then came `N Sync with
$51.5 million (but `N Sync sold the most tickets _ 1.8 million) and
the Dave Matthews Band with $48.5 million. Average ticket prices
for the top 50 tours rose nearly 30 percent, from $33.59 to $43.63.
And though the year saw a record overall gross of $1.5 million, the
actual number of tickets sold for the top 50 acts totaled 26.3
million _ down 4 percent from last year and the smallest number
since 1993's 25.6 million. ``For an industry based on a high volume
of repeat business, this is not a good sign,'' the magazine said.

   Country attendance dips: Tough news for country fans as the
millennium closes. Country attendance dropped 28 percent this year,
according to Amusement Business. Gross country dollars were also
down 16 percent, to $116 million. The good news lay in headlining
tours by Shania Twain (she led the pack with a $36.5 million gross,
with an average take of $571,410 per show) and George Strait. The
latter's stadium tour, which also featured Tim McGraw, Dixie
Chicks, Jo Dee Messina, Kenny Chesney, and Asleep at the Wheel,
grossed $32.3 million in just 17 dates, averaging $1.9 million per
show.

   Didi's tribute: A pleasant surprise last week was Didi Stewart's
tribute to the Hollies, staged at Johnny D's in Boston. The Hollies
may be known to some folks as just Graham Nash's band before he
joined Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash, but they were masters of vocal
harmony back in the '60s, mixing pure pop with a psychedelic flair.
Stewart, who is known for her tributes as well as her efforts in
such local bands at Girls Night Out and Didi Stewart and the
Amplifiers, caught the Hollies' spirit well. She did justice to
classics like ``Bus Stop,'' ``Carrie Anne,'' ``Carousel,'' ``He
Ain't Heavy,'' and ``Air that I Breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who teaches voice at Berklee College of Music, was
accompanied by a crack veteran band, including Peter Hoffman and
Wendy Sobel on guitars, Tim Jackson on drums, and Mike Payatte on
bass and vocals. Look for her to repeat the tribute later this
winter.

   It was 20 years ago today (well, close enough) when the Ramones
sang ``It's the end, the end of the '70s/It's the end, the end of
the century'' and we all kind of laughed. The end of the century,
fellas? So far away. In the song, ``Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll
Radio?,'' Joey Ramone continued: ``We need change and we need it
fast/Before rock becomes part of the past/'Cause lately it all
seems the same to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramones were prescient. As to rock 'n' roll, well, if it
seemed in trouble then . . . check out the top of the pops today.
</P>
<P>
   With this, the 20th annual It's Only Rock 'n' Roll Awards, we
both salute the vision of the Ramones _ who recently reunited for a
gig at CBGB in New York _ and hope for better days ahead. Not that
there weren't moments. It's just that when you survey the
landscape, you bump up against way too much vacuous teen pop,
rebellion-by-the-numbers rap metal, and country-pop dross. Our
modus operandi, as always: vicious, but fair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
KING OF THE MOUNTAIN: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.
Whenever all these guys (and gal) get together, you can only bow
and hand the crown back to them. Their FleetCenter show(s) had all
the love and ache, desperation and desire, full-tilt rock 'n' roll
and mournful balladry you could ever hope for. You leave a show
like this feeling very much alive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
800-POUND GORILLA: Robert F.X. Sillerman and his guys and gals at
SFX, the company that now presents most of the music you will go
and see, and likes nothing more than linking concerts to corporate
sponsors. Can a near-monopoly work for the customer? You be the
judge. Caveat emptor. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROCK 'N' ROLL POLITICO OFFSPRING: Sid McCain. Arizona Senator John
McCain's and presidential hopeful daughter championed the way-cool
space rock band Spiritualized when she worked publicity for Arista;
she is now a senior director of publicity for Capitol. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO? Puff Daddy. The devout Christian, draped in
gold chains, agreed to have himself put up on a cross for a pal's
video, reconsidered this questionable tactic, and made his
displeasure known by beating up on a record company executive
involved. Kind of a lose-lose-lose situation. And, wait, this just
in: Puff busted for possession of a stolen gun with Jennifer
(we're-just-friends) Lopez in tow. Upside: While his album didn't
tank, it didn't break the bank. &QL; 
 &QL; 
KNOCK KNOCK. WHO'S THERE? KNOCK KNOCK. WHO'S THERE? (Old joke)
Philip Glass and his ensemble performed a slow dazzle at the Wang
for ``Koyaanisqatsi.'' A trifle irritating, but a whole lot
mesmerizing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOUBLE BILL OF THE YEAR (HIGHBROW): Richard Thompson and Lucinda
Williams. Both with their bands, both turning out exquisite, pained
rock 'n' roll that encompassed country, folk, and more. And both
adults who've been through the wringer and survived to sing about
and shacatharsis at the Orpheum. Boston was the only city
that got this treat; it was not part of a national tour but through
smart booking at the Don Law Co. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOUBLE BILL OF THE YEAR (LOWBALL) Motorhead and Nashville Pussy.
Like-minded head-bangers who have forgotten they're adults play it
fast and hard, the audio equivalent of ``The Road Warrior.'' As
subtle as a flying mallet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUR ROUTING BUMMER; Pet Shop Boys. The arch English synth-pop duo's
rare tour bypasses Boston because of booking logistics. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PSYCHEDELIC STARS: (Tie) Mercury Rev and Flaming Lips. Merc Rev did
prog-rock proud at the Middle East, and months later the Lips did
the same at the Roxy. Music as a journey, as an exploration. Peaks,
valleys, explosions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRAINS 'N' BRAWN: Rage Against the Machine. The brightly lit bulb
in the rap-metal world of burnt-out filaments. Billy Bragg brought
Howard Zinn to the college kids and liberals; Rage brings Zinn to
the mostly apolitical masses. There are worse messages to absorb by
osmosis. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROCKER/ACTRESS OF THE YEAR: Courtney Love. The brazen, barefoot,
slatternly one leads Hole through a hard-rock highwire act at the
Orpheum and charms us as Andy Kaufman's level-headed wife in ``Man
on the Moon.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
THERE IS A POP HEAVEN, AFTER ALL: The Delgados. Unassuming boys and
girls from Glasgow make beautiful noise _ violins, guitars, voices
_ at the VFW in Cambridge. &QL; 
 &QL; 
REUNITED HOMETOWN HEROES: (Tie) J. Geils Band, Del Fuegos, the
Neats. Geils put down the whammer jammer at Tweeter Center and
recently pulled off a cool charity gig; Del Fuegos packed the
Middle East Downstairs to benefit Dan and Warren Zane's mum's
charity project (and never sounded better), and the Neats brought
chills as they stuffed T.T. the Bear's Place and set up a fund for
the son of their late drummer, Terry Hanley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOMETOWN HEROES HALL OF FAME: The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. For
continuing the Hometown Throwdown at the Middle, for projecting a
good vibe and a hard edge, for keeping humble in the face of all
the hoo-ha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOCAL BAND OF THE YEAR: The Shods. Shods City Rockers. Hooks 'n'
bite. &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT'S GLARE/ &QL; 
 &QL; 
THANKS FOR THE BREAK: Madonna and Michael Jackson. Whether it's
motherhood, owning the successful Maverick record company, or her
embrace of spirituality, Madonna the icon mostly stayed out of the
way. Jackson? Still cuddling with Liz or a chimp or . . . no, don't
go there . . . another year in the hyperbaric chamber of life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST FUTURE PLAN: (tie) Garth Brooks and Celine Dion. Garth, the
Billy Joel of country-pop projects his retirement in short order.
Downside: Does that mean Chris Gaines lives? Dion, the
shudder-inducing Canadian diva, plans to take two years off to
start a family. You go, girl! Remember, it's cheaper by the dozen .
. . &QL; 
 &QL; 
BARE YOUR MIDRIFF, SPARE THE SOUL: Britney Spears is this year's
model, but the list is endless and the lightness unbearable. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PUNK'S NOT DEAD: Joe Strummer. Ol' Joe and his band the Mescaleros
tear up the Roxy with slashing punk, skanking reggae and dub, and a
warm, heartfelt vibe. Much more than a trip down memory lane. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN EMBALMED STAR: Brian Wilson. Sad to say, but
the onetime Beach Boys genius was a semi-eerie presence on stage at
Symphony Hall, not singing his fabled high harmonies, not playing a
lot of keyboards, and projecting nothing but rote emotion. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FESTIVAL OF THE YEAR: The Guinness Fleadh. The first time in Boston
for the Irish-themed mega bill and a huge success despite the
last-minute cancellation of the crankiest man alive, Van Morrison.
Highlights: Elvis, a relatively sober and kick-ass Shane MacGowan
and the Popes, Richard Thompson, many more. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SMART METAL AWARD: Queens of the Stone Age. Messy and agitated,
non-formulaic metal with brains at the Middle East Up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PUNK ROCK/HIP HOP NUCLEAR FALLOUT AND NADIR: (tie) Limp Bizkit, Kid
Rock, Korn. The ``bad'' boys of modern rock keep punching the
lowest common denominator button. &QL; 
 &QL; 
IT'S ONLY ROCK 'N' ROLL AWARD: The Rolling Stones. At the Fleet,
Mick and Keef grin like Alfred E. Neuman, saying, ``What us,
worry?'' Jokes were made _ some in this corner _ but the old guys
will be (or are) to rock 'n' roll what John Lee Hooker and B.B.
King are to the blues. Timeless and still making sense _ if not
making as great new music. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK OF THE YEAR: ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
Some of the nastiest, funniest songs to grace the silver screen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CROSSOVER OF THE YEAR: The Corrs. Sweet Irish popsters get a
slightly harder kick _ and maintain wonderful harmonies, melodies _
at Avalon. Not just cute and bubbly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CRYPTIC, GRUMPY OLD MAN OF THE YEAR; Tom Waits. An album and an
Orpheum show that puts the art in avant-garde and draws us into a
witty, dark world of mutant blues and rock. (Note: Waits has always
been a cryptic, grumpy old man.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOCAL LOSS: The death of Morphine leader Mark Sandman. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST MOMENTS AT A LOCAL SHOW: Gene Dante and company singing Roxy
Music's ``In Every Dream Home, A Heartache'' and Gary Cherone and
company singing Alice Cooper's ``Ballad of Dwight Fry'' in Boston
Rock Opera's ``Another Night (at) the Opera'' at the Middle East.
Transfixing and smile-inducing, both. &QL; 
 &QL; 
UNDESERVED SNUB: Kula Shaker. How soon they _ radio, the public _
forget. A buzz band several years ago, the English group's
sophomore effort was up to the first, a pop/psychedelic smash, but
it sank like a stone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TECHNO KINGS IN CONCERT: (Tie) Mobv Chemical Brothers, and the
Orbital/Crystal Method/Lo-Fidelity Allstars. Moby put out one of
the year's best albums, ``Play,'' and he and his band backed it up
live (adding even more punch) on the Esplanade; ditto the Chem.
Bros. with ``Surrender'' and an Avalon gig. The triple bill at
Worcester's Palladium was a raver's delight from the rock/trip hop
slant of the Lo-Fi's to the Method;s sonic assault to Orbital's
more cerebral glide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MISANTHROPIC ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR: Roger Waters. Pink Floyd's
old captain had nothing new under the moon to offer us, but he and
his band played a stirring cream-of-the-crop (mostly) show at
Tweeter Center with all the ominous sounds and pessimistic bleating
an old crank could hope for. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FORMER MISANTHROPE TURNED MR. SHOW: Elvis Costello. Yes, EC has
been gracious for years, but his Orpheum show was not only that,
but ecelnd sharply etched. Songs from all periods, pumped
up, done proud with able help from keyboardist Steve Nieve. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A KICK AND A CARRESS: Magnetic Fields. The New York-based group led
by Stephin Merritt crafted a wide-rangijg chamber pop set, both
whimsical and sad, at the Middle East. Finely detailed, downbeat
music, gorgeous and rich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST/WORST ROCK 'N' ROLL TV AD: Buzzcocks for Toyota Rav4.
England's punk progenitors sing ``What Do I Get?,'' their plaintive
song of angst and missed opportunity for a company selling a gas
gobbler. Irony abounds, the royalty check does not bounce. &QL; 
 &QL; 
STONE TEMPLE PILOTS PEARL JAM KNOCKOFF: Creed. It gets more generic
every time it filters down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMEBACK OF THE YEAR; Blondie. Good album, great live show (the
first time, at the Orpheum). All the sass and sex appeal of yore
and more enthusiasm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS THEY KNOW IT AND THEY FEEL FINE;
R.E.M. A fab Tweeter Show (including the rarely performed ``Radio
Free Europe'' encore, and proof that creative rock 'n' roll goes on
after 40.

TIRICO'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tirico has emerged as one of ESPN's go-to guys.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let his play-by-play role at the Insight.com Bowl cast any
doubt on his low-key stardom.
</P>
<P>
   His strength is versatility. He is able to call college
basketball and football games with the same detached
professionalism as his golf and studio host roles.
</P>
<P>
   His coverage of Payne Stewart's tragic accident was Hall of Fame
stuff. ``With different players playing different schedules, it can
be weeks, even months, before paths may cross again,'' Tirico said
from the PGA Tour Championship in Houston. ``That's why in some
ways this all doesn't seem real. You keep thinking that next season
is going to start, and on some range somewhere on the West Coast
when the Tour gets started, we'll see Payne . . . But it's not
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tirico has worked his way to ESPN's starting lineup. He
graduated from Syracuse in 1988 and worked as sports director for
the CBS affiliate in Syracuse and as the play-by-play voice for
Syracuse basketball, football, lacrosse, and volleyball for the
local cable network.
</P>
<P>
   He joined ESPN as a ``SportsCenter'' anchor in 1991. Since then,
he has hosted ``Monday Night Countdown'' and ``Thursday Night
College Football.'' He also hosted ``The NFL on ESPN Radio'' and
``The NBA on ESPN Radio.'' There's no other way to describe Tirico:
He's got skills.
</P>
<P>
   And smarts.
</P>
<P>
   He told ESPN viewers shortly after Stewart's death: ``Golf and
silence go hand-in-hand, but the silence today in Houston is eerie
as the players carry their individual feeling of this universal
feeling around the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sailors will tell story
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's Cup arrives right on time, especially for viewers
frustrated with local sports teams. ESPN2 starts more than 70 hours
of coverage Sunday at 12:30 a.m. with the Louis Vuitton Cup
Challenger semifinals. Live coverage begins Feb. 18 with the best
of nine America's Cup Match.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Mason is producing the coverage. Mason competed in the
1962 Defender Trials as a crew member on Nefertiti.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told reporters that his main objective is to allow
the sailors to tell the story. Digital technology, including
wireless microphones attached to several key players, will enable
viewers to feel as if they are in New Zealand listening to strategy
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Announcers Jim Kelly and Gary Jobson will be stationed in the
water ``to see the boats firsthand, feel the wind, and get a better
sense of the competition,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Other technological innovations include ``SailTrack,''
computer-generated 3-D graphics, and ``yachtcam,'' an on-board
camera. Mason said he is most excited about the on-board sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other sport will allow people at home to feel the emotional
energy of the competitors like the America's Cup,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all agreed on Jordan
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN revealed a few details on its selection of Michael Jordan
as the century's greatest athlete, beating out Babe Ruth and
Muhammad Ali. Details show a wide range of disagreement. Only nine
of the 48 panel members voted Jordan No. 1. Ruth received 10
first-place votes. Ali received 11, but also had six votes placing
him below the Top 10. Ruth received five such votes and Jordan only
two . . . Fox Sports Net New England airs ``Magic versus Bird: The
Game that Changed the Game'' Saturday at 6:30 p.m. At 9 a.m. and 5
p.m., the cable station reruns ``Keith Olbermann's Top 50 Athletes
of the Century.'' CBS interviews Bill Parcells for ``60 Minutes''
Sunday at 7 p.m. Parcells tells Mike Wallace this season was ``a
humbling experience. You feel like a failure, no matter how much
you've won, no matter how many games . . . championships . . .
Super Bowls. You're not winning now, so you stink. And that's the
way you look at yourself personally.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Once every thousand years or so, the Rockets are this unbeatable.
Every pass is precise. Drives turn into dunks. Jumpers are chip
shots.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And if not quite 1,000 years in the making, the Rockets' 122-100
win over the Clippers at Compaq Center on Thursday night was at
least their most prolific and lopsided of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets pulled out all the Millennium Celebration Party
stops they could come up with. They passed out party hats and
noisemakers. They threw confetti into the stands and gave away
posters, jackets and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   But the last detail was the party highlight that was most
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a stunning turnaround for their make-or-break
backcourt combination of Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley. One game
after Francis was benched down the stretch and Mobley turned
himself into a stand-still jump shooter, the Rockets' prodigy
backcourt tossed passes around like party favors.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley and Francis each had 11 assists, the first time the
Rockets have had two players in double figures in that category
since Sam Cassell and Robert Horry turned the trick in 1995.
Francis added 19 points, while Mobley scored 16 and had seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' Francis said. ``I worked hard in practice
yesterday. I didn't play up to my standards the last game. Coach
(Rudy Tomjanovich) told me he just wanted me to be more aggressive
and play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great. Every time I turned around, somebody was open.
And (Mobley) was passing the ball, and I was doing the same thing.
That means the plays we're running are working. Guys were open
cutting to the basket. We had some transition buckets. A lot of
times guys were cutting to the bucket, and we were finding them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley put on a clinic regarding the difference between his
frustrating finish against the Raptors and the Rockets' plan to
clear out to allow him to create.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they might not have expected this much of a reversal
in one game. When Mobley reached double figures in assists for the
first time in his career, there were almost three minutes left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're going to double me and rush people at me,''
Mobley said. ``My job is to get everybody else into it. That's the
most fun kind (of game). Nobody is bickering. Everybody's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bickering was reserved, as is so often the case, for the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor, having already publicly plotted his escape from
Los Angeles, had a career-high 31 points, making 13 of 22 shots.
But in 40 minutes, the 6-9, 260-pound forward had just three
rebounds and then directly pointed at second-year center Michael
Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi blocked six shots but had just four rebounds and four
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really bothers me with the way we're losing,'' Taylor said
after his team dropped to 9-20. ``When you are losing to teams that
you are supposed to beat, it should bother you. If it doesn't,
something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to be on the same page, and everybody has to
play. We simply have to get more out of Michael. He's not
protecting the basket. He's not doing much on offense. He's not
doing nothing right now. I don't know if anyone else is going to
say anything, but I don't care. He's got to step up, because now
he's nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom, the Clippers' ballyhooed Rookie of the Year
candidate, registered his first career triple double (10 points, 13
rebounds, 10 assists). He was, however, just 2-of-13 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, meanwhile, were so in sync that they had assists on
36 of their 50 field goals, collecting five more assists than their
previous best this season. And that total came in a double-overtime
game in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   With their guards distributing the ball so fervently, the
Rockets' big men consistently cut to the lane to take passes for
dunks. Kelvin Cato had 21 points, scoring 10 on alley-oop dunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great out there,'' Cato said. ``We played as a total
team tonight. Everybody had it going, and we started milking
everybody. Even the guys off the bench came in with a good
attitude, no matter how many points up we were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three stages. We had the Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) and
Chuck (Barkley) together stage. We had the Chuck stage without
Dream. Now we have the stage without both of them. Now we're
finding out what our strong points are and taking advantage of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rogers had 15 points for the Rockets, completing four
cuts to the basket with dunks.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the highlight finishes, the slam of the night did
not come from either Cato or Rogers, or even Francis, who brought
out some of what could become part of his All-Star Weekend
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had already begun to turn the game into a H-O-R-S-E
contest early in the second half. Shandon Anderson scored on a cut
to the basket, taking a pass from Mobley. Francis passed to Rogers
for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Rockets' first five field goals of the half were
layups or dunks, the lone exception an Anderson jumper that would
become one of many. Francis would add a 16-footer to put the
Rockets ahead 78-58, and the Rockets would score on three more
dunks or layups before an Anderson trey produced a 27-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the winner of the dunk contest came on the next possession.
Anderson took a pass from Mobley in the corner and pump-faked, then
drove the baseline and threw down a stunning two-handed slam over
7-3 Clippers center Keith Closs.
</P>
<P>
   Closs fouled Anderson on the play, and Anderson completed the
three-point play, inspiring mad celebrations from Francis and
Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson finished with 16 points as every Rockets starter scored
in double figures for the first time since the season opener. Walt
Williams added 16 off the bench.

   NEW YORK _ ``Make it better,'' moaned Dianne Rosenfeld, a
30-something beauty salon entrepreneur, lying on a table in her
Upper East Side Manhattan apartment on a recent evening.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau she had downed with a friend
earlier that day had left her head pounding. Her body ached from
working out too much. She was getting over the flu. And she had had
a  &UR; very &LR;  intense day of shopping. She was in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   But such complaints are music to the ears of Michael Lepak, a
masseur who makes house calls.
</P>
<P>
   Lepak, 34, a quiet blond with a strapping physique, works the
late shift for Healing Hands, a Manhattan-based company that
dispatches its 50 massage therapists for everything from jet lag (
a massage while the client inhales beads of eucalyptus) to a
breakup (gentle touching and hours of listening). One of his
specialties is hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate student in social work by day at Fordham University,
Lepak moonlights five nights a week for $130 an hour, plus tip,
from about 4 p.m. on. He has been asked to cure headaches and
backaches, to help clients feel awake (peppermint scents) and to
help them fall asleep (lilac scents).
</P>
<P>
   He also gets the occasional 2 a.m. call from the Four Seasons
Hotel for someone who just flew into town and is suffering from jet
lag.
</P>
<P>
   Lepak arrived at Ms. Rosenfeld's at 8 p.m. with his green
leather massage table, multicolored oils and extra-supple hands. He
began setting up her apartment for the hangover cure by dimming the
lights, firing up the lilac candles, putting some New Age guitar on
the CD player and pouring oil over her body.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Rosenfeld's friend Harry Redlich, who was
visiting from Los Angeles, sat on the couch, sipping wine and
watching, claiming he had nothing better to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must get the toxins to flow out of your body,'' Lepak said
in a soft voice, as his patient lay limp on the table covered with
a towel and a black bikini brief. Kneading her left calf, he said:
``We must push around the blood and fluid. We must push all the
poison back into the liver and kidney, where it can be purified.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded good to Ms. Rosenfeld, whose usual hangover cure is
``getting a cheeseburger and fries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Lepak chided. ``After a hangover you must keep the
circulation moving. You must drink lots of water. Flush out the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just decadent New York life,'' pointed out Redlich, an
advertising writer. Indeed, what could be more decadent than having
someone ease your ``indulgence stress,'' as Ms. Rosenfeld called
it.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling her toes, Ms. Rosenfeld called out, ``My feet, my
feet!'' Lepak applied lotion to her soles and rubbed her arches.
Ms. Rosenfeld, who gets these treatments several times a month,
knows feet are the window to the throbbing head.
</P>
<P>
   Silently he moved from the calves to the neck, never losing his
focus, despite the chatter about Prada sales and the loud funk
music Redlich had turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lepak tapped his client on the back, signaling that she
was ready for her eucalyptus bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Michael draw the bath?'' Redlich asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Lepak said, already packing up his oils and table for
his next call. He had to meet a masseuse on the Upper West Side to
administer a double good-night massage to a husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30, he left Ms. Rosenfeld, who, after the two-hour
session, decided she felt revived enough to skip the bath and
instead go with her friend for dinner _ and more wine. ``I'll see
you again,'' Lepak called out, his table in tow.

   NEW YORK _ Paper magazine, the guide to downtown fashion and
night life, has always been a reliable index of what's next. So
when the magazine gave a book party to toast ``Abfab to Zen:
Paper's Guide to Pop Culture'' not long ago, it was notable that
the editors chose not a grungy club on Rivington Street but the
newly renovated Russian Tea Room. Guests mingled in the
eye-befuddling interior, decorated with mirrors, mosaics, a 15-foot
revolving see-through bear filled with live fish and a gold tree
laden with Faberge-inspired eggs. ``It was a bar mitzvah in Las
Vegas,'' said Kim Hastreiter, a co-editor of Paper, who is planning
an article for the March issue on the new vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Ms. Hastreiter has her finger on the pulse. At the
pivot point of the new century, ornamentation and frippery are the
style du jour. The creators of visual culture are like party
planners tossing confetti: fashion designers have been dousing
dresses in Swarovski crystals, artists have been coating canvases
in technicolor and glitter and architects have ushered in the new
age with buildings that seem to shimmy and swagger, inside as well
as out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural expression of Dow Jones fever,'' said Sally
Singer, fashion news director of Vogue. ``It's about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see in the turn toward decorative styles a reaction to
cold, technological computer culture; others see an upbeat response
to the longest period of peace and prosperity the West has known in
100 years. There is a parallel, often noted, to the last turn of
the century, in particular the Gilded Age and the fin de siecle
style of Vienna. At that time, an obsession with patterned facades,
coupled with overblown materialism, manifested both a desire for
sensual pleasure and spiritual distress or anxiety in the face of a
new age.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the preoccupation with ornament and splash today
reminds me of the Victorians, because of the common fondness for
excess, the grand gesture and ostentation,'' said Luc Sante, a
writer who has been studying the ties between today's architecture
and the Victorian period. ``Like them, we're having such a grand
tormented or imperial time. I have a feeling that a lot of today's
apparent confidence in the economy, the unbridled enthusiasm, is
actually people shaking in their boots. When the bottom falls out,
it will do that in a really big way. All of the extravagance right
now is an outward manifestation of denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Storr, a senior curator of painting and sculpture at the
Museum of Modern Art, said that for 20 years contemporary art has
been tending toward the baroque. He referred to Jorge Luis Borges'
definition of baroque as a stylistic endgame, when art recognizes
its near exhaustion. It caricatures its situation, flaunting and
squandering its resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what may be happening now,'' Storr said. ``It's all
gangbusters. Spend it while you got it, and spend it with style.
The bills aren't paid. The credit cards are maxed, but you look
great.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mid-1990s saw the reign of sober, minimalist uniforms on
fashion runways, now anything dark, monochromatic and tailored
looks like a throwback. For spring 2000, the cry for oomph is
crescendoing. Louis Vuitton is gleaming with gold, paillettes are
the new techno fabric at Prada, and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana offers
bejeweled micro-miniskirts. Stores will soon be swamped with exotic
skins like python and ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion insiders agree that decorative looks are a reaction to
the ``Gattaca aesthetic,'' as Hamish Bowles, Vogue's European
editor at large, called it, referring to both the 1997 movie about
the 21st century and the futuristic, sports-inspired clothes
popularized by Miuccia Prada and Helmut Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the '90s, people got bored with spare chic,
and fashion now has to do with an ironic take on overt luxury and
decoration and color,'' Bowles said, citing Alexander McQueen as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Fendi Baguette bag, which was introduced in
fall 1997 and helped set off the current craze for accessories, is
a case in point. Although the bags come in 100 varieties in fabrics
like cashmere and embroidered satin, each one is handmade. Once a
style sells out, it is not repeated. Prices range from $450 to
$6,000. Some Baguettes have a six-month waiting list, and the
hottest one for fall was a tapestry design, at $2,350.
</P>
<P>
   Even understated designers like Jil Sander and Giorgio Armani
are enthralled with prints these days. It hardly seems coincidental
that in the fall, the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology
mounted a retrospective of Bob Mackie, the titan of over-the-top.
</P>
<P>
   Some equate today's decorative styles with a newfound confidence
in being female. Valerie Steele, the museum's chief curator, said
women no longer feel the need to wear power suits to be taken
seriously, and men have accepted the fact that the opposite sex can
wear flowers and lace and still wield authority.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so sanguine. No less an observer than Silvia
Venturini, the designer of the Baguette bag, described the yen for
striking accessories in talismanic terms. The craze is ``an attempt
to ward off an unavoidable late-millennium anxiety,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as minimalist fashion is out today, in furniture and
interior design, cold, sleek surfaces are demode. Sensual, colorful
forms that incorporate the human touch, as well as luxurious
materials, are in. ``We're back to charm, character and comfort _
the three C's,'' said Marian McEvoy, editor in chief of Elle Decor.
``We all were in an aesthetic prison. Now, pleasure is a good
thing. It means more color. If you like oranges, go for it. Plush,
indulgent, sensual materials are going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As Murray Moss, the owner of the Moss design store in SoHo, put
it: ``Materials today appear more luxurious, reflective, strong,
shiny, man-made. We're now out of an idea that modern is minimal.
We want objects that speak to us. That means they look almost more
baroque.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the example of Gaetano Pesce, a designer who emerged in
the 60's and has experienced a resurgence. Moss carries a
collection of his furniture and objects made of resin, which is
poured into molds, each piece individual in its color scheme. Pesce
also incorporates accidents and irregularities into the designs.
``It is a humanization of the industrial process as opposed to
1930s assembly-line production,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Like fashion and design, contemporary art has taken a turn
toward the visually opulent. Matthew Barney, a multimedia artist
whose operatic films are ravishing to behold, has emerged as the
art star of the moment. Chris Ofili, whose festive canvases are
festooned with glitter, sequins and, yes, elephant dung (he is the
main catalyst of the controversy over the ``Sensation'' show at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art), won the Turner Prize in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Tomaselli, who has been making richly colored canvases with
arrangements of prescription pills, plants and insects beneath
layers of glossy resin since 1989, recently emerged from years of
critical neglect. In July his work was featured on the cover of Art
in America. ``I was considered some kind of crackpot'' at first,
Tomaselli said, adding: ``Serious art was supposed to look tough
and be hard to like and understand. The zeitgeist has changed.
There are a lot of artists who seem to be embracing pattern,
decoration and intense color. Everything from Claritin ads to Nest
magazine has a trippy, psychedelic quality.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, a concerne politics of identity gave
rise to a movement of angry, painful and cynical art. And long
before that, since the heyday of austere modern art, the pursuit of
the beautiful was maligned as superficial.
</P>
<P>
   But in reaction, Dave Hickey, a cultural critic and professor at
the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, published a series of
influential essays on beauty, beginning in 1991. He argued that
beauty is the agent of visual pleasure, and that pleasure ought to
be as important in art as any deeper meaning.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, in an exhibition titled
``Regarding Beauty,'' is re-examining modern art from the
perspective, once taboo, of visual pleasure. Even the American
Craft Museum, recognizing that beading is hot, has mounted
``Beadz!'' with new work by contemporary artists. Liza Lou, an
artist who painstakingly builds dazzling installations of domestic
scenes out of millions of glass beads _ a life-size kitchen, a
suburban backyard _ said the company in Prague that makes her beads
is reporting a shortage because demand is so strong.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Danto, a critic who wrote an essay for the ``Regarding
Beauty'' show at the Hirshhorn, said the art world's interest in
beauty was not merely a reflection of economic prosperity, which
seems to be driving fashion now. He called it primarily a reaction
to the politicized art of the early '90s, in particular the 1993
Whitney Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a gallery once felt like an experience in sensory
deprivation, but in the past month a walk through Chelsea _ vibrant
with lush, colorful, glistening art _ was like a stroll through
Arcadia. There were L.C. Armstrong's paintings of lilies and bird
of paradise at Postmasters gallery, Richmond Burton's abstract
pattern paintings in metallic colors at Cheim Reid, and Thomas
Woodruff's Victorian-style tableau paintings at Debs &AMP; Co. and, in
Soho, at P.P.O.W.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Varnedoe, the chief curator of painting and sculpture at
the Museum of Modern Art, said he was stunned to see work at the
latest Venice Biennale without social politics or sexual angst.
``Irony has been such an important part of art in the 20th
century,'' he said. ``It's been the armor. A lot of work that is
done now is more playful and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Varnedoe among those who find the new decorativeness a
sign of uncomplicated optimism. A decade ago, he noted, the Cold
War ended, bringing an end to potent international conflicts, and
there has been a lack of social unrest. Rapid technological change
has created a feeling of volatility that, he said, has made people
feel opportunistic rather than anxious. Even a fashion photographer
like David LaChapelle, who had his first show at the Tony Shafrazi
Gallery in June and is known for outrageous, shrilly colored images
that hover between the glamorous, the morbid and the deviant, said:
``Sincerity is really cool. Irony is just overdone now. I don't
feel jaded or mean about things.''
</P>
<P>
   His very espousal of sincerity, however, seems to come with a
wink and a nod. Many people would find in LaChapelle's surreal work
_ its saturated colors, its cartoonishly pumped-up men and women _
an ironic pose. A central question about all decorative chic is
whether any artist, after decades of ``less is more'' modernism,
can really embrace ornamentation for its own sake, without striking
a pose. Is the love of froufrou ever completely on the level, or is
it the latest hip recycling of a retro style?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the fashion designers Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley,
who scored a success in 1999 with their label Tuleh, a collection
of frilly cocktail dresses and sable stoles inspired by a fictional
muse _ a glamor puss who stepped from a 1950s fantasy of New
Orleans. The contemporary appetite for romantic, luxurious
clothing, Patner said, is ``a manifestation of exhilaration at the
end of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting thing to do,'' Bradley added, ``is wave
goodbye to the 20th century with sable-trimmed, fringed gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, if it isn't an ironic pose, comes awfully close.
</P>
<P>
   Shifts in fashion and art occur relatively quickly.
Architecture, which is meant to withstand the test of time, changes
more slowly. Yet it, too, is experiencing a flamboyant moment. The
Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao, Spain, by Frank Gehry, which opened in
1997 and is often cited as the most importaning of the late
20th century, feels and looks like the architectural equivalent of
a sequin dress. The titanium surface shimmers in the light; the
forms and spaces of the building appear to heave, cleave and sway.
Although the design was executed by computer, the museum bears none
of the cold, rational traces of the up-to-the-minute technology
that facilitated its fantasy style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been interested in expressing feelings in my work,''
Gehry said in an interview. ``That means you don't distill them
with rationalization. You solve the practical stuff but don't take
the juice out while you're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   One direction in architecture that Gehry's work is said to
inspire is an exuberant, adventuresome style. Martin Filler, the
architecture critic for The New Republic, pointed out that the
recent economic boom has created more options for architecture, and
since Bilbao, at least two daring building projects have been
approved. One is an extension to the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London by Daniel Libeskind, and the other is the Contemporary Art
Center in Cincinnati by Zaha Hadid.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Riley, the chief curator of architecture and design at
the Museum of Modern Art, agreed that the flamboyant style of the
Gehry project represents one reaction to millennial fever. But the
other is a refinement and reinvention of the traditional modernist,
minimal building. It does not translate into retro-looking
architecture. Instead, a new cityscape of sensual, translucent
structures, rather than cold, hard, transparent surfaces, has
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Riley cited the new LVMH Tower on East 57th
Street by Christian de Portzamparc, with its frosted glass and
giant faceted facade resembling quartz crystal. ``Transparency was
equated with truthfulness,'' Riley said. ``Architecture is now more
sensual and subjective, as opposed to objective truth.''
</P>
<P>
   From art to fashion to design to architecture, visual culture at
the turn of the millennium is spirited and seductive. People,
paintings and buildings all seem to be dressed up. Whether the
raiment has been put on in celebration or desperation is something
the new century will soon reveal.

 &HT;    UGA's 'scum doctor' scopes out biological cure to pollution
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Call him the scum doctor. He doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years, geologist Walter O'Niell has been
dipping his hands into tanks blanketed by mats of a primitive
blue-green algae, hoping to come up with a cost-efficient way of
cleaning up environmental problems and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Developed and patented by Clark Atlanta University biologist
Judy Bender and Peter Phillips, a biologist at Winthrop College,
the slimy microbial mat _ actually composed of several layers of
different kinds of bacteria _ is a living filter, absorbing
contaminants, heavy metals and organic pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   O'Niell's research for his doctorate from the University of
Georgia focused on whether the Bender-Phillips microbial mat could
absorb trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, solvents used in
many industrial processes. Two of the most common contaminants,
they eventually can break down into vinyl chloride, a known
carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   The mat, however, renders the chemicals harmless, breaking them
down to carbon dioxide without producing any detectable levels of
vinyl chloride. It could have applications outside as well as
inside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Niell had learned about Bender and her work from John Noakes,
a friend who directs the UGA Center for Isotope Studies, and knew
he wanted to use the mat in his Ph.D. work. Bender ``has been very
supportive, giving me samples of the mat and bacteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen what the mat can do to trichloroethylene and
tetrachloroethylene, O'Niell has moved on to other projects, like
determining if the Bender-Phillips mat will break down perchlorate,
a byproduct of rocket fuel that's found near missile manufacturing
sites throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   He's working with UGA geologist Valentine Nzengung to see if
willow trees and fresh-water algae can also break down
contaminants. And he'd like to obtain funding for a pilot project
in Bangladesh to learn whether the microbial mat can remedy the
rampant arsenic contamination of that country's wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much environmental pollution,'' O'Niell said. ``I
think we can solve a lot of problems using plants instead of
digging up soils and trying to clean them. Plus, it would be a lot
cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting companies, cities and the federal government to opt for
a biological and not a mechanical solution to contamination
problems isn't easy, said Bender. She and Phillips initially
developed the microbial mat to feed fish being farmed commercially
in the Dominican Republic and stumbled on its cleaning properties
accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Niell, 41, has been a geologist for most of his adult
life, he hasn't always worked in the environmental arena. He
searched for coal and offshore marine minerals before coming to
Athens with his wife, Dorothy O'Niell, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was thinking of leaving the Marine Minerals
Technology Center at the University of Mississippi, where he had
worked for six years as a geologist. He was on a prospecting
expedition off the Oregon coast when a flotilla of urchin
fisherman, coupled with the appearance of Greenpeace's Rainbow
Warrior, convinced him to change directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenpeace had put out some information about our project that
wasn't true, and these fishermen were all surrounding our boat, and
screaming,'' said O'Niell, a Louisiana native. ``We were on CNN _ a
woman from Greenpeace chained herself to our boat. I started
thinking, 'man, this isn't good, I should find a new field.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With a B.S. in geology from Nicholls State University in
Thibodaux, La., and a master's from Ole Miss, he wanted to move
into hydrogeology. While at Ole Miss, he had met Noakes, who
encouraged him to come to Georgia.

 &HT;    Make your own putty for perfect match
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the elevator going up to the newsroom the other day, a friend
asked me what kind of wood putty on the market would take a stain
so he could match it to the wood he was filling.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a while to come up with the answer, partially because
I'm old and partially because I was stuffed with lunch. I thought
and thought about wood putty, and finally realized I've never used
any.
</P>
<P>
   What you do, I finally told him, is make your own. It's easy
enough. Save your sanding dust, or, if you haven't saved any, make
some using a scrap piece of wood. Get a small can of good shellac
and cut it at least 50-50 with denatured alcohol. Put a little pile
of sanding dust on a piece of cardboard or a scrap of wood and,
using a little stick or something similar, transfer a few drops of
the cut shellac to the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use too much; you want a paste-like consistency after it's
thoroughly mixed. And there's your wood putty, a perfect match for
the piece you're working on. The stuff will dry very quickly, so
don't mix up more than you can use in a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A thread on the Internet brings to mind the subject of crosscut
sleds for the table saw, which I don't think we've discussed.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think there's a woodworking magazine out there that has
not, by now, published a couple of articles on how to make one of
these sleds. They are, as far as I'm concerned, an essential jig
for the table saw.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt this, take a plank of oak, or whatever you have
that's perhaps six feet long, eight-quarters thick and perhaps
eight inches wide. Dump this on the table, put your mitre gauge in
place and set up to cut a foot off of one end of the plank.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think there's a standard-issue miter gauge made that
will hold a piece of wood this big square to the blade. It will
inevitably flex, and I don't care how long a backstop you've
attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   The sled, if built right, will give you a square crosscut every
time because it is a sliding table; the workpiece is carried
through the blade, not shoved along the surface of the table.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow who started this thread made himself a sled but
discovers that he still isn't getting a square cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distance from the back left edge to the blade kerf is not
the same as the front left edge to the kerf. Is my tablesaw off?
Or, is my sled not squared up correctly?''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do here is to see if the blade is square to
the miter gauge slot. Get your miter gauge and verify with a
known-accurate square that the gauge is set at a true 90 degrees.
Put it in the slot, put long side of the square against the gauge
and set the short end of the square so that it just touches a tooth
on the forward edge of the blade.
</P>
<P>
   Mark the tooth with a piece of chalk or a crayon. Now rotate the
blade until the tooth is at the back. Keeping the square exactly in
position - use a gentle clamp if needed _ bring the gauge up to the
tooth in its new position. If it still just kisses the tooth, then
the table is square to the blade. If it doesn't, then the table is
misaligned.
</P>
<P>
   This is generally cured by loosening the table bolts and
oontzing it around until this test proves it's square.
</P>
<P>
   You don't know what oontzing is? Well, that's a whole other
field. If you can't guess, go ask a sailor.

   The audacious, the hyper-cerebral, the willfully perverse. The
challenging, provocative, offbeat and disturbing. The singular, the
recalcitrant, the idiosyncratic. These are the stubborn visionaries

erratic, occasionally awful, but they're rarely boring. Often
they're sublime. Listed in alphabetical order, these directors have
kept pictures exciting, and dangerous.

 &HT;    That's a wrap: The greatest 25 directors
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nowadays, when young directors are feted like
rock stars and people know exactly what ``A Film by Steven
Spielberg'' and ``An Oliver Stone Film'' means, the director's task
is more and more prone to proper scrutiny _ and respect.
</P>
<P>
   A savvy portion of the moviegoing masses is drawn to a movie
based on who was perched behind the camera calling the shots.
Quentin Tarantino's name guarantees edgy pop violence, Hitchcock's
epitomizes perverse suspense, John Waters' a carnival of crude.
</P>
<P>
   The more you can identify a director with a visual stamp and
thematic consistency, the more you're probably dealing with a
filmmaker with vision, an artist, an auteur. It's the hacks (Chris
Columbus, anyone?) who bore us numb.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a great director? A vast, consistently strong body of
work and a few masterpieces. Innovations in style and technique. A
steady vision. Saying something fresh and lasting in groundbreaking
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   To wrap the century in which movies grew up, we picked the
greatest 25 Hollywood directors ever to shape, enrich and elevate
the youngish medium.
</P>
<P>
   Not from cultural arrogance did we restrict the list to American
directors. Though France has been equally key in cultivating the
form and India has a bigger film industry, Hollywood makes the
movies the whole world sees.
</P>
<P>
   The selection team included me, Movies editor Jody Seaborn and
American-Statesman contributing film critic Alison Macor. We spent
much time thrashing out who would go where. We had brief disputes.
Alison, for example, wanted Hitchcock at the top. I thought
Spielberg should be higher. And during the writing of the list, as
the dust of debate settled, David Lean and William Wyler were
knocked down a few pegs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite active quibbles, we're comfortable with our conclusions.
These, we think, are the giants, the Shakespeares and Joyces of
celluloid, the guys (yes, at this point in film history they all
are men, and all are white) who breathed life into what fast became
the century's most vital and popular art form.
</P>
<P>
   1. John Ford
</P>
<P>
   The apotheosis of classical American film: pictorial grandeur;
vivid characters that blur into archetypes; sentimental notions of
land, family and community; supple, personal storytelling; and a
formal modesty that neatly suited his old-fangled values. If Ford
wasn't necessarily the greatest at all of these virtues _ Spielberg
has outdone him in sap-glazed nostalgia, Hitchcock and Welles had
keener eyes, Hawks was smarter _ he married them into potent
wholes. From the silent era on, he made more than 60 films, not all
of them the signature Westerns that mythologized John Wayne and
Monument Valley. Indeed, he won a record four Oscars for
non-Westerns, including ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and ``How Green Was
My Valley.'' It's easy to knock Ford for artistic faults that
fester with time. Though some make your teeth hurt with bathos and
bluster, his films are exemplary entertainments by an unadorned
master.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Stagecoach'' (1939), ``The Searchers'' (1956).
</P>
<P>
   2. Alfred Hitchcock
</P>
<P>
   With flash and devilish irony, Hitchcock demonstrated perhaps
the deepest understanding of the medium. It was for him an urgently
visual, not literary form. This bedrock ethos was his springboard
into amazing technical exuberance; he constantly exercised the
form. His utterly cinematic eye and obsession with our shadow side
conspired to forge some of film's most convincing and ecstatically
watchable thrillers. His influence incalculable, Hitch was film's
first pop genius.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Strangers on a Train'' (1951), ``Rear Window''
(1954).
</P>
<P>
   3. Orson Welles
</P>
<P>
   Some find Welles' movies chilly and stilted, emotionally static,
locked in self-conscious style. True, Welles' cerebral frost coated
much of his work. But those brains, hitched to a highly evolved
dramatic instinct and a thirst for revolution, led to some of the
greatest innovations in the young medium. ``Citizen Kane,'' which
he directed in 1941 at age 25, is a textbook of revelations, from
the vertiginous narrative structure and Gregg Toland's deep-focus
photography to Welles' haunting portrayal of a man much like
himself, a volatile blend of brains and bombast. Welles liberated
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Citizen Kane'' (1941), ``Touch of Evil'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   4. Howard Hawks
</P>
<P>
   A consummate American director whose unassuming style belied the
cool artistic mastery of his genre-jumping oeuvre. Using the camera
to tease out just enough visual information for a scene, Hawks put
the stamp of thematic persistence on every movie he made: manly
codes of honor, female empowerment, heroism in the line of duty and
the fizzy sparks between the sexes. His almost invisible touch had
a Midas effect with screwball comedies (``Bringing Up Baby''),
Westerns (``Red River''), noir (``The Big Sleep'') and musicals
(``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes''). He made many of the most enjoyable
films in Hollywood history.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``His Girl Friday'' (1940), ``To Have and Have Not''
(1944).
</P>
<P>
   5. Martin Scorsese
</P>
<P>
   The heedless passion of an artist sluices through Scorsese's
cinematic stunners, some of the most forceful movies in a
generation. He gets you with tough thematic integrity conveyed with
a firestorm of dazzling craft. The one-two combo of spiritual
fervor and visceral wallop is his trademark, and, despite some
missteps, he remains at once our most formidable sensualist and
moralist.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Taxi Driver'' (1976), ``Raging Bull'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   6. Billy Wilder
</P>
<P>
   As a director and writer (with writing partner Charles
Brackett), Wilder accrued a staggeringly consistent corpus that was
tough and acrid yet still regaled the masses (and the Academy). Far
too ironic to be the hidebound cynic he's so often accused of
being, the Viennese import was a worldly commentator on our darker
foibles. He did it just as deftly in melodrama (``The Lost
Weekend'') as in rip-roaring comedy (``The Apartment'').
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), ``Some Like It Hot''
(1959).
</P>
<P>
   7. Elia Kazan
</P>
<P>
   An illustrious theater rat (and, to casualties of McCarthyism, a
definitive rat), Kazan was as powerful a dramatist in Hollywood as
he was on Broadway. A long string of forceful dramas in the '40s
and '50s that entertained as they rattled postwar complacency
cements his station in the canon. And no other director wrested so
many revelatory performances from his actors, including a young
Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, James Dean, Karl Malden, Andy Griffith
and Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``On the Waterfront'' (1954), ``East of Eden''
(1955).
</P>
<P>
   8. George Cukor
</P>
<P>
   Cukor capitalized on his facility with ``women's pictures'' to
craft a bundle of sparkling masterworks (such as, aptly, ``The
Women''). A product of the theater, he worked beautifully within
the Hollywood studio system, zigzagging bubbly comedy (``Dinner at
Eight'') and melodrama (``Camille'') with refined grace and
burnished skill. In picture after picture, he made his starlets
shine: Jean Harlow, Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, Judy Garland,
Ingrid Bergman and, had he not been canned from ``Gone With the
Wind,'' Vivien Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``The Philadelphia Story'' (1940), ``A Star Is
Born'' (1954).
</P>
<P>
   9. D.W. Griffith
</P>
<P>
   If Welles was cinema's Picasso, Griffith was its Da Vinci. From
1908 to 1925, his filmic innovations _ multiple camera angles,
close-ups, crosscutting, parallel action, less theatrical acting _
fashioned a lasting visual vocabulary that shaped movies into an
art form. Griffith's Neanderthal notions of race (on repugnant
display in ``The Birth of a Nation'' and ``Broken Blossoms'')
tarnish his halo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Birth of a Nation'' (1915), ``Intolerance''
(1916).
</P>
<P>
   10. Stanley Kubrick
</P>
<P>
   With cold surgical precision, the cryptic Kubrick invoked
far-out worlds where humans were diminished by the menacing shadow
of technology and undermined by their own tragic intentions. His
grimly comic films were driven by a monastic intellectual rigor,
and the enigmatic results could confound audiences. His was a
demanding genius.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964), ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   11. Frank Capra
</P>
<P>
   His streamlined odes to the common man resonate even louder
today, when movies strain to uplift audiences by drowning them in
syrup. Capra was a populist and classical craftsman, who, by
filtering his stories through a hope-filled view tinged with dark
truths, made eminently satisfying art.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Miss: ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939), ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' (1946).
</P>
<P>
   12. Robert Altman
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's bumptious party-crasher brought an ensemble of
yakking friends to the fold and ousted staid storytelling forms
with contained chaos. With what-the-hell gusto _ the crazy
mise-en-scene, the overlapping gab, loose-limbed structure _ Altman
brought documentary naturalism to his pungent satires and pulled
the carpet from under the war, Western and noir genres (``MASH,''
``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' ``The Long Goodbye'').

<P>
   Don't miss: ``MASH'' (1970), ``Nashville'' (1975).

<P>
   13. Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   The '70s wunderkind seemed born with full-blown storytelling
chops and technical know-how. Now a billion-dollar mogul,
Spielberg's sensibilities are stuck in pre-adolescence. His best
films emit the intoxicating mists of boyish wonder. They make kids
out of all of us and rank with the century's best entertainment.
Lately Spielberg's strained to make grown-up films (``Amistad,''
``Saving Private Ryan''), but they're saddled by the boy's naivete
and a chronic incapacity for analytical thought. In them, he's
reduced to a superlative technician.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Jaws'' (1975), ``E.T.: The Extraterrestrial''
(1982).
</P>
<P>
   14. Ernst Lubitsch
</P>
<P>
   The German transplant suffused his romantic comedies with
European class and cosmopolitan wit, a Noel Coward-ish flavor
dubbed the ``Lubitsch Touch.'' Sophistication, sly sexuality and
subtle expressiveness were the hallmarks of Lubitsch's incisive
probes into love and manners. Gracefully funny, he even made Garbo
bust out in laughter. Every romantic comedy since is indebted to
the maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Ninotchka'' (1939), ``The Shop Around the Corner''
(1940).
</P>
<P>
   15. Woody Allen
</P>
<P>
   Owing as much to brooding Swede Ingmar Bergman as to Charlie
Chaplin and Bob Hope, writer-director Allen is a master melder of
uproarious comedy and romantic distress, sprinkled with existential
reverie. Few strike all the keys _ funny bone, heart and head _
with such precision. And no one charts the aggrieved heart with
such bittersweet candor. His deeply personal films (30-plus) form
an unbroken chronicle of obsession, angst and emotional discord.
Despite a spate of slapdash work in the past decade, he remains
America's most dogged auteur.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Annie Hall'' (1977), ``Manhattan'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   16. John Huston
</P>
<P>
   The manly-man as artist, a la Hemingway, Huston channeled his
high-wire virility into a resonant array of pulp and art. Full of
swagger, spit and booze, it's no wonder the writer-director
excelled at gangster flicks and adventure epics. He worked with the
best _ Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, Edward G. Robinson, Sean
Connery _ rarely eliciting a bum performance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``The Maltese Falcon'' (1941), ``The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre'' (1948).
</P>
<P>
   17. Francis Ford Coppola
</P>
<P>
   His reckless lack of discipline _ some call it genius _ may
finally unravel this giant of the Hollywood New Wave, but it can't
sabotage the masterpieces he wrought in the 1970s: ``The
Godfather'' (1972), ``The Godfather, Part II'' (1974), ``The
Conversation'' (1974) and ``Apocalypse Now'' (1979). These are
prickly interrogations of the American experience, whose collective
importance _ and extreme entertainment zing _ echoes on. Coppola's
been adrift this decade, excreting tripe like ``Bram Stoker's
Dracula'' and ``Jack.'' We worry.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: See above '70s titles.
</P>
<P>
   18. Vincente Minnelli
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for his quintessential musicals (from ``Meet Me in St.
Louis'' to ``Gigi''), Minnelli actually made more nonmusicals.
Topically restless, he was comfortable and supremely efficient in
comedy (``Father of the Bride''), sweeping drama (``Lust for
Life'') and heart-curdling romance (``The Clock''). His dreamily
roving camera was emblematic of a ranging mind.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``An American in Paris'' (1951), ``The Bad and the
Beautiful'' (1953).
</P>
<P>
   19. Preston Sturges
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. filmmaker to earn the ``Written and directed by''
credit, Sturges had tight reign on his biting comedic vision _ a
quirky, sophisticated stance that engendered a batch of the 1940s'
funniest comedies. An American born of privilege and raised in
Europe, Sturges satirized the idle rich, Hollywood, heroes and
social mores in all their absurdities. He had visual flair, too;
check out, among other tricks, the surreal title sequence in ``The
Palm Beach Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``The Lady Eve'' (1941), ``Sullivan's Travels''
(1941).
</P>
<P>
   20. William Wyler
</P>
<P>
   Wyler was a towering craftsman and quiet stylist who worked
prolifically within the studio system. No wild-eyed visionary
bursting with grand pronouncements, Wyler nevertheless produced a
rock-solid body of tonic entertainment: ``Wuthering Heights,''
``Mrs. Miniver,'' ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' ``Roman
Holiday,'' ``Ben-Hur.'' If the three-time Oscar winner had a fabled
foible, it was that he was a grinding perfectionist whose nickname
was ``90-take Wyler.'' The meticulous care showed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``The Letter'' (1940), ``Detective Story'' (1951),
any of the above.
</P>
<P>
   21. Nicholas Ray
</P>
<P>
   Ray's odes to misunderstood outsiders throb with the angry pain
of alienation. Himself a Hollywood misfit, Ray's patchy track
record boasted a handful of morose masterworks, in which tortured
loners seek grim salvation: ``They Live By Night,'' ``In a Lonely
Place,'' ``The Lusty Men'' and, of course, ``Rebel Without a
Cause.'' Ray was belatedly exalted by the French auteurists, who
lionized his romantic nihilism. They also thought he made some
pretty good pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: The above titles, ``Johnny Guitar'' (1954).
</P>
<P>
   22. Buster Keaton
</P>
<P>
   He turned the pratfall into a dust-spraying thud of genius. The
silent-comedy virtuoso bounced about the confines of the screen-box
like a rubber ball, always trying to smash out of film's imposed
boundaries. Keaton succeeded, obliterating the fourthwall. Always
the hapless hero, Keaton's unflappable face played sharp
counterpoint to his body's kineticism, achieving a stoic lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Sherlock Jr.'' (1924), ``The General'' (1927).
</P>
<P>
   23. David Lean
</P>
<P>
   He's been criticized for doting on pretty pictures and shirking
substance, but Lean's best pictures _ ``Brief Encounter,'' ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' _ dilute the charges. Sure, he's a
virtuoso technician. But he had a keen eye that bore into the
psychological essence of a scene. He knew what to do with all those
pretty pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``Oliver Twist'' (1951), ``The Bridge on the River
Kwai'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   24. Sam Peckinpah
</P>
<P>
   A hard-boozing maverick to the bitter end, ``Bloody Sam''
upended the Western, stripping it of gauzy romanticism and dunking
it in blood. With blunt savagery, he forever changed the way we see
screen violence and imposed a troubling moral ambiguity on the
action genre that's still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``The Wild Bunch'' (1969), ``Straw Dogs'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   25. Charlie Chaplin
</P>
<P>
   It's fashionable to knock Chaplin the director, especially in
light of his clunky late work, testaments to a bitter refusal to
embrace film's rapid technological progress (including, in some
cases, the pesky development of sound). Yet the dour clown
introduced a new emotional idom in his bittersweet comedies. Pathos
and laughs meshed, sometimes with a maudlin clang, amid flurries of
comic invention. The iconic power of Chaplin's Little Tramp hasn't
dimmed a whit.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss: ``The Kid'' (1921), ``City Lights'' (1931).

 &HT;    What `Man on the Moon' needs: Aliens
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you were wondering, ``Man on the Moon'' is not, as the
title implies, a lunar action thriller with morphing men on the
moon trying to vaporize brave astronauts in the form of Keanu
Reeves and Bruce Willis. Instead, it is a mildly funny film about
the comedian/artiste/freak Andy Kaufman as played by Jim ``Can I
have the Oscar for this one?'' Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is effectless _ unless you count the flying Santa
sleigh and the singing puppet. There is a small attempt at makeup
effects when Kaufman finds a cancer cyst on his back, but it's
hardly applaudable (and kind of a bummer). And Courtney ``Nose
Job'' Love as Kaufman's love interest is _ and, believe me, this is
hard to say _ worse than Denise Richards in ``The World is Not
Enough.'' Unlike Richards, Love didn't have the benefit of things
blowing up behind her to take our minds off her horrible acting. In
fact, Love's wooden acting was so bad that it, in itself, was a
special effect begging the question: Beneath the rhinoplastered
exterior is Courtney Love real or an android?
</P>
<P>
   I know this was supposed to be biographical and no one asked me,
but I have a couple of suggestions that would have made this movie
better. For one, you could have improved ``Man on the Moon''
immensely by making Jim Carrey an alien. Not some tripped-out,
big-toothed Alien alien, but a friendly, funny alien capable of
computer-generated gags like turning himself into a rocket, a car
or a vending machine. Next, I would have given Carrey a
nemesis/love interest. Maybe it could be a big reptile that shoots
lasers out of his eyes. In keeping with the comedic attempts made
by the film, I would name him Lenny the Lizard and have his lasers
not work all the time (sometimes his eyes only produce flowers or
chocolate milk, instead of total destruction). This way, Andy
Kaufman's story could be funny, poignant and touching; a real
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   If the filmmaker had just followed my advice, it would have
given ``Man on the Moon'' a better chance at more heralded reels
and, most importantly, kept me awake.

 &HT;    YELTSIN RESIGNS UNEXPECTEDLY, TURNS OVER REINS TO PRIME MINISTER
PUTIN
 &HT;    (1100&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-PUTIN-0101; YELTSIN-LEGACY-0101.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin, who climbed atop a tank to
help usher democracy into Russia, stepped down unexpectedly Friday,
apologizing for failing to transform his nation into a ``rich,
civilized country.''
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional, nationally televised address, the 68-year-old
Yeltsin bid farewell to his countrymen after eight years in power,
during which economic crises, corruption charges and ill health
have tarnished his image as a freedom fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians should enter the new millennium with new politicians,
new people who are clever, energetic and strong, while we, who have
been in power for many years, should rather go,'' he said, his
voice choking back emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian Constitution, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
the country's most popular politician, becomes acting president,
and new elections must be held within three months. Yeltsin tapped
Putin as his preferred successor when the 47-year-old former KGB
official became the fifth prime minister in 17 months in early
September.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters looking on in the wood-paneled president's office
in the Kremlin, Yeltsin passed a black briefcase to Putin
containing the codes for Russia's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Putin granted Yeltsin immunity from prosecution, a
development some analysts believe could have motivated the
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's two daughters, his son-in-law, and at least 60 other
current and former Kremlin aides are reportedly under investigation
for corruption and bribery charges in separate cases by Swiss and
Italian prosecutors, as well as a money-laundering investigation by
U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is a real political animal. He has been anxious about
his family,'' said Andrei Zudin, the director of political research
at Moscow's Center for Political Technologies, a think tank.
``Putin is a great surprise for him. He's proven he's a winner ...
popular and loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's resignation was unexpected but not surprising. Rumors
have circulated in Moscow for months that the ailing silver-maned
politician would step down _ if he did not die first. Yeltsin had
quintuple heart bypass surgery three years ago, and has repeatedly
been hospitalized for pneumonia and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He had turned over day-to-day rule of the world's second largest
nuclear power to Putin, including leading the Russian military
assault against Muslim separatists in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya _ the main reason why the prime minister skyrocketed from
an unknown bureaucrat to become Russia's most visible and popular
public figure.
</P>
<P>
   Russians busily preparing for New Year's Eve, traditionally
their biggest holiday of the year, reacted calmly and with relief
to Yeltsin's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best present I could have asked for,'' said Nadia
Gorobaya, a 19-year-old student rushing around the capital for last
minute holiday purchases. ``He should have done this sooner. He's a
disgrace as a leader ... he hasn't brought us democracy. In fact,
he's brought us almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yeltsin, in his speech acknowledged mistakes and asked
several times for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg your forgiveness for having failed to jump in one leap
from the gray, stagnant, totalitarian past to the clear, rich and
civilized future,'' he said. ``I want to beg forgiveness for your
dreams that never came true. I am leaving. I've done what I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the threat of prosecution for corruption, others said
the timing of Yeltsin's action had more to do with the war raging
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has waged a three-month campaign there against Chechen
rebels, a war the Kremlin has called a fight against Islamic
bandits and terrorists. Russia's military has relentlessly bombed
factories, hospitals and television stations, along with civilian
homes in the southern republic, forcing more than 20,000 people to
flee to neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30,000 people died in the first Chechen war from 1994
to 1996, many of whom were civilians and conscript Russian
soldiers. The death toll turned public opinion in Russia against
the offensive. This time around, however, casualties are minimal
and a majority of Russians back the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Russian army has focused its efforts on
taking control of the Chechen capital Grozny, but has stalled after
meeting heavy resistance from what is reported to be a small pack
of rebels entrenched in the city. The bulk of the rebel fighting
force is thought to have retreated to mountain hideaways to wait
out the frigid winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's popularity depends on a successful war,'' says Yevgeny
Volk, the director of the Moscow office of the Heritage Foundation.
``Extending the war means extending the chances of Russian soldiers
coming home in body bags. No politician wants that.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians on Dec. 19 voted for a new parliament, handing a
surprising victory to the pro-Kremlin Unity Party that Putin backs.
With this strong showing and the subsequent backing of other
smaller political parties, Putin is the undisputed favorite to win
the presidential race. Those elections had been scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin has shortened the electoral campaign period down to
three months from six months,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, a Moscow
political analyst. ``For three months they can keep up this story
of success in Chechnya. In six months, that would no longer be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin met with the Russian Cabinet soon after Yeltsin's
announcement, saying he would not make any serious changes to
domestic or foreign policy in the three months he would effectively
run the government. Itar-Tass news agency reported that elections
would tentatively take place on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing must change in our work. Russia's foreign policy will
not change,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton praised Yeltsin for putting a
democratic structure in place in Russia. ``We have had our
differences ... but President Yeltsin and my starting point has
always been how Russia and the United States could work together to
advance common interests,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this spirit, I look forward to working with Acting
President Putin as the Russian people begin this process of making
the transition from one democratically elected president to the
other,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has invested much time and money into
its relationship with Yeltsin and his multiple governments,
portraying the occasionally impetuous Russian as the best
personification of democratic ideals and economic market reforms.
Yeltsin's nationalistic blustering and current corruption
allegations have been an embarrassment to both Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with high-profile disagreements over Kosovo and
Chechnya, U.S.-Russian relations have dropped to their lowest point
since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts feel a Putin presidency would be a good
development for bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a strong and wise man, one that is not a typical
leader in the Russian mold,'' said Zudin, of the Center for
Political Technologies. ``He served in the intelligence branches
that collected information about the West. He, unlike others, has
ingested this knowledge and knows how other countries work, and
approves.''
</P>
<P>
   If a single image marked Yeltsin's mercurial political career,
it was clambering atop a T-72 tank in 1991 to defend the government
of then-President Mikhail Gorbachev against a coup attempt by
Soviet legislators unhappy with reform. Two years later, Yeltsin,
now president, would put down another attempt to topple the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the leader has become more the butt of
jokes than the admired democrat, with approval ratings in the
single digits. Yeltsin, the the first democratically elected
president in Russia's history, has been worried about how history
would remember him, according to former high-ranking aides. .
</P>
<P>
   On the day he announced his resignation, however, many Russians
were generous in their assessment of his era.
</P>
<P>
   ``An epoch is over, said Nadezhda, a 43-year-old municipal
worker, who refused to give her last name. ``Good or bad he was a
strong leader. We felt safe behind his back.''

   DOCTORS-CALLBACKS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ As a family practitioner,
Dr. Doris Robitaille knows how frustrating it can be when
technology turns on its users. Last fall, she futilely attempted to
return a page from parents whose boy had smashed his head on a
coffee table, only to be told her call could not go through. The
culprit was a commonly used phone service that automatically
rejects calls from callers who have requested that their numbers
remain anonymous. Like most doctors, Robitaille has an unlisted

repeatedly thwarted her efforts and those of other doctors to
return patients' calls. (Thatcher, Austin American-Statesman)

 &HT;    YELTSIN LEAVES A MIXED LEGACY FROM EIGHT CHAOTIC YEARS IN POWER
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-YELTSIN-0101.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES, JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin, who flirted with greatness in leading
his country out of the communist wilderness, leaves a mixed legacy
from his eight tumultuous years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The snowy-haired Yeltsin helped topple the Soviet Union and went
on to become the first popularly elected leader in 1,000 years of
Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he ended his career in frustration and sad irony.
</P>
<P>
   Ailing and at times politically irrelevant in his last years in
office, Yeltsin was unable to fully transform Russia into a
workable democracy. The country he left behind continues a painful,
lurching transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Federation, which Yeltsin created in 1991 from the
rubble of Mikhail Gorbachev's disintegrating Soviet Union, enjoys
more social freedoms and economic diversity. His pinnacle moment
came when he stood down a coup attempt against Gorbachev by
climbing atop a tank and rallying democratic forces, an appearance
that former British Prime Minister John Major would call ``sheer
raw courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin wrought huge change, but did not complete the conversion
or achieve what he said were his greatest goals: to bring Russia
tranquility and widespread prosperity. The former superpower
continues to struggle to feed and care for its people, and cope
with wild ``bandit'' capitalism and deep government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 68-year-old Yeltsin acknowledged in his resignation
speech Friday that he had failed to solve many of Russia's most
vexing problems. ``I've done what I could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was a colorful figure who rose to prominence as a friend
to the common man. In his prime, he was bigger than life,ting an image of a fearless, benevolent leader who could swig
a glass of Russia's cherished vodka, dictate domestic policy and
maintain Russia's prominence on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to keep his new country from tumbling into civil war,
Yeltsin twice unleashed internal violence on a scale unseen since
the days of Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most memorable images of his eight-year Kremlin rule
are Russian tanks blitzing the Russian parliament building in
October 1993 and Yeltsin's forces laying waste to Grozny, the
capital of upstart Chechnya republic on Russia's southern flank in
a botched, unpopular 1994-96 war. A new war against Muslim
separatists in Chechnya continues today.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Yeltsin said force was necessary to keep the
country united. His reputation never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Indelible, too, are more recent scenes of a frail, sick man
clinging to his presidency from his plush country houses while his
threadbare country suffered under severe economic depression. He
underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He fired the entire government several times, often for little
apparent reason, and damaged his democratic credentials by
resorting to force to solve political disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's hopes of disbanding the ``socialist command economy''
at home met with only limited success.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sweeping decrees in favor of private ownership,
nearly all farmland is tilled by Soviet-style collective farms as
Yeltsin has not pushed land ownership laws through parliament. The
economy remains a confusing, chaotic hybrid, with 70 percent of
factories privatized. But many mega-enterprises, including the gas
industry, remain as state-controlled monopolies. Under his
stewardship, Russia's gross domestic product plunged and the buying
power of ordinary Russians faded under periodic bouts of runaway
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Yeltsin has became more and more insular. He has
suffered ``acute loneliness'' in ruling the nation, he confessed in
his 1994 autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   At times he turned to alcohol for solace, appearing tipsy at
public events or behaving erratically. One of the most embarrassing
episodes was a September 1994 refueling stop in Ireland, when
Yeltsin simply failed to leave his airplane to acknowledge the
welcoming troops and dignitaries turned out on the tarmac,
including the country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   With all his imperfections, Yeltsin was embraced by American and
other Western leaders as the best hope to make democracy and free
enterprise work in Russia, the nuclear-armed behemoth where
communists and ultranationalists still draw significant followings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite profound problems at home, he managed to maintain
Russia's role as a major player on the world stage, asserting
diplomatic influence on the world's two hot spots of the last
decade, Iraq and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Among Yeltsin's world-changing achievements was signing the 1991
Byelovezhskaya agreement that shattered the old Soviet empire by
making Russia, Ukraine and Belarus independent countries.

INVESTOR SHOULDN'T GIVE UP ON BOND HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 2, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have invested in Vanguard's Index 500 fund through a
dollar-cost-averaging program and am pleased to see its value
continue to rise after buying on the dips. Unfortunately, over
three years ago I also decided to invest some traditional IRA
savings in the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund. I bought over
800 shares at $9.89 per share in 1996. Today, the same shares are
valued at $9.67 per share. Although I've received income dividends
monthly that have increased my account to more than 1,000 shares,
the total value of the account is now worth approximately what I
paid back in 96. Not a good way to save for retirement! Splitting
assets between stocks and bonds has not proven a good idea, based
on the market's performance over the past few years. So much for a
conservative outlook and following advisers' suggestions to split
retirement savings between proven stock and bond index funds from a
reputable company such as Vanguard. Since I do not intend to
withdraw any of these IRA funds for more than 10 years, should I
hold on to my Vanguard Total Bond Market Index position, or reduce
my losses and switch to the proven Index 500?
</P>
<P>
   S.A., Chula Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you should reexamine your IRA statements on the Total
Bond Market holding, since it is statistically impossible for your
account to have remained stagnant from 1996 to now, unless you
withdrew some funds. Certainly it has come nowhere near the
performance of Index 500, but its three-year record shows average
annual total returns of 5.49 percent. Its total returns in 1996
were 3.6 percent, followed by 9.4 percent in 1997, 8.6 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Like most bond funds, it is in the red this year, but it shows a
year-to-date loss of only .83 percent as this is written.
</P>
<P>
   Second, its unfair to disregard the idea of diversification
among asset classes such as stocks and bonds based on a three- or
four-year period which represents an almost unprecedented bull
market on the stock side. Over many years you will discover that
the thinking that's behind recommendations of allocating a
portfolio among stocks and bonds is solid: in some markets the
bonds will outperform the stocks, and in many markets the bonds
will deliver steady, if unspectacular, returns, such as during the
years from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Only occasionally will the bond holdings go into the red, such
as this year, and when they do, they do not tend to go very far
into the red. Moreover, if the historical record is any indicator,
if bond funds have a bad year or two, they tend to recoup the lost
ground fairly quickly; look at the 1994 loss of 2.66 percent for
this fund, followed by its 18.18 percent recovery in 1995. Perhaps
you were looking at that 18.18 percent return when you first bought
into the fund. If so, you had unrealistic expectations. A much
better measure to set your expectations upon is a bond funds
10-year average annual return.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is currently 7.67 percent for this fund.
</P>
<P>
   So I recommend you stick with the strategy you embarked upon.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering your Index 500 position with the Total Bond Market
holdings reduces risk, and should give your portfolio some measure
of resilience when the stock market stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, what you describe as a dollar-cost-averaging program
with your Index 500 holdings sounds more like market timing to me.
A dollar cost investor sets a schedule for additions to his or her
portfolio, with a set amount of new money going into the account at
a specified date, whether it be monthly, quarterly, or even over a
longer period. These investments are made regardless of the state
of the market. If you are buying on the dips you are trying to time
the market, betting that you can foresee what is the bottom of a
dip.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, studies have shown, dollar-cost-averaging
tends to work better, since if a market timing investor only misses
the targets slightly, the effect is to significantly reduce
returns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have $167,000 invested in mutual funds, a $6,000 IRA,
$30,000 in bank savings, and $20,000 in CDs. The mutual funds
consist of $74,000 in Putnam Fund for Growth and Income, $20,000 in
Putnam Diversified Income, $10,000 in Putnam Voyager, $17,000 in
Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunity (Class T), $30,000 in MFS Total
Return, $12,000 in MFS Emerging Growth, and $4,000 in Colonial
High-Yield Securities. I add $500 a month to the Putnam Growth and
Income account and $200 a month to MFS Total Return fund. I am 67,
retired, widowed, and have no debt. I own my home and have income
of $60,000 from my pension and investments. Is my distribution
correct?
</P>
<P>
   P.N., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I estimate that you are holding about 55 percent of your
portfolio in stocks, with that number likely to steadily (if
slowly) advance based on your pattern of reinvestments. Many
investors of your age would consider that a high level, but it's
not necessarily high for you.
</P>
<P>
   After all, since you are able to save 14 percent of your income
in retirement, its clear that you are sufficiently well heeled that
you can afford a higher stock-market position than many others can.
</P>
<P>
   Although your diversification could be better, I dont suggest
you sell any of your current positions, but rather that you look to
some new funds as the vehicles for the $500 a month now going into
the dominant position in Putnam Fund for Growth and Income.
</P>
<P>
   Three solid prospects I suggest are Putnam International Growth
and Income, Putnam Health Sciences, and Putnam Vista. Each of these
would give you some participation in market segments you are
currently ignoring -- international markets, health care, and
mid-cap growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am single, 44 years old, and earn $90,000 per year. I
contribute the $10,500 maximum a year to my 403(b) plan. I own my
own home with about $30,000 equity in it. I expect Social Security
of $14,900 a year at age 62, and a company pension of $20,500 at
age 65. My assets consist of $343,238, mostly in tax-deferred
accounts and mostly invested in stock funds. My question is, how
long must I continue working at my current earnings level before I
can retire? My expenses in retirement will be in the area of
$40,000 to $45,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   M.M., Tyngsborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems to me that you'd be in a fairly comfortable
situation if you set a retirement target in 10 years. Let's begin
with what you'll need in retirement. If we take the midpoint in
your estimated range -- $42,500 -- and adjust it for a presumed 3.5
percent average annual inflation rate, you will need $59,950 a year
to buy what $42,500 now buys.
</P>
<P>
   If we presume an 8 percent average growth rate from your taxable
investments, which are the more conservative, and a 10 percent
average rate from the tax-favored accounts, you would have $324,708
and $781,654 respectively on the two sides of the portfolio, or a
total of $1,106,352. The taxable accounts would be sufficient to
provide your income stream until age 59 1/2 when the tax-favored
accounts become available. By that time, presuming you moved to a
more conservative portfolio in the tax-favored accounts and
achieved only 8 percent growth there, those accounts would be worth
$1,194,274.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively small amount left over from your taxable accounts
at that stage -- $65,684 -- would bring your total savings at age
65 1/2 to $1,259,958. Especially given your anticipated Social
Security and pension incomes coming up within the next six years,
that would be more than sufficient to maintain the same buying
power after adjusting for inflation, as well as to generate
portfolio growth to protect you against inflation in the later
years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Could you retire earlier? Probably yes, but the earlier you
retire the more you will need to have in excess of the money that
is used to generate your income stream, in order to deal with the
inflation in the many years you can anticipate spending in
retirement. So you could probably retire in eight years, but in my
opinion you would be cutting it too close.
</P>
<P>
   Those last two years would give you a considerable margin of
comfort, and that's where I would set the target.

 &HT;    With Hurricanes ahead, Tech's Hamilton isn't looking back
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla _ On the eve of a new year, and the end of his
college football career, the most celebrated Georgia Tech player in
generations would not allow himself to look back.
</P>
<P>
   Reflections would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' Joe Hamilton said Friday. ``I'm solely thinking
about (playing) Miami and the Gator Bowl tomorrow. Any time you
play your last game, you want to go out a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the outcome of No. 17 Georgia Tech's match against No.
23 Miami (8-4) at Alltell Stadium, the fact that Joe Hamilton is a
winner has been firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   In the four seasons before Hamilton took over at quarterback,
the Yellow Jackets were a measly 17-27, and far removed from
national acclaim. Since then, Tech has gone 30-16, has remained in
the Top 25 in the past 26 polls, rising as high as No. 9 at the end
of last season when the Jackets beat Notre Dame here to finish
10-2.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Hamilton has set 13 school records, earned
consensus All-America status and was runner-up in the Heisman
Trophy voting. Yet, when asked this week what the highlight of his
career has been, Hamilton did glimpse back and a broad smile spread
across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, it has to be beating the Georgia Bulldogs two
years in a row,'' he said, ``because that means more to the
program, and Tech fans, than any individual honors.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hamilton said, it's time to add another notch.
</P>
<P>
   But knocking off the favored Hurricanes will be no small feat.
Miami presents Tech with its biggest challenge since the second
week of the season, when the Jackets pushed No. 1-ranked Florida
State on the road but fell 41-35.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are No. 11 in the nation in pass efficiency
defense, 12th in scoring defense (17.3 ppg.) and 16th in total
defense (301.7 ypg.).
</P>
<P>
   And that's just on one side of the ball. Miami is on the hottest
scoring streak in its history, pounding the past three foes 155-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a great, great deal of respect for Butch
Davis'', Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``Watching film, the one
thing that really shows up is the toughness their team plays with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job with Miami's program, taking it from
where it was to where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davis was named 'Canes coach five years ago, the program _
which has won four national championships _ was saddled with
probation and hampered by NCAA-imposed recruiting sanctions. Now,
Miami is back on the New Year's Day stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past five years have been the toughest five years, but the
best,'' senior guard Richard Mercier said. ``What doesn't kill you
will make you stronger, and we survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've weathered the biggest storm any team could have.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's another one brewing, as Tech leads the nation in
offense, and hasn't really been stopped all season. There is no way
the Hurricanes will underestimate the Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically we have one mutual foe each of us don't like
much,'' Davis said, alluding to an FSU team which beat the 'Canes
31-21. ``Watching that film, it didn't take long to open our
players' eyes about how good Georgia Tech is.''

 &HT;    Alabama seeks bowl win to cap off turnaround season
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Mike DuBose went to bed early Friday night, which is not
to say he went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't stayed up till midnight on New Year's Eve in at
least 15 years,'' the Alabama coach said the day before. ``I'll
probably start out the night thinking I'll stay up that late,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have tried a little harder, just to make it last, as a
season like this one doesn't come by too often. But having turned
around one of the most catastrophic periods in its football
history, the Crimson Tide's next trick comes tonight, when No. 5
Alabama faces No. 8 Michigan in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Making its 50th bowl appearance but its first at the Orange in
25 years, the Tide (10-2) can tie a big red bod a season
that began in ignominy _ DuBose's extramarital hijinks and a loss
to Louisiana Tech. Now riding a five-game win streak including a
27-point throttling of Florida in the SEC Championship, the Tide
can reach 11 wins for the first time in five years but for the
fourth time in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up short of winning the national championship, which
is always a goal,'' wide receiver Freddie Milions said. ``But
everything else we've gotten, there couldn't be anything better.
This game will be something to dwell on when we start out next
season against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to peak. We feel like we have one more big
game in us and we're going to unleash everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is expected to play without Outland Trophy winner Chris
Samuels (left knee), which makes running tack Shaun Alexander's
final game a little more interesting. Samuels was vital in leading
Alexander to his 15 school rushing records and the SEC player of
the year award.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not really Alexander who turned the season for the
Tide. It was a defense that went from one of the poorest in the
conference at midseason to No. 9 (total defense) in the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense always gets the glory but it doesn't bother us,''
said Tide defensive tackle Cornelius Griffin. ``At Alabama, it all
comes down to team. We got off to a slow start but as time went on,
we got better with reach game.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the first seven games, the Tide yielded an average of 107.7
rushing yards. In its last five games, it has given up just 140 on
the ground. Pass defense improvement has been more dramatic.
Alabama recorded only four interceptions over the first eight games
but has intercepted 12 times in the last four games, including four
against Florida in the SEC title game.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes critical against a Michigan team that has nearly
abandoned the run this season and let a quarterback tandem of Tom
Brady and Drew Henson throw 35 times a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into that rhythm of playing good teams,'' said
Michigan fullback Aaron Shea, ``and when you get down here and face
a great team like Alabama, it's no shock.''

 &HT;    Once upon a life . . .
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Not long ago I bought my mother a tape recorder, a
remote controlled microphone and some blank tapes and urged her to
record the stories of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Born-Depression Texas, she now has entered a prosperous
new century and a new millennium. I know she has some good stories.
</P>
<P>
   My father also must have had some good stories. I wish I had
asked him to record his stories. He would have turned me down.
Still, I wish I had asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to know my stories,'' he would have said.
That would have been the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Mother might do it. She's self-conscious about talking into the
tape recorder. But she understands the importance of recording
family history.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for several years with my brother verifying family
records in preparation for her admission to the Daughters of the
American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Stories are the most interesting parts of a family history.
Names and dates of marriages, births and deaths are fairly flat
without the flavoring of stories.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's a relative on my mother's side of the
family who would be just a name on a page had not a story survived
about how he eloquently argued himself into prison.
</P>
<P>
   The man was a judge during the Civil War. He supported the
South. One day he gave a speech on the courthouse lawn arguing why
it was every man's responsibility to join up to help repel the
northern aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge paused in his speech to gauge the crowd's
reaction to his argument, a man in the back of the crowd yelled,
``Well, why haven't you joined, judge?''
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in his own argument, my relative said that's exactly
what he was planning to do. He joined up. Within days he was
captured during his first battle. He was marched to a prisoner of
war camp in St. Louis where he had plenty of time to reflect on how
he got there.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the best stories are the ones where someone did
something bad, outrageous, funny or at least unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the stories that people don't want to tell.
</P>
<P>
   I had an aunt on my father's side of the family who reportedly
led a high-flying life in her youth. She married early to an oil
wildcatter. They made and lost fortunes during early years of the
Texas oil boom. She later married a strait-laced Presbyterian elder
and refused to relate any of her tempestuous narratives.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, she wouldn't tell any stories on anyone else in the
family. She went to the grave with a treasure trove of great family
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that many people get more protective of their
reputations the older they get, I changed my tactics with my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her to record her recollections of where she lived as a
child, what toys she had, what her schools were like and other
similar memories.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, I'm hoping, will prime the pump. If she starts
telling stories about things in her life, then she might move on to
other people, relatives and then to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Of all my relatives, I feel I know my grandfather, Roy Rowland,
the best. He was a life-long newspaper man who liked to tell
stories.
</P>
<P>
   He did not hesitate to tell stories about himself. I know his
pets when he was growing up as one of seven children of a Baptist
preacher. I know about the time his pet pig was served for dinner
during a visit by another preacher. He never got over that.
</P>
<P>
   I know about his first job on a newspaper while he was still in
school in Flatonia, Texas. I know all of his duties on that job and
even feel like I know some of the people he worked with.
</P>
<P>
   Stories bind people together and keep them alive as long as the
stories are told.
</P>
<P>
   I hope my mother records her stories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin shocked his nation and the
world Friday by announcing his resignation six months ahead of
schedule, and handing over power to his favored successor, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   As the final act of an extraordinary career, Yeltsin, 68, chose
the last day of 1999, and the start of a four-day New Year holiday
in Russia to try to upstage the new millennium and take charge of a
succession battle that will set Russia's course for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   And in his first decree as acting president, Putin granted
Yeltsin broad immunity from prosecution as well as from
interrogation and searches, the Interfax news agency reported. The
decree, which did not name Yeltsin specifically, also provided
benefits including health care, security and a pension for
presidents leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Putin took office Friday at a private Kremlin ceremony, with the
personal blessing of Patriarch Alexei II, leader of the Russian
Orthodox Church. Yeltsin, by his action, seemed determined to put a
lock on Putin's succession to the presidency in an election three
months from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, on the last day of the departing century, I am
resigning,'' Yeltsin told a bewildered nation, in a noon-time
special broadcast filmed against the backdrop of a traditional New
Year's tree. ``I have understood that it was necessary for me to do
this. Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians,
with new faces, with new smart, strong and energetic people.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's unexpected decision, made on the eve of Russia's
most festive holiday, was seen as a master stroke by a politician
who once again showed that he has no match on Russia's turbulent
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strong move by the president,'' said Vladimir
Ryzhkov, a lower house deputy. ``He did it at the most appropriate
time, when popular support for Putin is at a high. Early elections
will hamper all of the opposition. This will increase Putin's
chance of being elected many times over.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Yeltsin has been in and out of the hospital since 1996,
when he underwent heart surgery following his election to a second
term, his resignation Friday was widely attributed to political,
not health reasons. There was no suggestion, from any quarter, that
Yeltsin was forced out of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a brilliant decision, extremely precise and profound,
and apart from anything else very brave, apart from its historical
significance,'' said Anatoly Chubais, a top Kremlin adviser and the
architect of Russia's privatization program. ``I think that this
decision was very difficult for Boris Nikolayevich as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement issued Friday, praised
Yeltsin's achievements and said, ``The relationship between the
United States and Russia under President Yeltsin has produced
genuine progress for both our people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was looking forward to ``working with Acting
President Putin as the Russian people begin the process of making
the transition from one democratically elected president to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, Yeltsin has dominated the Russian political
stage like an erratic, lumbering bear, emerging from periodic bouts
of poor health and lethargy with surprise moves calculated to
confound his opponents and dazzle his political allies.
</P>
<P>
   A master of drama, and of the political moment, Yeltsin, a
former Communist Party boss in the industrial city of Yekaterinburg
(then Sverdlovsk) in the Ural Mountains, has consistently relied on
his political instincts to get and hold onto power.
</P>
<P>
   But as critics have frequently noted, Yeltsin has proved better
at mastering Russia's often ugly power politics than he has at
governing the country. His legacy is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of Communist rule, Yeltsin managed to defend
Russia's fledgling democracy, most notably by standing up to the
August 1991 coup by Communist hard-liners. But his rule has also
been marked by rising poverty, corruption and a failure to invest
democracy with meaning beyond a freedom that many Russian see as
bordering on chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In a personal aside, which he himself noted was
uncharacteristic, Yeltsin apologized Friday for having failed to
fulfill the hopes of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize for our unfulfilled dreams,'' he said.
``What we thought was easy has proved painfully difficult. I would
like to apologize for having failed to justify the hopes of the
people who believed that we would be able to make a leap from the
gloomy and stagnant totalitarian past to a bright, prosperous and
civilized future at just one go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself believed in this,'' he went on. ``We haven't managed
to make this leap and I was naive in thinking we would.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago Friday, on another cold wintry New Year's Eve,
Yeltsin entered the Kremlin as Russia's first democratically
elected president, shoving aside his arch-nemesis, Mikhail
Gorbachev, the Soviet president he had supplanted three weeks
before by forcing the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   That stunning move, taken in secret with a handful of leaders of
ex-Soviet republics at a hunting lodge in the forests of Belarus,
was to catapult Yeltsin onto the world stage, where he has lobbied,
harangued and bullied Western leaders as they learned to cope with
Russia's new and turbulent democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's blustering, sometimes peculiar political style, has
often led his opponents in Russia to write him off, and count him
out. But each time, he has proved them wrong: in the late 1980s
when he rallied liberal democratic forces after his humiliating
dismissal from the top ranks of the Communist Party by Gorbachev;
in the 1996 elections when he won with a come-from-behind victory
over the Communist leader, Gennadi Zyuganov; in a failed
impeachment drive last May, and now, in a four-month-long campaign
run from the Kremlin designed to put a Yeltsin stamp of approval on
Russia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Just last summer, Yeltsin's chances of controlling his
succession looked weak. Beset by a wave of international scandals _
including reports that members of his own family had accepted
kickbacks from a Swiss construction firm, the Kremlin was losing
the political initiative to a powerful new political alliance,
which united behind former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Islamic rebels from the breakaway region of Chechnya
launched an armed invasion of a neighboring Russian region, Yeltsin
seized the moment to name his sixth prime minister and heir
apparent, Putin, 47, a former KGB officer who was then head of
Russia's domestic intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   That move, followed by a full-scale war against the Chechen
rebels, now moving into its fourth month, dramatically altered
Russia's political landscape. In August, Putin was a political
nonentity, with no party, no popular support and the backing of a
deeply distrusted president.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, with his popularity ratings now hovering
around 50 percent, Putin is Russia's latest rising star, the
architect of an uncompromising war seen by many Russians as a
belated, and welcome, attempt to restore the battered authority of
the Russian state.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who came to politics in the mid-1980s through the St.
Petersburg branch of Russia's liberal democratic movement, showed
in parliamentary elections held Dec. 19 that his personal
popularity could be translated into political pull.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly strong showing of two pro-government parties,
both brand-new creations concocted by Kremlin strategists and both
blessed by Putin, broke the eight-year-long stalemate in the
Russian Parliament, dominated until now by a Communist led
anti-Yeltsin opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary elections confirmed the Kremlin's expectations
for Putin, and according to political analysts, provided Yeltsin
with the assurances he needed to let go of power, most political
analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's rise, carefully curried by Kremlin image makers, is
also traced to a shift in the national mood, as voters, tired of
the chaos and corruption associated with Yeltsin's tenure, cast
about for a strong leader, an image that the dour-faced Putin seems
to fit.

 &HT;    Georgia, Purdue both playing for pride, respect
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The teams are both 7-4. Neither is in the Bowl
Championship Series. Technically, they're playing for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But just try telling that to Georgia and Purdue, who will meet
this morning at 11 a.m. in the Outback Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're playing for pride,'' said Georgia senior
Steven Herndon. ``We slipped there at the end of the season. We
lost three of our last four games. That's not the way we wanted to
end the season, especially the seniors. We want to go out on a
winning note. ... We've got to restore some pride back in the
Georgia Bulldogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about respect,'' Purdue defensive tackle David Nugent
said. ``We're playing for our school, our university, we're playing
for our families and friends. We're just going to go out and do the
best that we can to represent them.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear to mean a little more to the Bulldogs. This was
the year Georgia was supposed to close the gap on SEC powers
Tennessee and Florida. This was the year the Bulldogs would
reassert themselves as a national power.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they regressed, losing to their four biggest rivals _
Tennessee, Florida, Auburn and Georgia Tech _ in the same season
for the first time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue was in a similar situation. The Boilermakers were
cruising along nicely before losing three of four games in October
to Michigan, Penn State and Ohio State and falling to Wisconsin on
Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both our teams were close to having really good records this
year,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``Before Coach (Joe) Tiller
came there, most Purdue people would have jumped off a bridge to
have a 7-4 record. Same thing for us, but we've created a situation
where 7-4 is nothing like what everybody wants. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of our teams lost to some good teams, no question. But
that's what we get measured by in our league, what we do against
the best teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Outback Bowl is billing today's game as a battle of two of
the nation's best quarterbacks. Georgia's Quincy Carter and
Purdue's Drew Brees both were trumpeted as Heisman Trophy
candidates at the beginning of the season. While Carter's campaign
never got off the ground, Brees finished third in the Heisman
voting and attended the selection ceremonies in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to go up against a guy like Drew Brees, who is a
great competitor,'' Carter said. ``I've been through this a lot
this season, facing Tee Martin and Romaro Miller and Joe Hamilton.
So it's not unusual for me. I've just got to be sure I don't try to
make it a duel between me and Drew Brees. I just want to go out and
play my style of football and do what I can to help this team
win.''
   Brees, who threw for 3,521 yards and 21 touchdowns this season,
is probably licking his chops to get a shot at Georgia's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs finished last in the SEC in pass defense, giving up
416 yards and 341 yards passing in the ninth and 11th games,
respectively. In between, they held Ole Miss to 114 yards through
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, it comes and it goes and sometimes it falls apart,''
said junior cornerback Jamie Henderson. ``This game is on us. If we
let them get started early, it could be a repeat of Auburn or
Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The passing game matchup is why the Boilermakers are 5 1/2-point
favorites. But the SEC traditionally plays well against Big Ten
schools. The SEC was 3-0 versus the Big Ten in bowl games last
year, and Georgia whipped Wisconsin 33-6 here in the Outback Bowl
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But conference rivalries appear to mean little to this year's
participants. With them, it's all about the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of ups and downs this season,'' Georgia
linebacker Boss Bailey said. ``We want to end it on a big up.''

   GM-PRECEPT (Detroit) _ With hundreds of millions of dollars of
industrial and federal research work behind it, General Motors'
Precept, an experimental model to be introduced in January, is
probably the most expensive single car ever built. It produces
remarkable fuel economy _ almost 80 miles per gallon _ and is
likely to influence what America drives in the future. But the
Precept itself, along with similar experimental vehicles being
designed by Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler, faces huge
obstacles. The three auto makers have all focused on
diesel-electric hybrid cars. Yet federal and state environmental
regulators have just adopted new tailpipe emissions rules that will
make it very difficult after 2003 to sell automobiles with any
diesel engines. Honda and Toyota, meanwhile, have begun mass
production of small cars that combine gasoline engines and electric
motors, leaving Detroit scrambling to catch up. By Keith Bradsher.

WHAT COMES AFTER `PUSTRIAL?' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 2, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was turning 50 and full of brass when he set out earnestly to
see if it was possible to tell the future. Already he had a pretty
good record as a prognosticator of trends.
</P>
<P>
   A 1960 collection of his essays, ``The End of Ideology: The
Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties,'' had become a
classic of the Sixties, patiently explicating the Left's
disillusionment with communism. The Public Interest, the quarterly
he had founded in 1965 along with Irving Kristol to supply the
necessary analysis for a post-ideological age, was well on its way
to becoming the most influential American journal of opinion of the
Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   So when Daniel Bell published ``The Coming of Post-Industrial
Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting'' in 1973, it proved to be
an especially provocative framework for thinking about what was
happening to the human race in the late 20th century _ especially
when placed alongside a similar exercise of a few years before,
``The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines to Our Changing Society,''
by Peter Drucker.
</P>
<P>
   Those who took to heart Daniel Bell's message were well-prepared
for what came next _ some of what came next, anyway. The transition
to post-industrial society would consist of three main themes, he
said: a shift from manufacturing to services; the centrality of new
science-based industries; and the rise of new technical elites amid
the advent of a new principal of stratification.
</P>
<P>
   From this vantage point, wrote Bell, it was possible to discern
deeper ``axial'' transformations of the age: ``a changeover from a
goods-producing to an information or knowledge society''; a change
from ``empiricism or trial-and-error tinkering to theory and the
codification of theoretical knowledge for directing innovation and
the formulation of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right, of course _ but there was no ``of course'' about
it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter-century later, Daniel Bell has written a
lengthy new forward for a silver anniversary edition of
``Post-Industrial Society.'' He is a spry 80 now, Henry Ford II
Professor of Social Sciences emeritus at Harvard;
scholar-in-residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
that bastion of distinction and good intentions in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   It is an appropriate time therefore to celebrate Bell's career:
40 years as a university sociologist, the inheritor of the mantle
of famous Harvard savants Pitrim Sorokin and Talcott Parsons; and
50 years at the pinnacle of the higher journalism in America. It's
a just occasion to reflect on what it is we expect from our better
pundits. A nice time, too, to inquire of him what he expects to
happen next. He was among my teachers in college; a man of wider
interests or greater ambition I have never known.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Drucker, who came to the United States from Vienna and
London, Bell was raised in New York, the child of Polish
immigrants. He entered New York's City College at 16. Among his
classmates were Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Seymour Lipset, and
Irving Howe, all prominent intellectuals in later years. Later he
married Pearl Kazin, Alfred's sister. All participated as members
of the non-communist Left in the great arguments of the Thirties
and Forties among intellectuals in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bell made his living as a writer and editor for a time, studying
and teaching sociology on the side at Columbia University and the
University of Chicago. Henry Luce hired him onto Fortune Magazine
in 1948, and for 10 years during the magazine's golden age he
served as its labor editor, before returning to full-time teaching,
first at Columbia University, then at Harvard since 1969. He never
lost his feel for reporting, though, and for the next 30 years his
relentless flow of insights contributed to keeping the London
Economist at the top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker, on the other hand, made his reputation as a student of
General Motors Corp. He taught in a business school for more than
20 years instead of a sociology department. But like Bell he was
first and foremost a journalist, and when, in the full flood of
their careers, the two men chose to write on the over-arching
transformation that then was in its early stages, they came to more
or less the same conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one cited the other, naturally, confirming the old adage
that social scientists would no sooner share a toothbrush than
build on each other's theories. But to see that both books were
about the same things is no more difficult to to compare their
tables ofcontents _ a device typographically clumsy but succint.
</P>
<P>
   Bell divided his work into six chapters and a five-part coda.
They look like this:
</P>
<P>
   Chapter One, From Industrial to Post-Industrial Society;
Theories of Social Development;
</P>
<P>
   Chapter Two, From Goods to Services, the Changing Shape of the
Economy;
</P>
<P>
   Chapter Three, The Dimension of Knowledge and Technology: The
New Class Structure of Post-Industrial Society;
</P>
<P>
   Chapter Four, The Subordination of the Corporation; The Tension
between the Economizing and Sociologizing Modes;
</P>
<P>
   Chapter Five, Social Choice and Social Planning; The Adequency
of Our Concepts;
</P>
<P>
   Chapter Six, ``Who Will Rule?'' Politicians and Technocrats in
the Post-Industrial Society.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's coda, ``An Agenda for the Future,'' lists five topics:
How Social Systems Change; The Future of Science; Meritocracy and
Equality; The End of Scarcity; and Culture and Consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker's ``The Age of Discontinuity,'' on the other hand,
consists of seventeen chapters divided into four parts.
</P>
<P>
   Part One, the Knowledge Technologies: The End of Continuity; The
New Industries and their Dynamics; the New Entrepreneur; the New
Economic Policies
</P>
<P>
   Part Two, From International to World Economy: the Global
Shopping Center; Making the Poor Productive; Beyond the ``New
Economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Part Three, A Society of Organizations: The New Pluralism;
Toward a Theory of Organizations; the Sickness of Government; How
Can the Individual Survive?
</P>
<P>
   Part Four, The Knowledge Society: the Knowledge Economy; Work
and Worker in the Knowledge Society; Has Success Spoiled the
Schools? The New Learning and the New Teaching; the Politics of
Knowledge; Does Knowledge Have a Future?
</P>
<P>
   On balance, you have to give the nod for prescience and clarity
to Drucker. The answer to the question, what comes after
``post-industrial?'' seems clear, whether you call it ``the
knowledge society'' or ``the information age.'' Drucker anticipated
more of the mechanics of the transformation, including the turn
against government and the critique of Keynesian economics.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is clear in retrospect that it was the murmer of the
conventional wisdom of Cambridge, Mass. that Bell was hearing, not
the whisper of the future, when he wrote in 1973, ``It seems clear
to me, today, we in America are moving away from a society based on
a private-enterprise market system toward one in which the most
important economic decisions will be made at the political level,
in terms of consciously defined `goals' and `priorities. He
resigned the co-editorship of The Public Interest that same year,
just as the ideology of the market was gaining the upper hand, and
as the journal he had co-founded joined Commentary as a flagship of
neo-conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell raised plenty of deep questions of his own, and because
of his deep grounding in Marxism and Continental sociology, his
book touched off a brouhaha among intellectuals in the former
Soviet Union. (A 300-copy translation was prepared for party
officials.) The political liberalisam that had been forged into
controversies of the Thirties and Forties remained the book's
dominating key.
</P>
<P>
   Readers were well served by either ``The Age of Discontinuity''
or ``The Coming of Post Industrial Society,'' and best by both.
Together they remain reassuring evidence of the ability of our
wisest intellectuals to know at least dimly where we are going,
even in tumultuous times.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Bell think today? Last month he and and his son
David (a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University) took
turns bantering away by e-mail throughout the day for a week on the
e-zine Slate's friendly feature known as ``The Breakfast Table.''
</P>
<P>
   There all Bell's gifts were on display: the encyclopedic
knowledge (Joachim of Fistore, the obscure Cistercian monk of the
12th century, and his relation to William Butler Yeats' ``The
Second Coming,'' the extrordinary personal history (Varian Fry was
his editor in 1945 at Common Sense), the spirituality, the humor,
the family values.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't he give just one prediction for the next century.
(``No, not a prediction, for that is not the way to think about it,
but a relevant social framework to identify issues and problems.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing,'' wrote Daniel Bell, ``is a change in
the `axis' of world socio-political organization; namely, one of
widening economic integration (crossing national boundaries) and
increasing political fragmentation (within national boundaries.)
The economic dimension is a `change of scale,' as all national
economies are absorbed into a global framework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fragmentation is occurring because (as I remarked a decade
ago) the national state is becoming too small for the big problems
of life, and too big for the small problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He is probably right _ again.
</P>

   The century's turn has been a time of retrospectives: what was

IT'S A JUNGLE IN HERE: TALES OF AN OFFICE GARDENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (editors: optional sidebar at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Belinda Marley roared out of Pittsburg, Kan., in 1981 with a
``wicked green thumb,'' as she puts it, and a certain insouciance
regarding the facts. Four hundred miles from home, in the deepest
heart of Dallas, she hired herself out as a horticulturist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lied my way into the job,'' she admits. ``I had 100
houseplants at home, and I told them I had experience in a local
greenhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marley, who is now 41, parlayed this opening into a career
in ``interiorscaping,'' and she now zips around in a Chevy Blazer
with a palm tree and ``Belinda's Tropical Paradise'' painted on the
side, taking care of tropical plants in restaurants, reception
rooms, lobbies and offices of all descriptions in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hostile environment,'' she says. ``It used to be OK to
throw some plastic and silk plants around, but now, with what we've
created for ourselves, plants are as important as that desk.'' A
big leafy palm or two may help clean up the air as well as the
attitudes of office workers; plants also produce oxygen and raise
the humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is proven that live tropicals make people more
productive,'' Mrs. Marley says, whipping out a brochure that cites
NASA research conducted by Dr. B.C. Wolverton, an environmental
engineer and the author of ``How to Grow Fresh Air'' (Penguin,
1996).
</P>
<P>
   Leafy tropical plants adapt to the workaday world without
complaint, but they are really no better suited to the average
office than most people are. ``How many people in those cubbyholes
actually get a window?'' Mrs. Marley asks. Where no natural light
ever penetrates, she recommends peace lily (Spathiphyllum). ``She
could truly live in a closet,'' says Mrs. Marley, who refers to all
plants in the feminine.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-leaf philodendron (Philodendron oxycardium) and pothos
(Epipremnum aureum) thrive in the modern business world's miserable
work stations. These vines can be pinched back to the scale of a
cubicle, but easily get out of hand. ``I have cubbyholes where they
have created circles on the walls,'' she says. ``It goes over the
top of the computer and down the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential clients typically call an interiorscaper after they
have moved into a building, she says. The furniture is arranged and
the pictures have been hung, and then someone thinks of plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come in and look for dead spots,'' she says, ``where the
decorator has done her job but there is a dead spot. Unfortunately,
they're never in front of the windows.'' Many of the most
spectacular and adaptable tropical plants are native to rain
forests, however, and thrive in subdued light.
</P>
<P>
   Clients often think they know which plants will work best. A
restaurant owner once insisted on a peace lily next to the
reservations podium. ``She took serious abuse,'' Mrs. Marley says.
``Her leaves were tattered and torn. I replaced it with a yucca
cane. They slice you if you muscle them. Nobody messes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' waiting rooms are notoriously hazardous to the health
of plants; Mrs. Marley had to remove a plant that a nervous patient
had so thoroughly punctured with her long fingernails that
something appeared to have chewed on it. ``People fiddle,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is the person who has extra coffee in their cup and
it goes in the plant,'' she continues. ``The plant gets a caffeine
jolt, but you get a foul smell after a while, and you lose it all

</P>
<P>
   Gardening is usually a quite private pastime, but Mrs. Marley
has to deal as much with people as with plants. She becomes an
unofficial extension agent, answering gardening questions as she
waters gigantic banana trees from the atrium stairs, clips the
ragged tips of a lady palm's pleated fronds with pinking shears, or
takes a feather duster to a ficus.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marley or one of her three full-time employees visit each
of 65 clients once a week, for fees that start at $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people overwater,'' she says. ``Stick your finger in the
soil. If it is wet, don't water.'' In low light, plants really
don't need a lot of water. What they do need is a routine. ``It's
just like children,'' Mrs. Marley says. ``Without it things get all
mixed up.''
</P>
<P>
   She seldom has to repot plants. ``Everybody thinks, `I have a
plant, I have to repot it,''' she says. ``You never really repot a
plant unless you want it to grow larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marley prefers light plastic pots molded to look like
stone, lead, or terra cotta, but is happy to accommodate customers'
tastes. Shiny brass pots are popular with bosses. ``We have one
account, you can tell where the head honchos are because they all
have brass containers,'' she says. For the big corner offices with
lots of light, she likes to recommend citrus trees. ``They're
fun,'' she says, ``and you get the fruit of your labors.''
</P>
<P>
   She also encourages clients to try bromeliads, and is
particularly partial to the bromeliad known as urn plant (Aechmea
fasciata), which has long, toothy green leaves, dusted with silver.
``When you get one, she's blooming, and it's bright and significant
and awesome,'' Mrs. Marley says. ``To take care of her, you just
pour a little water in her head. She is just awesome _ killer
color, killer bloom, and she'll have a baby for you before she
dies.'' As the bloom fades, one or two offsets emerge at the base
of the parent plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not your red geranium person,'' Mrs. Marley says. She
prefers big, wild, leafy, tropical plants in the unnatural world
inside the revolving doors. ``Come on,'' she says, ``let's get some
adventure going on here.''
</P>

   THIS WEEK: Alms for Birds &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Start winnowing the long list you've compiled from the new plant
introductions for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Plan for drought and heat. Look for vegetables that did well in
test gardens in this year's record heat, like Outredgeous lettuce
and Blushing Beauty peppers. Some All-America Selections winners _
the sunflower Soraya, the cosmos Cosmic Orange and the tithonia
Fiesta del Sol _ got good marks last summer, but your garden may
not accommodate all these orange-flowered winners. At 2 feet tall
rather than the usual six, Fiesta del Sol is suitable for
containers and small gardens. Cosmic Orange blooms from early
summer until frost, and bees love it. These two will be available
in garden centers in spring, but Soraya will show up only in
catalogs. And if you can't get enough orange, California poppy
(Eschscholzia mexicana) is easy and reliable, and it thrives in
drought.

DRESSING MEAN AND MEANING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (b By STANLEY BING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look at you. The next 1,000 years are already 24 hours old, and
what have you done to alter your style? Have you changed your life?
Have you wrested victory from the maw of mediocrity? Or are you the
same 20th-century hominid you were last Friday?
</P>
<P>
   Of course you are. And it just won't do. If there's one thing we
know about the new epoch, it's that it's going to be harder,
faster, meaner and more digital than the relatively warm and toasty
analog version we've just left behind. That means dressing,
accessorizing, working, playing, meeting, greeting, piercing,
coiffing and otherwise living in full compliance with the tough new
paradigm. Nervous yet? Good. Here is the sixfold path to power
style for the new mean elite. Follow it or die.
</P>
<P>
   Casual is over. The backlash against Internet millionaire idiot
savants is now well established. Nobody who has ever been forced to
sit at a meeting in a sober Canali pinstripe and Barneys tie while
some dopey guy in a down vest and ``Planet of the Apes'' T-shirt
spouts jargon about sticky interfaces will doubt the wisdom of the
new anticasualism.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote is staunch, aggressive, gender-free traditionalism
and a solid commitment to lack of personal comfort. We're not
comfortable with what we're doing _ why should our clothing be?
Look to shirts and blouses bleached so blazingly and sadistically
white that they could cause retinal damage. Suits for men and women
should be in funereal hues, with creases that could slice a finger.
</P>
<P>
   All clothes should be worn tight and high, harking back to the
immensely uncomfortable chinos, James Bond peg legs and squirmingly
uncomfortable miniskirts of the 1960's and 70's, which kept people
basically vertical until Woody Allen and Kurt Cobain took over with
their corduroy, denim and (ugh) flannel.
</P>
<P>
   Hair today, gone entirely. Evolution is working on us all, and
nowhere more strikingly than in the corridors of power. Men are
growing ever more hairless, and what hair they have, more often
than not, looks bad. Consider Donald J. Trump. Women, on the other
hand, are continuing their rise to full and justified equality, but
not moving as fast as they should, possibly because they have too
much hair.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is clear for both sexes: the complete eradication
ol and body hair. Nobody doesn't look really scary when
shaved and buffed, a fact established by West Coast entertainment
executives who, in the early 90's, invented bullet heads strictly
for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Like professional swimmers, the new shaved and buffed 2K
stylists will move through the ocean of life, eating raw fish as
they go, unencumbered by frizz. Pair that with excessive physical
fitness, and you have a combo that cannot be beat.
</P>
<P>
   You only get one chance to make a first impression _ so make it
hurt. The most important power styling opportunity is the moment
you say hello to your next interface target. Don't waste it.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the common handshake is over.
</P>
<P>
   This germ bridge from one person to another was invented
millenniums ago by those who wanted to show that they were not
carrying a weapon. ``Look!'' the handshake said. ``I have no sword!
My intentions are peaceful and good!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not really the message we mean to convey, now is
it? ``Hey!'' we want to say. ``Watch out for me! I mean business
and I will hurt you if I can!''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing conveys this message more effectively than the common
head butt.
</P>
<P>
   You're now equipped for it. Bow down that hard, cold cranium.
Aim it at the other guy. And knock his or her block off! Boy!
Doesn't that feel good!
</P>
<P>
   Put your worst foot forward. The relationship between pain and
gain is particularly evident in power shoes. These should be tight
and unforgiving, just like their owner, making the wearer
irritable, unhappy and eager to visit similar constraint and pain
on others, as well as cutting off the blood supply to the brain.
These are all terrific assets to any business mentality.
</P>
<P>
   New footwear is being developed that will actually make men
shorter, helping those with excessive tallness join the ranks of
the tiny titans that move the world. Studies show that 90 percent
of all those chief executive billionaires at the Herb Allen Sun
Valley conference are _ not to put too fine a point on it _ short.
Now, any man can have that lack-of-height advantage. Similar
research demonstrates that tall women with enormous spike heels
terrify and impress male and female counterparts alike. Women will
also be further exploring the elimination of socks and hose. In
women, the effect of a bare leg and associated nearby naked foot on
adipose business executives with bad sex lives is self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Wear your office. There's no reason to look like a wonk just
because you're tapped into the cybermacrocosm. For this we can
thank the breakthrough stylings of Steve Jobs and the gang at
Apple, whose tangerine and blueberry Macintoshes are so cute that
they make you want to pinch their virtual cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   So let the rainbow in! Black and beige are out, baby. Each and
every objet that keeps you in touch with Big Mother should be as
translucent and colorful as your world view. To avoid bulging
pockets stuffed with communication gizmos and unsightly clip-ons,
true power-forwards are now sporting clever shoulder and wrist
holsters and natty garters in leather and lace to keep their
beepers, pagers, cell and satellite phones, laptops, palmtops and
stovetops in handy reach.
</P>
<P>
   Until cranial implants become the norm, the first unwired
telecom chapeau, coming next winter, will take up the slack. Big
and bold as its Russian counterpart, with fake-fur earflaps to
conceal its tasty little satellite dish, antennae and inner
workings, this hot headgear will sport every communications
technology the budding intrapreneur could want. The rumored price
is more than $15,000 _ with free Internet connectivity!
</P>
<P>
   Make every desk accessory count. Your desk is you. Toss the
Smurfs, bogus award medallions and cute little gewgaws that have
burdened it with an excess of personality in the past. Get a hefty
stone paperweight that you can hit people with it if they don't
give you what you want. A serrated letter opener can help organize
your in pile and can also leave a nasty gash. Remember to keep it
clean.
</P>
<P>
   And this above all: To thine own self be true. Anything else
seems so 20th century, don't you think?

<P>
   The limousines moved quietly along the dark back roads, under
canopies of arching branches and leaves, before turning down a dirt
drive and stopping at the courtyard of a large 1940's center-hall
colonial.
</P>
<P>
   And these were just the cars for the staff and performers.
</P>
<P>
   When the guests arrived, valets whisked away their Range Rovers
and Mercedes sport utilities, and they found themselves in a
reasonable facsimile of the red-light district of Amsterdam. Here
in rural, stately Bedford, N.Y., the entire house and much of the
11-acre grounds were bathed in red light. Semidressed models stood
in doorways and hung out of windows, like ladies of the Westchester
night.
</P>
<P>
   A bodyguard with a list checked off the 200 guests before they
proceeded to a registration tent, set up like a private club,
outside the front door of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbanites have always given parties _ birthday parties,
Memorial Day parties, block parties, Tupperware parties.
</P>
<P>
   But lately some have been putting on affairs more reminiscent of
the last days of disco than of the quiet good taste associated with
holiday dinner parties or summer garden parties. Couples in their
30s and 40s, perhaps ambivalent about settling into respectable,
boring middle age, have been playing host to blowouts more typical
of an after-party for the MTV Awardse process, they have
exported some of the high-spirited night life of their younger
years in Manhattan to the skateboard-filled driveways and
deer-tracked byways of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like, `Hey, we're doing it so we can really let
loose and so we can feel like we're not 40 years old and living a
boring life in the suburbs,''' said Seth Kanegis, 36, an investment
manager, who with his wife, Marlene, was host to the Amsterdam
theme party last fall. ``I mean, I would love to be able to go to
the south of France and party like a rock star, but I can't do that
_ I've got kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanegis' party was produced by David Tutera, a party designer
and special-events planner in Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he oversees a
staff of 16 in a large concrete-block building filled with party
props: classical columns, arbors, chandeliers, 50 flats of wheat
grass from a House &AMP; Garden shoot and a shelf of Halloween props
from a party in Greenwich, Conn., for Tommy Hilfiger's oldest son.
</P>
<P>
   Tutera, 33, works all over the country, producing mega-events
like a post-Grammy Awards celebration for 3,500 in New York, or the
Kennedy Center's spring gala for 1,500 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But in Westchester and in Fairfield County, Conn., he does
private parties for clients who can afford his fee, which begins at
$15,000, plus expenses that can climb into six figures. Kanegis
flew him to Amsterdam for three days to collect menus and soak up
atmosphere. Back home, Tutera interviewed caterers until he found
one who could recreate the Indonesian fare that's popular in
Amsterdam. Behind the Kanegises' house, Tutera's crew erected an
enormous dance tent and set up four-poster beds around the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the night, the host introduced the main
attraction: Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, who had just wrapped up a
monthlong tour with a side band, the Refugee Camp. Tutera arranged
to meet their tour bus at an exit off Interstate 684 and escort
them to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wyclef came on, everyone was blown away,'' Tutera said.
``They wound up playing an extra hour, then were guests for the
rest of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutera, who is completing a book for Simon &AMP; Schuster, ``David
Tutera: A Passion for Parties,'' to be published next fall, is not
the only name in suburban party extravaganzas. Bill Tansey, of
Tansey Design Associates in New York, put on a party last summer
for a young couple in Southampton ``who just wanted an intimate,
erotic dance party,'' he recalled. He covered a section of their
pool with a plexiglass dance floor and, after dinner, brought out
the entertainment: a club DJ from Manhattan, five drag queens and a
transsexual dressed in Saran wrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people made a zillion dollars recently,''
Tansey said. ``They want to have the most fabulous, most
talked-about event, whatever the excuse. They also want to have a
great time. A lot of them are between their mid-30s and mid-40s.
Often, you'll hear them say, `This is the last time we can have
this kind of party, because soon the kids will be aware of what's
going on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Aelyon of Mosaic Event Planning in Westport, Conn.,
produced a Moroccan feast last summer for 120 guests in 12 tents on
the estate of a couple whose property straddles Westport and
Weston. The tents were outfitted with cushions, tapestries and
personal waiters. Also on hand were a belly dancer, an elephant, a
six-piece Middle Eastern band and two lifeguards (a river runs
through the property). A separate picnic with its own entertainment
was organized at the opposite end of the estate for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving parties has become part of the imaging and packaging
we're all trying to sell,'' Aelyon said, explaining the motives
behind such lavish affairs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, professionally produced theme parties are not every
aging suburbanite's idea of a good time. Many would give thanks
simply for a relaxing evening away from the children, with good
conversation among a few friends as the focus, rather than an
exhausting evening of dancing and living it up, as though they were
still in their 20's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the desire to defy the stereotype of suburban complacency
is strong enough to create a steady demand for parties like
Tutera's. He produced oneummer at the Westchester County
home of a Manhattan couple who also have an apartment on Park
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for my husband's 50th birthday,'' said the wife, who
asked that their names not be used, to protect their privacy. Her
husband is a scion of a prominent family, with holdings worth
billions of dollars. ``He wasn't real happy about turning 50, and
he wanted something different,'' his wife said. Hearing the word
``different,'' a friend of hers recommended Tutera, and the two hit
it off. ``David's hot,'' she said. ``He's fresh and original and
still unspoiled. The worst thing that can happen is that you're
bored at your own party. We weren't bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Running with his client's idea, Tutera erected a clear plastic
tent behind the house, rented antique tables and chairs as well as
contemporary furniture from ABC Carpet &AMP; Home, then arranged them
among the wildflower gardens _ a kind of formal indoor dining room
brought outside, with wall-to-wall carpeting of thick turf. When a
summer storm broke at exactly the moment the guests were seated
inside the clear tent and the Hampton String Quartet began playing,
it seemed as though everyone was on an movie set, Tutera said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the birthday boy, ``he was blown away,'' his wife said,
adding, ``The guy's been to a lot of parties, but he said this was
the most beautiful party he'd ever been to.''
</P>
<P>
   For New Year's Eve, Tutera was booked for a party for 250 at the
home of Nick and Lisi Robinson, a couple in their early 30s who
live in Katonah, N.Y. The theme was ``Divas of Disco,'' and Tutera
had built a two-level dance floor in a white-carpeted tent with
white chiffon walls. Featuring caviar stations and sushi bars, the
disco tent was planned with not one, not two, but three live
performers: Alicia Bridges (``I Love the Night Life''), Musique
(``In the Bush'') and Lisa Lisa of Cult Jam.
</P>
<P>
   Come Monday morning, Tutera expects to be back in his Mamaroneck
studio, designing sets for the spring round of big suburban
parties. One will be for the Kanegises in June. Marlene Kanegis'
sister is Lisi Robinson, and something of a ``Can you top this?''
competition seems to have sprung up between the two couples. They
attend each other's events produced by Tutera and, of course, incur
an obligation as guests to return their hosts' hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one could blow away all previous parties Seth's had,''
Tutera said. He would reveal no other details except that he and
Kanegis are discussing hiring four bands. ``It will be the Battle
of the Parties,'' Tutera said. ``We're not talking bar mitzvah
bands here; we're talking headline bands.''

HORRORS NOT `FORGOTTEN'

<P>
   Movie buff Michael H. Price likes nothing better than uncovering
``new things about old things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-based author and longtime film critic for the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram co-authored the essential genre study
``Forgotten Horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   First published 20 years ago, this revealing, one-of-a-kind work
explores uncharted cinematic territory: the Depression-era history
of Hollywood's Poverty Row chillers. Price wrote and researched
``Forgotten Horrors'' with the late George E. Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very month we finished the book, we started discovering
new things,'' said Price, who also directs AMC Theaters' Gourmet
Cinema project in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it never stops,'' Price said. ``Every time you think
you've milked the last drop in the archives, you look around and
something reaches out and grabs you.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Midnight Marquee Press has now published the revised
and expanded ``Forgotten Horrors: The Definitive Edition.'' The new
volume sheds light on such little-known but endlessly intriguing
treasures as ``Murder After Midnight,'' ``Amazon Head Hunters,''
``Revolt of the Zombies'' and ``Riders of the Whispering Skull.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of `Forgotten Horrors' crosses all cultural
barriers,'' Price said. ``For one thing, how do you define a horror
film? Is it supernatural? Is it science-fiction? Can it be rampant
criminality? Anything that scares you can be considered a horror
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ``Forgotten Horrors'' are whodunits, while others are
creepy comedies. Some are spooky Westerns, others are jungle
adventures and many are full-fledged fright films. All are bound by
their relative obscurity, their low-budget origins and an inherent
quotient of mystery and dread that Price and Turner called ``weird
menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a game,'' Price said. ``There are ground
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the author admits, his threshold of tolerance
has risen. A case in point is ``Private Snuffy Smith,'' a comedy
based on the hillbilly comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so blasted weird,'' Price said. ``When I started
watching it, I wasn't expecting much. Then, early on in the game,
they introduced this invisibility potion. I said, `This is a
forgotten horror!'''
</P>
<P>
   Price's personal favorite from the definitive edition is ``Drums
of Jeopardy'' (1931), a horror thriller featuring Warner ``Charlie
Chan'' Oland as a vengeful Bolshevik scientist. Price is also fond
of the grim, mature Tim McCoy Western ``Lightnin' Bill Carson''
(1936) and a voodoo oddity of ``poetic backwater romance'' called
``Chloe'' (1934).
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago that if you don't write to please
yourself, you're not going to please anybody,'' Price said.
``George and I started this out of a passion for these movies.
Somehow we tapped into a popular vein right before the video market
exploded in the early '80s. Now there's no end in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten Horrors: The Definitive Edition'' covers 1929-37. An
envisioned series of sequels (based on an exhaustive ``laundry
list'' of qualified titles) will follow the phenomenon through the
mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That puts you in Herschell Gordon Lewis territory,'' Price
noted. ``That's about the point where imagination leaks out and
explicit shock values creep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I like antiquity,'' he said. ``I like watching movies
that were made before a certain level of technology was reached.''
</P>
<P>
   To order ``Forgotten Horrors,'' call (800) 886-0313.

MAKEUP THAT SAYS: NIGHT AND DAY, YOU ARE THE ONE

  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)

 By ALEX WITCHEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting near the Prescriptives counter at Bergdorf
Goodman, I eyed the glowing white liquid suspiciously. ``Is this
Magic?'' I asked Darac, the illusionist (read makeup artist) who
goes by one name only.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Magic alters the reality of what you see,'' he
said. ``It plays with light so it's all illusion. It's very Lucille
Ball in `Mame.' Every time she had a close-up she looked very soft,
no fine lines or discoloration. Think of Magic as soft surgery.
It's for people who say, `Should I have something done?' and
shouldn't, but do, and then come out looking like Mrs. Phantom of
the Opera. Which we don't enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptives is just one of the major cosmetics companies that
have been introducing products that are supposed to play with light
so that women of a certain age (over 30) can welcome in 2000
looking like movie stars shot through cheesecloth. Estee Lauder
recently introduced Spotlight, a lotion ``whose trick lies in the
special way light is reflected by `micro-prisms,''' its promotional
literature claims.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon's Age Defying Makeup and Concealer Compact features
``unique moisturizer-wrapped color particles,'' which ``float above
skin lines, making them look less noticeable.'' And Christian Dior
takes playing with light one step further with its new Lumiere
Noire, a makeup line that is transparent in daylight and can be
seen only in the black light of nightclubs (and is sold only at
Sephora).
</P>
<P>
   Anne Carullo, the vice president of marketing and product
development worldwide for Prescriptives, who came up with the
concept for Magic, said: ``I always figured maybe I could trick
light a little bit. If we optically alter what light sees, we alter
the way we are seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in formulating Magic, Prescriptives worked with Trisha
Sawyer, a makeup artist for Julia Roberts and Sharon Stone, on
translating the principles of movie makeup into one for the masses
_ meaning that if you use a base coat underneath your foundation,
one that is filled with tiny glittering particles, it will somehow
influence the way light hits your face (gently, thank you).
</P>
<P>
   At least, this is how I could best decipher the corporate
gobbledygook describing Magic's Illuminating Liquid Potion as ``a
holographic liquid, an oil-free, water-in-silicone emulsion with
three-dimensional pigments made of spherical, multilayered
particles that changes the way skin reflects light.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who speak English, this means that Magic will make you
look as dewy and brimming with estrogen as you did the day of your
junior prom. Which sounded good to me.
</P>
<P>
   During the last week, I tried all four of the new makeup lines
in the hope that I, too, would wake up this weekend and greet the
millennium with Julia Roberts' face _ and salary. Here's what
happened instead.
</P>
<P>
   PRESCRIPTIVES: Darac was the key to this experience (I'm sure
the other companies' illusionists are equally good, though I tried
those products at home). His sessions at Bergdorf's are free,
though you must book well in advance. What is not free are the
products: the Illuminating Liquid Potion is $30, the custom-blended
foundation Darac made for me (``the difference between ordinary and
extraordinary,'' he insisted) was $55, and the custom-made lipstick
was $30, though all he did was copy the color of the $11.50
Clinique lipstick I usually buy.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Darac's floor show is worth the extra charge, as was
the discovery of my new favorite Prescriptives product, the Cooling
Globe, which looks like a small light bulb. You keep it in the
freezer and roll it over your puffy eyes when you get up in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will rescue you,'' Darac proclaimed, applying it to my
eyelids. Heaven. ``Also here, after a few martinis,'' he went on,
pressing it behind my neck. ``And sinuses,'' he added, holding it
on my cheeks. ``It's an Altoid for the eye,'' he said, albeit a $30
Altoid. How did I ever live without it?
</P>
<P>
   He did a fabulous job on my makeup, and indeed, shadows, red
marks and all unevenness were obliterated without it looking like I
was wearing makeup at all. Unlike other makeup applications, the
result of this one was that my skin looked genuinely more lush than
usual (though if I looked extra close I could see the little
glitters; I simply resolved not to look.)
</P>
<P>
   Alas, hours later, when I checked myself again, the sparkles had
sputtered and my skin had way more creases than usual, which is
what happens when there is too much makeup on my face, even when
expertly applied. ``Old pumpkin,'' a friend calls the effect.
</P>
<P>
   When I used the products on my own a few days later, I avoided
this look, but I also avoided the cheesecloth glow. I had bypassed
ethereal completely, leaving me to believe the magic may have been
Darac's. Does he do hair, too? I had asked. He drew himself up.
``We are only cosmetic,'' he proclaimed. ``One man, one art:
Aristotle.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN DIOR: I wasn't quite sure what to make of Lumiere
Noire, a novelty makeup for the club-hopping set, which remains
invisible to the naked eye until you encounter it under the black
lights of a club. I never saw much point in clubs, even when I was
younger, but now that my stepchildren are old enough, or almost old
enough, to go instead, I sat them down for an after-dinner
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They loved it, drawing a stick figure on my cheek and a
tick-tack-toe board on my forehead, applying a stencil to the
inside of my arm, coloring it in, then writing their names
underneath. I looked totally normal until I held up a black light,
revealing the designs in vivid ice blue. Fantastic! It occurred to
me that you could write any kind of heinous message right across
your forehead, go to work and smile at your bosses, and all the
while they would have no idea what they were looking at. It
definitely beats lingerie for that ``only you know'' sort of
thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback? After washing my face three times with soap and
water, the blue remained. Blurred and faded, but still glowing.
That was strange, but even so, I'd recommend it to anyone with time
(and kids) on their hands, whether they go to clubs or not. It's
fun, and it makes you feel young _ without the glitter.
</P>
<P>
   ESTEE LAUDER: I found Spotlight to be quite similar to Magic,
though it was definitely shinier, or more ``radiant,'' as the
adjective in its packaging promised. Either way, my forehead looked
like a headlight.
</P>
<P>
   While the makeup had the same glittery particles that Magic did,
Spotlight gave my skin a reddish cast, which is actually meant to
offset the green undertones of fluorescent office lights. Had it
not been Christmas Eve, I would have found the red alarming, as my
nose was glowing a la Rudolph. Luckily, when I applied my own
Georgette Klinger foundation over it, the excessive rosiness
disappeared and the overall effect came closest to Darac's
application of Prescriptives. As he would say, I enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   REVLON: This was my briefest experiment. The Age Defying All Day
Lifting Foundation felt like thick grandma makeup on my skin,
seeming only to enhance the size of my pores. And the accompanying
concealer compact felt oily to the touch and did not work as well
as the Benefits concealer I normally use.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this applying and removing different
combinations from my face was an increase in the very same
unsightly marks and blotches that these makeups were formulated to
conceal, not to mention patches of dryness (especially on the site
of the stick-figure man).
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for movie stardom. Makeup is only makeup, after
all. Though Ms. Carullo of Prescriptives promises that in May the
company will introduce its second group of products that play with
light. ``Maybe a putty to build cheekbones with,'' she mused, ``a
serum that pulls the face back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds interesting. We would enjoy.

MAKEUP THAT SAYS: NIGHT AND DAY, YOU ARE THE ONE

  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting near the Prescriptives counter at Bergdorf
Goodman, I eyed the glowing white liquid suspiciously. ``Is this
Magic?'' I asked Darac, the illusionist (read makeup artist) who
goes by one name only.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``Magic alters the reality of what you see,'' he
said. ``It plays with light so it's all illusion. It's very Lucille
Ball in `Mame.' Every time she had a close-up she looked very soft,
no fine lines or discoloration. Think of Magic as soft surgery.
It's for people who say, `Should I have something done?' and
shouldn't, but do, and then come out looking like Mrs. Phantom of
the Opera. Which we don't enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptives is just one of the major cosmetics companies that
have been introducing products that are supposed to play with light
so that women of a certain age (over 30) can welcome in 2000
looking like movie stars shot through cheesecloth. Estee Lauder
recently introduced Spotlight, a lotion ``whose trick lies in the
special way light is reflected by `micro-prisms,''' its promotional
literature claims.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon's Age Defying Makeup and Concealer Compact features
``unique moisturizer-wrapped color particles,'' which ``float above
skin lines, making them look less noticeable.'' And Christian Dior
takes playing with light one step further with its new Lumiere
Noire, a makeup line that is transparent in daylight and can be
seen only in the black light of nightclubs (and is sold only at
Sephora).
</P>
<P>
   Anne Carullo, the vice president of marketing and product
development worldwide for Prescriptives, who came up with the
concept for Magic, said: ``I always figured maybe I could trick
light a little bit. If we optically alter what light sees, we alter
the way we are seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in formulating Magic, Prescriptives worked with Trisha
Sawyer, a makeup artist for Julia Roberts and Sharon Stone, on
translating the principles of movie makeup into one for the masses
_ meaning that if you use a base coat underneath your foundation,
one that is filled with tiny glittering particles, it will somehow
influence the way light hits your face (gently, thank you).
</P>
<P>
   At least, this is how I could best decipher the corporate

SPARTAN WOMEN, LIBERATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With scholars poring over the same texts for centuries, ancient
history would appear to be a field in which it is difficult to plow
new ground. But Sarah B. Pomeroy, distinguished professor of
classics at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City
University of New York, says there is much to be learned about the
women of Sparta, the ancient city-state in southern Greece that
defeated Athens in the Peloponnesian War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult in my field to find a subject that nobody
has taken seriously,'' Ms. Pomeroy said. ``This subject has been
around for 2,500 years but has turned out to be totally fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparta, which existed from 800 B.C. until A.D. 200, was renowned
in the ancient world as a stoic, martial city-state that practiced
eugenics. It was the society that inspired the modern English word
``laconic'' (after Laconia, the region surrounding Sparta), not to
mention the adjective ``spartan.''
</P>
<P>
   Spartan men were raised to be soldiers from an early age.
Indeed, to build and maintain esprit de corps in the ranks, they
were not allowed to live apart from their military units until age
30, even if they were married.
</P>
<P>
   Spartan women are often portrayed as having been as grim as the
men. But Ms. Pomeroy, whose previous books include ``Goddesses,
Whores, Wives and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity,'' said that
impression is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom was that they were the most oppressed
women in the ancient world because they were simply baby-making
machines,'' she said. ``But there is much more to it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Spartan women were in many ways among the most liberated of the
ancient Greek world, she added. Sparta was one of the few Greek
states where women received formal instruction in poetry, music,
dancing and physical education. Spartan women drank wine and were
famous for their beauty, Ms. Pomeroy said. Helen of Troy came from
Sparta.
</P>
<P>
   No women in ancient Greece had formal political rights, but
Spartan women, unlike their counterparts in other Greek
city-states, were allowed to own property. A four-horse chariot
team owned by a Spartan woman was victorious at the Olympics in 396
B.C. and again in 392 B.C. And the two wealthiest people in Sparta
during the Hellenistic period (beginning in 323 B.C.) were women.
</P>
<P>
   Sparta has always been a challenge to ancient historians because
information is relatively scarce. Unlike the Athenians, the
Spartans built few public monuments and wrote little about
themselves. The city had a fearsome reputation that did not invite
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   It did not fall to a foreign invader until the Thebans conquered
it in 370 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what is known about Sparta comes from modern
archaeological evidence and the writings of Xenophon, an Athenian
who was exiled to the city-state around 400 B.C., and Plutarch, who
lived from A.D. 46 to A.D. 120. But Sparta cast a spell on many
writers, including Plato, who used aspects of Spartan society as a
model for his utopian Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every ancient source has its bias,'' said Ms. Pomeroy, who
recently received a Guggenheim fellowship and said she expected to
finish writing a book about her findings in another year or so.
``It's OK as long as you know what the bias is.''

DETHRONING FREEDOM AS A NATION BUILDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What idea gave birth to the American character? What made the
United States so distinctive a nation? And how did it attain its
imposing status?
</P>
<P>
   One answer has been offered above all others. The United States
was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all
men are created equal. This is what Alexis de Tocqueville saw as
the defining principle of American life. Democracy and
egalitarianism shaped our culture, determined our character and
influenced our politics.
</P>
<P>
   But James E. Block, in a project that began as a doctoral
dissertation for the Committee on Social Thought at the University
of Chicago, offers another answer. The primary concept that shaped
America is not liberty, it is ``agency.''
</P>
<P>
   This might seem a bit peculiar. This use of the word agency
seems antique and hardly familiar. In Block's interpretation,
agency is a notion that developed in 16th-century England, in a
Puritan challenge to the monarchical order.
</P>
<P>
   Agency required a new view of human nature and a new
interpretation of responsibility: the individual becomes a
self-reliant agent able to act freely, but in that freedom a choice
is made to serve a larger vision. Agency is not servitude; it is a
path freely chosen. And agency is not freedom; it defers to a
collective authority.
</P>
<P>
   An agent might be a congregant who joins an independent church
and becomes devoted to its mission. Or an agent might be a
politician in a constitutional government whose demands are
tempered by the social contract. An agent, in Block's telling, is
the archetypally American character.
</P>
<P>
   In a densely packed dissertation tracing the origins of the idea
in the tracts, diaries and sermons of dissenting Puritan ministers
in the 1570s, Block follows its evolution in the works of Thomas
Hobbes and John Locke until it comes into its own in Colonial
America.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Block suggests, the American Revolution cannot be fully
understood as a fight for independence and liberty. Those were
terms used to persuade the agrarian populace to join forces with
the political elite in service to a common good. Instead of
enshrining liberty, the Revolution enshrined agency.
</P>
<P>
   This is why, Block argues, American history has always involved
a tension between individual freedom and collective demands. From
the start, untethered liberty was seen as a danger; it was
indulgent and potentially disruptive. But servitude to an
unquestioned authority was just as troubling. So iconoclasm and
conformity continually clash; the compromise is a notion of agency
where freedom freely serves a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing a new paradigm, Block is not the typical brash
young scholar. He is 53, has practiced law and teaches political
science at DePaul University in Chicago. But his doctoral adviser,
Martin E. Marty, a professor emeritus of the University of Chicago,
calls his work a ``tour de force'' that confronts us with ``a
radical rethinking of American traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get used to the word agency alongside liberty when reckoning
with American life,'' he said. Block's interpretation also raises
questions about contemporary political culture, in which the very
existence of common goals is challenged. At the moment it is being
identified, then, is agency about

BLOODLESS KNIFE FOR EPILEPSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 1 percent of the population, nearly 3 million people in
the United States, has epilepsy. Because drug therapy is not always
effective, finding new ways to treat the disorder without the risk
and cost of open brain surgery has been of keen interest to medical
researchers like Nicholas M. Barbaro, a neurosurgeon and epilepsy
specialist at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barbaro and his team at the UCSF-Stanford Medical Center are
joining with specialists at four other leading epilepsy treatment
centers _ Yale University, the University of Pittsburgh,
Northwestern University and the University of Virginia _ in a study
to see if there is an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Their study will focus on 40 patients with temporal lobe
epilepsy, which is known to be resistant to drug therapy but can be
located precisely in the brain and is very responsive to
traditional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium has applied for a $2 million grant from the
National Institutes of Health to make a two-year study of the
safety and effectiveness of a bloodless radiosurgery technique with
a $5 million piece of equipment called the Gamma Knife.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamma Knife, made by the Swedish medical technology firm
Elekta, focuses low-dosage gamma radiation from 201 sources on a
precise target in the brain. Areas adjacent to the target receive
only slight doses of radiation, while the target gets the full
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the Gamma Knife was used only to treat tumors and
vascular disorders of the brain, not epilepsy. But animal tests
showed promise, and in November a team of French doctors published
a preliminary report in the medical journal Epilepsia that claimed
the elimination of seizures in six of seven human patients who were
treated with the Gamma Knife.
</P>
<P>
   But the apparent success of the French study, Barbaro, the
study's principal investigator, said, raises almost as many
concerns as hopes, highlighting the importance of a larger and more
controlled study in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already know the French have gotten a pretty favorable
outcome, with the vast majority of their subjects becoming
seizure-free,'' he said. ``But there are still big questions, and
we're concerned that as soon as a couple of their publications come
out, everyone with a Gamma Knife will think they can try this
without having enough long-term data to decide the most effective
and safest protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barbaro said, the French study did not compare the
effectiveness of low and high doses of radiation, as the American
study will. He added that there have not been enough subjects to
determine the safety and effectiveness of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider our study to be a pilot,'' Barbaro said. ``We
believe you should treat 100 patients or more before you're able to
say, `Here's the formula, here's how you treat epilepsy with a
Gamma Knife.' We won't have good, hard data about safety until
then.''
</P>
<P>
   But if larger studies continue to show positive results, he
said, the benefits of Gamma Knife surgery may be great. For
example, children with drug-resistant epilepsy who have
radiosurgery may be able to reduce or eliminate the antiseizure
medication that has been shown to depress IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer patients will suffer postoperative language impairment,
``something that's unavoidable in an open surgical procedure,''
Barbaro said, because radiosurgery does not require cutting through
the outer surface of the brain where language skills are located.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Barbaro said, especially if lower doses are found
to eliminate seizures effectively, the ``potential exists to treat
people who cannot be operated on today,'' particularly those whose
epilepsy is centered in parts of the brain that affect speech and
movement.

DICK VAN DYKE: PUT ON A HAPPY FACE 
Produced by: Peter Jones 
Date: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
On: A&AMP;E 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a great story buried in ``Dick Van Dyke: Putting On a
Happy Face,'' A&AMP;E's shapeless two-hour biography premiering Sunday
at 8 p.m. Properly pruned and focused, this might have been a
layered drama about the pathos under the comic mask, the emotional
pain beneath the funnyman's fierce ambition and years of hoofing
and mugging, the never-say-die failures and often personally
unrewarding successes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, this is a stiffly chronological, woodenly
executed account of the comedian's checkered career and
alcohol-haunted family life that only ardent Van Dyke fans and
students of sitcom minutiae could love.
</P>
<P>
   There's a wealth of material, including clips from the pilot
that led to the 1961 breakthrough ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,''
starring not Van Dyke but the show's creator, comic writer and
performer Carl Reiner. The show's producer sensed that it would
work better with a different actor in the lead role, preferably Van
Dyke or Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   We also learn the names and birth dates of all of Van Dyke's
children, and where he moved and when. As with so many other
programs in the A&AMP;E ``Biography'' series, information is heaped on
indiscriminately, without much sense of its relevance or dramatic
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke, now the star of ``Diagnosis Murder,'' worked
tirelessly and with little success first in vaudeville and then in
radio, and, later, in TV, as a kids' show host, game show host, and
morning show anchor. He tried Broadway but the musicals he was cast
in failed, until the 1960 hit ``Bye Bye Birdie'' earned him sorely
needed recognition.
</P>
<P>
   He had a long and apparently happy first marriage that turned
out to be marinated in drink. Interviews with his brother Jerry,
colleague Mary Tyler Moore, and a few of Van Dyke's grown children
inform us that he's not merely private but an inaccessible,
obsessive loner. Van Dyke speaks of his battle with the bottle, but
aloofly, and neither he nor this two-hour documentary cares to
explore seriously the emotional distance he keeps between himself
and even members of his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Van Dyke: Putting On a Happy Face'' is fact-filled to a
fault, the TV equivalent of a hastily written term paper, too often
padded formlessly with odds and ends.

ANIMAL RIGHTISTS OFF TO A FAST START IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM

<P>
   What a millennium this is going to be! Fasten your seat belts,
animal lovers, because this thousand years is launching with a boom
in books and TV shows concerned with animal minds, emotions, and
status.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Wise's provocative ``Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal
Rights for Animals'' (Perseus, $25) is due out in February; Marc
Hauser's ``Animal Minds: What Animals Really Think'' (Henry Holt
and Company, $25) in March.
</P>
<P>
   So it's crucial you get your feet wet on the subject with the
new ``Nature'' miniseries, ``Inside the Animal Mind,'' which starts
Tuesday night at 8, on Channel 2, and continues on Jan. 11 and 18.
The longtime voice of PBS's ``Nature,'' George Page, is the
executive editor (though it's Steve Kroft of ``60 Minutes'' we
hear). Page has also written a companion volume, ``Inside the
Animal Mind: A Groundbreaking Exploration of Animal Intelligence''
(Doubleday, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   TV people can be shameless with titles, can't they? Not quite
groundbreaking, the package is more a beginner's guide to the
beast-brain universe. In three hours, the show covers the biggies:
issues such as problem solving, abstract thought, navigation,
emotions, awareness of self, and the definition of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And we hear from many of the field's biggies: Jane Goodall,
Temple Grandin, Marian Dawkins, and our own Dr. Nicholas Dodman
from Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine. But the best
part is the animals ths. In one study, pigeons trained to
peck at ``like'' images (all trees, for example) on a TV screen are
shown to be capable of distinguishing a Picasso from a Monet _ for
a reward pellet, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Lowly chickens are found to produce direct, meaningful calls.
The warning to others of a hawk overhead is different from that for
a ground predator. And hearing these separate calls, the other
chickens take appropriate action _ ducking or heading for a corner
of the coop. Meerkats and vervet monkeys have similar discrete
warnings for various predators.
</P>
<P>
   In one segment, ewes are shown images of familiar sheep faces on
doors. The females choose a door as though participating in a
woolly version of ``Mystery Date.'' If not in season, a ewe will
always select a female from her group. If she is sexually
receptive, however _ here comes the naughty bit _ she will choose a
particular ram of her liking. It's amazing to see an animal study
the faces and then run for a door.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Nelson, the charismatic macaw that trundles off to
bed with owner Christine. Nelson contentedly cuddles as Christine
reads a book, but when her husband, Paul, attempts to climb in with
them, Nelson flies into a rage _ biting the nervy interloper. This
comes during the portion on ``jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sweet scene in which Goodall sian
interview, a vast savanna for a backdrop. She's there to describe
chimpanzee characteristics, and suddenly a very young chimp leaps
onto the boom mike being angled over her head. ``Mischievous!'' she
cries out with a hard, unguarded laugh of complete delight.
</P>
<P>
   We meet a pet magpie who tricks the household dogs with duck
cries, baboons fascinated with mirrors, and a chimp that can
immediately locate a real banana in a real room after being shown a
toy banana hidden in a small-scale replica of the room. We witness
elephants gravely examining the bones of dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things to ponder. Grandin, a well-known professor
of animal sciences at Colorado State University is autistic. She
says that because of her autism, she thinks in pictures, not words.
She believes that animals may do the same, and that she may have
particular insight into their minds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing threads to run through the series
involves the comparison of human brain chemistry and activity with
that of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, high-tech scanning techniques prove that similar
areas of the brain are activated in both man and animal when
performing similar tasks, such as creating a mental map. And as for
chemistry, Dodman lets us sit in on a few of his behavioral cases
at Tufts in part two: ``Do Animals Have Emotions?'' There is a
beautiful greyhound named Jeff that has terrible separation
anxiety, and Tasher, a stressed-out, self-mutilating cockatoo.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinary behaviorist points out that, in these cases,
human medications, such as Prozac, are used in the same way with
animals. There is a great deal of fuss about whether animals feel
some emotions as we do. In the book, Page quotes Dodman as saying,
``Look, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, we have to
investigate the possibility that it's a duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with big concepts, there are wonderful scientific tidbits.
When a puppy, or any other mammal for that matter, is born, the
amygdala, the portion of the brain that acts as a radar for danger,
is the only fully developed part. Consequently, early traumas can
lead to phobias.
</P>
<P>
   Oxytocin is a hormone that may play a role in sexual pleasure.
It is also released during childbirth and promotes pair bonding
between mother and child. The sight of a baby face _ animal or
human _ can stimulate its production. This emotional glue is also
key in keeping the famously monogamous pairs of prairie voles
together for life. And that commitment can apparently be
jump-started with an injection of this very hormone. Just think of
the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   One odd element in a series about intelligence is the tendency
of the narrator to ask obvious questions, as though the viewer were
a child. We watch a bird locating buried nuts, ``Is this the
limit'' of animal intelligence? we rubes are asked. ``Do any other
animals have insight?'' we're queried after watching chimps. Simple
declarative sentences would be less patronizing. I know, I know,
they're only human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Animal Mind'' doesn't quite hit the heights or
reach the depths hoped for. But to catch even a glimpse of the
mental powers of killer whales, chimps, dogs, rats, dolphins,
elephants, orangutans, birds, and bees is nothing short of
thrilling.

ELIOT AND SPENCER: A NOVELIST'S REVENGE AGAINST A SOCIAL
DARWINIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Hrdy is CQ) 
(bl) 
 By SARAH BOXER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the author of ``Mother Nature,'' plans to
raise Darwin's consciousness. Never mind that Ms. Hrdy, a social
anthropologist, is more than 100 years too late to talk to Darwin
and that her ally in re-education, the novelist George Eliot (nee
Mary Ann Evans), is dead too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that all the major themes in the novels of
Eliot were written as a response to social Darwinism,'' Ms. Hrdy
said, and more specifically as a response to Herbert Spencer, who
coined the phrase ``survival of the fittest,'' which Darwin
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot met Spencer in 1851 in London. ``He was the first
broad-ranging intellectual she met. He knew biology, culture,
history. He taught her about Darwin's theory of evolution,'' Ms.
Hrdy said, and before long Eliot fell in love with him and ``threw
herself at his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote to Spencer: ``If you become attached to someone else,
then I must die, but until then I could gather courage to work and
make life valuable if only I had you near me. I do not ask you to
sacrifice anything _ I would be very glad and cheerful and never
annoy you.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer rejected her. And the reason he gave was a eugenic one _
that Eliot was not beautiful enough to give him beautiful children.
``He was a pangenesist,'' said Ms. Hrdy, who studies how parents
invest in their children. ``Like Darwin, Spencer believed that
there are male and female components in the gonads.'' And he
assumed that it is the male who gives the child mental powers and
the female who gives the child beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot got her revenge in fiction, and unlike her peers ``she got
the genetics right'' too, Ms. Hrdy said. She understood that
``physical and mental traits can derive from both parents and sort
themselves out in unpredictable ways,'' that ``what you see is not
what you beget.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mill on the Floss,'' Eliot has poor Tulliver marry an
airhead beauty _ ``I picked the mother because she wasn't o'er
'cute'' (overly acute) _ and the happy couple wind up with a clever
daughter and a dull-witted but handsome boy. The father ponders his
folly: ``When a man's got brains himself, there's no knowing where
they'll run to.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Eliot's sly critique of Spencer have to do with
Darwin? ``No one disputes the brilliance of Charles Darwin nor the
soundness of his basic theories of natural selection, but Darwin
had a blind spot where women were concerned,'' Ms. Hrdy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Spencer, Darwin convinced himself that because females
were especially equipped to nurture, males excelled at everything
else,'' she writes in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot went on the attack by populating ``Middlemarch,'' ``Daniel
Deronda'' and ``Adam Bede'' with beautiful heroines who end up
being anything but ideal mothers and mates.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Middlemarch'' Eliot has Dr. Tertius Lydgate, the character
with a ``strictly scientific view of women,'' ruined by his
supposedly ideal wife, Rosamond, with her ``lovely little face.''
It is ``a fictional case study against the idea of ideal types,''
Ms. Hrdy said.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Victorian notion of ideal types is dead,
consider the concept propounded by evolutionary psychologists today
that there is an ideal feminine beauty _ a perfect hip-to-waist
ratio _ which maconsciously use to select the best mothers
for their children. Where are you now, George Eliot?

FROM A MEDIEVAL CALENDAR, SCENES OF LIFE AT THE LAST MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: the 135-word precede should be italicized)  
 (bl)  
 By JOYCE JENSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its appearance, with 12 months represented in 12 pages, is not
so different from that of a calendar you might find hanging on a
kitchen wall (except for the words in Latin). But the Julius Work
Calendar is nearly 1,000 years old. It was probably created by a
cleric working in the manuscript studio at Canterbury Cathedral in
England. Down the left side of the page are the days of the month
in Roman numerals, and on the right the names of saints and
religious festivals. Across the bottom runs a delicate drawing
illustrating the task of the month. Over all the calendar offers a
window on life in England at the start of the second millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Here are explanations of the drawings based on excerpts from
``The Year 1000'' by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger, published by
Little, Brown &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   JANUARY: ``The ploughman feeds us all,'' declared Aelfric, the
Wessex writer and schoolmaster who, in the years 987 to 1002, had
his pupils observe and analyze the various economic activities
around them. The wheeled plow was the foundation of life for
English people in the year 1000. January's drawing shows a man with
a plow making furrows of freshly turned earth.
</P>
<P>
   FEBRUARY: February displays a yard of vigorous vines being
pruned. As the wheeled plow embodied millennial man's mastery of
the soil, the skillful pruning of branches demonstrated his ability
to create a working partnership with bushes, vines and trees.
</P>
<P>
   MARCH: The average person was represented by the man with the
spade or, in the illustration, the man with the rake, the mattock
or pickax, and an apron full of seeds. March 21 was a magical date,
with exactly the same number of hours in the day as in the night.
At the bottom of the calendar are two notations: NOX HOR XII (Night
hours 12); HABET DIES HOR XII (the day has 12 hours).
</P>
<P>
   APRIL: The Roman Catholic Church in England celebrated Easter on
the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring
equinox. The holy day, which came at the end of the 40-day Lenten
fast, was celebrated with a feast; thus the calendar depicts a
group of revelers with their cups raised. Meat was the principal
ingredient of an Anglo-Saxon banquet. Poultry was considered a
luxury and was also recognized as a therapeutic. addition to the
diet of the sick or invalid. Old English recipe and remedy books
show that chicken soup was already renowned for its restorative
powers.
</P>
<P>
   MAY: In the year 1000, England under King Ethelred II enjoyed a
prosperity unmatched in northern Europe. Surviving documents
testify to 10th-century trade in wine, furs, fish and slaves, and
there is evidence that English woolen cloth was being exported to
Europe a couple of centuries before the millennium. Clearly the
Anglo-Saxons were sheep-rearing folk: the calendar drawing for May
shows a flock cavorting under shepherds' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE: The word carpenter is said to have come from the Latin
word carpentum, the sturdy two-wheeled cart developed by the Celtic
woodworkers of ancient Britain, which was much admired by the
Romans. That cart, being loaded with tree trunks, is June's
illustration. In the year 1000 the forests were a center of life.
They provided fuel, building material, a place of refuge from
invaders and a larder of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   JULY: Hay month was the first great harvest of the year; the
farmers needed the grass cut and dried before the rain could spoil
it. The July harvest would provide enough feed to maintain the
animals through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST: Aug. 1, known as Lammas Day, is one of the oldest
English country festivals. It marked the day when the first loaf
from the new harvest was consecrated. The drawing for August makes
clear that harvesting for this Lammas, or loaf Mass, was an
activity that involved the whole community. No less than seven
laborers _ more people than in any other drawing in the cycle _ are
sweeping their sickles, cutting the wheat, binding it into sheaves
and loading it into a Saxon cart.
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER: In this month's drawing two Anglo-Saxon adventurers
are heading into the woods in search of big game. In September
villagers would hunt the free-range pigs that roamed the woodlands
to stock up for the harsh winter ahead.
</P>
<P>
   OCTOBER: October depicts hunters with falcons attached to their
wrists. Their quarry is the huge European crane, a common sight in
England until it was hunted to extinction in the 16th century.
Hunting in 1000 was still a democratic pastime. Every freeborn
Anglo-Saxon had the right to enter the forest and bring home game
for the pot. Medieval hunting was both a metaphor for war and a
preparation for it, as it trained riders and horses and fostered
the camaraderie of the warrior band.
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER: Theft was not taken lightly in the year 1000: in the
drawing for this month, a figure standing beside a pile of wooden
planks is suspected of being a thief and is brought to justice.
Under the rudimentary codes of the time _ there was no police force
or prison _ he would be hanged if found guilty. The risk was most
severe for those who could not buy their way out; the rich could
pay for their transgressions at the rate of 125 pounds of silver
for each human life they had taken.
</P>
<P>
   DECEMBER: December's drawing shows a group of ordinary people
flailing, winnowing and carrying away the harvest, which is
probably how most people in England prepared for and greeted the
beginning of the second millennium. Only the literate were in a
position to concern themselves greatly with what would happen when
_ as the Anglo-Saxons would have put it in the older Roman numeral
style _ the year DCCCCLXXXXVIIIJ became a simple M.

RETHINKING THE GRAFFITI WARS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graffiti may seem like a strange subject for a scholar, but for
Joe Austin, a professor of popular culture, the effort to eradicate
graffiti in New York during the 1970s and '80s illustrated a
sociological phenomenon known as deviance amplification.
Translation: The more attention bad behavior gets, the more young
people want to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The graffiti wars began in the early '70s and continued through
the 1975 fiscal crisis and 1977 blackout in New York. For city
officials, ``graffiti was the visible sign it had lost control,''
said Austin, who teaches at Bowling Green State University in
Bowling Green, Ohio, and studies the clash between youth culture
and authority.
</P>
<P>
   City officials believed that if graffiti went unchecked it would
signal a general lawlessness and more serious crimes would follow.
This is sometimes called the broken-window thesis, popularized by
James Q. Wilson, now a retired professor at the University of
California in Los Angeles, and George Kelling of Rutgers University
in an 1982 article in The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allowed one window to break in a neighborhood and it
wasn't repaired, people would think you can do other acts of
vandalism,'' Austin explained. ``Eventually this would become,
`It's all right to mug and rape people,' and a general sort of
social chaos would ensue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Austin argues that the graffiti wars had an unexpected
result: the more publicity the campaign got, the more writers
sprayed-painted their work across the city.
</P>
<P>
   His research does not rely on the standard scholarly tracts. His
archives include graffiti magazines like The International Get Hip
Times, Flashbacks and Styles for Miles. He has also interviewed
more than 100 graffiti writers, whom he considers artists. His work
is to be published by Columbia University Press as ``Taking the
'
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on graffiti in New York became a game of cat and
mouse between the police and artists, said Austin. ``The code of
ethics of a graffiti writer is you don't write over another
person's work unless you are trying to provoke him,'' Austin said.
So to create dissension, the police marked over the artists' work.
</P>
<P>
   To confuse the police, graffiti writers adopted different tags,
or names. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had a list of
the 10 most wanted artists. ``It was really only five guys,''
Austin said. ``Three of the names were of one person.''
</P>
<P>
   One effect of the crackdown, Austin said, was that the quality
of the artwork declined. Artists began doing fly-by-night drawings,
called throw-ups, of the kind mostly seen in the city today.
</P>
<P>
   Austin estimates the city spent about half a billion dollars
between 1970 and 1990 trying to eradicate graffiti. By the mid-'80s
most of the graffiti on subway cars was cleaned up. But he argues
that crime on the subways during those 20 years did not
significantly decrease. ``The correlation between graffiti and
crime had no basis,'' he said. Most experts believe, Austin said,
that the economy is the major influence on the city's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   The city, Austin said, ``repressed a really important art
movement in the 20th century, coming from young people who came
from poor backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually takes a lot of skill to produce a mural that is
100 feet long and 12 feet high,'' he said, referring to the length
of a subway train. ``It served to deflect young people from
membership in youth gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than squelching graffiti, he added, the city should have
used it to beautify urban spaces.

A YEAR OF FLUFF, SMUT AND LETTING OFF STEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any critic to comment upon this final year of the Century of
American Music, and you're likely to hear a heavy sigh. The year
1999 gave us fluff and smut, the inflatable sweethearts of the
teen-age market and the foul-mouthed bullies of hip-hop and rock.
Releases from aspiring legends like Nine Inch Nails, R. Kelly and
Mary J. Blige failed to make the anticipated cultural impact, while
previously dismissed artists like Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock rose to
rule the Zeitgeist. People actually looked to Cher, rising again
with her smash ``Believe,'' as a beacon of artistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Step outside the bubble of critical debate, though, and this
year's pop sounds much more exciting. It was a great year for
arrogant fans using music to air their opinions and elaborate upon
their daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   The year's hits expressed ethnic pride, encapsulated gender
debates, and revealed some crucial attributes of a new generation.
Only a few songs would prompt listeners to pause for reflection;
their hearty jokes and bold declarations defeated subtlety. But for
the crowds mightily singing along, the soundtrack to 1999 offered
inspiration and release.
</P>
<P>
   Bratty boys and sassy girls faced off across the genres. TLC's
``No Scrubs,'' the spring's ubiquitous hit, refreshed the theme of
the no-good man and became the favored chorus for finger-snapping
groups of girlfriends nationwide. It inspired an answer song, ``No
Pigeons,'' by Sporty Thieves and set the stage for similar
pronouncements from Destiny's Child, Whitney Houston and Mariah
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``. . . Baby Hit Me One More Time,'' which had parents
worrying about the masochistic messages the high school heroine
Britney Spears might be proffering, is really yet another song
about romantic confrontation, and Ms. Spears' steely gaze was as
suggestive an aspect of her video as her schoolgirl outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Male artists presented their own boot-camp chants for the battle
of the sexes. Limp Bizkit's crassly sexist songs the most likely to
make it onto a World Federation Wrestling soundtrack, but they were
hardly alone. The modern rock bands Lit and Blink 182 took callow
whining to new heights with ``My Own Worst Enemy'' and ``What's My
Age Again?'' LFO took a laid-back approach to the same cocky
attitude in ``Summer Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   These songs were the antidotes to the craven entreaties of
teen-age idols like the Backstreet Boys, whose hyper-romanticism
set impossibly high standards for average Romeos. They fed a mood
of frustration that hit its nadir at Woodstock, where the old,
shameful connection between rock's transgressiveness and misogyny
resurfaced via sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   It was a horrifying moment, but hardly inexplicable given pop's
rude mood. Musical expressions of racial identity were often as
blatant, although not as hateful, as those about sex. The much
touted ``Latin pop explosion,'' for example, was driven by Ricky
Martin's ``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' a novelty song based on the most
obvious stereotype: a mocha-skinned temptress who would have worn
fruit on her head in another era. (``Smooth,'' the comeback hit for
Carlos Santana, relied on similar images of Latin heat and
coolness.) But because Martin delivered it with a self-aware grin,
the cliche charmed instead of offended.
</P>
<P>
   The year's best-selling rock album also relied on a racial
lampoon, which happened to expose a generational reality. With
little fanfare, the Offspring's late 1998 release, ``Americana,''
outsold both Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock, mostly because of a song
that satirized what those groups stood for. ``Pretty Fly (for a
White Guy)'' leveled scorn at a suburban would-be gangster, giving
many white hip-hop fans a humorous way to face their dubious ghetto
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper Eminem, a protege of the venerated hip-hop producer
Dr. Dre, threw the joke back with his single, ``My Name Is,'' which
presented race-crossing as a trickster's game instead of a
dangerous conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these exaggerated expressions of pride and anxiety were pop
moments that simply vented collective steam. Hip-hop is always
fertile ground for creative babbling, and this year it turned the
radio into a veritable playpen. Choruses of ``Holla, holla'' and
``Ay-yi-yi-yi . . . who dat?'' arose wherever hip-hop fans gathered
to dance, echoing hits by Ja Rule and JT Money with Sole. Most
successful was Jay-Z, who had millions shouting out his nickname
with ``Jigga'' and whooping like owls along with the cleaned-up
chorus of ``Can I Get a . . . !'' Modern rockers rode the
nursery-rhyme mood with sing-alongs like ``Steal My Sunshine'' by
Len and ``All Star'' by Smashmouth.
</P>
<P>
   There were exceptions to the year's ridiculously extroverted
mood, even at the top of the charts. Marc Anthony dignified the
fascination with all things Latin with the elegantly lustful ``I
Need to Know.'' Brandy and Monica both encouraged teen-age girls to
stop screaming and start thinking with their modest, pensive
ballads.
</P>
<P>
   TLC followed ``No Scrubs'' with ``Unpretty,'' a vision of the
beauty myth that's remarkably complex, musically and lyrically. A
few steps away from the hit parade, artists like Moby, Mos Def,
Kelly Willis and Magnetic Fields made intricate music that rewarded
careful listening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the nation's party people usher in a new era this
weekend, they'll probably be listening to big, silly songs that
reflect the year's rowdy mood.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes back to Cher: whether people believed in their
machismo or feminine wiles, their cultural heritage or racial
loyalties or simply the life after love that the bewigged diva
touted in her high-energy anthem, they wanted to make known their
most accessible emotions. And pop, more than ever the truly public
art form, gave everyone the means to get good and loud.

DISCOVERING A DEFICIT OF ATTENTION DEFICIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Britain) (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 1.5 million to 2.4 million (or 3 percent
to 5 percent) of schoolchildren in the United States have
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. And tens of thousands are
regularly given drugs like Ritalin to combat it. But in Britain the
diagnosis is made for fewer than 1 percent of the schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jacobson, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, decided to investigate why.
He says he believes his is the first cross-cultural study of the
disorder. His findings are sure to contribute to debate over
whether attention deficit disorder is the result of biology, as
most experts now believe, or the creation of a society addicted to
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Examining 10- and 11-year-olds in Oxfordshire and in western
Massachusetts, Jacobson found that there was little difference
between the behavior of children in whom the disorder is diagnosed
and those found to be normal. Both groups surpassed the average for
inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including
restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not
listening and fidgeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The default condition that children will revert to is ADHD,''
Jacobson concluded. Though he holds master's degrees in
neuroscience and anthropology, he is skeptical of the theories that
the disorder is due to an absence of neurotransmitters in the brain
or abnormal glucose metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are inclined to diagnose a child as ADHD,'' he said,
``you have ample opportunity. And if you are inclined not to
diagnose a child, you also have ample opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of identifying the disorder has been recognized
for years. In 1998 a panel of experts commissioned by the National
Institutes of Health found that a consistent diagnostic method for
the disorder had proved elusive. In December, a landmark study by
the national institutes on treatment of the disorder found that the
drug Ritalin was more effective than behavioral-modification
therapy, which is what is primarily used in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might use Jacobson's preliminary findings, which he
presented at the Society for Psychological Anthropology in New
Mexico in September and again at the American Anthropological
Association in Chicago in November, to conclude that the disorder
is simply widely underdiagnosed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson recognizes this and says he has to do more work on why
the British rate is so low. But he is convinced by his study, which
should be completed in the spring, that the direct connection made
between attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities is
false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something else is the cause of the problem that kids
don't learn up to level that they are being compared to,'' he said.
``All children have talents, and all children have needs. What we
are doing by focusing on ADHD is focusing on a few kids' needs. So
we have a whole group of kids who have special needs and are not
getting attention.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harris Yulin doesn't have a killer's face, but if you
saw him walking down the street you could be excused for taking
cover.
</P>
<P>
   In his 40-year career, after all, Yulin has played more than a
few disreputable characters, from the sleazy cop in Brian De
Palma's 1983 cult movie ``Scarface'' to his recent turn as a
double-dealing politician in the film ``Cradle Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   It is casting, the actor said, that has more to do with his
stern, rugged looks and almost senatorial presence than with any
preference on his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not always the bad guy,'' he said recently, with a shrug.
``It just seems to be what I'm known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Yulin has been turning that gruff reputation on its head
with his subtle turn as Walter Franz, a damaged businessman looking
for emotional solace in the current Broadway production of Arthur
Miller's drama ``The Price.'' Ben Brantley, writing in The New York
Times, called Yulin's performance ``excellent,'' adding that Walter
seemed to be a character whom Yulin was ``born to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the only role Yulin may have been made for. Indeed, the
actor's talents are on particular display of late, with four major
projects open or coming soon. In addition to ``The Price'' and
``Cradle Will Rock,'' Yulin can be seen in ``The Hurricane''
playing the lawyer who represents that film's wrongly convicted
hero (a good guy!), and in a movie scheduled for Jan. 9 on the TNT
Network, ``The Virginian.'' There Yulin reverts to form as a
disreputable judge.
</P>
<P>
   At 62, Yulin has established himself as something of the
character actor's character actor, a quiet force who parlays small
roles into big moments.
</P>
<P>
   His status is evident in ``The Price,'' where he shares the
stage with three other accomplished actors: Bob Dishy, Lizbeth
Mackay and Jeffrey DeMunn,
</P>
<P>
   ``He pays a lot of attention to details and specifics of
characters: the hands, the voice,'' Dishy said. ``And I appreciate
it, because I work in a similar way.''
</P>
<P>
   Yulin, a smoker who talks in something like a casual growl,
didn't plan it this way. A Los Angeles native, he worked his way
through a series of professions _ and countries _ before landing on
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be a painter for a while in Florence,'' he said.
``And I was extremely bad at it.''
</P>
<P>
   After flirting with architecture, he found himself in Tel Aviv
in 1962, a time and a place he remembers as ``like Paris in the
1920s.'' There, at the urging of new friends, he began directing
and acting in small shows.
</P>
<P>
   That calling took hold, and when he returned to the United
States, he decided _ if that is the right word _ to continue
acting. ``I said, `Well, I guess this is what I'm going to do,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His first break came in 1963, when he was cast in a leading role
in a production at the Phoenix, a now-defunct Off Broadway theater.
The play was ``Next Time I'll Sing For You,'' which featured James
Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons and was notable in a couple of
regards, Yulin said.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was scheduled to open the week of Nov. 22, 1963, when
President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. (The opening was
postponed.) Second, said Yulin, the production, an absurdist take
on a novel by the Anglo-Indian novelist Raleigh Trevelyan, was
``just a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on the apron of the stage, insulting the audience
essentially, in a sort of elegant way, but insulting
nevertheless,'' Yulin said. ``I could feel waves of hate coming
from the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yulin's fortunes improved, however, and over the course of the
next decade, his standing was sealed. In 1980 he won raves in the
Broadway production of ``A Lesson From Aloes,'' by Athol Fugard, in
which he again played opposite Jones.
</P>
<P>
   His film work also began to increase, with roles in ``The
Believers,'' ``Clear and Present Danger'' and ``Multiplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, he has also teamed with his friends and
fellow actors Ed Asner and Rene Auberjonois to do staged readings
of ``Don Juan in Hell,'' a favorite of his since high school. And
last year, he directed ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' at Primary Stages.
</P>
<P>
   As he matured as an actor, Yulin says, he was also trying to get
rid of another, less seemly reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when I was young, I became known as what you would
call a difficult person to work with,'' he said with a smidgen of
pride. ``I never felt it was a question of ego, but I did realize I
offended some people.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has apparently faded with the years, at least
according to Yulin's current Broadway director, the actor James
Naughton.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that was in evidence,'' Naughton said. ``Every
rehearsal I've been in there's a day where everything goes south,
or someone goes south. It never happened with this show.''
</P>
<P>
   In rehearsals for ``The Price,'' which began at the Williamstown
Theater Festival in Williamstown, Mass., Naughton said Yulin had
only one demand: that his dog, Max, a cocker spaniel, be allowed to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max would wander onto the playing field during rehearsal,''
Naughton said. ``Harris would just look at him, point, and Max
would wander back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yulin, who divides his time between New York and Los Angeles as
work demands, often drives across the country because Max has a
fear of flying. Along the way, he says, he often stops in small
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, someone recognizes him. ``They're like, `Hey, what
are you doing here?''' Yulin says. ``And then, once they realize
I'm just an actor, people are almost always friendly and
pleasant.''

DEMOCRATIC TAKEOVER IN HOUSE COULD CURB SOUTHERN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a narrow five-seat margin separating the two
parties, Democrats are increasingly confident they can recapture
control of the House come November. Should that happen, Southern
lawmakers could well see their ranks thinned in terms of leadership
posts and committee chairmanships.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a few gains, notably the likely ascension of Rep.
John Spratt, D-S.C., to chairman of the Budget Committee. Rep. Eva
Clayton, D-N.C., could also snare a subcommittee chairmanship on
the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But there aren't many other Southern Democrats waiting in the
wings should Republicans lose their grip on the House. Many of the
old Southern Democratic lions have either retired, been defeated _
or in some cases _ switched parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southerners are a smaller proportion of the Democratic party
than they were in past decades,'' said Merle Black, a political
scholar at Emory University. ``That's especially true in the Deep
South.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Republicans could lose some significant posts.
Florida's Bill Young would have to relinquish control of the
Appropriations Committee while state colleague Porter Goss would
give up the chair of the Intelligence Committee. Ditto for South
Carolina's Floyd Spence, who would lose the helm of the House Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And Louisiana Republican Billy Tauzin _ who left the Democratic
side in 1995 _ would not realize his dream of controlling the
Commerce Committee should his former party win back control.
</P>
<P>
   The big winners in the event of a Democratic takeover may well
be black lawmakers. Georgia's John Lewis is already seeking a
leadership post. While several black Democrats like Lewis hail from
the South, the more senior members come from Northeast and Midwest
states.
</P>
<P>
   POWER SHIFT II
</P>
<P>
   While individual Southern lawmakers could lose influence, the
region should continue to gain seats in Congress. New projections
show the South and West will add to their House delegations though
at a slower pace then the past.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the 2000 Census will not produce the dramatic
regional shuffle that characterized redistricting after the 1980
and 1990 counts, according to an analysis by Election Data Services
Inc., a political consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing that we are seeing as you get to the end of
this decade is that we're not getting the major shifts that we saw
previously,'' said Kim Brace, president of the company. He
estimates 16 states will see a change in the size of their
congressional delegations after the 2000 Census and
reapportionment, which is based on state population.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, for instance, would gain just one seat after adding
four after both the 1990 and 1980 counts. North Carolina, which
added a seat last round, would remain stable. Sun Belt centers
Arizona and Texas would win two more House seats while Georgia
would add one along with California, Colorado, Montana and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin would each
drop one, along with a rare Southern loser, Mississippi. New York
and Pennsylvania are each expected to lose two seats.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC INFORMATION FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is testing the strength of a
controversial new public records law championed by Sen. Richard
Shelby of Alabama and other Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the new standard intended to increase public scrutiny of
research used to justify federal regulations, chamber officials
asked the Environmental Protection Agency for data and studies that
provided the basis for recent EPA rulings on air quality, auto
emissions and environmental justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the cost of health and safety regulations now topping
$230 billion a year, it is vitally important that the federal
government provide public access to the data and information
underlying EPA's regulatory proposals,'' said William Kovacs, a
chamber vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the new Shelby rule argue that it could be used to
stifle research that provides the basis for unpopular laws. But
proponents say that study paid for with tax dollars should be
accessible to the public. The chamber intends to take the EPA to
court if it does not honor the requests.
</P>
<P>
   NO FISHING
</P>
<P>
   Federal fishery experts say they now have evidence that putting
large tracts of ocean off limits to fishing can help replenish
dwindling stocks of fish.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term study of a 40-square-kilometer area off Cape
Canaveral, Fla., that has been closed to fishing since 1962 found
that the abundance and size of local species was significantly
greater than in fished areas. Researchers for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration also found that larger fish
migrating from the protected area can boost spawning in surrounding
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The study is likely to give impetus to the push to ban fishing
in large sections of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean to ease
pressure on declining fisheries.

 &HT;    PUTIN: WHERE WILL THE 'GRAY CARDINAL' LEAD RUSSIA?
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-YELTSIN-0101.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In just four months, Vladimir Putin emerged from the shadows of
the Kremlin bureaucracy and his KGB past to become one of the most
popular politicians in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   With the surprise resignation Friday of President Boris Yeltsin,
the enigmatic Putin, 47, a former spy and domestic security chief,
became one of the most important figures in the world as acting
president and the likely victor in new presidential elections
scheduled for March.
</P>
<P>
   Putin now has his finger on the trigger of a vast nuclear
arsenal. He also holds singular power under the country's
constitution to determine Russia's post-Soviet path.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin has come to represent stability and
moderation in a country aching from a decade of tumultuous economic
and social upheavals.
</P>
<P>
   But how and where he will lead Russia no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is perhaps the most ominous thing _ how little we know
about the man most likely to lead Russia after Yeltsin,'' analyst
Michael McFaul of the Carnegie Endowment said earlier in December.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was plucked from obscurity by Yeltsin in August to become
the country's fifth prime minister in 17 months. Polls at the time
showed that very few Russians had ever heard his name, much less
developed an opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Russians have come to appreciate Putin
as a tough-talking protagonist waging war against the breakaway
republic of Chechnya and, in turn, restoring a sense of national
pride and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In a country adrift since the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991, Russians appeared eager for a man of action. Putin's poll
ratings soared, as Russia's army waded deeper into Chechnya and
Kremlin image-builders posed the stern-faced Putin as the nation's
hands-on leader during Yeltsin's recurring illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   For his own political survival, Putin will have to perpetuate
this role.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has only 90 days to consolidate his power before the
presidential elections on March 26. His success will depend largely
on the course of the war, and his ability to hold together the
influential Kremlin advisers, business tycoons and media barons _
known collectively as ``the family'' _ that have kept Yeltsin in
power.
</P>
<P>
   ting Yeltsin and his inner circle became Putin's first
priority on Friday. As acting president, he signed a decree
guaranteeing immunity from prosecution for Yeltsin and his
relatives who fear political opponents may try to seek vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya may not be as easy to control. Some 100,000
Russian troops are amassed there against several thousand Islamic
militants. Yet the Russian forces have been unable to secure the
capital, Grozny, and reports filtering out of the republic suggest
that Russian casualties are much higher than the state-controlled
media in Moscow have reported.
</P>
<P>
   The first test facing Putin and Russia is whether the conflict
in Chechnya will become a protracted guerrilla war _ and will the
public care as they did when Russia's 1994-96 operation there ended
in disaster. So far, Putin and the Kremlin have been adept at
pressing the war and manipulating the Russian media to rally public
support.
</P>
<P>
   The popular support for Putin and the war translated into
significant gains for a pro-Kremlin party which fared well in
parliamentary elections in mid-December. Thus, Putin will have
natural allies in the new Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper questions remain, though, over how Putin will deal with a
long line of Russian ills, including the economy and a social
safety net that has all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Putin made a successful leap from cold warrior to new Russian
policymaker. But his months as prime minister have not given a hint
of his vision for Russia, other than a war that seeks to protect
old boundaries. There is not much of a record to suggest his
political leanings or depth of commitment to democracy and market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Putin and the Cabinet started a new Internet
Web site which featured a broad policy statement from the prime
minister entitled ``Russia at the Threshold of the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto suggests that Russia must find its own way in a
centrist path that rejects both the Soviet past and an allegiance
to bold democratic reforms that have left most Russians poorer than
they were during Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in an apparent criticism of Yeltsin and his band of
reformers, said Russia's biggest mistake was to seek to transform
itself into a copy of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia will not soon, if ever, become a copy of the U.S.A. or,
say, Britain,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   But the former KGB spy also bluntly criticized the Soviet era,
which he said ``failed to make the country flourish, its society
dynamic, its people free.''
</P>
<P>
   With a long Russian and Soviet history of a central state
authority, ``Russia needs a strong state power and must have it,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can count on a worthy future only if we manage to naturally
combine the principles of a market economy and democracy with
Russia's realities,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, Putin remains allied with many of the reformers
that gained such a bad name working under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   He started his political life in St. Petersburg (formerly
Leningrad), rising to the post of vice mayor under liberal mayor
Anatoly Sobchak. Known as a colorless, but effective, administrator
Putin earned the nickname the ``gray cardinal'' _ operating in the
shadows of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he came to Moscow in a move arranged by market reformer
Anatoly Chubais, a close Yeltsin advisor in the mid-1990's. Putin
became the deputy Kremlin administrator and later was put in charge
of the Kremlin's relations with Russia's powerful regional
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Putin was named head of the domestic security
service, the FSB, an arm of the former KGB, and in March was also
named secretary of the president's Security Council. In August, he
replaced Sergei Stepashin as prime minister in a surprise shuffle
by the unpredictable Yeltsin that had many Kremlin-watchers
wondering just how long Putin would last in the job.

FOREIGNERS FLOCK TO TIMBUKTU, AND LOCAL MUSLIMS WONDER WHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn., Texas, Conn.) (nk) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIMBUKTU, Mali _ ``Timbuktu 2000! Timbuktu 2000!'' cried
3-year-old Aboubacari Sidiki, as he dangled from the bumper of a
truck parked on a sand-filled street here.
</P>
<P>
   The words meant nothing to him. The boy was simply parroting the
slogan that city promoters had been using to draw in Westerners to
mark the end of an era at the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timbuktu, the city of mystery,'' went the campaign. But the
greater mystery to Aboubacari and to most grown-up residents of
this city was this: What was the big deal with the year 2000 and
why were all these foreigners _ known locally as toubab _ coming to
celebrate it here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about the year 2000,'' said Niele Maiga,
a woman in her 50s, who like most Muslims here found little
significance in the new year. ``It's this year that we first heard
about the year 2000. On the radio, they told us women that we
should keep the front of our houses and the streets clean because
the toubab were coming for the year 2000. Tonight, we're going to
sing in Songhai'' _ a local language _ ``for some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maiga was carrying a load of clothes through a winding
street, past a mud-brick house where a British explorer, Gordon
Laing, lived in 1826. Regarded as the first European to reach
Timbuktu, Laing was killed before making it back home.
</P>
<P>
   Founded early in the millennium, Timbuktu reached its peak
toward the middle, when the trans-Saharan caravan trade turned it
into the center of trade between the African interior to the south
and the Arab world to the north. Stories of great mosques,
sub-Saharan Africa's first Islamic university and vast wealth _ all
inaccessible to Westerners _ reached Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the millennium spent, so, too, is Timbuktu. A small
city of crumbling mud-brick houses, the caravan trade a distant
memory, Timbuktu is blanketed in sand. The advancing Sahara has
encircled the city in dunes. But the magic of its name has endured,
enough certainly to attract some Westerners to ring in the new year
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't I get a camel and go into the desert for the first
sunrise of the millennium?'' Larry Blum, 36, of Cohasset, Minn.,
said, explaining why he had come here. ``Most people, especially
Americans, don't even think this place exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's happening in the States?'' said Blum, who was on a
``four-month solo expedition'' through West Africa. ``Heard
anything about the NFL?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the city's allure surely remains its remoteness, at the
edge of the vast Sahara, with no paved roads leading south. Even
for those who took the easy way here and flew Air Mali,
complications arose in mid-week. Mali's president, Alpha O. Konare,
needed Air Mali _ that is to say, the one plane that makes up the
airline _ for urgent business and so delayed passengers' arrival
here by several hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the world?'' said Jehara Maiga, who was preparing
fish in the middle of the street when she was told of the West's
view of her city. She laughed uncontrollably at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   Mamadou Kamoute, a teacher added: ``For you, Timbuktu may be a
city of dreams. But for us, it's just another city in Mali.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80 Peace Corps volunteers from West Africa made up the
largest group of foreigners here. Sixty-seven had taken a three-day
boat trip from the southern city of Mopti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of figured we'd move in this direction and see what
happened,'' said Petra Cahill, 24, from Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Zehawi, 27, of Houston, said: ``Timbuktu is something I
didn't even know existed until two years ago, when I applied for
the Peace Corps and was told that I was coming to Mali, and I saw
Timbuktu on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   And so despite the locals' ho-hum attitude toward the new year,
the toubab energetically went about their plans to celebrate the
arrival of 2000 in Timbuktu. About 100 tourists rode on camels into
the desert and planned to spend the night there _ a project that
appeared incomprehensible to a group of boys hanging out near a
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good to go out in the desert at night,'' said Sidi
Baby, 12. ``It's going to be windy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These toubab, they're ... '' began Mahaldane Traore, who was
only 15, but wise enough not to complete his thought in the
presence of one.

RUSSIAN STOCKS SOAR IN WAKE OF YELSTIN'S RESIGNATION

<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin's resignation Friday drove
Russian stocks to their highest levels since the 1998 economic
collapse, reflecting hope among investors that Acting President
Vladimir Putin would revive stalled economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Trading System stock index, the main stock market
barometer in the country, rose 18 percent to 177.71. The increase
was the greatest one-day jump since July 14, 1998, when the
International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Russia $22.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, the Russian economy collapsed. Since then,
the market had languished, with periodic rallies occurring on very
low volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian company stocks traded in the United States rallied
Friday as well. Shares of cellular provider Vimpel Communications,
the first Russian company to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, rose 24.2 percent to $41. The Templeton Russia Fund, a
mutual fund that invests primarily in Russian companies, rose 35
percent to $19.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Telecom Inc., a Russian telecommunications and Internet
company traded on the Nasdaq market, rose 164 percent to $32.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose on optimism that Yeltsin's surprise resignation will
pave the way for financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund said the resignation would not
change its relationship with Russia. ``We are not into the
political side of things,'' said Stanely Fischer, the deputy
managing director of the Washington-based agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yeltsin initiated the changes that have given Russia
the beginnings of a market economy, little progress has occurred in
the last few years. Yeltsin has either been too ill or too
preoccupied with Kremlin political intrigues to forcefully push
reforms through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among investors now is that the younger, apparently
decisive Putin will take up reforms that have been stalled or
shelved.

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS LINK PLANET AS Y2K FEARS ABATE
 &HT;    EDs: This story will be updated during the evening.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As clocks ticked past midnight on Friday across the
planet, billions of people from all corners of the Earth joined in
a satellite-linked celebration of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside technical arguments that the third millennium of
the Christian Era will not actually start for another year,
hundreds of millions of people partied around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread joy at the long-waited advent of the year 2000
was tempered in some places by fears of terrorism and technology
gone awry. And security concerns threatened to cast a pall over the
millennial festivities in some mega-cities.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 200 countries, governments, financial firms,
communications' carriers and airlines girded for signs of the
dreaded Y2K bug, which could cause computer systems to fail at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications, however, suggested that the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent stamping out Y2K software bugs appear to
have paid off. As the world's computers moved smoothly through the
transition to 2000, potential problems appeared well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said as upbeat reports about computer operations poured
into his Washington command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, banks, power grids or
other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the tiny South Pacific island of Kiribati became the
first nation to see the dawn of the new millennium. It occurred at
5 a.m. EST. Kiribati was so intent on being the first that it
realigned its chunk of the international date line east by two
hours to stage the first ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   While Y2K seemingly fizzled out as a big news story, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin managed to startle the world on the last
day of the 20th century by choosing to resign after eight years as
leader of the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the New Year's Eve ceremonies, world leaders paused to pay
tribute to Yeltsin's key role in stage-managing the collapse, after
more than 70 years, of the communist-led Soviet Union and his
championing of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under his leadership since 1991, the Russian people have faced
the unprecedented challenge of creating new institutions and
building a new life after decades of corrosive communist rule,''
said President Clinton _ whose own term spans the millennium but
ends in just over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Yeltsin had stepped down and handed the reins of power
to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had scant impact on Russian and
U.S. military officers who worked jointly at Peterson Air Force
Base in Colorado Springs, Colo. to ensure that the millennial
computer bug does not trigger an unwarranted nuclear alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no glitches, everything is working smoothly.
We're in contact with Moscow all the time,'' U.S. Air Force Col.
Mike Therrien told reporters after the completion of the first duty
shift at the special Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability.
Russian and American military experts at the command center sat
side by side, jointly monitoring nuclear missile launch warning
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Further reason to celebrate came when five hijackers freed all
155 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines plane in Afghanistan after
India released two Muslim militants and an Islamic cleric, ending a
crisis that began on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But most New Year revelers seemingly paid scant attention to the
relentless flow of world events. Nearly a million people crowded
the shores of Sydney Harbor as the city that will play host to the
2000 Olympics saw in the new millennium with the biggest fireworks
display and party in Australian history.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial celebration in Fuji, New Zealand, Australia,
Japan, the Russian Far East, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle
East each marked the advent of a new century. None of these regions
reported major problems caused by the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said key sectors in his
country were all operating normally ``It's looking good so far,''
echoed Senator Ian Campbell, parliamentary secretary to Australia's
communications minister, after midnight came to Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the first of the world's mega-cities to enter the new
millennium, crowds swarmed into the bayside area for rock concerts,
traditional drum performances and another lavish fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected upwards of two million visitors to jam Times
Square in New York City, the largest such gathering since the
traditional event began in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 miles to the south, the nation's capital basked for
much of the day in unusual near-spring like temperatures as tens of
thousands of people flocked to the Lincoln Memorial for a
millennium bash to be topped off at midnight with a spectacular
high-tech sound, light and fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 seconds before midnight, Clinton and a group of children
were scheduled to light a fuse at the base of the Lincoln Memorial
that will travel across the reflecting pool in a spout of fireworks
to the base of the Washington Monument. The president's millennium
plans called for no fewer than three speeches and two separate
White House parties.
</P>
<P>
   The final ``Midnight Moment,'' held amid extraordinarily tight
security precautions, required 3,120 hours of preparation, 15 days
to set up, 135 miles of wiring, 26 pyrotechnists and 188 firing
cues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different sort of technological challenge that, five
years ago, caused the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, to
forecast that it would cost Americans as much as $600 billion to
fix computer programs that read two-digit ``00'' dates as 1900
instead of 2000 in the trillions of lines of code that make up
systems controlling everything from airplane traffic to banking
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the firm's prediction proved to be well off the
mark: The Department of Commerce currently estimates U.S. costs at
about $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the need to fix the glitches helped fuel robust growth in
the computer industry and brought out of retirement many
programmers who had created the problem in 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a millennium that left much of the world wealthier and
healthier than when it began 1,000 years ago. Particularly in the
Western world, the past 250 years has brought a sharp rise in
personal incomes and living standards. Despite many setbacks, since
the French Revolution in 1789, the world has also steadily turned
toward a democratic way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying Industrial Revolution that began around 1750
has seen the world's population increase nearly eight-fold until
today it numbers about 6 billion people.

   WASHINGTON _ As clocks ticked past midnight on Friday across the
planet, billions of people from all corners of the Earth joined in
a satellite-linked celebration of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside technical arguments that the third millennium of
the Christianll not actually start for another year,
hundreds of millions of people partied around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread joy at the long-waited advent of the year 2000
was tempered in some places by fears of terrorism and technology
gone awry. And security concerns threatened to cast a pall over the
millennial festivities in some mega-cities.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 200 countries, governments, financial firms,
communications' carriers and airlines girded for signs of the
dreaded Y2K bug, which could cause computer systems to fail at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications, however, suggested that the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent stamping out Y2K software bugs appear to
have paid off. As the world's computers moved smoothly through the
transition to 2000, potential problems appeared well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said as upbeat reports about computer operations poured
into his Washington command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, banks, power grids or
other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the tiny South Pacific island of Kiribati became the
first nation to see the dawn of the new millennium. It occurred at
5 a.m. EST. Kiribati was so intent on being the first that it
realigned its chunk of the international date line east by two
hours to stage the first ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   While Y2K seemingly fizzled out as a big news story, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin managed to startle the world on the last
day of the 20th century by choosing to resign after eight years as
leader of the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the New Year's Eve ceremonies, world leaders paused to pay
tribute to Yeltsin's key role in stage-managing the collapse, after
more than 70 years, of the communist-led Soviet Union and his
championing of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under his leadership since 1991, the Russian people have faced
the unprecedented challenge of creating new institutions and
building a new life after decades of corrosive communist rule,''
said President Clinton _ whose own term spans the millennium but
ends in just over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Yeltsin had stepped down and handed the reins of power
to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had scant impact on Russian and
U.S. military officers who worked jointly at Peterson Air Force
Base in Colorado Springs, Colo. to ensure that the millennial
computer bug does not trigger an unwarranted nuclear alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no glitches, everything is working smoothly.
We're in contact with Moscow all the time,'' U.S. Air Force Col.
Mike Therrien told reporters after the completion of the first duty
shift at the special Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability.
Russian and American military experts at the command center sat
side by side, jointly monitoring nuclear missile launch warning
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Further reason to celebrate came when five hijackers freed all
155 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines plane in Afghanistan after
India released two Muslim militants and an Islamic cleric, ending a
crisis that began on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But most New Year revelers seemingly paid scant attention to the
relentless flow of world events. Nearly a million people crowded
the shores of Sydney Harbor as the city that will play host to the
2000 Olympics saw in the new millennium with the biggest fireworks
display and party in Australian history.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial celebration in Fuji, New Zealand, Australia,
Japan, the Russian Far East, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle
East each marked the advent of a new century. None of these regions
reported major problems caused by the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said key sectors in his
country were all operating normally ``It's looking good so far,''
echoed Senator Ian Campbell, parliamentary secretary to Australia's
communications minister, after midnight came to Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the first of the world's mega-cities to enter the new
millennium, crowds swarmed into the bayside area for rock concerts,
traditional drum performances and another lavish fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected upwards of two million visitors to jam Times
Square in New York City, the largest such gathering since the
traditional event began in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 miles to the south, the nation's capital basked for
much of the day in unusual near-spring like temperatures as tens of
thousands of people flocked to the Lincoln Memorial for a
millennium bash to be topped off at midnight with a spectacular
high-tech sound, light and fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 seconds before midnight, Clinton and a group of children
were scheduled to light a fuse at the base of the Lincoln Memorial
that will travel across the reflecting pool in a spout of fireworks
to the base of the Washington Monument. The president's millennium
plans called for no fewer than three speeches and two separate
White House parties.
</P>
<P>
   The final ``Midnight Moment,'' held amid extraordinarily tight
security precautions, required 3,120 hours of preparation, 15 days
to set up, 135 miles of wiring, 26 pyrotechnists and 188 firing
cues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different sort of technological challenge that, five
years ago, caused the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, to
forecast that it would cost Americans as much as $600 billion to
fix computer programs that read two-digit ``00'' dates as 1900
instead of 2000 in the trillions of lines of code that make up
systems controlling everything from airplane traffic to banking
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the firm's prediction proved to be well off the
mark: The Department of Commerce currently estimates U.S. costs at
about $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the need to fix the glitches helped fuel robust growth in
the computer industry and brought out of retirement many
programmers who had created the problem in 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a millennium that left much of the world wealthier and
healthier than when it began 1,000 years ago. Particularly in the
Western world, the past 250 years has brought a sharp rise in
personal incomes and living standards. Despite many setbacks, since
the French Revolution in 1789, the world has also steadily turned
toward a democratic way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying Industrial Revolution that began around 1750
has seen the world's population increase nearly eight-fold until
today it numbers about 6 billion people.

 &HT;    A simpler turn of century
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My friend Cathy's grandmother is 106, and of
sounder mind, Cathy suspects, than she is herself, most days. So
Cathy will be spending New Year's Day with the woman who vividly
remembers the last turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother remembers her father shaking her awake. ``It's
1900!'' he cried, and the little girl heard the sounds of
celebrations in the streets of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of Y2K hysteria, we can't imagine the unbridled joy
of that celebration. The revelers had no fear of terrorists on
Times Square, computer meltdown, wayward nuclear missiles or
overhyped media events.
</P>
<P>
   But they faced daily terrors nearly inconceivable to us. They
didn't have to worry about some lunatic pulling a pistol on them at
the mall, but they knew they could be carried off any day by
influenza or pneumonia. Dying in childbirth or losing a child to
diphtheria were very real possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have to worry about Y2K, but they knew what it was
like to work 14-hour days, and to stoke a coal furnace.
</P>
<P>
   The things they feared _ and didn't fear _ tell us a great deal
about all that has been marvelous, and all that has been horrible,
about this century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a world without airplanes _ and without the atomic bomb.
It was a world without penicillin _ and without presentiment of
world war, the Holocaust, Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine waking up to a new century without the leaden weight of
those realities, the Pandora's Box of knowledge we dare not open
very often. It's too painful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why this year _ the biggest New Year of them all _
my heart hasn't been in it. And I usually love New Year's Eve _
none of this namby-pamby ``I just want a nice quiet evening by the
fireplace'' for me.
</P>
<P>
   At first I thought my indifference was a by-product of my desire
never to hear the words ``Y2K'' and ``millennium'' for the rest of
my natural-born days.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper reason is that I haven't wanted to take stock of the
past century. For you can't contemplate the Wright Brothers and the
Man on the Moon (pause a moment here for hometown pride) without
remembering Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You can't celebrate Winston
Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi without confronting Adolf Hitler and
Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   What would it have been like, to wake up New Year's Day 1900,
with only optimism and hope for what the shining new century would
bring?
</P>
<P>
   If only I'd had the brains to ask my grandparents when I still
could. Instead, I called the one friend who was around that night _
revered local educator Evangeline Lindsley, 103, of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   She spent New Year's Eve 1899 tucked in bed at her grandparents'
farm while her parents celebrated at a neighborhood square dance.
``They didn't make an awful lot of fuss about it,'' she recalls.
``They didn't make such a big to-do about it as they do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her memory stretches from the assassination of President William
McKinley to the Columbine massacre. In the 1920s, she tdents
that Hitler would never be appointed prime minister, ``The German
people,'' she said, ``are too civilized to follow that man with the
funny little mustache.''
</P>
<P>
   Still an avid follower of the news, Lindsley grows disheartened
at times. Yet she has never lost faith that mankind can catch up to
the treacherous miracle of technology: ``They always have, haven't
they?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a hope to hold onto this New Year's Eve. That, and the
image of a small girl, shaken awake by her father _ ``It's 1900!''
_ and greeting the century, gleaming with promise like a newly
minted penny.

   &UR; IDEAS &LR;

<P>
   The century's turn has been a time of retrospectives: what was
the most important event, who was the most influential thinker? The
Times decided to look ahead at what some of today's researchers are
working on. From the most raked-over field, like the history of the
ancient world, to the latest medical technology, scholars are
coming up with fresh insights. Some ideas may turn into
breakthroughs, and others may turn out to be dead ends, but the

EXPERIMENTAL `HYBRID' CARS MAY HAVE A ROUGH ROAD AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With hundreds of millions of dollars of private and
federal research work behind it, the Precept from General Motors,
an experimental model to be introduced here Jan. 9, is probably the
most expensive single car ever built. Yet it is still a lot of car
for the money.
</P>
<P>
   In place of side-view mirrors, which cause a lot of wind
resistance, it has tiny cameras, mounted on the front doors, that
send images to the dashboard. Rather than the smooth, rounded
contours commonly associated with aerodynamic design, carefully
angled body panels are designed to give the six-passenger Precept
far less wind resistance than a Corvette sports car. And instead of
a gasoline engine, the car has two electric motors, batteries under
the seats and a rear diesel engine to charge the batteries and
provide additional power and range.
</P>
<P>
   These features, which produce remarkable fuel economy of almost
80 miles per gallon, are expected to influence what Americans will
drive early in this new century.
</P>
<P>
   But the Precept and similar experimental vehicles from Ford and
DaimlerChrysler being built under the umbrella of the
government-sponsored Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles
face huge obstacles that raise some serious questions about the
costly partnership between Detroit and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Big Three have all focused on diesel-electric
hybrid cars. Yet federal and state environmental regulators have
just adopted new rules for tailpipe emissions that will make it
very difficult after 2003 to sell automobiles with diesel engines.
Meanwhile, Honda and Toyota, operating with much smaller government
subsidies, have already begun mass production of small high-mileage
cars that combine gasoline engines and electric motors, leaving
Detroit scrambling to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing costs for all hybrid cars, including the Japanese
models, are steep, so selling them at competitive prices remains a
money-losing proposition. Perhaps most daunting of all, there is
little sign that Americans want high-mileage cars in an era of
relatively low gasoline prices and rising national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The combination has left Detroit executives alarmed by a new
competitive threat from Japan, frustrated by what they see as
conflicting strategies among government agencies and struggling to
justify further investments in cars like the Precept.
</P>
<P>
   But Detroit auto industry leaders say that despite the problems,
they intend to continue pouring money into high-technology cars,
mainly to protect themselves in case gasoline prices soar again
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better be prepared to deal with it,'' said Harry Pearce,
GM's vice chairman. ``You don't revolutionize your industry
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest embarrassment for GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler is
that Toyota and Honda have beaten them to the market for hybrids.
The Clinton administration has given $1.4 billion over the last
five years to national laboratories, universities, auto parts
manufacturers and Detroit automakers to help in the building of a
few experimental models. Yet Japanese automakers, who were excluded
from the program, have been able to put working hybrids on sale
first.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Insight, which went on sale Dec. 15, starts at
$19,295, and gets 61 miles to the gallon in the city and 70 on the
highway. Toyota plans to start selling its bigger Prius next summer
for a little over $20,000, and predicts that its car will approach
a combined 50 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Honda and Toyota officials don't mind rubbing it in. ``We always
see our competitors talking about their projects as soon as we hit
the market with a real product,'' said Robert Bienenfeld, Honda's
manager of sales and marketing of alternative-fuel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has provided a small subsidy for the
cars. Japanese car buyers who choose the new-technology automobiles
receive a $3,000 rebate from the government. The Clinton
administration proposed a similar program in the United States last
winter. It was combined with tax cut proposals in Congress and
never made it into law, but is expected to pass once GM, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler have cars that can use such subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   While Honda and Toyota executives refuse to discuss their costs,
auto analysts say that both automakers will be losing money on
every car they sell. But with Honda planning to sell only 4,000
Insights in the United States next year and Toyota expecting to
offer just 12,000 Prius cars in the 2001 model year, neither
company's costs will be exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Detroit executives have been quick to point out, the
Insight and Prius fall far short of the roomy, high-performance
sedans that GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler hope to produce someday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Insight, for example, is essentially a two-seat, very
lightweight aluminum car with a small gasoline engine that does
most of the work. As in most hybrid cars, the engine shuts off when
the vehicle stops; once the driver touches the accelerator, a small
electric motor and modest batteries get the car moving again while
the gasoline engine turns back on.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has taken a different approach with the Prius, which
closely resembles a Corolla from the outside. Compared with the
Insight, the electric motor and batteries provide a much greater
proportion of the car's overall power. But the Prius, because it is
heavier, manages to achieve only slightly better mileage than the
smaller Chevrolet Metro. The Prius, in essence, is a compact car
with fuel economy a little better than a subcompact's.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these cars' shortcomings, Detroit automakers,
particularly GM, still feel pressure to match the Japanese
entrants. GM, which marketed the all-electric EV-1 with little
sfrom 1996 to 1998, is already studying ways to introduce a
small gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle, using its technical
partnership with Toyota, Pearce acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   While GM and Toyota officials refuse to elaborate,
environmentalists say that the companies are working on a
gasoline-electric car that would look like a sport utility vehicle
and would probably be manufactured at their joint operation in
Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are engineering limits to the fuel efficiency of gasoline
engines, and automakers appear to be approaching those limits. So
GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler have been working with the government
on diesel-electric hybrids instead. Diesel engines can be up to 30
percent more efficient than gasoline engines, but even though
today's diesels are far cleaner and quieter than earlier versions,
they still may run afoul of the new and unexpectedly tough state
and federal air pollution regulations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry's problems began a year ago, when the
California Air Resources Board met to approve a staff proposal to
require sport utility vehicles and other light trucks to meet the
far more stringent air pollution standards for cars.
</P>
<P>
   One of the board members, who are political appointees, noted
that the staff proposal did not change the rules on diesel-powered
light trucks. Yet the board had voted the month before to classify
diesel emissions as a toxic air contaminant, and automakers had
begun laying plans to build more sport utility vehicles with
conventional diesel engines so as to meet federal fuel economy
rules.
</P>
<P>
   After less than half an hour of discussion, and with no staff
analysis, the board amended the staff's proposal to eliminate the
agency's longstanding separate regulations for diesel-powered
family vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though diesels offer better fuel economy and produce lower
quantities of gases associated with global warming, they will be
subject to the same strict standards as gasoline-powered cars,
beginning with the 2004 model year. Effectively, that will mean new
cars with diesel engines will be banned from California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel economy is strictly a federal area; we don't deal with
it, we don't have the mandate to deal with it,'' said Richard
Varenchik, a spokesman for the board. Prodded by a national
lobbying effort by environmentalists against sport utility
vehicles' pollution, New York and Massachusetts are now moving to
adopt California's emissions rules, including the diesel
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton gave final approval last week to strict new
federal regulations on tailpipe emissions that will also take
effect with the 2004 model year. The federal rules are slightly
less stringent than California's standards; Gary Guzy, the general
counsel of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that with
further research, it should be possible to develop diesel engines
clean enough to comply with the least stringent category.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers will only be allowed to sell a limited number of
vehicles in that category, which they already plan to use for
selling large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. As a
result, automakers will face a choice between selling high-mileage,
diesel-electric hybrid cars or selling large, high-profit sport
utility vehicles and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers once hoped that the Republicans who control Congress
would rescue them from their environmental predicament, but that
hope is evaporating like a puddle of spilled gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by environmentalists' television advertisements in New
Hampshire criticizing air pollution in Texas, Gov.George W. Bush, a
leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said
in a debate in New Hampshire in early December that he favored the
federal air quality rules that President Clinton was about to
approve. Two weeks later, Bush asked the Texas Natural Resources
Commission to consider adopting California's auto emissions rules.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even if an unexpected technological breakthrough allows
automakers to address the emissions problems of diesel engines, a
bigger question looms: how many Americans will want very
high-mileage cars? New automobile buyers these days rank fuel
economy down with the quality of seat fabrics and interior
carpeting, behind two dozen other considerations, according to
recent surveys by Auto Pacific, a market research firm in Santa
Ana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Americans pay so little attention to gasoline these days because
it is so cheap, even after a run-up in prices over the last year.
The United States has the lowest gasoline taxes of any large
industrialized country. In Europe and Japan, where high taxes push
the price to $4 or $5 a gallon, small cars are much more popular,
which is why their citizens are expected to buy large numbers of
hybrids long before Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid cars also have a few nuisances that may irritate
Americans spoiled by the power of gasoline-powered cars. For
instance, most models _ including the Precept, Insight and Prius _
have fuel-efficient manual transmissions, which are becoming almost
extinct in the American auto market.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrids also have less power to spare for accessories. The
Prodigy, an experimental, diesel-electric car that Ford also plans
to display at the North American International Auto show early in
January where the GM car will be introduced, has an
air-conditioning system that shuts down whenever the car stops. The
car's electric motor is not strong enough to run the
air-conditioning by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuing the occupants of hybrid vehicles after crashes could
also prove tricky. While the hybrids meet federal safety standards
when crashed into concrete barriers, their batteries and
high-voltage cables pose special risks for rescuers who must cut
into vehicles to save trapped motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry and federal officials say that they plan to
continue working on all these problems, and will hope for
breakthroughs in their research.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still needs to keep working on high-technology
cars, said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, because ``getting a
highly fuel-efficient car that can meet the demands of U.S.
consumers in the market will reduce pollution and enhance our
energy security.''

 &HT;    Arkansas' looks to end string of bowl losses
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Joe Dean Davenport was being flip when he filled out
the sports information questionnaire last summer and said of how he
would favor spending New Year's Eve 1999 ``at home sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows better now.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyb talks to us says, `Y'all have to go down there
and beat the hell out of those Horns,''' the Arkansas tight end
said. ``That's the extent of the conversation. Usually there's a,
`Hello, how're you doing?' Not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The Hogs started getting clued in about what
today's Cotton Bowl meant to state pride when former coach Frank
Broyles addressed them at a team meeting shortly after they
accepted the bowl's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to us about the '69 shootout,'' Dean said. ``He
remembers it play for play. He remembers the referees' names.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is Arkansas' chance for revenge, albeit 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas is to foil those plans, the Longhorns must:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pass the ball effectively. Texas wants to run, but the Horns
figure the best way to get their offense back on track is through
the air. The Horns will run more three and four-wide sets, trying
to spread out the Hogs and neutralize their pass rush. That will
make halfback Hodges Mitchell a more potent threat on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Longhorn tight ends, particularly Bo Scaife, to
potentially play a major role.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid an early Arkansas onslaught that would only stoke the
Hogs' motivational fire. If Arkansas can shut down Texas
quarterback Major Applewhite early, the Horns' plan to get Chris
Simms some playing time could mean neither quarterback finds his
rhythm, a necessity if they are to end the frustration of six
consecutive scoreless quarters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep Razorbacks quarterback Clint Stoerner from scrambling and
making the big pass play deep by throwing it up to receivers
Anthony Lucas (6 feet 3 inches) and Boo Williams (6-5). Texas
safeties Lee Jackson and Greg Brown must help deep and bring some
wood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remind the Hogs where they are. Arkansas hasn't won a bowl
game since an 18-17 victory over Arizona State in the 1985 Holiday
Bowl, a string
</P>
<P>
   of seven straight losses.

GETTING A GRIP ON 21ST-CENTURY JARGON 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For linguistic purists, the world at the dawn of the 21st
century is, well, a mess. Management consultants, marketing
experts, lawyers and, especially in recent years, techno-geeks have
cluttered American English with shorthand indecipherable to all but
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, acronyms are so popular they are often
recycled. SLAM, for example, can mean Sea Launch Air Missile,
Strategic Low Altitude Missile, Selectable Lightweight Attack
Munition, or 10 other things. President Clinton issued an executive
order for federal agencies to use common, everyday words. This
promptly became PEI, for Plain English Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But the prize clearly goes to business, especially those in
technology. Companies like Ebay and CNET use an alphabet soup of
official names, thinking more of Internet call signs than
linguistic elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to keep abreast of new terminology might seem, to use
Silicon Valley lingo, to be WOMBAT duty _ a waste of money, brains
and time. But those who have never heard of HTML are probably
condemned to spend their lives offline, and investors who don't
understand EBITDAM might think profits still move stock prices. And
if any of that sounds like techno-babble, read on.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a crib sheet of basic business, technology and
financial terms that any layman might encounter when shopping at
Circuit City, researching a stock on the Internet, sorting through
e-mail or reading about global business:
</P>
<P>
   BANDWIDTH _ The data transfer rate of an electronic
communications system. Figuratively, brainpower. As in, he doesn't
have the bandwidth for the job.

genetic code and develop new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   BLUETOOTH _ A computer chip that will start appearing in mobile

call your Palm Pilot while riding in a taxi, if you can think of a
reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   BROADBAND _ A communications network that has the capacity to
receive different kinds of signals, like voice, data or video, at
high speeds.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   EBITDAM _ Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and (for the Internet age) marketing expenses. Updates
EBITDA, a standard Wall Street measure.
</P>
<P>
   ECN _ Electronic communications networks. As the New York Stock
Exchange and the Nasdaq well know, these new trading networks are
stealing trading activity in many of the hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE _ Since emerging markets took a plunge
and scared the rest of the world two years ago, finance ministers
have been trying to come up with a new global early warning system
to make sure it never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   GB _ Gigabyte, or approximately a billion bytes, or characters.
Many new hard drives have at least one gigabyte of storage
capacity. Say goodbye to MB, or megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   GM _ Not the car company, but genetically modified goods, as in
corn or beef. The European Union, in particular, is uncomfortable
with GM foods.
</P>
<P>
   HOTELING _ The practice of moving workers from one office (or

   SERVER _ Either hardware or software that provides a service to
clients. Most often used when bad things happen, as in, ``Our
server is down, try again later.''
</P>
<P>
   SMS _ Short message service. Forget pagers. Europeans, who have
relied on digital cell phones for years, prefer to send short text
messages by tapping on their telephone dialing pads. A distraction
for kids in class.
</P>
<P>

working at home for their own employer.
</P>
<P>
   T-1 _ A leased telephone line for connecting to the Internet,

attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   WORM _ A virus that works its way into a computer network.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ If Boris Yeltsin really meant it about being forgiven
for his mistakes when he made the stunning announcement of his
resignation Friday, as far as many people on the streets of Moscow
were concerned, he needn't have bothered.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of secretive and brutal communist rule, eight
years of topsy-turvy economics under Yeltsin and countless
political maneuvers that made little difference to their daily
grind, most Muscovites seemed simply glad to see an aging,
obviously unwell leader leave the scene _ or just plain didn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Nikolayevich can't spoil our mood today,'' exulted
Mikhail, 39, a mathematician who refused to give his last name as
he joked, swigged beer with friends at an outdoor stand and savored
the gentle snow falling on New Year's Eve, traditionally Russia's
most thoroughly celebrated holiday. Without Yeltsin, Mikhail
continued, ``things definitely won't get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've needed this for a long time,'' said Valentina Paranina,
62, a vendor. ``What was he doing already? Nothing. He was old and
sick and did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For 46 years, Mrs. Paranina has worked in what used to be GUM,
the glum Soviet state department store on Red Square whose often
empty shelves and drab assortment of wares symbolized the maudlin
monotony of communism incontrast with the czarist-era
splendor of its building and location.
</P>
<P>
   Today, GUM's arcades are light, bright and packed with Russian
and Western wares at prices beyond the reach of many Russians. Mrs.
Paranina watched stoically as customers buying last minute New
Year's gifts cheerfully plonked down ruble sums exceeding her
monthly pension of 575 rubles _ about $51 at today's rates _ to buy
the lacquer boxes and Russian dolls she sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``came here as a young girl, and I will leave as a
babushka,'' sighed Mrs. Paranina, who said she works because she
must supplement her pension. ``Of course, the difference between
when I came, and now, is heaven and earth. After all these ups and
downs, we really don't know what will be good or bad anymore. We
hope for the better. We're sick of all these bolts from the blue.
We want stability, and a good leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she see that leader in Vladimir Putin, Yeltsin's handpicked
successor who rose from relative obscurity to become prime minister
in August and is now acting president until elections in March?
``We don't know him,'' said Mrs. Paranina with the caution bred by
a lifetime of change over which she had no control. ``So far, he's
done nothing bad _ but it could well be that, as a leader, he won't
know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the gleaming DKNY store that stands close to Moscow's long
shuttered Central Market, there was a far more palpable disinterest
in Putin's and Yeltsin's fate, and that of Russia. Young Russians _
the ones who have no real memory of communism, and are often
consumed with enjoying the fruits of capitalism _ wandered in and
out, buying gifts or longingly fingering a clothing trophy they
cannot afford. ``I don't care, really,'' said one 23-year-old
vendor who gave his name only as Alexei. ``The only real thing is
that the dollar will go up. And that's all I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's ratings have shot up in the past two months as Russian
soldiers have prosecuted what the military and much of the media
have portrayed as a successful war against Islamic militants in
Chechnya. The party he supported in parliamentary elections held
just 12 days ago emerged as the likely commander of a majority in
the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday, even those who applauded the sheer political skill
of Yeltsin's move to make an all-powerful queen of his erstwhile
political pawn were not prepared to commit to Putin, although
almost everyone seemed to agree he is the next president.
</P>
<P>
   For Yeltsin, Friday's resignation, and the way he announced it
to the Russian people on television, ``is an absolutely wonderful
move,'' said Yelena Rubinchik, 55, a retired engineer. ``I think it
was planned long ago, it's politically well thought through, it's
done so it seems like Yeltsin's own initiative, not made under any
pressure. I liked his speech, apologizing, it made him seem
sympathetic, and politically he's managed to make it seem a change,
without change.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the presidential elections take place in three
months, ``everybody will be occupied with other problems, and
Yeltsin's family will be safe,'' she predicted, alluding to the
widespread belief that the retiring president's family and
associates have used his spell in the Kremlin to enrich themselves
in ways that probably broke Russian laws, and could be prosecuted
by a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubinchik was one of the few Russians questioned Friday who
pondered Yeltsin's legacy. ``His historical value will be
understood in time,'' she said. ``In my view, he made two big
mistakes _ the war in Chechnya, and not banning the Communist Party
when he could have. But he was a reformer _ it's very Russian not
to appreciate the person who brings change until long afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Sharandak definitely had other things on his mind
tonight besssia's turbulent politics. He was, he said, among
the 40 percent of Russians who didn't even bother to vote in this
month's parliamentary elections. ``For me,'' he said, ``time is
literally money. If I hadn't worked that day, I really wouldn't
even be able to put the bread on the table'' for his wife and two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Sharandak, 33, makes his living driving around Moscow in a car
whose dashboard bears the sign ``I'm looking for work.'' He
declined to say how much he makes now, or how else he might be able
to earn his living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very far from politics,'' he said. ``To vote, you have to
know something. I know more about Bill Clinton, or Ronald Reagan,
than I do about that Putin. Liberal? Democrat? People throw these
terms around, but they don't know what they mean. They gave the
people here freedom, but not knowledge. It's like putting a gun in
the hands of a child.''

 &HT;    Four Longhorn players suspended for Cotton Bowl
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls, Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    and Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Four players from the University of Texas football
team, including All-Big 12 Conference performers Kwame Cavil and
Aaron Humphrey, were suspended late Thursday for violating team
rules and will not play in today's Cotton Bowl against Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Coach Mack Brown choked back tears as he announced the
suspensions at 11 p.m. Thursday after an hourlong meeting with his
team. Brown called the meeting ``one of the most emotional things
I've ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two players suspended were backup defensive end J.J.
Kelly and linebacker Jamal Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   Brown would not say what rules the players violated, saying that
federal privacy laws precluded him from doing so. He said he
personally suspended the players.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds, who attended the
late-night press briefing, deferred comment to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown would not say for how long the players were suspended,
only that they will miss the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great young men who I love and care about very much,''
Brown said. ``The team loves and cares about them very much. We
will continue to support them in every way we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is very difficult. It's a major concern for our
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texas player who attended the team meeting said Brown did not
tell the players why the four were suspended. Brown said the team
as a whole agreed not to speak to the media about the suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   In Humphrey and Cavil, Texas lost its leading pass rusher and
pass receiver. Humphrey was voted a team captain, and he has led
the Big 12 in quarterback sacks for the past two years. Freshman
Cory Redding will start in Humphrey's place, while sophomore
Montrell Flowers will start in Cavil's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil was a third-team All-America selection and a unanimous
all-conference pick. He broke Big 12 records this season for
receptions (100) and total yards (1,188).
</P>
<P>
   Joyner and Kelly were not major contributors to the team this
season.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second scandal in the past four years to rock a
Texas football team during preparations for a bowl game. In 1995,
the day before the Longhorns met Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl in
New Orleans, it was revealed that reserve defensive back Ron
McKelvey actually was a 30-year-old named Ron Weaver, who had
already played six years of college football.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Longhorns were forced to suspend defensive back
Tony Griffin before the 1987 Bluebonnet Bowl after learning that
Griffin had flunked an NCAA drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil missed two days of practice this week. He left Dallas on
Monday to attend the funeral of his grandmother in Waco and did not
return until Wednesday. Humphrey and Joyner missed Thursday's
practice, and team officials said at the time that both were
suffering from the flu.

GEORGE HARRISON'S ATTACKER CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The man accused of stabbing George Harrison on Thursday
was charged with attempted murder on Friday and then sent to a
prison mental clinic for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exceptional course of action, but we feel you need
treatment immediately,'' the magistrate presiding over the case
told the man, 33-year-old Michael Abram of Liverpool. The
magistrate, Tim Pocock, then adjourned the hearing until Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Abram, who the police said was knocked unconscious by Harrison's
wife during the attack, is said by family members to be a former
heroin addict who is delusional, hears voices in his head and
harbors a strange hatred of the Beatles, whom he believes to be
``witches.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Lynda, told reporters that repeated attempts to get
help for her son had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had no help from anyone,'' she said. ``I feel as though
I have been totally isolated for the last six years. The system is
totally useless unless you commit a serious offense.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how the intruder managed to gain access to
Harrison's well-secured estate, set inside electronic gates and
razor wire on 34 acres in Henley-on-Thames, about 25 miles west of
London. The struggle, in which Harrison, his wife, Olivia, and the
intruder were all injured, took place in several rooms in the huge
mansion, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, 56, was said to be in pain but recovering well Friday
after treatment for a collapsed lung at Harefield Hospital outside
of London.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Craig, general manager of the hospital, said that doctors
were working to reinflate the lung, which was damaged when Harrison
suffered a one-inch-deep stab wound in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a question of waiting for the treatment to take hold
until his lung reinflates,'' Craig said. ``We hope that he will be
able to go home in a couple of days, but that depends on the next
24 hours.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thames Valley police, who are handling the investigation, said
that it was still too early to say exactly what happened during the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But what was most likely, police said, is that Abram attacked
Harrison first, slashing him repeatedly and stabbing him in the
chest, before inflicting superficial stab wounds on Mrs. Harrison,
51, when she intervened. Abram, police said, was then knocked
unconscious when Mrs. Harrison picked up a heavy table lamp and hit
him hard over the head.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harrison suffered cuts and bruises in the attack, but was
released from the hospital. She spent Thursday night at Harrison's
bedside in the Harefield surgery ward.
</P>
<P>
   In his court appearance Friday, Abram had a heavily bruised
forehead and a black left eye.

 &HT;    Y2K FEARS ABATE AS WORLD'S COMPUTERS MOVE SMOOTHLY TO 2000
 &HT;    EDs: You can expect a 1STLD writethru around 10 p.m. EST.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The hundreds of billions of dollars spent stamping
out Y2K software bugs appear to have paid off, with the world's
computers moving smoothly through the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said Friday as upbeat reports about computer operations
poured into his command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, banks, power grids or
other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far too early to declare victory,'' he said. ``I would
stress that we need to continue to monitor all of these systems
over the weekend _ and particularly on Monday when we open for
business again _ to see exactly what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, business and government leaders have been
pushing computer programmers to find and fix the so-called Y2K bug,
a software flaw that caused computers to read only the last two
digits of a date. For those computers, the date ``00'' was
understood as 1900, rather than 2000. Without repairs, that
seemingly simple problem could cause equipment to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said Friday that U. S. taxpayers have spent about $8.5
billion fixing federal computers. Private industry has spent
another $100 billion. And perhaps another $200 billion has been
spent collectively by other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Getting business and political leaders to take the Y2K problem
seriously was difficult at first because few believed that a single
flaw could have such big implications. But many became converts in
1998 when store clerks starting finding customers' credit cards
being rejected whenever they had an expiration date of ``00.'' The
computerized equipment mistakenly assumed the cards had expired in
1900.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the effort to wipe out the bug has been
massive, with the United States helping take the lead around the
world. Koskinen described the anti-bug campaign as ``the biggest
management problem the world has seen in 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going as well as can be expected and maybe even
better,'' Bruce McConnell, director of the International Y2K
Cooperation Center, said Friday as developing nations turned in
positive reports as their midnights passed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging reports came Friday morning when the
first Russian nuclear plant to pass into Jan. 1 did so without
incident. Koskinen said the Bilibino Nuclear Heat and Power Plant
in northeast Siberia above the Arctic Circle operated normally
after rolling into 2000.

 &HT;    Sports records: the core of our fascination with sports
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In ``World Record Breakers in Track and Field
Athletics,'' author Gerald Lawson wrote, ``There has always been a
touch of magic about a world record. At a moment in time, an
athlete has secured a performance unmatched by any other human
being. That is something special, even if the record only lasts one
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And if a record can stand well into a new millennium, that
really is something to savor. After watching Michael Johnson scorch
a world record 19.32-second 200-meter dash in the 1996 Olympics,
John Smith, a UCLA assistant track coach and a former record-holder
himself, gushed, ``What Michael did tonight blows my mind. He put
the record into the year 2105. They have `Star Trek' by that time.
That's just mind-boggling. I was reading the other day projections
for world records in the year 2080. The 200 was projected at
19.48.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other remarkable, record-shattering performances
as the millennium drew to a close. This year Johnson got the
400-meter record that he chased for a decade, clocking a 43.18 to
take Butch Reynolds' name off the record book. Maurice Greene
blistered a 9.79-second time in the 100 meters, bettering the 9.84
that Donovan Bailey ran in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and equaling
the expunged record that a steroid-laced Ben Johnson ran in the
1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps foreshadowing a truly memorable Olympics in 2000, a rash
of swimming records was broken, including some of the oldest ones.
South Africa's Penny Heyns broke six records in six weeks.
Australian Susie O'Neill and American Jenny Thompson erased
18-year-old marks of Madame Butterfly, Mary Meagher, although
Meagher's 200-meter long-course butterfly record remained on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when he walloped 70 homers, Mark McGwire destroyed a
record that had remained almost unchanged, except for an asterisk
attached to Roger Maris' name, for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year a giant, Wilt Chamberlain, passed away. He set
some standards that might stand until the next millennium _ along
with those of pitcher Nolan Ryan. As our chronometer rolls over to
2000 how close is man _ and woman _ to achieving their ultimate
athletic potential?
</P>
<P>
   When Frenchman Baron Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympic
ideal in 1896 after a 1,500-year deep sleep, the world was just
beginning to re-emphasize the kind of athletic competition that had
been such a significant part of the ancient Greek culture. The
marks from the first modern Olympics, set by athletes from a
handful of countries, were rather modest indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-meter dash was won by the United States' Thomas Burke in
12.0 seconds, while the recognized world record at the time was
10.8. The winner of the marathon, a Greek shepherd named Spiridon
Louis, negotiated the 40,000 meters (modern marathons are 42,195
meters) in 2 hours, 58 minutes, 50 seconds. The shot was captured
by the United States' Robert Garrett with a modest put of 36 feet,
9 3/4 inches, while the world record at the time was 47 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Women did not compete in track in the Olympics until the 1928
games when Elizabeth Robinson won the 100 meters in 12.2 seconds.
The most strenuous throwing event that year was the discus, which
Poland's Halina Konopacka won with a world-record throw of 129-11
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Records for men and women have continued to tumble since. In
some events, such as the men's 100 meters, there's been only about
a 10 percent improvement. In other tests of skill, endurance or
strength, there have been leaps of 50 percent and more. The women's
discus record is now more than 250 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records that stand out are FloJo's (Florence
Griffith-Joyner's) 100 and 200 meters and a lot of the throwing
records for men and women,'' said University of Texas assistant
track coach Dan Pfaff. ``Some of those throwing records were set by
Eastern countries in the rock and roll days.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith-Joyner, who died on Sept. 21, 1998, after suffocating
from an epileptic seizure in her sleep, set world records of 10.49
seconds in the 100 and 21.34 seconds in the 200 at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The use of steroids by some athletes, which is generally thought
to have started in the 1960s, has made it harder to determine what
the natural human limits really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``When anabolic steroids came on the scene it changed everything
and it changed everything forever,'' said Terry Todd, a UT
professor who is an expert on strength sports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Pfaff said that advances in training, nutrition and injury
prevention have been such that even with increasingly tighter drug
testing, records will continue to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of technology involved,'' Pfaff said. ``Twenty
years ago it wasn't too cool for a sprinter to be a weightlifter.
That's changed. We're still learning a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Gobel, assistant director of athletic performance at
Nebraska, added, ``It's going to keep growing. It's like Bob
Beamon's long jump. No one ever thought that could be broken. Our
kids keep getting bigger and stronger ... (1972 Heisman Trophy
winner) Johnny Rodgers ran a 4.6-second 40-yard dash and we thought
that was great. Now, 4.6 is average for a guy at that position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see significant improvement. That's without creating
a person who's superhuman,'' said Eddie Coyle who heads UT's Human
Performance Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle elaborated, ``One approach for predicting such performance
is mathematical. It's not linear, it's curvilinear.''
</P>
<P>
   A linear progression would mean that, for example, the time in
the 100 meter dash would drop a tenth of a second every decade. A
curvilinear model would project that performance increases would
slow as better marks were set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another method is physiological,'' Coyle said. ``What if you
had a person who could pump the most blood, whose muscles were the
most efficient? In the marathon people have the potential to run
under two hours. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle, who has worked with Tour de France champion Lance
Armstrong, said a person with the best of everything could run --
marathon in 1:50, about 15 minutes better than the current record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tested 10K runners where we projected they could run the
marathon in two hours. They ran times of 2:10. My guess is they
didn't train the way they needed to train,'' Coyle said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one big way records can be broken is by fast athletes
moving up to longer events. But, there's a natural tendency that
prevents that from happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``In track and field, athletes tend to compete at the shortest
distance they can be successful at,'' Coyle said.
</P>
<P>
   An example might be Tommie Smith, an incredible 200-meter runner
in the 1960s. He ran the 400 meters only a few times. In 1967,
Smith, whose future was so bright in the 400 that he was wearing
shades for the race, convincingly beat Lee Evans while setting a
world record of 44.5. seconds. He didn't race at that distance
again, while Evans won the gold in the Mexico City Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle said, ``Now, you have athletes competing at 200 and 400
meters that 10 to 20 years ago would have been running the 100 and
200.''
</P>
<P>
   The same moving-on-up principle could work in other sports as
well. Coyle said of current University of Texas women's swim coach,
``Jill Sterkel was a world-class sprinter. We did a lot of tests on
her and she also had great endurance, and she had the
determination. She would have been great at the 200 and 400. She
used to say, `Don't tell my coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle said records could be broken if athletes tried different
sports. He said, ``The talent we see at UT or the Texas Relays, if
it were focused on bicycling, we could have a lot of world records
with the power output that some of those athletes have.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women are also continuing to set records in strength
events, although comparisons across eras can be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said, ``One of the problems is the accuracy. Exaggeration
was more common in the early days than steroids are today. You
might have 20 different people claiming they were the world's
strongest man. This is a field in which legends build easily.
People get Paul Bunyanized ... You have to go by competition or
things done in a public fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd said, ``In power lifting, records have shot up. No one
bench pressed 700 pounds in the middle 1970s. Now you have dozens
of guys at 700.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those advances, Todd said, are due to sophisticated
gear. He added that some of the earlier strong men could hold their
own with the implements they used back then. One, turn of the
century strongman, Louis ``Apollon'' Uni, used to lift overhead a
barbell that was actually a set of railroad wheels weighing about
365 pounds. The almost two-inch thickness of the axle and the fact
that the wheels didn't spin the way free weights do made lifting it
quite a feat.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1950, two famous American weightlifters attempted to lift
Apollon's Wheel. John Davis did it on his fourth try, while Norbert
Schemansky was able to jerk it overhead a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Todd would like to get permission for Mark Henry to try to lift
the wheel, which is in France. He thinks Henry should be able to do
a more difficult lift with it, the press, and make a statement
about just where man stands heading into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1997 book, Lawson projected that 12 of the current track
and field records would still be around in 2015. In addition to
Johnson's 200-meter record, they were the 400-meter hurdles, the
triple jump and discus. For the women it was FloJo's 100- and
200-meter times and the 400, 1,500, 3,000 and 10,000 meters and the
discus and javelin marks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson wrote, ``The idea that human beings can continue to
improve on what has been achieved in the past is an uplifting one,
whatever the field of endeavor. It would be a sad day if no further
world records were possible. More encouraging is the belief that
out there somewhere are future champions who will one day set world
records that will make us shake our heads in disbelief.''

IN HONG KONG, MANY MARK THE MILLENNIUM AT THE RACE TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ How do you mark the passage of 1,000 years of human
history? Simple, in this city of chronic gamblers and cold-eyed
oddsmakers: You head for the track.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:45 a.m., as the last wisps of smoke from New Year's Eve
fireworks drifted away from the Happy Valley Racecourse, the crack
of a starter's gun set off the Millennium Cup. The Hong Kong Jockey
Club billed it as the first horse race of the 2000s, though rumors
swirled that it may have been edged out for first-in-the-world
status by post-midnight races in New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Such details did not dampen the spirits of more than 50,000
people who cheered wildly as one of the favorites, Floral Joy,
streaked across the line several lengths ahead of the next horse.
</P>
<P>
   If a horse-race seems an offhand way to celebrate the ultimate
New Year's Eve, remember that strictly speaking, the new year does
not even arrive here until February 5, when Hong Kong and the rest
of the Chinese-speaking world will welcome the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Hong Kong was celebrating someone else's
holiday, it threw quite a party. The city mounted a splashy
fireworks display at Happy Valley. At the stroke of midnight,
fireballs placed at 175-foot intervals around the track erupted
into a fountain of flames. An enormous illuminated dragon, which
the organizers described as the largest-ever, held court in the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   For some Hong Kong residents, gambling seemed the only way to
celebrate the millennium. ``This is the perfect atmosphere for
racing,'' said Wilson Chan, a local businessman who lost money on
the first seven races of the evening, but was sure he would win it
all back on the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Cheng, a popular local radio-show host, said horse racing
symbolized stability in this former British colony, which reverted
to Chinese rule two years ago. ``Deng Xiaoping promised us that the
dancing would go on and the races would go on after the handover,''
Cheng said, paraphrasing a now-legendary remark by the Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Cup capped an evening of festivities that also
featured performances by several of Hong Kong's biggest film and
pop stars, including Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat, and Michelle Yeoh.
Chan served as the clown prince of the evening _ singing, dancing,
and mugging with all the cheerful exuberance he brings to roughing
up bad guys in films like ``Rumble in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Of less interest to the star-crazed audience, Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa led a countdown of the final seconds of
1999. Tung then slipped away for the Hong Kong Convention Center,
where he caught a New Year's Eve concert by Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Houston performed at one of the evening's hot tickets _ a
dusk-to-dawn millennium party hosted by Richard Li, the son of Hong
Kong billionaire, Li Ka-shing. The younger Li only decided to throw
the bash a month ago, and his organizers had worked frantically
around-the-clock to book marquee performers and ready a dinner for
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Across Victoria Harbor, the Regent Hotel vied for the status of
gaudiest party. At midnight, nearly 3,000 guests gazed out of the
hotel's floor-to-ceiling windows toward Hong Kong island, where the
already dramatic skyline had been transformed in a dizzying light
show. Brilliant hundred-foot, lighted dragons wrapped themselves
around buildings, while the numerals 2,000 flashed on several
skyscrapers.

FRONT-RUNNER TO BE CROATIA'S NEXT PREMIER VOWS TOUGH ECONOMIC
REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Ivica Racan, a 55-year-old ex-Communist with a
beard and a taste for rock music, is likely to be Croatia's next
prime minister if the polls hold and an opposition coalition wins
parliamentary elections on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   And if the opposition does win, defeating the governing Croatian
Democratic Union founded by the late president, Franjo Tudjman,
Racan says he will move to cut spending on social services by 17
percent. Such a cut will not be very popular or seem very
socialist, he acknowledged in an interview, but economic
restructuring is something a desperate Croatia desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   Racan also promises that an opposition government will cooperate
better with the tribunal in The Hague investigating war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia, although he has his doubts about its
fairness toward Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   He defends the Croatian military action in 1995 that expelled
nearly 200,000 Croatian Serbs. But some in the government ``thought
they had to cover up war crimes so there would be no mud on our
common fight for an independent Croatia,'' he said. That fight is
won, Racan said. ``Certain crimes are not defensible, and we have
to prosecute them and preserve the value of our common struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Racan also pledges to meddle less in Bosnia than the Tudjman
government, which formally supported the Bosnian Federation of
Muslims and Croats but in fact worked to undermine it and preserve
a separate Bosnian Croat entity.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition wants a more powerful Parliament and a less
powerful presidency, Racan says, a fairer justice system and more
open access to state television, which currently operates as a
private transmission belt for the governing party, which has run
Croatia since independence in 1991. Creating a truly public
television service, Racan said, is the coalition's first task.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is much easier to talk about democracy when you're in
opposition than when you're in power,'' Racan said disarmingly,
looking toward his wife, Dijana Plestina, a professor of political
science at Wooster College in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his opposition to Tudjman, who died on Dec. 11, Racan is
respected here because of the way he behaved as the last leader of
the Croatian Communist Party. People believe he could have cracked
down on dissent in 1989 and 1990; instead, he threw his support
behind Croatia's first multiparty elections in 1990, which led to
the sweeping victory of Tudjman and his party.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many Croatian Serbs voted for Racan and his party
as emblematic of the more multiethnic ideals of Yugoslavia. But
today, wary about offending the strong nationalist strain in the
Croatian electorate, Racan is very careful about criticizing the
government's languid efforts to allow the return of Croatian Serbs
to Croatia, as they are supposed to be able to do under the 1995
Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be completely dissatisfied with the return of
refugees to Croatia,'' Racan said carefully, while saying that real
progress in resettling Croatian Serbs must be ``connected to the
rest of the Balkans,'' meaning Bosnia and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged the ``process has to be faster'' in every
direction, with Bosnian Croats able to return to Bosnia as well as
Croatian Serbs able to return here. Despite the risk of inflaming
nationalists, ``I don't insist on complete reciprocity,'' he said,
but then added, ``In this part of Europe, where there has been so
much human suffering and destruction, it's not easy to defend my
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that the parties of Racan and his coalition
partner, Drazen Budisa, together with another, allied four-party
opposition coalition, will take a majority of the seats in
Parliament, although the governing party will remain the largest
single party. The long-governing Croatian Democratic Union is being
helped by the aura of Tudjman, whose beaming face as he hugs a
child is featured on the party's billboards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dividing the spoils among six parties will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Budisa, 51 and a former dissident, is expected to be the main
opposition candidate in presidential elections on Jan. 24. Mate
Granic, the moderate foreign minister, wants to be president, but
the governing party is having trouble agreeing to his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The party has a strongly nationalist wing and powerful players
like the deputy speaker of Parliament, Vladimir Seks, and Ivic
Pasalic, the former Tudjman internal security adviser, are afraid
where Granic may take the party, even if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   So Granic is being tempted to run as an independent, officials
say, where he would confront a number of other candidates and hope
to make it into a second round runoff between the two top
finishers. To become president, a candidate must win more than 50
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's big economic problems _ a large budget deficit,
national debt, high unemployment, corruption and an aging
population (a fifth of the country is supposed to receive a
pension) _ will be a kind of poison pill for any new government.
</P>
<P>
   But Racan says the right words, as he hopes for Western support
in any coming restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop Croatia's fall into deeper and deeper economic
crisis,'' he said, proposing a radical cut in social spending and
the high rate of taxation, and a strong effort to privatize state
enterprises and banks, in an attempt to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   A common enough platform, but difficult here, where most state
enterprises and banks have been run for the benefit of the ruling
party or its allies, and where privatization has been murky and
corrupt, Western diplomats say, with the state bailing out the
problem firms of its friends.

   FRANCE: EXPLOSIVES LINKED TO BASQUES SEIZED
</P>
<P>
   The French police have seized a ton of explosives they said
belonged to the Spanish Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA, a
week after two powerful van bombs were found and defused in Spain.
The explosives were found in an unused garage outside the city of
Pau near the Spanish border.

   COLOMBIA: LEADER KILLS GENOCIDE BILL

<P>
   In an unexpected reversal, President Andres Pastrana vetoed a
bill that would have made genocide and forced disappearance
criminal acts. His administration shifted course after the armed
forces complained that such a law would leave soldiers open to
prosecution, in civilian rather than military courts, for deaths
inflicted in combat with leftist guerrillas.

   NEW YORK _ As the 20th century began, high-yielding railroad
shares were virtually the only blue-chip American stocks that a
conservative investor would consider. As it ended, the most popular
stocks were being issued by young companies that had never earned a
dollar, let alone paid a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the American public fell in and out of love with
the stock market at least twice, before ending the century
completely enraptured with the possibility of wealth via Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, by far the best-known average
to have endured the entire century, rose 44.26 to a record
11,497.12 on Friday. For the decade, the Dow was up 318 percent, by
far its best decade ever. For the century, it rose 26,130 percent.
(If it does exactly as well in the next 100 years, the Dow will hit
3 million a few days before the century ends.)
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip railroads of a century ago were not, however,
destined to perform as well. Many went bankrupt over the ensuing
years, and the Dow Jones railroad average, renamed the Dow Jones
transportation average in 1970, ended the century up 3,730 percent,
a gain one-seventh that of the industrials.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was a wild and largely unregulated place when
the century began. In 1901, much of the nation watched in
befuddlement as the price of Northern Pacific soared without
apparent reason, then plunged.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line had been the subject of an unannounced takeover
war, in which two powerful groups _ one led by J.P. Morgan and the
other by Edward Harriman _ tried to secure control by buying shares
in the open market. When the battle was over, speculators were
ruined as losses on Northern Pacific shares forced the liquidation
of other stocks, causing the entire stock market to plunge.
``Disaster and Ruin in Falling Market,'' read the headline in The
New York Times. ``Panic Without A Parallel in Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, companies were free to give investors as much, or
as little, information as they wished. There were no generally
accepted accounting principles, so the profit figures that were
issued were of questionable quality. Dividends _ real cash payments
to shareholders _ were the principal measure of a company's
soundness.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in the late 1920s, as individual investors
poured into stocks for the first time, and the lure of capital
gains began to take hold. There was still relatively little
regulation, and there were plenty of reports of ``pools'' that
manipulated stock prices. Many investors concluded they wanted to
make money by trading with the pools, and reports that a pool was
involved became a sure way to get a stock moving.
</P>
<P>
   The 1929 crash ended that public infatuation with stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street was a street of vanished hopes, of curiously
silent apprehension and of a sort of paralyzed hypnosis
yesterday,'' The Times reported on Oct. 30, 1929, after the worst
day of the crash. ``Men and women crowded the brokerage offices,
even those who have been long since wiped out, and followed the
figures on the tape. Little groups gathered here and there to
discuss the falling prices in hushed and awed tones. They were
participating in the making of financial history. It was the
consensus of bankers and brokers alike that no such scenes will
ever again be witnessed by this generation. To most of those who
have been in the market it is all the more awe inspiring because
their financial history is limited to bull markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, The Times was harshly critical of the ``orgy of
speculation'' in stocks that preceded the crash and sneered at
``those newly invented conceptions of finance'' that had been used
to justify such high stock prices. But it was otherwise sanguine,
forecasting that the Federal Reserve would keep the economy on an
even keel. It was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During and after the Great Depression that followed, the stock
market became an object of scorn. The Securities and Exchange
Commission was established with a mandate to prevent market
manipulation, and the Fed was given the power to keep investors
from borrowing too much money to buy stocks. Not, of course, that
anyone wanted to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It became accepted wisdom that companies should pay far higher
dividends on their stocks than they paid in interest on their
bonds. After all, the shareholder needed to be compensated for the
risk of another crash.
</P>
<P>
   But stocks did gradually recover, and by the 1950s the public
was showing a renewed interest. In 1954 the Dow rose above its 1929
high, and around the same time the dividend yield on stocks fell
below the bond interest rate. Congress mounted an investigation,
and the Senate Banking Committee called for more regulation in a
report that saw signs of dangerous speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When preoccupation with the stock market results in widespread
distortion of perspective, the stock market may become a potential
threat to the stability of the economy,'' warned the committee
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was no such threat on the horizon. By 1966, the
Dow was flirting with 1,000 _ although it could not quite manage a
close above that level. (That came in 1972.) But even as the Dow
churned in the late 1960s, investors flocked to initial public
offerings, many of which doubled during the first day of trading.
In a report dated January 1969, Merrill Lynch warned, rightly as it
turned out, that there was ``considerable risk'' in buying such
issues.

 &HT;    It was a very, very good year on Wall Street
 &HT;    By Tom Walker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The longest bull market in history showed no signs of
letup Friday as the major stock averages ended the 20th century at
record highs. The day's action rounded out a year that gave
investors an unprecedented fifth straight year of double-digit
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the surprising resignation of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, nor the highly anticipated arrival of 2000, put a damper
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely light in an abbreviated session, with many
professionals leaving early for the New Year's holiday. But the Dow
Jones industrial average closed at 11,497.12, the Nasdaq composite
at 4,069.31, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 at 1,469.25 and the Russell 2000
at 504.75. All were records.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, most analysts said the year's big stock market
story was technology _ especially the Internet, which allowed
individual investors to bypass Wall Street institutions via
burgeoning online trading.
</P>
<P>
   Two major stock averages broke into new territory last year that
most analysts had not anticipated would be entered for another year
or so.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 in March and
moved above 11,000 six weeks later. The Nasdaq composite soared
above 3,000 for the first time in November, and 4,000 two months
later.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the technology-loaded Nasdaq composite confirmed
that a ``new economy'' based on productivity-enhancing
information-age equipment was here, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The technology decade was marked by record-setting economic
growth, minimal inflation and falling interest rates that
encouraged the growth of individual investing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the stock market became the engine that
drove the economy, thanks to the ``wealth effect'' earned by nearly
79 million Americans from stock and mutual fund investments. One
study showed the total value of the world's stocks was almost $45
trillion, or more than the world's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   Last year also had a downside that might have hurt the markets,
but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year was full of negative events and surprises that kept
us on our toes,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist
for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Y2K, the Clinton impeachment trial, expectations for
a weakening economy, economic problems in South America, fear of
the Federal Reserve (interest rate increases).''
</P>
<P>
   He also said 1999 will be remembered as ``a year of few `haves'
and many ``have-not' stocks.'' That's a reference to the narrow
range of investor buying that boosted blue chips and big stocks for
most of the year, while the bulk of stocks lagged the leaders or
lost money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately 63 percent of all New York Stock Exchange stocks
declined an average of 29 percent,'' said Goldman. ``While the S&AMP;P
500 was up some 19 percent, the index would have barely budged if
not for its technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldman, investors narrowed their focus last year
out of fear of rising interest rates, prompting them to seek safety
in known quality. The prospect that the Fed might raise interest
rates again in 2000 continued to worry investors at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the achievement of the indexes was mind-boggling
by any standard. Five straight years of double-digit growth was
regarded by most analysts as practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite surged almost 86 percent in 1999 and almost
1,150 percent during the decade, largely on the technology
momentum. Nothing like that had happened since 1915, when the Dow
rose 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which was revised in October to better reflect the
``new economy,'' rose 25 percent, significantly better than the
previous year's 16 percent. Four ``new economy'' stocks were added
_ Microsoft, Intel, SBC Communications and Home Depot _ replacing
``old economy'' standbys Chevron, Goodyear, Sears, Roebuck and
Union Carbide.
</P>
<P>
   The broader S&AMP;P-500 index rose more than 19 percent in 1999,
against 27 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Nasdaq, the best performer was the Russell 2000
index of smaller capitalized stocks, which gained almost 20 percent
in 1999, reversing the year-earlier decline of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts saw the fourth-quarter surge of the Nasdaq and the
Russell 2000 indexes as evidence that trading may finally be
expanding to the mid-sized and smaller laggards _ a trend
strategists say would strengthen the market overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think technology will outperform through 2000 as a whole,
but non-tech stocks with solid fundamentals have appeal for near-
and long-term appreciation,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Arnold
Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   With little domestic news to move the markets on Friday,
analysts said traders and investors bought the same stocks that had
dominated trading all year.

 NEW YORK: such issues.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One measure of how that boom differed from the current one was
reflected in that report, in which Merrill Lynch laid out its
requirements for underwriting new issues: ``We require that a
company have substantial earnings, that its growth record extend
over several years, that the company be important to its industry,
and that the price to be paid for the shares be reasonable in
relation to actual and projected earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The final gasp of that love affair with stocks came in the early
1970s, with the ``one-decision stocks,'' companies that
institutional investors loaded up on because they were growing
rapidly. It was held that such stocks need never be sold, because
they would keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the brutal bear market of 1973-'74, in which the Dow
fell 45 percent and many other stocks did worse. Inflation and
interest rates were on the rise, and stocks seemed hopeless. ``The
Death of Equities'' was proclaimed on the cover of Business Week in
1978. By 1982, the Dow was lower than it had been in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, inflation was coming down and the descent of
interest rates from record highs was starting. The stock market
began to rise in August 1982, starting a bull market that continues
to this day. The 1987 crash, which seemed epochal at the time, is
now remembered as a great buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the final year of the century, an initial public offering
boom eclipsed anything that had been seen before. The best
performers tended to be Internet companies with little in the way
of operating history, and a lot in the way of hopes. The best
performer of the group was Internet Capital Group, which invests in
other internet companies and has shown little in the way of
revenues, and no profits, in its four-year history. Its shares
ended the year at $170, or 28 times the price at which they were
sold to investors in August. Merrill Lynch was the lead
underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom was a principal reason that the Nasdaq
composite index rose 85.6 percent in 1999, by far the best annual
performance ever for a major American index. For the decade, the
Nasdaq was up 795 percent, more than twice as much as the Dow. With
capital gains so bountiful, few investors are concerned about
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   As stock prices rose during the last 17 years, a new investment
gospel gradually spread, holding that stocks are always the best
long-term investment. If the previous stock market boom produced
``one-decision stocks,'' this one has produced the ``one-decision
market,'' in which no long-term investor should ever get out of
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The studies supporting that thesis tended to concentrate on
American prices _ ignoring the much worse results in some other
countries _ and they implicitly assumed that the U.S. economy would
continue to grow and prosper as it has in the past. In 1999, books
appeared with forecasts that the Dow would soar to 36,000 or higher
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Bernstein, a financial historian and author of
``Against the Gods,'' a book exploring how investors and others
have dealt with risk through the centuries, dismisses such
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us that we know more about portfolio values 20 or 30
years from now than we know about what values will be tomorrow or
next year,'' he said in a recent article. To him, that is
ridiculous. To many investors today, it is a sure thing.

STILL TALKING TO THE ANIMALS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Jan. 7)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laura Weeks can bring her two cats to the job and be sung to by
a big bird who knows ``Un Bel Di'' from ``Madame Butterfly,'' so
maybe it's no wonder she's still working full time at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   Laura said she once read that people who work in retail are
happiest in hardware, garden and pet stores. She's been in the pet
business for 53 years and says, ``I can't think of anything else I
would rather do.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling she's always thought this way, that it's not
just a retrospective look. As the Social Security system pushes
people to work longer, Laura is an example of finding something you
love enough to do forever.
</P>
<P>
   She's happy around animals, even the rats and snakes, but also
delights in the mushy, protective way people act around their pets.
``I love seeing a big, tough guy cuddling his tiny dog and talking
baby talk.''
</P>
<P>
   She's learned that ``people will relate to any kind of a living
thing. It brings out the human in them,'' she says, pursing her
lips at Cyrano the toucan, whose trick is to gently take a grape
from Laura's mouth with his beak.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, who works 10-hour days, owns a pet store in Sebastopol,
Calif., with another woman, Dianne Lloyd, whom she met at a dog
show. Their pet shop, full of squawking, crawly things, is the kind
you remember as a Main Street regular if you grew up in a premall
era.
</P>
<P>
   There's a swivel-hipped tangerine-colored iguana who sashays
around the store, and a gray Amazon parrot, named Dorian, who can
sing ``Falling in Love Again'' with a Marlene Dietrich accent.
Another tropical beauty, named Kiri after the singer Kiri Ti
Kanawa, is the Madame Butterfly diva.
</P>
<P>
   This is a pet store where they play opera and serve guests
biscotti and coffee. But it still smells like a pet store _ a rich,
earthy blend of alfalfa, bird feathers and visiting dog. It's how
my daughter's bedroom smelled the year she had mice. It's one of
those places that, when it closes, people will get nostalgic about
and wonder what happened to the older woman in the green apron.
It's a throwback. They don't even take credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Laura maintains, ``You can always make a living in the pet
business. Even in a depression or a recession people take care of
their pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura left an oil refinery job and cashed in war bonds to open
her first pet store on Solano Avenue on the Berkeley-Albany border
after World War II. It was 1946 and women business owners were
rare. ``My suppliers bet I'd be gone in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   This was before kibble and pet diet food, and Laura stocked
horsemeat that she cut and ground herself for pet food _ and
sometimes, she suspects, for people food. ``I had people tell me if
you doctor it up with garlic you couldn't tell it wasn't beef.''
</P>
<P>
   She sold the East Bay store in 1982 and bought property in
Healdsburg with her sister, but, she said, ``I'm not any good at
gardening,'' and went looking for another pet store.
</P>
<P>
   All along she's learned as much about people as animals. She has
regulars who stop in ``for their bird fix'' or to make eye contact
with the fierce-looking bearded dragon lizard.
</P>
<P>
   One day a customer came in looking for milk for a baby gopher.
``She'd found a little gopher on the ground and she couldn't kill
it. It ended up becoming her pet. She named it Go-Go and it would
sit on the couch with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no end to what people will bond with,'' says Laura.
</P>
<P>
   If when you are 80 you are still learning about God's creatures,
even the human ones, and you are able to haul your own 40-pound
feed bags, they will say you probably made the right career choice.

PAKISTAN PRAISES TALIBAN FOR `MATURITY' IN BROKERING END OF
HIJACKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With INDIA-HIJACKING)

 By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's government welcomed the
peaceful end of the hijacking ordeal in neighboring Afghanistan
and, like a proud older brother, praised that country's Taliban
leaders on Friday for ``showing great responsibility and maturity''
in managing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their approach throughout this period of stress has been
imbued with a sense of humanitarian concern and care and opposition
to terrorism which has earned them the appreciation of the entire
international community,'' read a testimonial from Pakistan's
ministry of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,
are the only countries that recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban
government, which, as the host to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born
exile accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, is not
usually blessed as a peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Javed Jabbar, an aide to Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, also credited the Taliban with ``maturity'' in serving
as the stern but judicious broker in securing a deal between the
Indian government and five desperate hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the past week may amend somewhat the Western image of
the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan and have been fighting
to take the rest, as unyielding religious fanatics preoccupied with
the head-to-toe swathing of Afghanistan's women and the maintenance
of untrimmed facial hair on its men.
</P>
<P>
   Will the world now be ready to declare the Taliban
rehabilitated? Probably not. But the Taliban may not be seen quite
so one-dimensionally as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West in particular tends to draw pictures entirely in
black and white, and then we act surprised if people don't turn out
to be as bad as we thought,'' said Paula Newberg, who has written
about Afghanistan for the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Newberg does not believe that recent events will end the
Taliban's pariah status with other countries, though ``this may go
a small way toward changing the adjectives in which the Taliban are
described and considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what role the Taliban played in the hostage ordeal is
still largely unknown, as is the fate of the five hijackers and the
three militants freed from Indian prisons in the bartering.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the hostages were freed, the Taliban
foreign minister, Abdul Wakil Muttawakil, said the hijackers and
released militants were being given 10 hours to leave the country
by road. He said a Taliban official has accompanied the men to
insure their safe passage. He gave no indication where they might
be heading.

 &HT;    Miami Heat ready to unveil a showplace of an arena
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Opening-night jitters for a new NBA arena start long
before the first tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat's first game Sunday at the $203million
AmericanAirlines Arena comes after a manic, around-the-clock push
by hundreds of hardhats painting, hauling, sanding, sweeping,
wiring and installing. The sold-out 7:30p.m. game with the Orlando
Magic follows a sold-out Gloria Estefan New Year's Eve concert.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sixth new NBA arena to open this season after Los
Angeles, Toronto, Indianapolis, Denver and Atlanta. American
Airlines paid $42million for naming rights covering 20 years, with
the price including a silhouette of an airplane on the roof and an
airplane design on the carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to christen it right,'' says Alonzo Mourning, the
Heat's center, ``and christening it right means we come out with a
win. That's my only concern going into that new arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Heat players will dress in the kind of luxury that's a
far cry from a locker room. Heat management calls it a ``players'
lounge'' and it's in-the-round. Cherry-wood ``lockers'' trimmed in
black, each the size of a phone booth, circle the room. The ceiling
is a white, acoustic dome sprinkled with pin lights that shine down
on the Heat logo set in marble tile at the room's center.
</P>
<P>
   Heat coach Pat Riley wanted a round locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a circular dining table,'' explains Jay Cross, the Heat's
president of basketball properties, ``everyone is treated equally
and is part of the circle.''
</P>
<P>
   From the round room, players are only a few steps from an
extra-large sauna, whirlpool, showers, grooming area and training
room that Cross describes as ``a miniature sports hospital.'' It's
a short walk to a full-size court in the training center facing
Biscayne Bay.There are two sets of offices for coaches, one just
for game days, along with a video coaching room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to compare with this in the NBA,'' Cross
says. Or the WNBA, which includes Miami's unnamed expansion team
that begins a 32-game schedule in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' Mourning says. ``I've been to every NBA
arena in the country and we have the best arena by far and I'm not
saying that just to be biased. The best location. It's on the bay.
The suites are beautiful. The architecture is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami architect Bernardo Fort-Brescia designed the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a controversial site,'' he says. ``I was always
concerned about a building of this size on the waterfront being
perceived as obtrusive. I was convinced I could do something
sculptural that would contribute to the betterment of the
waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The outside of the arena is a combination of glass and curved
white facades suspended off the ground to create the look of a
ship's sails. The Heat's colors _ red, yellow, orange _ are the
arena's theme from seats to lights. Inside lighting has an inferno
effect that, from a distance on game nights, makes the inside of
the arena appear on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Not building an arena to accommodate hockey, which needs four
times the playing surface of basketball, will please Heat fans,
Cross predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The geometry of the building is different,'' he says. ``It's a
much tighter bowl. Most arenas are built with hockey in mind or ice
shows. Ours is built only for basketball. The seats come down to
the ends of the court, which makes everything much tighter and
allows for 4,000 more seats (than the Miami Arena) in the lower
bowl. The basketball court is built more like a stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in the cheapest seats will need binoculars to see that
stage. The 3,200 ``end zone'' seats are $5 but will be sold only
when a full house is anticipated for a marquee team such as the
Lakers, Spurs or Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're at center court and look at the last seat in the
balcony, it's no further than the last seat in the Miami Arena,''
Cross says.
</P>
<P>
   Premium seats at premium prices add up to 42 percent of the
arena's 19,600 seats. The additional 4,000 top-dollar seats along
with lounges and boxes are expected to generate $15million a year,
which is why the Heat wanted to leave the 11-year-old, 15,500-seat
Miami Arena three blocks west. The biggest chunk of the arena's
cost was paid by corporate bonds, in part personally guaranteed by
Heat owner Micky Arison.
</P>
<P>
   Seats in the first 10 rows courtside are $150 per game, $6,150
per season. Suites and loge seats range from $10,000 to $160,000
annually, and if those aren't good enough, there are four ``Star
Boxes'' at $500,000 and two ``Junior Star Boxes'' at $400,000, but
they're sold out. Good for any arena event, the big-buck boxes come
with an attendant, catered gourmet food and the best courtside
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County individuals and businesses account for 12
percent of Heat season tickets. All premium-seat season-ticket
owners park under the arena while everyone else competes for $10 to
$20 spaces that can be a three-quarter-mile walk.
</P>
<P>
   What you pay will determine where you can eat. All fans can go
to the Bacardi Bar, but only premium-seat season-tickets holders
can get into Club Chivas Regal and only Star Box owners will be
admitted to the Flagship Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The plush, new palace opens for the Heat on Sunday, which leads
Mourning to think more work is ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is filling it ... because the more people that are in
the stands, the harder we're going to play. Believe me.''
</P>

PATRIOTS PLAYERS' CHOICE: BILL BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Who would the Patriots want as head coach if
Pete Carroll is dismissed after Sunday's game against the Baltimore
Ravens?
</P>
<P>
   The players' choice is Bill Belichick, the assistant head coach
and defensive coordinator of the New York Jets, though the same
players think owner Bob Kraft would go after former Kansas City
Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players, there is also a great deal of respect for
in-house candidates such as defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell and
defensive line coach Ray Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Patriots veterans were asked their preference over the
past week with the condition their names not be used. Most don't
want to see Carroll fired but seem resigned to the fact he will be.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the players' choice isn't always the best one, but
there still many players remaining from Belichick's time in New
England who respect him as a defensive guru and leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who returned Friday from a holiday trip to Puerto Rico,
also respects Belichick, but getting him out of New York would be
difficult. Belichick has probably the best contract of any
assistant in the league, making upwards of $800,000 this season
after reportedly receiving a $1 million bonus from owner Leon Hess
after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick also has a contract in place that would make him Jets
coach when Bill Parcells steps down and also would make him one of
the highest-paid coaches in the league. Belichick is loyal to
Parcells, but there is speculation that he is eager to rejoin the
head coaching ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick would need to bring in a good offensive coordinator
because, as Carroll has with the Patriots, he had problems
overseeing the offense in his first head job in Cleveland. He's
also not media friendly, which could pose a problem in a big market
like Boston.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Patriots player, ``He understands this team as
well as anyone. He knows the key players and what makes them
tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs spokesman Bob Moore says Kansas City would seek
compensation, similiar to what the Jets gave the Patriots for
Parcells, from a team that hires Schottenheimer. According to the
Chiefs, Schottenheimer is still officially under contract with them
through next season.
</P>
<P>
   There are the annual hot coordinators, such as Jacksonville's
Dom Capers (defense) and St. Louis's Mike Martz (offense). Atlanta
offensive line coach Art Shell, whose team had a horrible year, and
Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak (facing life without John
Elway) saw their stock drop.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell, 55, wants to be a head coach after several years of
designing effective defenses for the Saints, Oilers, and Patriots.
Sidwell's name has been thrown around in New Orleans as a possible
successor to Mike Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft went with Sidwell, it would not disrupt the Patriots'
defense, which played very well this season. It would keep the good
parts of the team intact. After all, the Patriots will finish 8-8
or 7-9, not 2-14.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton would be an interesting choice. He's never been a
coordinator, but that doesn't seem to be a prerequisite anymore
after the hirings of Andy Reid in Philadelphia and Mike Riley in
San Diego. Hamilton has been a loyal soldier in the Patriots
organization, a fine player who has gone on and coached the
offensive lines of the Jets, Raiders, Buccaneers, and Patriots, as
well as taken the reigns as head coach of the semi-pro Bay State
Titans, where he brought along Arizona Cardinals pass rusher Eric
Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, also regarded as a player personnel candidate, is one
of the bright young black coaches in the league and the NFL is
encouraging owners to hire blacks. There are only three black head
coaches in the league _ Dennis Green in Minnesota, Tony Dungy in
Tampa Bay, and Ray Rhodes in Green Bay _ while 67 percent of the
players are black.

 &HT;    Former `Richie Redskin' playing it smart in Miami
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Coaches call plenty of players smart. The word
frequently shows up on laundry lists of terms describing men who
play football, along with big, strong, fast, athletic. They are
words that quickly lose their meaning when they're used on
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins defensive end Rich Owens, however, truly deserves his
label as smart.
</P>
<P>
   The man is reading a physics book _ and not for a class or to
impress anyone. It's just tossed in his locker and comes out
whenever he has spare time.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The Elegant Universe'' by Brian Greene and Owens,
27, is reading it because he wants to understand the theories and
science behind the hard science fiction novels he reads regularly.
This book is heavy on Einstein, Newton and the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something clicked in me and I just couldn't stop,'' he said of
the reading habit he picked up last season while recovering from a
major knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   So when Owens says he doesn't think playing against his former
team Sunday will be difficult or emotional even though he's less
than a year removed from his role as Washington's Richie Redskin
mascot, it's probably a well-considered answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it and I've thought about it,'' Owens said
this week. ``And I don't really see it as being, 'Oh God, the
Redskins.' I have flushed out all the angst about the former
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens spent the first four years of his career with the
Redskins, but he wasn't just any fifth-round draft choice from a
small college in Pennsylvania. The Lehigh graphic design major
became a defensive mascot after a coach called him ``Richie
Redskin'' during a meeting because he always wore a Redskins'
ballcap.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates, fans and the media quickly picked up on it.
</P>
<P>
   His 11-sack season in 1996 and the weekly television show he
co-hosted fueled his fame as a young star. Kids throughout the
Washington area, many of whom he met during his frequent talks at
elementary and junior schools, came to love him because he was
friendly and read comic books and didn't talk down to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' public relations staff even called him ``Richie''
through most of his biography in the 1998 Redskins media guide.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes all that good history will make up for some of the
other moments.
</P>
<P>
   Owens admits he ``whined and moped'' through the 1997 season
after coaches asked him to play tackle instead of his more natural
end. His production fell off, his weight ballooned and then he tore
a knee ligament in a pre-season game in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he improved his attitude that season but wasn't
around the team enough. He talked to coach Norv Turner and general
manager Charley Casserly after the season about his soon-to-end
contract and whether they wanted to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt honestly that they were kind of neutral about it,'' he
said. ``I didn't really feel like they were big-time enthusiastic,
and I guess coming off an injury, I can't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   So he jumped at the chance to play for the Dolphins, especially
after watching film and seeing a defensive system he thought might
suit him better than Washington's. He signed a two-year contract in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Owens impressed coaches in training camp, played well early in
the season and earned the starting job at left defensive end after
Kenny Mixon got hurt in a motorcycle accident. And when Dolphins
coaches asked him to try tackle, Owens didn't mind at all this
time. He credited the maturity he gained last year for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, but with the change in attitude, I was granted
a little bit more use of my brain than I had been using,'' Owens
said with a smile. ``As time went by, I just started picking it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he starts at left end, rotates in at right end, plays left
tackle on third down and rotates in at right tackle. He ranks
fourth on the team in tackles with 73. He has defensed five passes,
forced two fumbles and recovered one fumble. Most impressively,
Owens leads the team in quarterback sacks with 8.5 for 61 yards
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jimmy Johnson expected to get a strong player who would
help with the pass rush when he signed Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't anticipate him being as good a player as he is,''
Johnson said. ``The one key factor is he is so intelligent. He's
able to play all four spots and play them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens smiles when asked whether he'd like to reach double digits
in sack totals against his old team, but not because he wants to
show up the Redskins. He still has acquaintances on the team,
although not many friends, and still remembers his four years there
as some of the best of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He even still has fans there. Many write him from Maryland and
Virginia. He doesn't even mind that the Redskins reached the
playoffs for the first time in seven years the season he left
because he feels he's playing the best football of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's not about wins and losses for me,'' Owens said.
``I'd rather be playing some good football and doing what's good
for me. This is definitely a good place.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's not worried about taking the former mascot home.
Washington's tumultuous season with new owner Daniel Snyder and the
struggling, 28th-ranked defense only make it easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff is gone, the Richie Redskin and everything,
that's all gone,'' Owens said. ``It was fun and it was cool for
those four years, but it's gone now.''

LOOKING AHEAD, LEAVING BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let it be proclaimed: This morning, this simple winter morning,
represents more than the beginning of a new age. It represents an
accomplishment for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   We have survived. And by doing so, we have warped the physics of
time.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever _ this is a moment our parents and our
grandparents and our great-grandparents never experienced,
something our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren
never will relive _ we awakened with a startling realization:
</P>
<P>
   Today is tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on an ordinary Saturday morning in an ordinary winter, we
begin a new day, a new month, a new year and mark the symbolic
start of a new century and a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But today, most important of all, we begin anew. The future, so
long symbolized by the forbidding number 2000, is here.
</P>
<P>
   This is 1/1/2000. This is the big, fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also the biggest fresh start ever.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a millennium changed, humankind was a smaller
presence on the planet. Its reach was smaller, its problems
smaller, its resources smaller, its dreams smaller, its need for a
fresh start smaller.
</P>
<P>
   But now we also know _ more than our forebears ever dreamed _
how small we are, how small a place in the universe we occupy, how
small is our capacity to change the course of history, or our
community, or even ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we know how big this moment is, how big the challenge
is, how big the opportunity is.
</P>
<P>
   It is this big: This morning, for the first time in our lives,
we can say, blithely but truthfully, that the tensions that divided
Europe twice in conflicts that spun into world wars happened in the
last century. We can look upon the divisions between East and West,
between capitalism and communism, between the industrial nations
and the undeveloped world, between big-government liberals and
supply-side conservatives, as vestiges of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Dark Ages, the bubonic plague, and the Spanish Inquisition;
the Hundred Years' War, the Napoleonic wars, the Civil War, and the
Franco-Prussian War; anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism, and
sexism _ all these, plus bushels more, occurred in the last
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We have never been able to say that before.
</P>
<P>
   We have hurtled toward this moment for a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   We have traveled from a time when knowledge was the precious
province of the few, husbanded by cloistered monks, preserved in
isolated pockets, copied painstakingly by hand, to a time when
knowledge is the casual property of the many, disseminated by the
gentlest stroke on a keyboard, distributed to the farthest reaches
of the earth _ and, yes, even beyond.
</P>
<P>
   We have moved from a world where the top long-distance speed
measured what a man could walk in a day to a point where the speed
of sound has been conquered many times over. For millions of our
forebears, the longest journey they made in their lifetimes was the
trip to the market town. Today the market is on the desktop, and
wealth, once exchanged through barter, then through coins and paper
money, later through plastic credit cards, now moves in electronic
blips.
</P>
<P>
   We have gone so far, and yet there is so much farther to go. We
have tamed much of the savage side of nature, and yet we live in
deeper mortal terror of nuclear fire and chemicals than ever
before. We have eradicated smallpox from the face of the earth, and
yet we are impotent in the face of new diseases. We have achieved
great wealth, and yet we have not achieved the end of the tyranny
of greed.
</P>
<P>
   So much changed at midnight. But one thing, the central,
inescapable fact of human existence did not change.
</P>
<P>
   More than by our rulers, more than by biology, more than by
history, more than by nature, more than even by human nature, our
lives are governed by an inexorable process:
</P>
<P>
   Change.
</P>
<P>
   We can affect its pace and its trajectory, but we cannot affect
its stubborn will to press on, even if we stand in its way, legs
akimbo, arms flailing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last century it happened in the crackle of a single
moment: with bullets at Sarajevo in 1914 and Dallas in 1963, for
example, or with a pen's scratchy movement across a piece of paper
at the signing of the Social Security Act in 1935, or the unanimous
ruling in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, or with the
combustion produced when Elvis Presley made his national television
debut on the Dorsey Brothers' ``Stage Show'' in 1956, or the
human-rights breakthrough that was the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
or when a Saturn V booster sent Apollo 11 aloft in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But change also happened quietly, while we were looking
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the last century, 14 of the 65 biggest
cities in the nation were in New England. At the conclusion of the
century, only one, Boston, made the cut. And in this case, the lack
of change spoke for big change itself. Boston's population at
century's end was 558,394 _ a loss of 2,398 souls in a hundred
years. In that same period, the population of Los Angeles, only
102,479 in the year 1900, leaped by nearly 3.5 million, far
surpassing Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While we were looking elsewhere, the complection of the country
changed. The slice of the nation represented by foreign-born Latin
Americans grew by a factor of 11. Americans' life expectancy
bounded from 47.3 years to 76.5 years. The portion of the average
family's disposible income devoted to purchasing food dropped from
24 percent to 11 percent. The number of women in the labor force
jumped from 5 million to 64 million. The number of cars registered
in the country grew from 8,000 to 207 million. The number of farms
dropped by more than half. And the percentage of American homes
with VCRs went from 0 to 83.
</P>
<P>
   All that in a century's time. All that in a tenth of a
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And so this morning, this ordinary winter morning, we are
changing more than the calendar. We are changing, our nation is
changing, our world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   We are leaving behind a millennium where life was so precarious
that the father of Edward Gibbon, who at the height of the British
Empire chronicled the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, named his
six sons Edward because he assumed, correctly, that only one would
survive.
</P>
<P>
   We are leaving behind a millennium that witnessed the rise and
foreshadowed the fall of the nation-state. At the end of this
period the united Europe looks tantalizingly like Charlemagne's
empire, and the boundaries that once were tripwires for conflict
now have been all but erased in our wired world.
</P>
<P>
   We are leaving behind a millennium that perfected the air
conditioner but might have ruined Earth's climate. We are leaving
behind a millennium that put antibiotics in the medicine cabinet
but unleashed gas warfare on the battlefield. We are leaving behind
a millennium that created life in heroic in-vitro procedures but
destroyed lives in horrific concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   We have done good and we have done evil.
</P>
<P>
   We can do better.
</P>
<P>
   And so, this morning, when change is in the air, let's revive a

PATRIOTS PLAYERS' CHOICE: BILL BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Who would the Patriots want as head coach if
Pete Carroll is dismissed after Sunday's game against the Baltimore
Ravens?
</P>
<P>
   The players' choice is Bill Belichick, the assistant head coach
and defensive coordinator of the New York Jets, though the same
players think owner Bob Kraft would go after former Kansas City
Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players, there is also a great deal of respect for
in-house candidates such as defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell and
defensive line coach Ray Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Patriots veterans were asked their preference over the
past week with the condition their names not be used. Most don't
want to see Carroll fired but seem resigned to the fact he will be.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the players' choice isn't always the best one, but
there still many players remaining from Belichick's time in New
England who respect him as a defensive guru and leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who returned Friday from a holiday trip to Puerto Rico,
also respects Belichick, but getting him out of New York would be
difficult. Belichick has probably the best contract of any
assistant in the league, making upwards of $800,000 this season
after reportedly receiving a $1 million bonus from owner Leon Hess
after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick also has a contract in place that would make him Jets
coach when Bill Parcells steps down and also would make him one of
the highest-paid coaches in the league. Belichick is loyal to
Parcells, but there is speculation that he is eager to rejoin the
head coaching ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick would need to bring in a good offensive coordinator
because, as Carroll has with the Patriots, he had problems
overseeing the offense in his first head job in Cleveland. He's
also not media friendly, which could pose a problem in a big market
like Boston.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Patriots player, ``He understands this team as
well as anyone. He knows the key players and what makes them
tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs spokesman Bob Moore says Kansas City would seek
compensation, similiar to what the Jets gave the Patriots for
Parcells, from a team that hires Schottenheimer. According to the
Chiefs, Schottenheimer is still officially under contract with them
through next season.
</P>
<P>
   There are the annual hot coordinators, such as Jacksonville's
Dom Capers (defense) and St. Louis's Mike Martz (offense). Atlanta
offensive line coach Art Shell, whose team had a horrible year, and
Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak (facing life without John
Elway) saw their stock drop.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell, 55, wants to be a head coach after several years of
designing effective defenses for the Saints, Oilers, and Patriots.
Sidwell's name has been thrown around in New Orleans as a possible
successor to Mike Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft went with Sidwell, it would not disrupt the Patriots'
defense, which played very well this season. It would keep the good
parts of the team intact. After all, the Patriots will finish 8-8
or 7-9, not 2-14.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton would be an interesting choice. He's never been a
coordinator, but that doesn't seem to be a prerequisite anymore
after the hirings of Andy Reid in Philadelphia and Mike Riley in
San Diego. Hamilton has been a loyal soldier in the Patriots
organization, a fine player who has gone on and coached the
offensive lines of the Jets, Raiders, Buccaneers, and Patriots, as
well as taken the reigns as head coach of the semi-pro Bay State
Titans, where he brought along Arizona Cardinals pass rusher Eric
Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, also regarded as a player personnel candidate, is one
of the bright young black coaches in the league and the NFL is
encouraging owners to hire blacks. There are only three black head
coaches in the league _ Dennis Green in Minnesota, Tony Dungy in
Tampa Bay, and Ray Rhodes in Green Bay _ while 67 percent of the
players are black.

LOOKING AHEAD, LEAVING BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let it be proclaimed: This morning, this simple winter morning,
represents more than the beginning of a new age. It represents an
accomplishment for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   We have survived. And by doing so, we have warped the physics of
time.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever _ this is a moment our parents and our
grandparents and our great-grandparents never experienced,
something our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren
never will relive _ we awakened with a startling realization:
</P>
<P>
   Today is tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on an ordinary Saturday morning in an ordinary winter, we
begin a new day, a new month, a new year and mark the symbolic
start of a new century and a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But today, most important of all, we begin anew. The future, so
long symbolized by the forbidding number 2000, is here.
</P>
<P>
   This is 1/1/2000. This is the big, fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also the biggest fresh start ever.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a millennium changed, humankind was a smaller
presence on the planet. Its reach was smaller, its problems
smaller, its resources smaller, its dreams smaller, its need for a
fresh start smaller.
</P>
<P>
   But now we also know _ more than our forebears ever dreamed _
how small we are, how small a place in the universe we occupy, how
small is our capacity to change the course of history, or our
community, or even ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we know how big this moment is, how big the challenge
is, how big the opportunity is.
</P>
<P>
   It is this big: This morning, for the first time in our lives,
we can say, blithely but truthfully, that the tensions that divided
Europe twice in conflicts that spun into world wars happened in the
last century. We can look upon the divisions between East and West,
between capitalism and communism, between the industrial nations
and the undeveloped world, between big-government liberals and
supply-side conservatives, as vestiges of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Dark Ages, the bubonic plague, and the Spanish Inquisition;
the Hundred Years' War, the Napoleonic wars, the Civil War, and the
Franco-Prussian War; anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism, and
sexism _ all these, plus bushels more, occurred in the last
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We have never been able to say that before.
</P>
<P>
   We have hurtled toward this moment for a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   We have traveled from a time when knowledge was the precious
province of the few, husbanded by cloistered monks, preserved in
isolated pockets, copied painstakingly by hand, to a time when
knowledge is the casual property of the many, disseminated by the
gentlest stroke on a keyboard, distributed to the farthest reaches
of the earth _ and, yes, even beyond.
</P>
<P>
   We have moved from a world where the top long-distance speed
measured what a man could walk in a day to a point where the speed
of sound has been conquered many times over. For millions of our
forebears, the longest journey they made in their lifetimes was the
trip to the market town. Today the market is on the desktop, and
wealth, once exchanged through barter, then through coins and paper
money, later through plastic credit cards, now moves in electronic
blips.
</P>
<P>
   We have gone so far, and yet there is so much farther to go. We
have tamed much of the savage side of nature, and yet we live in
deeper mortal terror of nuclear fire and chemicals than ever
before. We have eradicated smallpox from the face of the earth, and
yet we are impotent in the face of new diseases. We have achieved
great wealth, and yet we have not achieved the end of the tyranny
of greed.
</P>
<P>
   So much changed at midnight. But one thing, the central,
inescapable fact of human existence did not change.
</P>
<P>
   More than by our rulers, more than by biology, more than by
history, more than by nature, more than even by human nature, our
lives are governed by an inexorable process:
</P>
<P>
   Change.
</P>
<P>
   We can affect its pace and its trajectory, but we cannot affect
its stubborn will to press on, even if we stand in its way, legs
akimbo, arms flailing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last century it happened in the crackle of a single
moment: with bullets at Sarajevo in 1914 and Dallas in 1963, for
example, or with a pen's scratchy movement across a piece of paper
at the signing of the Social Security Act in 1935, or the unanimous
ruling in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, or with the
combustion produced when Elvis Presley made his national television
debut on the Dorsey Brothers' ``Stage Show'' in 1956, or the
human-rights breakthrough that was the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
or when a Saturn V booster sent Apollo 11 aloft in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But change also happened quietly, while we were looking
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the last century, 14 of the 65 biggest
cities in the nation were in New England. At the conclusion of the
century, only one, Boston, made the cut. And in this case, the lack
of change spoke for big change itself. Boston's population at
century's end was 558,394 _ a loss of 2,398 souls in a hundred
years. In that same period, the population of Los Angeles, only
102,479 in the year 1900, leaped by nearly 3.5 million, far
surpassing Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While we were looking elsewhere, the complection of the country
changed. The slice of the nation represented by foreign-born Latin
Americans grew by a factor of 11. Americans' life expectancy
bounded from 47.3 years to 76.5 years. The portion of the average
family's disposible income devoted to purchasing food dropped from
24 percent to 11 percent. The number of women in the labor force
jumped from 5 million to 64 million. The number of cars registered
in the country grew from 8,000 to 207 million. The number of farms
dropped by more than half. And the percentage of American homes
with VCRs went from 0 to 83.
</P>
<P>
   All that in a century's time. All that in a tenth of a
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And so this morning, this ordinary winter morning, we are
changing more than the calendar. We are changing, our nation is
changing, our world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   We are leaving behind a millennium where life was so precarious
that the father of Edward Gibbon, who at the height of the British
Empire chronicled the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, named his
six sons Edward because he assumed, correctly, that only one would
survive.
</P>
<P>
   We are leaving behind a millennium that witnessed the rise and
foreshadowed the fall of the nation-state. At the end of this
period the united Europe looks tantalizingly like Charlemagne's
empire, and the boundaries that once were tripwires for conflict
now have been all but erased in our wired world.
</P>
<P>
   We are leaving behind a millennium that perfected the air
conditioner but might have ruined Earth's climate. We are leaving
behind a millennium that put antibiotics in the medicine cabinet
but unleashed gas warfare on the battlefield. We are leaving behind
a millennium that created life in heroic in-vitro procedures but
destroyed lives in horrific concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   We have done good and we have done evil.
</P>
<P>
   We can do better.
</P>
<P>
   And so, this morning, when change is in the air, let's revive a
slogan from the last century and say, with relief, Goodbye to all
that. Let's remember that, after spending so much time getting
here, we finally have survived and arrived, and that today is
tomorrow.

A QUARTERBACK REVERSE: LUCAS STARS AS FOLEY SITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ In a final twist to the regular season, which
shows just how unpredictable pro football has become, a former
backup quarterback on the Jets will start Sunday against Seattle,
while a former starting quarterback for the Jets will be the backup
for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Foley, who was the Jets' quarterback of the future when
last season began, is now a Seahawks bench warmer. And Ray Lucas,
who was simply hoping a year ago that someone would have enough
faith in him to keep him around, is the Jets' starter as the team
tries to end the season with a flourish by winning its fourth in a
row. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 7-8 Jets have .500 to shoot for, which would be redemption
in a season that fell apart early. But the stakes are higher for
the Seahawks (9-6), who can clinch their first American Football
Conference West title since 1988 with a victory. But if they lose,
and the Kansas City Chiefs win, the Seahawks will be out of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to be a starter,'' said Foley, who now backs up
Jon Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Foley did have one moment this season _ in the team's second
game, in Chicago. Seattle had lost its opener, and Kitna was
sidelined with an injury. Foley started against the Bears and won,
throwing two touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Going into that game, Foley, now 29, did not have a
complete-game victory in the National Football League that he could
boast of. His Jets career had seemed headed upward, but when a rib
injury sent him to the sideline early last season, Vinny Testaverde
replaced him, and Foley was traded to the Seahawks in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Foley and Lucas remain close. Foley called Lucas last Monday
before the Jets faced the Dolphins in Miami and produced their
third straight victory over a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of my best friends off the field,'' Foley said. ``We
hung out, spent a lot of time together. It's great to see him doing
well. He's a guy who's been patient, and making the best of it. I'm
real happy for Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Foley reflects on how it might have been different for
him as a Jet. How in his first start as the quarterback of the
future last year, a 36-30 overtime defeat against the 49ers, he
threw for 415 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we lost,'' he said. ``Not winning that game was my
downfall. And the next week I get hurt and my season's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Foley claims, he never understood _ or was told _ the
reasons for his departure, which came when the Jets traded him to
Seattle in March for a seventh-round draft pick, which turned out
to be tackle Ryan Young. Since he left, Foley has seen Jets coach
Bill Parcells at a golf tournament. They have also spoken several
times. But the questions remain in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, because Vinny came in and turned the whole thing
upside down, it was a blessing for the Jets organization,'' Foley
said. ``So the plans for me were pretty much done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had a problem with Foley's salary, which was due to hit
$1.5 million this season. Then there was the issue of his
durability _ he has been seriously injured twice in his career _
and his ability to start and finish a game.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Foley, a New Jerseyan with New York sensibilities and
attitude, found himself in a different environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``One minute I'm there and the
next I'm gone. They don't know how to handle me out here. New
York's the town that never sleeps and Seattle's the town that
always sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   So now Foley returns to the Meadowlands and will see Lucas
trying to stop his team, just as the pair squared off in 1993 _
Lucas for Rutgers, Foley for Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said: ``What I remember about Ray Lucas that game was
every play he rolled right and tried to find someone to pass to.
And there was never anyone there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah?'' Lucas said Friday when told about Foley's
statement. ``You know what I remember about Glenn Foley? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas smiled, and added, ``He was a monster drop-back
quarterback. When I got to the Jets he would help me with my reads.
He could tell me what was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither quarterback could have seen this far into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets handed out four annual team awards, including the
Dennis Byrd trophy for the team's most inspirational player, which
went to quarterback RAY LUCAS. Linebacker MARVIN JONES, who missed
all of 1998 because of knee surgery, was given the Ed Block award
for courage. The Kyle Clifton ``good guy'' award went to linebacker
BRYAN COX, and DWIGHT STONE, the receiver and returner, received
the Marty Lyons award for his charitable work.
</P>
<P>
   _ If TOM TUPA can raise his 45.1 yards-per-punt average by
three-tenths of a yard against Seattle, he will become the Jets'
single-season record-holder. The club mark of 45.3 was set by
CURLEY JOHNSON in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lucas trails only PEYTON MANNING in the AFC passer rating. The
Colts' Manning, who faces a difficult Buffalo Bills defense on
Sunday, is at 91.5 to Lucas' 88.6.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ New Year's Day arrived with two hallmarks of the
Middle East _ religious fervor and the security concerns that so
often accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, more than a thousand people _ Israelis,
Palestinians and foreign tourists _ cheered the new millennium and
watched small fireworks displays from the summit of the Mount of
Olives. They overlooked Jerusalem's Old City and some joked, while
toasting with champagne, that the ``messiah'' had not arrived as
some believers said he would.
</P>

   While New Year's might be just a turn of the calendar on many
lands, here it was seen in its more original form _ roughly the
anniversary of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   There were Catholic masses in the Basilica of Gethsemane, where
Christ is believed to have sweated blood. Protestants prayed in the
Garden Tomb, where they believe Christ was crucified. A few planned
to walk with a trumpet around Jerusalem's Old City walls, calling
in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   By a quirk of fate, Friday was a holy day for all three faiths
here.
</P>
<P>
   The focus was on the small hill-top campus area known to Jews as
the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram esh-Sharif. The site
is home to the rock where Jews believe God asked Abraham to
sacrifice a son and where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, more than 350,000 Muslims prayed there as part
of the annual holy month of Ramadan. Friday evening, hundreds of
Jews brought in the weekly Sabbath with prayers at the Wailing
Wall, a retaining wall at the base of the mount.
</P>
<P>
   But, there were also record numbers of Israeli police and
paramilitary troops on duty. About 7,000 police and 5,000 police
volunteers patrolled the night shift Friday _ more than four times
the usual amount. Many though, seemed bored, talking on mobile
phones and chatting with each other.
</P>
<P>
   At police headquarters on Friday afternoon, Special Units
Commander David Tzur was expecting a smooth New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a few minutes after midnight, the lights of Jerusalem
were still shining brightly. Emergency operations officials
reported that electric, water, traffic and telephone systems were
all functioning throughout Israel. The country had made extensive
preparations to combat computer and other infrastructure problems.

TREATMENT PLANT FOR RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WASTES LAGS BEHIND SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By RUSSELL WORKING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ As Western governments began spending
hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to help Russia
dispose of nuclear weapons and treat radioactive waste, Zvezda
seemed like an ideal place to do some of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda is a sprawling military shipyard, so it has the expertise
to scrap submarines. The plant sits on the harbor in the town of
Bolshoi Kamen on the Sea of Japan, where the Russian navy had been
dumping liquid radioactive waste. And it is in chronic need of
cash: Its workers, like millions across Russia, are owed months'
worth of wages.
</P>
<P>
   But almost four years into a Japanese-financed project to build
a liquid radioactive waste treatment facility at Zvezda, the work
is still incomplete. An American contractor has complained of what
it calls intentional delays to inflate the bills. It also is
unclear how Russia even can afford to run the treatment facility.
</P>
<P>
   The project's troubles carry an added urgency, as Zvezda is the
recipient of millions of dollars in U.S. Cooperative Threat
Reduction funds _ part of the money Congress set aside to help
Russia meet its treaty obligations to dismantle and destroy weapons
of mass destruction. By 2001, the shipyard is scheduled to cut up
14 Delta- and Yankee-class submarines capable of launching
long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, American officials have expressed fears that
delays in completing the wastewater treatment facility could hurt
American efforts to reduce nuclear weapons in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The wastewater treatment facility is a sophisticated plant
mounted on a 213-by-77-foot barge, capable of treating 1.8 million
gallons per year. The Japanese agreed to finance the facility
because they are fearful of nuclear waste dumping in the sea they
share with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott International, Inc., a New Orleans firm whose
subsidiary, BWX Technologies, Inc., has been building the barge,
told American consular officials in Vladivostok last February that
its $25 million contract had run $8 million in the red because
Zvezda was intentionally stalling in order to prolong the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more artificial the overruns, the less bang we will
extinguish for our buck, if this tendency is replicated
nationwide,'' Douglas Kent, then the ranking consular officer in
Vladivostok, wrote in report last February after conferring with
McDermott executives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such worries, the American and Japanese governments have
pressed ahead at Zvezda. Pentagon officials insist there are
sufficient controls to prevent misuse of American dollars. The
Defense Threat Reduction Agency has a contract with Zvezda
requiring the shipyard to meet monthly targets, said Maj. Ron
Alberto. ``If they don't do the work, they don't get paid, and they
have discrete, measurable tasks that they have to comply with,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda is located in a military town of 50,000 in the far
eastern finger of Russia that lies between China, North Korea and
the Sea of Japan. Bolshoi Kamen is classified as a closed city,
where few foreigners may enter. Even Russians need special passes
to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda receives funding for a handful of submarine-destruction
projects in addition to the barge. The U.S. Defense Threat
Reduction Agency is paying the shipyard $8 million to chop up
submarines that once targeted the United States. Lockheed-Martin
Energy Technologies, Inc., of Bethesda, Md., has a Defense
Department contract to process low-level solid radioactive waste
and the wastewater that comes from washing items such as
radiation-contaminated worker clothing (this water was once flushed
untreated into the bay, foreign workers say). It is also building a
facility for storing the solid radioactive byproduct until the
Russian government decides what to do with it. (Lockheed-Martin won
a $24 million contract for both work at Zvezda and a similar
project near the port of Archangel, in northwestern Russia on the
White Sea.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Bolshoi Kamen has permitted about 25 foreigners
connected to Zvezda projects to live in the town, Russian
authorities have denied press requests to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Such strictness is not unusual when the subject is nuclear waste
in Russia: The Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet successor
of the KGB secret police, is still appealing a navy court's
decision to dismiss treason charges against Capt. Grigory Pasko,
who first revealed the dumping of liquid radioactive waste in the
sea. (Another former navy captain in St. Petersburg, Alexandr
Nikitin, was recently acquitted of similar charges filed after he
contributed to a Norwegian environmental group's report on nuclear
waste.) And Federal Security Service agents raided the office of an
oceanographer who was researching radiation levels at nearby
Chazhma Bay, where a nuclear accident occurred in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The restricted entry to Bolshoi Kamen has angered some foreign
contractors and officials. ``Access to the site has been limited to
the extent of interfering with work there,'' the U.S. Commercial
Consul in Vladivostok, Richard Steffens, wrote in a 1999 report on
the city. Though Zvezda is one of the biggest recipients of
American investment in the Russian Far East, Steffens wrote, he had
been able to visit the city just once.
</P>
<P>
   Limited access has not been the only matter to hinder progress.
Kent wrote that Zvezda appeared to have intentionally slowed work,
apparently because the destitute city benefited from foreign
spending in town and 25 Russian workers directly employed on the
project. The Russian Ministry of Economics, which oversees Zvezda,
has exerted little authority over the project, Kent wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite frank and direct appeals from McDermott, the municipal
administration seems not to get the message that the company is
losing large amounts of money on this project, and has been soured
on doing any other business in Russia,'' Kent wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Zvezda director, Valery Maslakov, denied requests for an
interview. In a brief telephone conversation, Maslakov said he was
not required to discuss the reasons for delays.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have expressed disappointment with the delays but
confidence that the barge would soon be operational.
</P>
<P>
   Although McDermott announced in 1996 that the barge could be
done in 10 months, a company spokesman, Pierre DeGruy, conceded in
a telephone interview that the project had ``some unexpected
logistical problems that caused delays.'' DeGruy also said such
problems are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   While McDermott has sought governmental pressure to move Zvezda
along, the shipyard's own workers have grown restive at times over
wage delays. In October 1998, employees joined a Vladivostok
demonstration of 5,000 unpaid workers who waved communist banners
and burned President Boris Yeltsin in effigy. During 1999, the mood
has been more optimistic, although Zvezda still owes its workers
wages for all of 1997, said Olga Skripko, leader of a trade union
representing the factory's 3,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Others have questioned why a facility that receives
foreign-contract money cannot pay off wages that are now worth less
than a quarter of their 1997 dollar value, because of the ruble's
depreciation. Ivan Rogovoi, a regional legislator, said he became
so suspicious of salary delays last year that he called for an
investigation of Zvezda. A prosecutor later examined the shipyard's
records, Rogovoi recalled. Four days later, many workers received a
large chunk of their back pay.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation over unpaid wages apparently contributed to one
Zvezda worker's involvement in a scheme to sell uranium, a local
police investigation suggested. The worker was a part of a gang
that stole the radioactive material and tried to sell it for
$60,000 to undercover police agents. It is unclear where the
uranium originated. Officials say there is no uranium at Zvezda;
the reactors are removed from the submarines before they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda's failure to pay its bills also extend to other
companies. Vadim Bratukhin, spokesman for the regional electricity
provider, Dalenergo, said Zvezda owes the utility $1.3 million.
While it is not uncommon for cash-strapped Russian factories to
ignore electrical bills _ particularly in the military sector,
which receives uninterrupted power by law, the debts are striking
in Zvezda's case. In October, the shipyard paid Dalenergo only
$145.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one of our worst debtors,'' Bratukhin said. ``They
make absolutely no effort to pay the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Such debt, in turn, contributes to a vicious cycle within a
destitute region, whose administration has forbidden Dalenergo from
raising electrical rates to cover rising coal costs. The company's
unpaid power workers periodically declare hunger strikes for back
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Another apparent problem at Zvezda is that no one has decided
what to do with a more tangible byproduct of submarine destruction
than wastewater: Enormous chunks of the submarines that are
themselves contaminated with radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Each submarine has between eight and 10 compartments, and the
section that housed the nuclear reactor and two adjacent sections
are also radioactive, said Sergei Lishavsky, senior specialist with
the Vladivostok office of the federal Committee for Protecting the
Environment. The rest of the submarine can be sold for scrap, but
these blocks are too big to be moved by train, and Zvezda lacks the
technology to cut them into smaller pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Lishavsky said the radioactive scrap was safely stored away from
the Zvezda plant. He would not be more specific. ``We'll have to
take them to Nevada, because we don't know what to do with them, ''
Lishavsky joked.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: SHARPEN THAT AX, TIGHTEN THAT NOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 2000 National Football League playoff field becomes
crystalline late Sunday afternoon. Then we learn which 12 teams
will compete for a chance at Super Bowl XXXIV on Jan. 30 at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It took 17 weeks, 248 games, and included highlights (the rise
of the previously forlorn Rams and Colts), catastrophe (the Rae
Carruth murder charge), death (the loss of Walter Payton), happy
returns (the Browns), lost faces (the retirement of Barry Sanders
and John Elway), new faces (Kurt Warner's stunning play),
concussions (Steve Young) and the re-emergence of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, regular season. Hello, playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye. Hello. That will be a familiar refrain in the coming
weeks as several head coaches who failed to push their teams into
the playoffs pay the ultimate price with dismissal. They will be
tossed out the door headfirst. There are a bevy of NFL owners and
players who cannot wait for this to happen. It will make their day
because they believe these coaches helped ruin their seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpen that ax. Tighten that noose. Wax that plank.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are as good as gone: Mike Ditka in New Orleans and
Pete Carroll in New England.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an upset if Bill Cowher remains in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson contemplates quitting in Miami. Bill Parcells does
the same with the Jets. Dan Reeves in Atlanta, too, mulls the
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Tobin in Arizona is in trouble. Steve Mariucci in San
Francisco is shaky. Jim Fassel with the Giants, Chan Gailey in
Dallas and Ray Rhodes in Green Bay badly need a playoff berth to
solidify increasingly murky ground.
</P>
<P>
   That is a possible 11 head-coaching changes. No doubt, some will
survive, but, for certain, Ditka and Carroll will not.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka arrived in New Orleans full of bluster and will leave
three years later like a mild breeze. The Saints were warned that
he was more image than substance, more commercial than a winning,
captivating coach. In part, that is what the dull Saints wanted _ a
touch of celebrity. Now the owner, Tom Benson, and the Saints
players _ weighed down by a 3-12 season _ are counting the seconds
until it's all over so they can be rid of Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll tried replacing a legend (Parcells) and never quite got
it right. He was always looking over his shoulder, around the
corner, down the hall, hoping to distance himself from Parcells and
attempting a softer approach with the Patriots. Too many of his
players never got it. Too many simply ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher, after eight seasons in Pittsburgh, appears worn and
torn. Johnson appears fed up in Miami. Parcells looks as if he will
take another swing, though. Reeves, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin gets one more shot. Mariucci is 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   And the final trio is an intriguing group.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, Dallas and Green Bay all compete Sunday _ along with
Carolina _ for the National Football Conference's final playoff
spot. Each team is 7-8. But the first three feature coaches whose
clubs must put up an impressive fight on the regular-season's last
day in order to keep their jobs secure.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's team has been burdened by an offense that has shriveled
continuously, showing sporadic life. Now his defense has begun to
falter, too. It is a horrible combination. Gailey, just two weeks
ago, was in little jeopardy, with the Cowboys controlling their
playoff destiny. But then came a funky loss in New Orleans, to
Ditka. The Cowboys will still be guaranteed a playoff spot if they
beat the Giants Sunday, but what if they lose, 42-0? Gailey would
be in trouble of surviving something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most curious of the crew is Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Green Bay this season to replace Mike Holmgren, and
his team has fizzled. The Green Bay fans are irate. They see holes
in his leadership and in his decision-making. So do some of his
players.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Rhodes in his four years as the coach of the
Philadelphia Eagles? He is not the same coach now. He is too timid,
too gun-shy, his peers say. Some of his players say that he started
the season by easing Holmgren's rigid methods and dominating
discipline, but in turn, Rhodes has never been able to gain full
command. To make the playoffs, Green Bay must beat Arizona and the
Giants must beat Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to blame the coaches, the players, but start by
blaming me,'' said Ron Wolf, the Packers' general manager. ``Maybe
I didn't get the right players, not the right mix. Maybe I thought
there wasn't as much to do to get this thing running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after that, there has to be other accountability. This
has been an extremely frustrating year and it's carrying on down
here to the end. We started 3-1, were 4-2 and then won only three
of our last nine games. We've had two three-game losing streaks.
You can blame it on injuries, newness, whatever. But at some point
people have got to really stand up and play, and we unfortunately
have been unable to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in the 20th week of the season, counting
preseason, and when an offense moves, there is confusion on our
defense. We can't score enough points. Those things aren't good.
People want to blame it on Brett Favre's thumb. OK. But enough of
that. Somebody around here, me included, should have done more to
offset these things. Everyone is accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's frustration is matched around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve teams march into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen will not. There is a price to pay.
</P>
<P>
   We will see, Sunday, the last of some coaches in their current
spots. Literally, ringing out the old, bringing in the new.
</P>
<P>
   The refrain goes this way: Goodbye, we hardly knew you, but we
have seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   And hello, NFL 2000.

 &HT;    Roberds Inc. considers closing or selling stores
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Roberds Inc. is considering filing for
bankruptcy, selling the company or shedding portions of the
24-store chain as it struggles to pull out of financial dire
straits, company officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The home furnishings company, based in Dayton, saw some
improvement in early 1999 but posted a 54 cent per share loss in
the third quarter and suffered weak sales in October and November,
particularly in Ohio, company officials said. ``This weakness poses
a number of issues with respect to our profitability, line of
credit and liquidity. We need to take immediate action with respect
to all three issues,'' said Roberds President Robert M. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the company is considering selling or closing
stores, selling or closing some of the company's geographic
marketing regions, reducing or eliminating product lines, or
reorganizing under federal bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we have had at least one outside party
express an interest in acquiring some or all of the company. We are
exploring that and other strategic alternatives,'' Wilson said. The
furniture and appliance retailer hired Deloitte Consulting LLC to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Melvin Baskin said what changes will be made is
unknown but Roberds expects to ``move very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Roberds violated terms of its line of credit, but the
bank amended the terms, increased the interest rate and required
Roberds to improve its performance, according to a document filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Roberds also failed to
meet the tangible net worth minimum by one of its mortgage loans
and the lender reduced the requirement, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Roberds experienced labor troubles in some of its
stores. In October, Roberds sales clerks ratified their first
contract and dropped a call for a boycott of the chain. The United
Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1099 represents about 200
sales clerks at seven Roberds stores.
</P>
<P>
   But the labor negotiations distracted sales clerks from their
jobs, the company said. In addition, the boycott may have hurt
sales and a big sales promotion in August fell flat _ all of which
contributed to poor sales figures in the third quarter, according
to the SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company refinanced its revolving line of credit.
But by the end of September, $22.1 million of the $24.1 million
line of credit was tapped out, according to the SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials promised to spend the last quarter of 1999
boosting business and customer service, beefing up the sales force,
improving warehouse operations and inventory management, and
turning around sales trends, according to the SEC filing. But the
company warned that a regional furniture retailer in the Dayton
market and a new appliance and electronics retailer in the
Cincinnati area would put competitive pressure on prices and profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds has struggled the last few years. Sales totals slipped
from $342.1 million in 1996 to $318.7 million in 1998 and net
losses increased from $910,000 in 1996 to $16.1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine-months of 1999, net losses totaled $5.2
million and sales were $212.2 million, down 8.2 percent over the
first nine months of
</P>
<P>
   1998.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds' core problems track to its experiment in megastore
retailing. In 1996, the company opened Roberds Grand, a
250,000-square-foot store outside
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati. While the superstore is a success, it came at a
price. The company bragged it could deliver any item in the giant
store the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That required the retailer to stock its Fairborn warehouse with
expensive inventories that cut into profits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the company pared down its inventories, dumped thinly
profitable product lines such as personal computers and cut back on
the number of vendors. That restructuring came out of a plan
devised by Deloitte &AMP; Touche, accountants and consultants hired in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds operates stores in Ohio, Indiana, Georgia and Florida.
Founded in 1971, it has 1,900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Roberds closed at $1.43 3/4 Friday. Shares fell 30
percent in 1999.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the new year begins, the powerful zone of high pressure near
the Northwest Coast which has kept most of the Western states dry
and tranquil will dissipate initiating a trend toward cooler and
increasingly unsettled conditions across the region. Brisk onshore
winds will promote showery rain near the Northwest Coast.
Intermittent snow will be common along west-facing slopes from the
Cascades to the Bitterroots of Idaho and Montana. Valleys of the
interior Northwest will have patchy light snow and a few sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of snow will occur from the mountains of northern
Arizona to southern Colorado and northern New Mexico as a jet
stream disturbance crosses the region. Otherwise, breezy and cooler
conditions will develop across the Southwest on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colder air will spread south through the northern Rockies and
northern Plains. Milder air drawn north by developing low pressure
in western Kansas will be forced to rise over the colder air
resulting in increasing clouds from the central Plains to the
northern Mississippi Valley. A broken area of light snow and rain
will spread across these regions later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will turn milder as winds from the south increase.
Sunshine will be ample from southern New England to the Middle
Atlantic states and eastern Ohio Valley. Farther south, an area of
low clouds and a few light showers will linger near the southern
Appalachians. Otherwise, the Southeast will be mild and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wetter Times
</P>
<P>
   The year that ended Friday was the only year of the 1990s when
precipitation across the nation was below the long term average.
Indeed, although regional droughts have been common, for the nation
as a whole there have only been seven dry years since 1970. One of
the most notable climate trends in the United States during the
past century has been a relatively steady increase in wetness. The
added precipitation has been the result of more days with extreme
rain that can produce flash flooding rather than a large increase
in the total number of days with precipitation.

 &HT;    Gators hoping to regain their swagger against Michigan State
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ The Florida Gators lost more than a shot at the
national championship and the SEC title when they finished the
season with consecutive losses, including the 34-7 embarrassment to
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   They lost their swagger.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Gators? Now, that really is a crock. ``Yeah, we have lost
some of that,'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. ``And the only
way to get it back is to start winning. It's like Vince Lombardi
said: `Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the 10th-rated Gators (9-3) don't break that habit today
against No.9 Michigan State in the Florida Citrus Bowl, they're
going to be carrying into the off-season the weight of the
program's first three-game losing streak in Spurrier's 10-year
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that would be unheard of at the University of Florida,''
receiver Travis Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let that happen. Nobody in the country has more
talent than we do. We've got to go out and show everyone we're
still one of the top teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's little reason to believe Florida's slide won't
continue. After a 30-23 home loss to Florida State, the Gators put
up little fight against Alabama in the SEC title game, which ended
with defensive end Alex Brown ripping an offense that produced just
114 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Johnson returns at quarterback after shoulder problems made
him a non-factor against the Tide, but he played so poorly late in
the season that he was benched and has just four touchdown passes
in Florida's past seven games. Florida's top running back, Earnest
Graham, is out today with a foot injury, which won't help matters
against a Michigan State defense ranked No.1 in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   So how do the Gators get out of the offensive funk? New plays or
new players?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost some confidence in our ability to go up and down
the field,'' Spurrier said. ``The only way to get that back is to
do it a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brown's comments convinced Spurrier he had lost control of
the team, he made some changes. He held several team meetings so
the players could privately air their differences, then admitted to
the players he had become too critical and promised a more
enjoyable atmosphere for the bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier's moves have worked _ at least in practice _ as the
players appeared to regain some of their enthusiasm the past two
weeks. Most actually sound like the season didn't end after the FSU
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have said it's time to let it loose and play
loose, and that's what we're going to do,'' said safety Marquand
Manuel, who leads the team with 118 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try and play like the Gators are supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The one advantage the Gators have over the Spartans is their
recent bowl success. Florida is going for a record fourth
consecutive bowl victory, but Michigan State has lost four in a row
and hasn't won in the post-season since a 17-16 victory over
Southern California in the 1990 Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Just how Michigan State's players react to new coach Bobby
Williams _ who got the job when Nick Saban bolted for LSU after the
regular season _ is anyone's guess. But the players have been
thrilled about kinder, gentler preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a knock on coach Saban, but some of our recent bowl
trips were like concentration camps,'' All-America linebacker
Julian Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the game started, many of our guys were out of
gas. Coach Williams has done a better job of keeping everyone
fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the state of the Gators' mental health that might hold the
key today. Twice before Florida lost two in a row under Spurrier,
only to bounce back with wins over LSU and North Carolina State in
the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At least one prominent Gator player _ Brown _ disputes the
notion the swagger is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still got it,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three bad days this year. We're still the mighty
Gators.''
</P>
<P>
   By this afternoon, we'll learn if Brown will be regretting those
words, too.

 &HT;    FAR FROM Y2K BUG WORRIES, REVELERS IN CARIBBEAN LAY BACK AND
SOAK IT IN

<P>
   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ A calypso beat and blasting
conch shells echoed across this tiny Caribbean island as revelers
hoisted rum drinks and champagne to toast the new millennium from
the easternmost U.S. territory in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in shorts and sandals, many visitors marveled as much at
the balmy weather as at the dawning of a new age _ and few voiced
concerns about Y2K computer glitches as they slathered on more
suntan lotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't happen again for 1,000 years, so this is the place
to be,'' said Hope Paddock, a transplanted Texan whose daughter
lives in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   While far-away Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean was actually the
first U.S. possession to welcome the new millennium, St. Croix
capitalized on its location to host its own ``millennium-first''
party.
</P>
<P>
   Remote, rocky Point Udall on the island's eastern tip is the
easternmost spot of U.S. soil in the Atlantic basin. Officials
constructed a millennium monument there, a 20-foot-tall stone
affair resembling a sundial that was to be unveiled at a gala
featuring colorful Caribbean dancers, a steel drum orchestra and
the blowing of hollowed-out conch shells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like this back home in Philadelphia,'' said
Mariellen Heffner, who spent New Years' Eve snorkeling with her
husband and young son, earning rosy sunburns as a keepsake. ``If we
were home, we wouldn't be doing anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix hoteliers were hoping millennium fever would help them
recover some of the business lost in November when late-season
Hurricane Lenny lashed the island. Damage was light, but the storm
hit right at the start of the lucrative winter tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   But the island appeared packed with tourists, sailboats crowding
the harbors and large cruise ships berthed at the pier on St.
Croix's western tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came all the way from Seattle,'' said David Wilhite, who
was visiting friends on the island. ``We're hoping all the Y2K
problems will happen, and then we'll get stuck here. Stranded in
paradise.''

 &HT;    NO YELTSIN, NO Y2K GLITCHES: Russians welcome New Millennium,
New Beginning

   MOSCOW _ The end of the century in Russia didn't mark the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsday predictions of accidental nuclear launch, widespread
power outages or ruptures in gas and oil mains caused by Y2K
glitches proved unfounded after the Kremlin clock tower chimed
midnight in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours leading up to the end of the year, Vladimir
Yakovlev, the head of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, predicted
no catastrophes, telling the Interfax news agency: ``I will be in
my yard setting off fireworks with my kids. These are the only
rockets that will be launched into the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   At Russian Mission Control, space officials called it the most
boring New Year in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   From the Pacific Ocean port of Vladivostock to Moscow _ a span
of 10 time zones _ on-duty army and civil service officers reported
calm, with no interruptions in vital services for Russia's 150
million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most dramatic event to start the millennium in
Russia had nothing to do with Y2K. President Boris Yeltsin
surprised the nation by resigning at midday Friday, ending his
eight-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   But political events didn't pre-occupy the thousands of Russians
crammed into Red Square to toast in the New Year. Families,
teenagers and old friends wore smiles and fur coats as a light snow
filled the plaza and bottle rockets arced across the brick red
walls of the Kremlin, where some of the most pivotal moments of
last century took place.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with her middle-aged daughter and son-in-law with a
thick gray wool scarf swathed around her neck, Marina Olibaeva was
hopeful that less bloodshed and more reform would be the hallmark
of her country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Year always brings new hope. We are thankful for
Yeltsin for giving us a beginning. He did the right thing by
starting a new chapter in our history today,'' the 68-year-old
Olibaeva said.
</P>
<P>
   While some looked ahead to further reform, a few clung to the
past. Amid a sea of roaring revelers, one celebrant waved a single
crimson flag bearing the Soviet hammer and sickle in front of
Lenin's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood was as bright as the fireworks lighting the
night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is here to stay, whoever leads the government. We
are moving in the right direction,'' said Sergei Saltovsky, 43,
hugging his 5-year-old daughter Katya.

CMGI TO BUY GERMAN WEB ADVERTISING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Extending its growing Internet empire to Europe, CMGI Inc. plans
to acquire ADTECH, a German Web advertising service, the company
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, follows a
series of recent CMGI acquisitions and signals the company's
intention to rapidly expand its Internet advertising presence
overseas, offcials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not done,'' said Krista Thomas, a CMGI
spokeswoman. ``We're moving into the European market in a big
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ADTECH, based in Frankfurt, manages Web-based advertising
campaigns using specialized servers that allow the company to track
and change banner ads at Web sites all over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company started operating in Europe two years ago with
technology leased from a US company, AdForce. CMGI signed a deal to
acquire the company earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale goes through, CMGI plans to merge AdForce and
ADTECH to form a Web advertising conglomerate that could ultimately
operate around the world, CMGI officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Together with CMGI subsidiary Exchange Technologies, which
tracks people as they browse the Internet and notes the
advertisements they click through, CMGI wants to use the new
companies to tailor advertising to individual Web users according
to their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the full-service, soup-to-nuts provider in the
online marketing space,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, an Andover, Mass. company that owns or has investment
interests in more than 50 Internet companies, has been expanding
rapidly, especially in untested Internet economies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, shares in CMGI have more than doubled as the
company made a series of acquisitions and announcements on its
Internet investments, including deals for Internet services in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of investor enthusiasm, the company earlier this
month announced plans to raise $1 billion through the sale of
stocks and bonds for general corporate purposes. It also said it is
preparing to launch venture capital funds to invest in Internet
startups in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   While the company says it will continue to pump money into
diverse online ventures, the core of its business strategy will lie
in advertising and marketing services.
</P>
<P>
   Not including Friday's deal, CMGI spent more than $1.4 billion
in 1999 acquiring Internet advertising firms, including San
Francisco-based Flycast Communications Corp., an aggregator of ads
that are distributed over the World Wide Web, and AdKnowledge Inc.,
a marketing-management service.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said CMGI is now large enough to compete with the
current Internet advertising leader, New York-based DoubleClick.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist surveyed the
state of the federal judiciary on Friday and, in contrast to many
of his 13 previous year-end reports, pronounced himself quite
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice noted progress in three areas he had
identified as problems in last year's report. At that time, all
seven seats on the U.S. Sentencing Commission were vacant because
of a political impasse between the White House and Congress. Now,
the seats have been filled as the result of a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress had provided neither a raise nor a
cost-of-living adjustment for federal judges. This fall, Congress
approved a 3.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment, taking effect on
Jan. 1, that will bring the annual salaries of federal district
judges to $141,300; of judges on the courts of appeals to $149,900;
of Supreme Court associate justices to $173,600; and of the chief
justice to $181,400.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary was ``appreciative,'' Rehnquist said Friday, ``but
it should not be confused with a raise in salary.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We must continue to work for more appropriate
compensation for federal judges to maintain the quality and morale
of the federal judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   The third subject on which the chief justice noted progress was
the caseload of the federal courts, which grew only modestly after
sharp increases. Criminal cases in the federal district courts, for
example were up by 4 percent to 59,923, compared with 15 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   As he has often done, the chief justice criticized what he
called the ``unnecessary federalization of traditional state law
matters,'' which he said placed additional burdens on the federal
courts. But he said he was pleased by the increased attention paid
to the issue in the past year as the result of hearings by the
Government Affairs Committee of the Senate and a report by an
American Bar Association task force.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist also asked Congress to appropriate money for higher
pay for lawyers who are appointed to represent indigent defendants
in federal criminal cases. While the authorized rate is $75 an hour
for time the lawyers spend in court, inadequate funding has meant
that in most judicial districts, the lawyers are actually paid only
$65. That is not enough to cover overhead, the chief justice said,
adding, ``Adequate pay for appointed counsel is important to ensure
that a defendant's constitutional right to counsel is fulfilled.''

 MOSCOW: ... serious blow.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following year, in 1994, Yeltsin sent his army into Chechnya
to stem a separatist rebellion, a disastrous campaign that resulted
in the deaths of tens of thousands of Russian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But when his presidency was threatened again, by a Communist
challenger in the 1996 presidential elections and by heart disease,
Western leaders, led by President Clinton, voiced strong support
for Yeltsin. And they backed it with billions of dollars of
economic aid for his government.
</P>
<P>
   From Clinton and the West's point of view, Yeltsin represented
Russia's best chance for a democratic future. Under his leadership,
Russia pursued membership or partnership with the international
organizations that the West had created during the Cold War with
the intent of isolating Moscow: NATO, the European Union, and the
Group of Seven industrial powers. Yeltsin also pursued close
personal relationships with Western leaders, especially Clinton,
whom he always referred to as ``My friend Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Yeltsin peppered his speeches with references
to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal and its need to reclaim its
role as a great nation, and he sent his lieutenants on missions to
Iraq, the Balkans, and elsewhere that often confounded America's
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Western observers often dismissed these episodes as part of
Yeltsin's need to pay lip service to latent Russian nationalism
rather than a sign of inconsistent idelogy. Insiders familiar with
Yeltsin's autocratic leadership style knew that ideology had little
to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power is his ideology, his friend, his concubine, his
mistress, his passion,'' former Kremlin spokesman Vyacheslav
Kostikov said in 1997. ``Everything that goes beyond that, beyond
the struggle for power, concerns him much less.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's management of power often planted the seeds for his
greatest failures. In 1991, in an attempt to woo the support of
Russian regional leaders, he told them to ``grab as much
sovereignty as you can swallow.'' These words later came back to
haunt Yeltsin in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Yeltsin promised to ``lie down on the
tracks'' if his policies did not improve living standards. Years
later, this phrase became the buzzword of angry, anti-Yeltsin
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's admitted love for alcohol, which once helped solidify
the man-of-the-people image that carried him to power, most likely
caused some of the erratic public behavior that stirred shame in
his countrymen and probably contributed to his numerous health
woes.
</P>
<P>
   A man who once criticized the doddering Kremlin political elite
was widely ridiculed in his later years for his halting walk,
slurred speech, and embarrassing slips at public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Yeltsin held on to power by playing his allies
off against one another, occasionally bringing the same old face
back into government, occasionally plucking a new face from
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   During his second term, Yeltsin has largely been out of sight,
spending many weeks sidelined at his country residences outside
Moscow. He continued to dominate Russian politics, emerging to fire
his entire government four times over the past two years, but each
shakeup left him looking weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin governed fitfully, preferring to make strong statements
about the workings of government, and often criticizing the
officials he had appointed, rather than getting involved in the
details. He surrounded himself with an ever-changing coterie of
insiders who, it was rumored, were really calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, this clique, known as ``The Family,'' has been
embroiled in financial scandals. Speculation has been rife that
``Family members'' such as the powerful financier, Boris
Berezovsky, and the younger of Yeltsin's two daugthers, Tatyana
Dyachenko, were searching for a successor who would ensure the
entourage a peaceful existence after his time in power ended.
</P>
<P>
   Putin solved that Friday by decreeing that Yeltsin and his
family will enjoy lifetime immunity from prosecution, as well as
many of the perks acquired during his years in power: guards,
special communications systems, property and, presumably, wealth.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin's former chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, Friday
compared the outgoing president with Moses, who brought his people
to the border of the promised land but, because of their sins,
never got to see it, a veteran political observer had a different
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us . . . it's the other way round,'' said Alexei
Venediktov, news editor of Ekho Moskvy radio. ``We know that our
people never entered the promised land for the sins of the leader,
but the leader did.''

ABRUPT RESIGNATION PAR FOR THE YELTSIN COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin's startling decision Friday
to step down and name Prime Minister Vladimir Putin acting
president was a fitting end for the man who helped bring down the
Soviet Union and led Russia on its stormy post-communist odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive and unpredictable, with a flair for dramatic gestures
and a talent for keeping both his allies and his enemies off
balance, Yeltsin's volatile personality always mirrored his
mercurial political career.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most dominant political force in the past decade,
Yeltsin profoundly changed the political and economic landscape of
the world's largest nation.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to become the father of a new Russia, where the
watchwords of the Soviet era, the police state and shortages of
goods, would be replaced by democracy and prosperity. But Yeltsin
the politician was a brilliant tactician, not a visionary, and he
stayed in power long after he stopped leading Russia in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The pale, puffy and grim Yeltsin who announced his resignation
on national television was a shadow of the man who nine years ago
faced down Soviet power. But Yeltsin's political instincts, and
flair for great gestures, remained sharp to the end.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to hand over power to Putin and schedule a speeded
up presidential election in three months appeared timed to
capitalize on the success of parties backing Putin in recent
parliamentary elections. And what other leader could steal the show
on the most watched date of the second millenium? By stepping down
voluntarily and setting new elections, Yeltsin ended Russia's
tragic and bloody century by giving the country a chance for
something it has never seen this century: a peaceful transition of
power by popular vote, not by death, palace coup, or revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin never took much interest in day-to-day government, and
until his resignation speech, he rarely admitted to mistakes. And
after eight years as Russia's president, he leaves behind an
ambiguous legacy. He said he was confident that Russia would not
return to its authoritarian past and would develop as a modern
democratic nation, but he asked forgiveness for failing to complete
the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came
true,'' he said. ``And also I would like to beg forgiveness for not
justifiying your hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a member of the Communist Party elite that ruled the Soviet
Union, Yeltsin dealt the death blow to communism in the country
that for seven decades was world headquarters for Marxist-Leninism.
He turned the country that symbolized totalitarian rule in the 20th
century toward democracy and free markets. He invented the concept
of the political comeback in a land where ousted leaders
traditionally ended up on the dustheap of history. And he steered
the Russian nuclear superpower toward its best relations with its
former Cold War foes in the West since the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution, only to preside over a pronounced chill when NATO
bombers struck at Yugoslavia, a traditional Slavic ally of Russia,
and when Russia renewed its military effort to subdue rebels in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It was August 1991 when Yeltsin, in a single stroke of political
genius and courage, stood on a tank outside the Russian parliament
building and faced down a hard-line coup against the last Soviet
president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It was Yeltsin's single greatest
moment: it changed the course of history and it symbolized his
legendary talent for winning political battles.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, a seemingly cornered Yeltsin would stare down an
entrenched, powerful foe and come out the winner. Time and again,
the world would write off Yeltsin, only to see him reemerge with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's achievements were offset by the great failures of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The father of Russian democracy also will be remembered as the
man who led Russia's army into a disastrous and brutal 1994-1996
war against rebels in Chechnya, and thus as the Kremlin leader
responsible for the greatest number of deaths of his countrymen
since Josef Stalin's Great Terror of the 1930s and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And after seven years of Yeltsin's leadership, Russia is far
from the market-oriented and law-abiding state he set out to create
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a time of unprecedented economic freedom and growth,
Yeltsin's rule will be remembered as a time when bureaucratic
meddling and mafia-like extortion stifled small entrepreneurs, a
time when Russia built massive debts by borrowing tens of billions
of dollars from Western creditors, only to watch tens of billions
flee the country to offshore bank accounts as the Russian economy
contracted to a fraction of its 1990 size, a time when a few
well-connected insiders gained incredible wealth, but millions of
Russians had their entire life savings wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was the first Russian leader publicly to renounce the
repression, terror, and police tactics favored by his predecessors
over a millennium of Russian history. But citizens' rights in
Yeltsin's Russia still depend more on the arbitrary powers of
police and bureaucrats than on democratic institutions like
independent courts of law. He helped foster a free press, but then
forced it to support his reelection in 1996, a compromise from
which it has never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1931 in the Urals region of Sverdlovsk, Yeltsin became
an construction engineer. In 1961, at the height of Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev's anti-Stalinist political thaw, Yeltsin became a
member of the Communist Party. He rose quickly through the ranks,
and by 1976 he was heading the Sverdlovsk regional branch of the
Communist Party, a position similar to that of a US governor.
There, he gained a reputation as a reformer, which eventually
caught the attention in 1985 of Gorbachev, recently appointed the
new Soviet leader.
</P>
<P>
   With Gorbachev as his mentor, Yeltsin rose to the post of first
secretary of Moscow's Communist Party organization, a job that
included membership in the Politburo, the Soviet Union's de facto
ruling body.
</P>
<P>
   It was as a Politburo member in 1987 that Yeltsin, spurred by
Gorbachev's calls for ``perestroika (restructuring) and
``glasnost'' (openess), began a vocal campaign against corruption
and abuse of privilege among party elites.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners quickly moved to oust Yeltsin from the Politburo and
have him removed to an obscure job running construction in
Sverdlovsk in the Urals.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the end of Yeltsin's career. But in the
first of what would be many comebacks, Yeltsin was soon back in the
capital, elected by a landslide as a member of the first Soviet
parliament in which voters were allowed to choose among competing
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   There, the increasingly popular Yeltsin began a two-year
campaign that saw him quit the Communist Party and eventually rise
to become Gorbachev's main rival as the democratically elected
leader of the Russian republic, by far the largest in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt by hard-line Communists to oust Gorbachev in August
1991 gave Yeltsin the chance he was waiting for; within a few
months after he stood on the tank, Gorbachev was ousted from power
and Yeltsin took office in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the West was slow to take to Yeltsin, whose reputation
as a heavy drinker and penchant for breaches of protocol contrasted
with the urbane, staid Gorbachev. But from 1992 on, Yeltsin enjoyed
unprecedented support in the West, despite moves that would have
brought harsh protests during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, a little more than two years after his famous
stand, tanks again rumbled to the Russian parliament buiding, but
this time it was on orders from Yeltsin to drive out lawmakers who
refused to obey his illegal order to disband.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 people died in the street fighting that ensued.
Yeltsin emerged triumphant, but democracy in Russia suffered a
serious blow.

<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ The fully enclosed shopping mall, that
island of boxy chain stores and lost apostrophes in a sea of
asphalt, was not born in California. But this seems to be the place
where people are digging its grave, at least in its present form.
</P>
<P>
   Consider two scraps of retail roadkill at polar ends of the San
Francisco Bay area, a metro region that is to sprawl what Tuscany
is to vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   At the far northeast end of the bay, on Sonoma Boulevard in a
new part of the suburb of Vallejo, is a ghost shopping center so
empty this Christmas that the only congestion in the parking lot is
a crowd of sea gulls fighting over French fries.
</P>
<P>
   At the southern end, here in a Silicon Valley city where
ordinary three-bedroom houses sell for up to $2 million, is another
dead mall, but this one has been transformed. It has been reborn as
the Crossings, a village of pastel-colored homes, pocket parks,
sidewalks and gazebos _ the very thing that neotraditional city
builders have been promoting for years as the antidote to
auto-dependent sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of record prosperity and robust retail sales, dead
malls litter the landscape, from the haunt of the old Naugatuck
Valley Mall in Waterbury, Conn., to the icon of Valley Girl
culture, the Sherman Oaks Galleria in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1 of every 5 shopping malls standing in 1990 will be out
of business by the end of next year, according to ``Emerging Trends
in Real Estate,'' an annual report for institutional buyers of
property, which is jointly published by PricewaterhouseCoopers and
Lend Lease Real Estate Investments Inc., both of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller, older malls are falling because of retail
Darwinism, losing customers to bigger, more entertaining shopping
centers, though the rate at which new malls are being built is also
the lowest in 20 years. Other malls are also losing customers to
catalog and internet shopping and to big box stores like Wal-Mart.
Perhaps the biggest factor in the decline of older malls, real
estate experts say, is that there are simply too many stores for
shoppers to support.
</P>
<P>
   The husks of older malls are giving certain developers,
architects and planners a chance to prove with bricks and glass
what they could only dream about in words and sketches. The
demalling of America, as these urban specialists see it, provides
the perfect space for compact new neighborhoods _ where people park
their cars and walk between shops and home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where malls have started to die, you have a chance for some
very exciting new uses _ 24-hour neighborhoods,'' said Mark
Falcone, managing director of Continuum Partnership, a Denver
developer. ``What used to seem so threatening to a lot of
developers is seen now as just a return to the common-sense wisdom
of how people want to live and shop.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the mall, born in the Midwest at midcentury,
the same time as the federal interstate highway system, is an old
story of free market excess. In 1960, there were 3,000 shopping
centers in the United States, and 4 square feet of retail space for
every American. Now there are nearly 40,000 shopping centers and 19
square feet of retail space per capita. In the last 12 years alone,
shopping space has increased 34 percent, to a total of more than 5
billion square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formats are stale and boring,'' said Jonathan D. Miller,
the main author of the ``Emerging Trends'' report. ``The traffic
hassles are awful, and people just generally don't have the time to
spend wandering around malls like they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $1 trillion still changes hands every year in malls.
But people are spending less time in the retail biospheres than
ever before, according to several studies. Even teen-agers, whose
shopping habits and dialect have provided anthropological fodder
for a generation of mall sociologists, are getting bored with the
old format, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malls tried to be our social centers, but they're not
interesting enough, not diverse enough,'' said Peter Calthorpe, a
Berkeley urban planner and architect who is one of the nation's
leading promoters of the return to village-square-style
neighborhoods, the so-called New Urbanist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Calthorpe designed the Crossings here in Mountain View, and his
company has nearly a dozen similar projects under way, even in
sprawl meccas like Las Vegas and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Main-street style centers have been around for hundreds and
hundreds of years,'' Calthorpe said. ``But the big suburban mall is
a highly subsidized experiment that's barely 40 years old, and may
eventually be seen as an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for a well-known city planner like Calthorpe to
see the demise of sprawl-born malls, but even Wall Street is
singing the same tune.
</P>
<P>
   In advising investors to stay away from suburban malls,
``Emerging Trends'' stated: ``Whether mall owners want to admit it
or not, malls look the same from one end of the country to the
other. Same stores, similar merchandise, same fast food and same
movies. If shopping is entertainment, then going to the local mall
is like watching TV reruns over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the woes are people buying commodities over the
Internet. Just 10 years ago, Wal-Mart became the nation's No. 1
retailer, revolutionizing commerce and drawing money from old-style
malls anchored by traditional department stores. Now Amazon.com is
projected by some analysts to eventually become the nation's top
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Big regional shopping centers, anchored by major stores, and
small neighborhood retail squares built around a favorite
supermarket, are the two healthiest of the species. Outlet stores,
the name-brand discounters clustered at the far edge of exurbia,
have leveled off, with about 300 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mall will continue to evolve into a place that is far more
than shirts, shoes and slacks,'' said John Bucksbaum, the chief
executive officer of General Growth Properties, the largest manager
of shopping malls in the nation. ``Today, people want more. They
want to be entertained. They want to be able to sit down and eat,
and not just at a food court. They want a Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A new hybrid, known as the main-street mall, has sprouted
throughout the country to great success. These centers are somewhat
like the village square of old, with single-story stores, coffee
shops and restaurants facing a sidewalk, often with a fountain or
square in the middle, with parking underground.
</P>
<P>
   One such main-street mall, Redmond Town Square in the wealthy
suburb east of Seattle, has become a favorite social haunt for
Microsoft employees, who work several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the main-street mall is more a Disneyland
fantasy than a true evocation of America's village past. And others
wonder if the New Urbanists' creations, with their retro front
porches and pastel colors, will one day look as dated as the older
malls of today.
</P>
<P>
   But for people who have bemoaned the course of ever-expanding
American suburbs tied to the automobile, the return to smaller,
more compact developments _ albeit in dead malls, of all places _
is an extraordinary turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   California, which pioneered so many of the drive-by conveniences
that marked the auto age, is leading the charge in trying to
develop old malls into places where the car is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   One example is in Pasadena, where an old-style shopping center
downtown will be replaced with a series of small shops with 400
loft-style apartments above the stores. In Los Angeles, a similar
plan is under way near the city's old farmer's market, at Fairfax
and Third avenues, where a complex of more than 600 condominiums,
built around small shops and cafes, will replace a mall of discount
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking what is frankly a not very healthy and nondescript
area and making it quite vibrant and livable,'' said Con Howe, the
planning director for Los Angeles. ``People now want to live where
the jobs are, and where they can shop and dine in the same place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Putting homes atop small retail shops was once the norm for most
cities, but the practice was outlawed by later zoning codes. What
is happening now, city planners say, reflects the limitations of
sprawl and the desire of people to get out of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in the cul-de-sac and have to drive to the dry
cleaners, along with every other place _ people are getting fed up
with that,'' said Miller of Lend Lease, which is the largest
institutional real estate manager in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first generation mall is no longer the edge of the city _
it's right smack in the middle of the city,'' said Falcone, who is
conducting a study with Harvard University on the dead-mall
phenomenon. ``That makes it a good location for something other
than an auto-dependent mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Silicon Valley, nearly 10 jobs are being created for
every new unit of housing _ bringing a huge demand to retrofit some
older, dying malls.
</P>
<P>
   The Crossings has been so successful that it has spawned similar
plans for older malls throughout the Bay area. It may even get to
the point where Tom Wolfe's description of sprawl could become
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   In his novel ``A Man in Full,'' Wolfe noted that the only way
you could tell you were leaving one city and entering another was
when the chain stores started to repeat themselves.

PLAYOFFS OR NO, DALLAS PROVIDES MOTIVATION FOR GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waiting in the visiting locker room at Texas Stadium late Sunday
afternoon, the New York Giants will know whether the Green Bay
Packers, who play earlier against the Arizona Cardinals, have won
or are comfortably ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Since either scenario, in all probability, would eliminate the
Giants from the playoff race, there could surely be some
disappointment as the Giants prepare to take the field for their
4:05 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   Most Giants believe there will be an instant cure for any
melancholy, and it will be on the other side of the locker room
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running out there and seeing their fans, seeing the Dallas
Cowboys, seeing the whole America's Team thing,'' the Giants
11-year center Brian Williams said earlier this week. ``That will
get to me. I want to beat them. I mean, I can't even stand it when
I walk around New York and see Dallas Cowboys hats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants never expected their season to end up like this, with
them holding on to slim playoff hopes. These Giants, after all,
were in first place at the midpoint of their season.
</P>
<P>
   But if Green Bay wins, it is the Cowboys who have the
opportunity to win and go to the playoffs, unless the Giants can
defeat Dallas by 56 more points than the Packers have defeated
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 7-8 Giants say they intend to make the last act of
their season a purposeful victory. Or, as many Giants put it this
week, if they are going to ruin anybody's new year, they would want
it to be the Cowboys' new year. That it would come in Dallas, where
the Giants have won just twice in the 1990s, would be even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a great millennium present,'' said Giants
linebacker Jessie Armstead, a Dallas native.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is watching the Cowboys celebrate their
unexpected good fortune _ a playoff berth with an 8-8 record _ as
the Giants trudge into the off-season with their first losing
season under coach Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see any of that down there,'' Armstead said.
``Them winning and celebrating and talking. We won't have any
trouble getting up for stopping them. I know all about the Cowboys'
image and reputation. I grew up like any other kid in Dallas; the
Cowboys were my team. But the day I got drafted by the Giants, I
was a Cowboys-hater like everybody else around here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain enmity between the franchises that is
tangible, something that surfaces in off-hand comments and
off-the-record remarks, and something that has developed because
these teams have seemed in each other's way at critical junctures
of pivotal seasons for most of the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1990 season the Giants won the Super Bowl, but
the decade soon turned into a championship one for the Cowboys. By
1997, it was interesting to note how the Giants relished their
season-ending victory at Dallas, a victory that made them the only
National Football Conference East club ever to go undefeated in
division play.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, it was Dallas' Monday night wipeout of the Giants in
1998 that first signaled that real trouble was ahead that year. You
could say the same thing about a 1995 Monday night blowout by
Dallas of the Giants. And then there was the 1993 season finale at
Giants Stadium, when the Giants lost the home-field advantage in
the playoffs in a 16-13 overtime loss to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took the home field to the Super Bowl, where the Cowboys
won another championship.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the rivalry, as is the obvious discord that
exists between Giants co-owner Wellington Mara and Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mara admonished his players Wednesday for their play in the loss
to the Minnesota Vikings last weekend. Falling down on the job in
Dallas will hardly be viewed as the appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's going to happen,'' Williams said.
``Everybody on this team wants to be flying home knowing we did our
best, that we did something good. Beating the Cowboys, regardless
of what else happens, that's something good.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ When the Cowboys and Giants met in October, the Giants'
defense had one of its best games, limiting EMMITT SMITH to 26
rushing yards in 22 attempts in a 13-10 Giants victory. ``That
wasn't one of our better performances,'' Dallas quarterback TROY
AIKMAN said. Cowboys Coach CHAN GAILEY said he thought Smith was
looking forward to getting another chance against the Giants.
``Yeah, I think Emmitt remembers,'' Gailey said. ``He wants to go
out and have a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Giants coach JIM FASSEL said he would not rest injured
players, like running back JOE MONTGOMERY, who has a rib injury.
Nonetheless, expect to see the role of the rookie running back SEAN
BENNETT expanded. Bennett has been out for most of the season with
a knee injury, but this could be the Giants' last chance to get him
some seasoning and experience in game situations.

FORMERLY HOMELESS YOUTH HAS HOME ON FLORIDA STATE FOOTBALL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The former high school superstars thought
they had it tough. One by one, the Florida State freshman football
players vented their frustrations last year during their first
meeting with the university's director of student development, Pam
Overton:
</P>
<P>
   ``This place isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dining hall is not open when we need to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the last freshman spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm going to tell you,'' Todd Williams said, ``this is
probably the best place I've been. Nobody has ever been this nice
to me before. Maybe it's not everything we want, but it's
everything we need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is the Florida State campus in Tallahassee, and it is
home to Williams, a redshirt freshman offensive tackle who had been
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   It means three meals a day for Williams, who had stolen food as
a teen-ager to survive. And it gave a football family to a young
man who had lived on his own for years.
</P>
<P>
   This is tough: Williams' father wanted nothing to do with him,
refusing to sign his birth certificate. His father was shot to
death in 1994, en route to visiting his son for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I met my dad was in the casket,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Ozepher Fluker, never was a significant part of his
life because of her own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just know this, she wasn't there,'' Williams said. ``That is
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' sister is in jail, and he has not spoken to his
brother, who lives in Miami, for ``so long, I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce James had raised Todd, her grandson, in her Bradenton, ,
home since he was 9. She died on Oct. 2, 1993, of complications
from diabetes, and Todd, then 15, received the news over the phone.
He dropped the receiver and bolted out of the house, then ran laps
at a nearby baseball field, unable to sweat away the anger and
despair swelling within.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when I got through running that it would all be
over,'' Williams said. ``Then it hit, but I still didn't want to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like that was the only person that ever cared about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 21, said that after his grandmother's funeral, state
social service representatives arrived to pick him up because he
had no adult relative to care for him. He asked them to come back
the next day, so he could pack his belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Williams, who had a solid academic record in middle
school, fled Bradenton, with a friend, for the Miami area. Williams
had relatives and friends there but nowhere to call home. His
friend soon left, but Williams stayed in Carol City and Opa-locka.
</P>
<P>
   He broke into cars and hotel rooms to sleep, trying to leave
before he was discovered. Sometimes he slept in public restrooms.
``I got shot at a few times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He ate at restaurants, then fled without paying. He stole
clothing from department stores. He was arrested after he tried to
steal a car in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stole, I lied, I got involved in violent activities and
these people who would kill folks and stuff like that,'' Williams
said. ``It wasn't the right way, but I was young at the time and it
was survival.''
</P>
<P>
   After several months on the streets, he returned to Bradenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I didn't want to be like the rest of my family,''
Williams said. ``Like my uncles and stuff, they're in jail. Too
many people in my family didn't graduate from high school or go on
to college.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to a juvenile center after he was arrested following
a fight. Nobody picked up Williams upon his release, and he lived
in a halfway house before moving in with an older cousin. She moved
out, and an uncle signed the lease so Williams would have a place
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore at Southeast High School, Williams was
responsible for all the bills and chores and catching up in school.
He worked two and three jobs at a time, as a restaurant cook and a
grocery store stockboy, to pay the rent for his subsidized
apartment in Bradenton. It was 60 yards from a street corner where
drug activity was common.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been real easy with what he had been through to
try to make a quick buck on the corner where some of the boys were,
to take an easy way out,'' said Joanne VanEska, his landlord,
``instead of doing what he did, which was work and go to school and
keep himself clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also began attending church regularly and found people
there who cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``His circumstances were so bad when he was so young, he had to
have something to grasp onto,'' said Faust DeLazzer, who coached
Williams at Southeast. ``He got a sense of belonging and people
caring that he didn't get before.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams had saved enough money, he joined the football
team, biking to work after practice, returning home at night. He
had dreamed since he was a child of playing football at Florida
State, but not even he believed that was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the potential, if he grows, worked hard in the weight
room,'' DeLazzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams earned Class 6A second-team all-state honors and was
recruited by several major colleges, including Florida State. He
now has a football scholarship that covers his meals, lodging,
books and tuition, and a Pell Grant for about $1,500 a semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great story,'' said Sally Bishop, Williams' guidance
counselor at Southeast. ``I admire him. I knew his background and I
knew he had a lot of potential physically and academically. He
could have very easily done nothing with his life, and he pulled it
together to be somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams still struggles to control the anger rooted in his
abandonment. In high school he was suspended from school for 10
days and a football game for fighting. While at Florida State,
Williams attacked an automatic teller machine on Oct. 10 in
Tallahassee because it swallowed his card. He smacked the machine
several times, witnesses said, and was handcuffed by police. He
later agreed to make restitution to the owners and was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Inner peace is not so easy to find. More than anything, Williams
says, he wants a family someday. ``I've never had that,'' he said.
``To have a wife and a child to come home to.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton recalls during that initial meeting with Williams and
the rest of Florida State's freshman football class, ``You could
just tell that the guys had never thought about the things that
Todd has had to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said: ``I told Todd when he
arrived here, he could be a great story. You really hope it has a
happy ending.'' &QL;

RESIGNATION, UPCOMING US ELECTION COULD BRING NEW ERAA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton awakens in the new year, he
faces a dramatic new uncertainty on the world stage: the future
course of Russia after the surprise resignation of his good friend
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   US-Russia relations have gone through an extraordinarily
difficult year. There have been no fewer than nine crises beginning
with NATO's expansion into eastern Europe, but Clinton depended on
his complicated friendship with Yeltsin to pull out short-term
solutions to each new setback.
</P>
<P>
   They publicly toasted each other and tussled across the Atlantic
over issues, but privately, said former US aides, Clinton was able
to bully the Russian president into agreements that met US
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few brief meetings in recent months, Clinton has no
relationship with Vladmir Putin, named by Yeltsin as acting
president until March and the odds-on favorite to be elected then
as Russia's president for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the change now facing Clinton: he had a 20-minute
``frank'' discussion with Yeltsin Friday, said a senior
administration official, but he could not get Putin on the phone
because the new president ``was in a Cabinet meeting,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   With Putin, ex-spymaster and ex-St. Petersburg bureaucrat, as
the power in Moscow, the US administration sees opportunities and
dangers in the unpredictable new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of unknowns,'' the administration official
said. Those looking for positives said Putin will have much more
domestic support than Yeltsin in recent years, giving him great
ability to follow through on his platforms and foreign policy
commitments. He also will be working with a new legislature that
may be more open to reforms pushed by the Clinton administration on
arms control and economic initiatives, US officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for negatives said Putin's motivations will be to
win the elections, and thus continue a hard line in the war in
Chechnya, which Europe and the United States have condemned as
brutal and indiscriminate. His no-nonsense stand on Chechnya,
beginning immediately with his appointment on Aug. 9, has sent his
job-approval ratings to near 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a further cloud on Russia's future, and by extension its
ties with the United States, is the transition itself. The US
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Yeltsin
technically followed constitutional provisions in calling for new
elections in three months, but he said questions are sure to arise
from reports that Putin has granted Yeltsin immunity from
prosecution. There was no word about whether the immunity extended
to Yeltsin's family, who like the leader had come under suspicion
of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Clinton said he looked ``forward to
working with acting President Putin, as the Russian people begin
the process of making the transition from one democratically
elected president to another.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall I. Goldman, Davis professor of Russian economics at
Wellesley College and associate director at the Davis Center for
Russian Studies at Harvard University, said Yeltsin's resignation
seemed blatantly designed to win immunity for himself and his
family and to catch the opposition off guard, not good starting
points for a democratic transition.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the original intention of holding elections in June
was a better plan. ``This is a premature birth, and premature
births don't always work out so well,'' he said. ``You have a
better chance if you go all the way to term.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some predicted that Putin would weather the criticism,
and that eventually his election as president may steady the
US-Russia relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, there were broad disagreements over NATO
expansion; policy toward Iraq; Russian technology transfers to
rogue states; the Kosovo war; the dumping of Russian steel in the
United States, corruption scandals, including allegations of money
laundering at the Bank of New York; plans to modify the ABM treaty
to allow missile defense systems; the Chechnya war; and a espionage
incident in which a Russian official allegedly monitored
conversations in a seventh-floor State Department conference room.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts said a Putin presidency would not necessarily
bring an end to the controversy-of-the-month relationship. The
Chechen war looms large in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin built his campaign on what he is doing in Chechnya, and
if we are comfortable in that, we should be comfortable with him,''
said David J. Kramer, associate director of the Russian Program at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think
tank. ``There is a view in the administration that Putin is a man
they can do business with. I think that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior US official, who has met with Putin, said he believes
this was not an entirely accurate reading on Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very serious guy,'' the official said. ``The two words
I would say that come to mind about him are `serious' and
`studied.' He comes to the table after he has spent a great deal of
time studying and thinking carefully about how to portray the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Graham Jr., the chief political analyst at the US
Embassy in Moscow from 1994 to 1997 and now a senior associate at
Carnegie, said he believed the entire US-Russian relationship would
undergo a sea change. He predicted a shift from US dominance and a
foundation based largely on the relationship of the two leaders, to
one that gives more weight to Russian concerns and is based on
broader ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever things looked bad in the past, our president picked
up the phone, and they worked things out,'' said Graham, who wrote
dozens of diplomatic cables on the US-Russian political
relationship. ``Yeltsin made concessions to the US that were not
consistent to mainstream Russian thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the confidence that we could manipulate them, which is
what the United States has done,'' Graham said. ``I think a change
is positive. Basing a policy extensively on your ability to
manipulate the leader of a country is not a long-term strategy. The
challenge of the administration now is to build broader contacts
with the Russian elite. If you do that right, you also have a more
stable relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   So, said analysts, a new era in US-Russia relations could be at
hand, a post-Clinton-Yeltsin era, perhaps beginning after the dual
election seasons in Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, asked Friday about his personal relationship with
Yeltsin, who assumed office more than a year ahead of him, said,
``I liked him because he was always very forthright with me. He
always did exactly what he said he would do, and he was willing to
improve our relationship, to try to improve democracy in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin ``genuinely deplored communism,'' Clinton said. ``He
lived with it, he saw it, and he believed that democracy was the
best system. I think it was in every fiber of his being. And we had
our arguments, we had our fights, we had our genuine disagreements
about our national interests from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton added, for a second time, ``I liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a phone call with Putin?
</P>
<P>
   ``It should happen in the next day or two,'' said the US
official.

   Russian Stocks Leap After Yeltsin Steps Aside
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation drove Russian stock prices
up sharply, reflecting optimism that the acting president, Vladimir
Putin, will revive stalled economic reforms. The Russian Trading
System stock index rose 18 percent. Russian stocks traded in the
United States rallied as well, as did the Templeton Russia Fund, a
mutual fund that invests primarily in Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bond Prices Close Lower
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices ended the year lower, reversing a two-day gain that
analysts labeled an aberration from the bond market's yearlong
slump. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 24/32, to 95
12/32. The bond's yield rose to 6.48 percent from 6.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing Shares Are Sold
</P>
<P>
   US West said it sold 24 million Global Crossing shares, valued
at $1.15 billion. US West bought the shares before canceling its
planned merger with Global Crossing, which is building a worldwide
phone and data network.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Merger Called Overpriced
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management, the nation's biggest hauler of trash, contends
in a lawsuit that it overpaid in its $1.15 billion purchase of
Eastern Environmental Services last year because Eastern's chairman
overstated its profits. The suit seeks nearly $600 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia Defers Share Dispute
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia said it had extended by six months a deadline for
resolving an impasse on $3.8 billion worth of Malaysian stocks
frozen on a Singapore exchange. Suspension of trading in the shares
was among economic measures adopted by Mahatir Mohamad, Malaysia's
prime minister, in September 1998, and the two sides have since
clashed over how to return the equities to the Malaysian
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Some Markets Closed
</P>
<P>
   Most overseas stock and financial markets were closed Friday for
New Year's Eve. In the United States, commodity markets were
closed, and the stock market and Treasury market closed early.

EARLY DISCORD MARKS VUITTON SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   AUCKLAND, N.Z. _ The Ghost of America's Cups past stalked the
waterfront Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Long before a gun sounded on Hauraki Gulf to begin the semifinal
round of the Louis Vuitton Cup, the series began with a familiar
lurch into rancor and discord among the sailing teams.
</P>
<P>
   The object of wrath at a press conference Thursday was the
Japanese team that, as the other challengers see it, consorted with
the enemy, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Before the challengers' series began last October, the 11
syndicates agreed not to help the defender by sailing or practice
racing against it between rounds. The agreement was in keeping with
a longstanding America's Cup tradition of separation between the
two, though it has been breached at least once before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to tune up against the world's best match racers,''
said Peter Gilmour, an Australian who skippers the Nippon boats for
Japan. ``But Nippon has had tremendous help from New Zealand in the
past and no one else invited us out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Dennis Conner who tore the top off what had been a
fairly polite press conference when he raised the possibility that
Gilmour had sparred with New Zealand for personal gain, perhaps to
raise money to pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   Conner said he would not be surprised ``if Peter ends up
steering for New Zealand three years from now,'' suggesting that
Gilmour aided New Zealand to gain favor.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility, said Conner, launching into pure derision,
is that ``maybe he feels he's not going to the America's Cup and so
he wanted to have his photograph taken racing against New
Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Conner got serious: ``This is a big edge for New Zealand _
to find out how the challengers are going. It's all win win win for
New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cayard, skipper of AmericaOne from San Francisco, said he
could not see the upside for Nippon. ``New Zealand learned a little
Friday. They'll learn the rest next week. One of the six of us are
going to try to beat New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice sailings gave New Zealand a benchmark from which to
gauge the performance level of all the other teams when races begin
Saturday, said Conner and Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour justified his action by saying his was the only team
without a second world-class helmsman to give him sparring
practice. ``This was the best possible way for us to prepare. It is
a very logical process. This is all a storm in a teacup. I can't
believe on the eve of the new millennium, there are still these
silly prejudices . . . We see this as something really positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter pre-race conference among the six challengers was
music to the ears of Team New Zealand, which sends its two black
boats out every challenger race day to sail against one another and
watch the competition from afar. By design, there is no other
defender team in New Zealand. So while all the Kiwis' efforts,
wealth, and resources focus on a single campaign, they still have
no one else to spar with.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand tactician Brad Butterworth termed his scrimmage
against Nippon as a ``bloody interesting day. It was encouraging
because both boats were so similar. But we won't really know how
fast we are until we see the results of the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was somewhat more restrained than the irascible Conner,
Cayard ended his criticism with a sarcastic, Conneresque swipe at
Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard to understand the advantage of checking in and
the value of that to Team New Zealand. They have been watching us
all along and now they have a measuring stick. I can't really see
what the benefits were to the other side except for the front page
of the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour agreed that making the front page of the paper would
make his sponsors ``delighted,'' especially since Nippon and Team
New Zealand share some sponsors, such as Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in its modern history has there been an America's Cup
without some significant disagreement and bickering, but rarely has
it been so shrill this early in the trials. Conner finished his
ripping of Gilmour with an echo from America's Cups past. ``Whoa, I
shouldn't have said that!'' he shouted with mock self-effacement.
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to Fremantle in 1986 when he said the same
thing to wind up a diatribe accusing New Zealand of cheating by
building their 12 meter out of fiberglass rather than aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   As the semifinals begin Saturday, each of six boats will have 10
races, meeting each other twice. Four boats will be eliminated,
while the two top point-winners face off in the Louis Vuitton
finals beginning Jan. 20.

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN (Moscow) _ President Boris Yeltsin shocked his
nation and the world Friday by announcing his resignation six
months before the end of his term, and handed over power to his
favored successor, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. As final act to
an extraordinary career, Yeltsin, 68, chose the last day of the
year and the start of a four-day New Year's holiday in Russia to
upstage the new milennium, and try to assert control over a
succession battle that will set Russia's course for years to come.

Afghanistan. All 155 hostages on the Indian Airlines plane were
freed unharmed. (summary from wires) By Celia W. Dugger.

 &HT;    IN THE Y2K COMMAND CENTER, THE MEDIA WAITED, AND WAITED, AND
WAITED FOR NEWS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here at Millennial Perennial, where the Year 2000
was always arriving somewhere, they
</P>
<P>
   were ready to swat the Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's high-tech center located two blocks from the
White House, federal experts watched on high-definition television
monitors as fireworks welcomed the new century in Australia, Hong
Kong and on around the world. Sitting in gray cubicles and staring
at computer screens, they searched for trouble spots on colorful
world maps divided into time zones. Talking into tiny digital
cameras, they communicated by video conference with disembodied
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has never had to deal with this much
information at one time,'' marveled John Koskinen, the chairman of
the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. ``What's
happening in 180 countries, what's happening in 50 states, what's
happening in all the critical infrastructure industries, what's
happening in all of the federal agencies and their abilities to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   They were ready, all right, in the whiz-bang, $50 million
Information Coordination Center, which most people call the ICC.
But the Y2K bugs _ those dreaded, embedded computer pests _ seemed
to have already been shooed away. Folks from Austria to Austin
apparently fixed the glitch that might have shut computers that
used programs with only two digits to record dates and thus
couldn't distinguish the years 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the questions you've begun to see surface a
little around the edges is, well, has this all been hype? You know,
have we wasted a lot of time and money?,'' Koskinen acknowledged.
``Especially this weekend, could we have all been doing something
else?''
</P>
<P>
   He thought not, of course, recalling that ``we should not
underestimate the nature of the problem that was originally
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the scores of journalists assembled in the media center two
floors above the ICC were hardly in a position to pack up their
laptop computers and TV gear and catered pastries and simply tell
their bosses, ``Never mind. Not much of a story here.''
</P>
<P>
   So the show went on. And on. And on. The ICC operates 24-hours a
day through next Thursday. Workers pull 12-hour shifts, changing at
9 a.m. and 9 p.m. EST. Time is relative when a new millennium is
dawning somewhere every hour and when the Wall Street Deli
downstairs never closes.
</P>
<P>
   After awhile at the ICC, you can tell who is who among the
Y2Kers by their color-coded cotton cardigans emblazed with the
official seal on the left breast. The senior officials wear white
cardigans; the technicians wear black; the public affairs officers
wear green. Support staffers wear navy blue cardigans while the
eighth-floor experts wear royal blue.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth floor ICC hub is off-limits to the media, although
reporters can periodically watch the activity on a silent TV
monitor. The media center is on the 10th floor. Serving as a
backdrop to the network newscasts, a flock of flacks work on
computer terminals. These green-cardiganed public relations
specialists from various government agencies and private industry
are the human links between the eighth and 10th floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core staff of this entire operation is fewer than 30
people, so the 200 people working on each of the 12-hour shifts are
primarily from other agencies, who are experts in each of the
sectors we're monitoring,'' explained Koskinen. They share a
``sense of confidence'' that there will be no major disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think, like all of us, there is also a sense of
curiosity about how this story is really going to unfold and end,
because no one can tell you with any precision exactly what's going
to happen, when, and where,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of suspense was less apparent in the media work room,
however, where idle reporters and technicians played video games or
checked their e-mail or watched the other news events of the day
unfold on TV monitors. There were briefings scheduled for noon EST
and 5 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. and and then Saturday at 2 a.m. and 11
a.m. and 3 p.m. and then Sunday at 2 p.m. and Monday at noon and 5
p.m. Somewhere, outside the ICC, college football teams are playing
bowl games and people are drinking champagne or eating black eyed
peas for good luck....
</P>
<P>
   The ICC will continue to operate around the clock until at next
Thursday and remain in force for a month beyond that. The center
was set up as the government's central point for gathering and
analyzing information on vital computer systems _ in government,
the private sector and internationally _ during the millennium
rollover.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that such a massive effort was needed to tackle
such a tiny quirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem is ultimately getting two digits to four, which
is relatively simple,'' Koskinen explained. ``But what's been
fascinating about it and complicated about it is it affects
virtually everything in the world.''

TUCCI TAKES OVER AT EMC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Tucci sees lots of opportunities in his new job, but
doesn't have any doubts about the top requirement of the position.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, EMC Corp. named Tucci Friday as its new president
and chief operating officer, the No. 2 position at the Hopkinton,
Mass. computer storage leader behind chief executive Michael
Ruettgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``EMC is obviously on a roll,'' said Tucci, the former chief
executive of Wang Global of Billerica. ``I'm a pragmatist. My first
priority is, don't break anything.''
</P>
<P>
   EMC said it is giving Tucci day to day responsibility for
operations that include sales and services, marketing, engineering,
manufacturing, human resources, alliances, information systems and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   It said Ruettgers, who had been both president and chief
executive since 1992, would continue to be responsible for EMC's
``overall strategic market and technology direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a partnership with Mike,'' Tucci said of his
new position. ``He is one of the undisputed leaders in the high
tech field. I think our strengths complement each other and I think
we're going to be a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   EMC has been one of the most successful public companies in
America during Ruettgers eight years in charge, driven by rapidly
increasing demand for the storage of information by computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials cited EMC's growth in recent years and
expectations it will double business again over the next several
years as reasons it wanted to add depth to its senior management
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   EMC has told analysts it expects to hire about 4,500 new
employees to accomodate further expansion of its enterprise
computer storage and software businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci had been chief executive of Wang Global since it emerged
from U.S. Bankrutpcy Court protection in 1993. The company was sold
over the summer for $2 billion to Getronics NV of the Netherlands.
He resigned from a transitional management post with Getronics
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci said he had been discussing the possibility of joining EMC
with Ruettgers for several months, but also had considered
opportunities at start-up Internet firms, in venture capital and
with other large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty frothy time out there for executives,'' he said.
``I was not opportunity constrained.''

SEEKING A DEEPER NEW YEAR'S MEANING  
 A CALL FOR NEW MUSIC IN SYNAGOGUES  
 AN INFLUENTIAL BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While there is a legal wall between church and state, no such
barrier separates organized religion from the broader culture. The
former exists within the latter, and each influences the other,
with ideas flowing back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   For an example, one might look to Fort Worth, Texas, where an
aspect of Friday night's New Year's Eve events inspired one
minister to ask clergy members nationwide to preach for peace n
January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, the Rev. R. Scott Colglazier, sat on the Fort
Worth committee charged with planning that city's millennial
events. In an interview, he said that several months ago, the
committee decided the evening ought to be more than just a party,
but should offer people a chance to reflect on something of greater
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we decided to do,'' said Colglazier, senior pastor of the
5,000-member University Christian Church in Fort Worth, ``was to
have a few seconds pause before midnight, a pause for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was that Colglazier began a personal effort
to give the idea a far wider, religious currency, by appealing to
colleagues around the country to dedicate their first sermons of
the new year _ many of which will be preached Sunday _ to the
subject of peace. He wrote letters and made phone calls. And his
church sent out a press release to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he got a boost from a politically well-known
Texan, former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, who praised
Colglazier's idea in an opinion piece Wright wrote for the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram last September.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief essay describing his idea, Colglazier wrote,
``Throughout the centuries, religious communities have been
undergirded by a vision of peace grounded in the divine presence.
To touch peace is to touch God and to touch God is to touch
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Although defined in various ways, all religious
communities agree that they have been given by God a responsibility
toward the larger world. Surely no responsibility exceeds that of
bringing peace to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Colglazier has heard from ministers in his denomination, the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and from others who plan to
preach on peace. But he has no idea how many have taken up the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly ecumenical, and that's the reason I wanted to
do it,'' he said. The idea of preaching for peace, he said,
``really cuts across denominational lines, it cuts across world
religious lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A CALL FOR NEW MUSIC IN SYNAGOGUES
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sermons, it was two weeks ago, on Dec. 18, that
Rabbi Eric Yoffie preached one calling for a ``revolution'' in the
way that Reform Jews worship, asking that synagogues use ritual
music ``that is participatory, warm and accessible,'' which would
be particularly inviting and inspiring to younger families.
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie is the president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, which represents 875 Reform synagogues, and his
sermon was directed to the several thousand members attending the
union's biennial assembly, held in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said the music he meant was composed in a
``new American style,'' with roots in Jewish summer camps and youth
groups _ as opposed to more traditional music of worship that
derives from Eastern European Jewish communities. The traditional
music, he said, is ``soaring and rich and moving,'' but often
difficult to sing, ``and so you might respond to it as you respond
to an opera performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by singing enthusiastically, people can better focus on
community, God and prayer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the sermon, he asked that the union's congregations undertake
a greater focus on worship and prayer. And among specific
proposals, he called for more emphasis on teaching Hebrew to
adults, through the use of primers the union is developing. ``We
value Hebrew for many reasons, but it is most of all the great
democratic tool of Jewish worship, the vehicle that `opens the
gates of prayer' to the average Jew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AN INFLUENTIAL BOOK
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the sermon is but one of many ways of communicating
religious ideas. More basic, at least to those who trace their
tradition to the Bible, is the book.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview by e-mail, on the subject of the most
significant religious figures of the 20th century, the eminent
historian of Christianity Martin E. Marty said he believed that the
single most influential book in American religion to have been
written in the last 100 years was ``The Varieties of Religious
Experience,'' by the psychologist William James.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Published in 1902, when James was teaching at
Harvard, it remains in print, a valued text in many university
religion courses.

STOCK INDEXES PAY OFF FOR SOME INVESTORS AT YEAREND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Stock)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major US stock indexes, which began 1999 looking back on global
financial crises and ahead with concern about the Y2K computer
software glitch, set record levels Friday and gave investors large
profits for a fifth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of major Y2K computer problems as countries welcomed
2000 helped lead a rally during a day of light trading on Wall
Street after world boxing champion Muhammad Ali rang the last
opening bell of the century to the cheers of traders, many in
tuxedos. Markets closed Friday at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market has created unprecedented wealth for many
investors as the Dow Jones industrial index and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 have turned in double-digit gains each of the last five
years. Both indexes have been up every year since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these huge returns, however, investment experts said
1999 was distinguished by a sharp division between a relatively
small group of high tech and telecommunications stocks that were
big winners and a host of losers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a tabulation by Merrill Lynch, 902 NYSE stocks rose
last year, but 1,454 declined. The figures reflect activity through
Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had a year of the haves and have-nots, big-time, in the
stock market,'' said James Weiss, chief investment officer for
State Street Research &AMP; Management Co. in Boston. ``Some people are
going to be drinking champagne tonight and others will have bread
and water.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock index rose 32.44 points Friday to set another record,
closing at 4069.31. The dramatic increases reflect the dizzying
heights scaled by the technology stocks that dominate the index.
The Nasdaq's 86 percent gain in 1999 was by far the biggest
one-year return of a market index in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial index also set a record, rising 44.26
to 11,497.12. The Dow's 25 percent gain for the year far outpaced
the 16 percent return in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The broad Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added only 4.78 points
Friday, just enough to reach a record 1469.29 for a 19.53 percent
gain last year. Mobile phone company Qualcomm Inc., the biggest
gainer in 1999 with an annual return approaching 3000 percent, led
Friday's advance; Qualcomm was up 14 3/8 to 176 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Investors set another kind of record last year by pouring $69
billion into 546 first-time stock sales, or IPOs, by US companies.
Almost half were technology companies. That investment eclipsed the
prior record set in 1996 of $50 billion and fueled spectacular
rises in many fledgling Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, investment experts said they do not see US stock
markets _ and particularly Nasdaq _ repeating last year's
performance. Many predicted a correction in technology stocks, with
some saying such a rout could drag down the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. is forecasting declines in the Dow, S&AMP;P500 and
Nasdaq this year.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cliggott, Morgan's manager of equity strategy, said a
``wall of money'' pushed up technology stocks in the fourth quarter
as mutual funds put 80 percent of their money into narrowly
invested funds that specialize in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these (technology) companies are trading at 100, 200,
300 times earnings _ if they have earnings,'' Cliggott said. ``Tech
goes up like a rocket ship. When it goes down, it goes down like a
rocket ship.''

   Marshall Acuff, equity strategist for Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, predicted that a ``divergence`` between strong gains in
technology and lagging performance elsewhere would correct itself
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see some correction'' and ``it's going to be have to
begin in the Internet,'' Acuff said. ``It will have some effect''
on the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economies and stock markets have also done well this
year. After starting last year under the shadow of 1998's currency
crises and economic downturns from Singapore to Russia, stock
markets in 30 emerging countries had a combined gain of 66.6
percent through Dec. 30, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market in Japan, which is still in the throes of
restructuring the world's second-biggest economy, rose 36.8 percent
last year, while Hong Kong's stock market rose 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where many economists believe economies will expand
more rapidly this year, the Bloomberg index of 500 European stocks
rose 36.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pessimism at the beginning of the year
about international markets,'' said Brian Gendreau, a Salomon
economist, ``and that's all but gone.''

THE SHAPE OF AN AGE TO COME

  (kd) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial, Saturday, Jan. 1, 2000:
</P>
<P>
   So now at last begins the year 2000, a juncture in time so long
anticipated it is hard to believe it has arrived, disguised as a
mere Saturday. The year is so utterly new, all four digits
overturned at once, that simply seeing the date in print jars the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   The very novelty of it _ this is the roundest year any of us
will ever see _ suggests momentous change. In a practical sense, of
course, that is far from true. What remained undone on Friday will
still need doing on Monday. Yet there is no denying that we have
arrived at the gateway to another epoch, and the moment commands
respect and reflection about the world to come. In a thousand
years, when people look back at what has preceded them, they will
see that the chronicle of this new millennium began with us, on
this day. We belong now to their history, as progenitors, in a
different way than we did even yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ideals for Posterity
</P>
<P>
   When we gaze into a seeming infinity of tomorrows, we face the
challenge that any generation confronts when it looks ahead: how to
influence a future we cannot control or even predict. We can no
more see the details of centuries yet to be than the residents of
cultivated, tolerant, prosperous Baghdad in A.D. 1000 could imagine
what their city would look like a millennium later under the
tyranny of Saddam Hussein. We also recognize that no civilization
lasts forever, and that America a thousand years hence will be
something very different, if it exists at all.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, relieves us of the obligation to do what
is within our power. That is to help form the future by bequeathing
the best of what we have learned about constructing and sustaining
an enlightened civilization. History teaches that the surest way to
reach across time is through the transmission of enduring values
and ideals. The convictions of Washington and Jefferson still guide
us powerfully today, just as the ideas of the ancient Greeks and
the Enlightenment philosophers emboldened them. We have a similar
opportunity to inspire coming generations by projecting toward them
the principles that we have honed in more recent times. They can be
the distinctive legacy of our age.
</P>
<P>
   A Fresh Way of Seeing the World
</P>
<P>
   For we are the custodians of an attitudinal revolution that
developed in the last decades of the century _ the final seconds,
figuratively speaking, of the millennium. We have come to see the
need to organize the world's affairs in ways that bridge
territorial, political and cultural boundaries and to act in
concert to protect the health of the earth itself.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas, now widely embraced, represent a seismic shift in
how we think about the world, the relations between peoples and
nations, and our relationship with the planet that is our home.
Globalization has become a term of art for unifying trends in
trade, communications and management. But it could as easily refer
to a generous new consciousness about how the world should manage
not just its enterprises and armies but the task of crafting a
shared destiny.
</P>
<P>
   True, we have not ended bloodshed or eliminated ethnic violence,
nor have we overcome poverty or defeated disease. The fact that
this day arrives freighted with anxiety about terrorist attacks in
our most joyous public spaces shows that we have not conquered the
violence born of bigotry and political division. It would be naive,
even reckless, to suggest that the world's problems do not weigh
heavily as the centuries turn, and we do not mean to underestimate
the dangers that may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But in these first hours of a new era, it behooves us to imagine
the future with a sense of optimism, something that eluded our
ancestors as they struggled just to survive. We have the humane
vision and technological means to lift the world family to new
levels of liberty, affluence, health and happiness. Forging that
possibility into reality is the task that greets us in the morning
of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Decisive Lessons
</P>
<P>
   The blinding flash and towering mushroom cloud that filled the
sky over Alamogordo, N.M., on July 16, 1945, signaled the advent of
a new world in which adversaries could unleash nature's most
powerful forces. Less than 25 years later, three men peered back at
Earth as they circled the moon, and from the porthole of their
spacecraft that Christmas Eve in 1968 we could see how small, how
wondrous our planet is as it floats in the black emptiness of
space. The profound paradox of those images _ one deadly, one
supernal _ has instructed the progressive nations of the world in
the last years of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We had acquired the tools to deform the entire planet, and not
with weapons alone. Unrestrained pollution and surging population
growth are forces of equal, albeit more gradual, cataclysmic
potential. Yet just at this point of paralyzing danger, we also
gained the ability to see the earth as a miraculous and mendable
entity, and to think and act in altruistic ways that would have
been unimaginable just a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of this transforming process _ a universal learning
experience that may in time be compared to the Renaissance _ can be
found in the blossoming of democratic spirit in 18th-century
revolutions. Later, industrialization demonstrated the
life-changing potential of technology and inventiveness. The
military conflicts of the last century created both a worldwide
hunger for peace and a sharpened antipathy to totalitarian
governance. The rising aspirations of Asia and Africa showed the
futility of imperialism, while the United States and its Western
partners, in their farsighted moments, were seeking to guide the
world according to what Lincoln called the better angels of our
nature.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent years this new perspective deepened with the
recognition and fear that the technology of war had brought us to
the edge of a disaster from which the world might never recover.
But it also grew from the interconnectedness of the modern age, the
realization that the welfare of a single nation could not be
severed from the welfare of the entire world. More benign
technologies _ airplanes, telephones, television _ spurred the
process. Today, computers and the global communications network are
all but erasing national boundaries and undercutting nationalism
itself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Different International Order
</P>
<P>
   Our political and economic models are changing as the Cold War
recedes. We have learned that our leaders should be judged not by
their ability to defeat enemies or conquer new territories, but on
their capacity to extend prosperity and peace. Because even small
countries can obtain the weapons to threaten not just adjacent
lands but distant capitals, every nation has a critical interest in
seeing every other nation do well. In the Middle East and most
recently in the Balkans, the United States and its allies have
found common purpose in combating regional bloodlettings and
preventing rogue nations from acquiring biological, chemical and
nuclear arms. We must be imaginative and wise in helping Russia and
China become responsible world powers after tortured decades under
Communism.
</P>
<P>
   The third millennium's economy has to be a mutually beneficial
construction of expanding productivity and shared prosperity, built
around the engine of trade. It is easy to see a developing nation's
wealth as an opportunity for new markets. We must also perceive
that a poor nation's hunger is a danger to the well-being of the
whole. One of the great goals for mankind in the opening decades of
the new century must be to lift hundreds of millions of destitute
people from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For poverty, like war, is contagious. It can destroy life, and
the prospect of living as well. Deprived people must consume an
earth they cannot afford to protect. They turn farmland into
desert. They develop communicable diseases that can spread across
continents in days.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation of the Planet
</P>
<P>
   Surely one of the modern epoch's greatest gifts to the third
millennium is a new reverence for the environment. Until the most
recent moment in human history, our relationship toward nature was
always carelessly rapacious. But only since the Industrial
Revolution have we been capable of doing irreparable damage to the
land, water and air. We are the first generation to accept
ecological stewardship as a duty to unborn generations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we cannot ignore the fact that our desire to see poor
countries reach prosperity is colliding with our need to curb
fossil fuels, deforestation and the depletion of an all too
exhaustible sea. Resolving those conflicts early in the new
millennium may well be the test by which posterity most stringently
grades us. If managed properly, capitalism, with its roots in
individual self-interest, can be a powerful tool for creating the
wealth that allows developing nations to cleanse the air, earth and
water.
</P>
<P>
   Future generations will also measure what we did with the
world's knowledge reserves. One of the rules for the next
millennium must be that we have an obligation to disseminate, not
hoard, new information about science, health and technology. The
Internet has given us the tools for sharing. The will must still
come from the human heart. In the end, the democratization of
wealth and health depend on the worldwide democratization of
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Light of a New Day
</P>
<P>
   We will turn soon enough to the tasks that await us. Even now,
the monumentality of this moment fades in the old familiarity of
morning and afternoon. The sun has barely begun to gather itself
after the winter solstice, and the light over the city and the
country is so fragile that it threatens to splinter and fall in
flakes to the ground, as it always threatens to do in January.
</P>
<P>
   And yet something about the sound of 2000 draws past and future
near in a way that we have never quite known before. So here we are
now, all of us, just next door to yesterday and yet somehow in a
different world. This day's firstborn are already with us, and the
first of us to die in this new calendar have already gone. Soon we
will have slept a full night in this strange-sounding year, and
then another. We cannot know how the new millennium will end, but
we do have the power to determine how it begins and, perhaps, what
it will remember of us.

   SYCAMORE, Ill. _ As darkness shrouded the farm fields, Bill
Lenschow milked the cows and finished his chores, then sat down
with his wife, Kathy, to a special dinner of steak and shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   With lights blazing in their cheerfully boisterous old house on
Washington Place, the Newquist children played board games and
watched an old Jimmy Stewart movie with their parents, Tammy and
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital on Edward Street, Jeri Delaney clasped the hand of
her husband, Patrick, who is recovering from a stroke, gave him a
kiss and told him that she loved him.
</P>
<P>
   In this small town on the frozen prairie, people tended to mark
the passing of the 20th century in gentle, personal ways.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time to be grateful, said John Garman, 62, who went to
mass then settled in to watch college football on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful time,'' said Garman, who lives in a
five-story housing project for the elderly, known here as the
high-rise. ``There is peace on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillie Jackson, 73, a neighbor of Garman, drifted back in her
memory to a New Year's Eve celebration from her childhood, when she
played with a doll she made out of a corn cob, with string pulled
from a burlap sack for the hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a time,'' she said, ``when people didn't expect so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kate Diedrich, 9, and her brother, Ryan, 8, readied their
noisemakers for the big celebration in the living room of their
farmhouse _ they were doing a countdown at 10 p.m. _ and tried to
imagine life 100 years ago. Their great-grandmother, Ruth Logan,
had explained just the other day how different things had been.
</P>
<P>
   Told that women could not vote, and were expected to stay home,
Mary Kate said she had other plans. ``I want to be president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no wild celebration on State Street, the main drag
through town. But some people, like Debbie Saalfeld, a 52-year-old
teacher, danced to the music of a disc jockey at the Stratford Inn.
Steve and Nony Roush went to dinner at Johnny's Char House, the new
place out on ``the four-lane,'' as people still call the highway
that leads to the neighboring town of DeKalb. George and Trish
Diedrich, the parents of Mary Kate and Ryan, slipped away for a New
Year's toast at a neighborhood tavern called Hinks.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Lenschows, whose cows need to be milked before dawn,
millennium or not, the old year would pass without much thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get up at 4 a.m.,'' said Bill Lenschow. ``You don't
stay out too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone remembered dreaming about the year 2000 as
children, calculating how old they would be, and wondering whether
cars would be able to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking, `Boy, I'm going to be old,'' said Steve
Roush, 50, with a chuckle. ``And, well, I guess I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Joseph Thomas, the leader of the Israel of God church on
North Avenue, who was born three years after the turn of the 20th
century, planned to stay on the straight and narrow. To mark this
New Year's Eve, he walked around the corner to his friend Lessie's
house, who was throwing a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the revelry, Thomas was staying away from vices, such as
alcohol and cigars, just as always. ``That's how I got to be
97-years-old,'' he said.

 &HT;    POPE JOINS NEW YEAR'S PARTY AT THE VATICAN: Y2K FAILS TO DAMPEN
FESTIVITIES
 &HT;    EDs: This story to be updated at 10 p.m. EST.
 &HT;    ADAM L. FREEMAN 
 &HT;    c.1999 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Technology failed to clash with tradition New Year's Eve
as tens-of thousands of celebrants packed the Vatican's St. Peter's
Square for an evening of music and a papal blessing with no worries
about technological glitches.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation known more for its culinary influence and historical
treasures than for civic organization, Italy passed into the Third
Millennium with barely a nibble from the so-called ``Y2K Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic square witnessed pilgrims and secular revelers
rubbing shoulders with nuns and priests while listening to the
ecclesiastical rhythms of the Harlem Gospel Singers among others.
Periodic pops could be heard from uncorked clandestine champagne
bottles smuggled into the celebration under the noses of the
omnipresent security.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening Pope John Paul II presided over Vespers
in St. Peter's Basilica to celebrate the beginning of the new
millennium and the closing of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those present at the celebrations had traveled to Rome
for the opening ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Grand Jubilee
which began on Christmas Eve and will end on January 6, 2001, the
day of the Epiphany. Upwards of 30 million pilgrims are expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight (local time) the crowd was too festive to worry
about Y2K problems that could complicate Italy's celebration. On
Dec. 30, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi issued a statement
stating that there would be no problem when the calendar turns to
Year Zero. Forty-thousand people burned the midnight oil to control
possible complications in all aspects of civil infrastructure.
Among them were police, coast guard, doctors and even cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in Rome, a ``war room'' of engineers worked around to
assure that all precautions and interventions had gone smoothly.
Italy's airports were empty Friday as all Alitalia flights were
cancelled between 10:45 p.m. New Year's Eve and 6:20 a.m. January
1, said Enrico Lepri, a spokesman for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after midnight the 79-year-old Pope appeared on
his balcony to bless the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
   After a festive cheer from the throngs the Pope said: ``The
clock of history strikes an important hour: at this moment the Year
2000 begins, and we enter a new millennium. A Happy New Year to all
of you, men and women of every part of the world!''

&HT;     Y2K BUG HAS NO BITE IN THE NEW YEAR _ BUT SLOT MACHINES GO

   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new year 2000 swept across the planet Friday
with no reports of major problems linked to the infamous Y2K bug,
the potential computer glitch that government safety officials had
warned could cripple industrialized societies dependent on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the No. 2 official in the State Department,
told an early evening briefing that Russia and 40 others nations in
Asia and Eastern Europe had made the transition without problems.
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' Pickering
declared. The biggest problem was the `Mothers' Day phenomenon'' of
telephone circuits being overloaded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, the director the White House Y2K command post,
cautioned that he won't have a clear picture of any
computer-related problems in the United States until late Monday
after a day of normal business operations following the long
holiday weekend. He said he would withhold any decision about
problems in the developing world until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen appeared to relish his announcement that one Y2K-linked
failure caused some 150 slot machines at three Delaware racetracks
to shut down. The time-based computer chips in the slots were
programmed to read three days ahead and became confused Thursday
night when they rolled over to 2000. The slots were quickly
repaired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The slot machine problem was proof that Y2K bugs were real and,
at the same, that this relatively innocuous problem indicated that
most people had heeded the years of warnings about how computers
could crash when the year turned over to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was there were no airplane crashes no electrical
failures, no accidental missile launches. The problem had come down
to slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Russian joint operation center located near Colorado
Springs, Colo., reported that there were no incidents. The center
was set up to protect against any mistaken perceptions that one or
the other nuclear powers had launched a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Koskinen said the Y2K transition was `the biggest
management challenge the world has had in 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that industrialized society moved into the new year
without any problems should not lead to anyone to `underestimate
the nature of the problem that was originally there.''
</P>
<P>
   `Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Early good news came to the White House center as New Year's eve
slipped past midnight in Western Pacific time zones first. For
example, New Zealand celebrated the arrival of the New Year at 6
a.m. EST. As Japan, Australia and other industrialized nations
joined the '00 honor roll, optimism grew at the White House Y2K
coordination center that years of preparedness were paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, undersecretary of state, reported that the Bilibino
nuclear reactor in the Russian Far East passed into the new year
without incident, a reassuring note because of concern about
Russia's attention to the Y2K issue and its aging nuclear reactors.
Later, he reported that all of Russia's reactors had smoothly
rolled over into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen noted an increase in public interest in the Y2K
phenomenon as Jan. 1 approach. The White House Y2K web site had
about 250,000 hits on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guam was the first U.S. territory to make the transition without
incident; Koskinen said, noting that officials on the island
reported soon after midnight that a baby was born and an airplane
had landed there.

JUDGE FINDS NOTED TAX ATTORNEY ENGINEERED KICKBACK SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (bl) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. Tax Court judge has ruled that one of the nation's most
prominent tax lawyers, Burton Kanter of Chicago, was ``the
architect'' of a long-running kickback and tax-evasion scheme in
which money was siphoned from funds managed by the Prudential and
Travelers insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The special trial judge, D. Irvin Couvillion, ruled that the IRS
had overwhelmingly proved its civil fraud case, saying there were
indications of fraud in the existence of ``sham'' companies, the
destruction of documents and evasive testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter said he had done nothing illegal and would appeal. He
said he had not calculated the potential taxes, civil fraud
penalties and interest due, but if the decision was upheld, he
said, it could run into tens of millions of dollars for himself and
a former insurance executive, Claude Ballard, and the estate of
another, Robert Lisle.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Court held that $13 million in kickbacks were paid from
1972 through 1988 by four developers and another man to Ballard and
Lisle, who were senior executives with Prudential overseeing its
real estate investments.
</P>
<P>
   The kickbacks, the court ruled, were made to them for using
their influence to steer financing and contracts to the developers
and the other man. The executives gave 10 percent of those
kickbacks to Kanter, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kanter was the architect who planned and executed the
elaborate scheme,'' Couvillion wrote in his 606-page decision,
issued Dec. 15. ``What we have here, purely and simply, is a
concerted effort by an experienced tax lawyer and two corporate
executives to defeat and evade payment of taxes and to cover up
their acts.''
</P>
<P>
   One tactic, he wrote, was to funnel kickbacks to ``sham''
companies that Kanter controlled. Kanter, the judge wrote, would
then withdraw the cash, replacing it with purported accounts
receivable from other ``sham'' companies. Such an exchange, if done
properly, can be a legal tax-free swap. But, the judge wrote, the
accounts receivable would be written off as worthless, fabricating
a tax loss for the sham company. These transactions, the judge
held, involved no real exchanges and were frauds.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, he found, these transactions involved ``pure
tax avoidance vehicles'' with no business purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The judge characterized Kanter's testimony at the 1994 trial as
``implausible'' and ``incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Couvillion, who took five years to reach his ruling, sided with
Kanter on only a few minor issues, one of them involving $349.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kanter said he was shocked that the judge ``could
ignore the testimony of more than a dozen witnesses'' who were all
``of the highest integrity'' that the payments were not kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter, 68, has earned sizeable fees representing many wealthy
Americans over the years, including Chicago's multibillionaire
Pritzker family and a number of Hollywood producers. Although he
said he did not consider himself a wealthy man, five years ago he
had enough financial muscle to try to buy the Miami Dolphins
football team _ the former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and the
Chicago developer Bruce Frey were his partners in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   He has a long history of fights with the IRS, but in many cases
his clients have come away paying far less in taxes than the IRS
sought. When A.N. Pritzker died in 1986 the IRS sought $150 million
in taxes, but because of Kanter's elaborate tax planning the family
paid only $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stef Tucker, a Washington tax lawyer and former chairman of the
American Bar Association tax section, said Kanter was one of the
most creative tax lawyers in the country and was a pioneer in
seeing how foreign trusts could be used to legally reduce taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was simply using gaps, failures by Congress to focus on
areas in the tax law, to the advantage of his clients,'' Tucker
said, adding that Kanter's willingness to disclose his techniques
in lectures and articles was a strong indicator that they were
lawful ``although he was clearly reaching the edges of the
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that Kanter and his wife, Naomi, filed tax
returns showing a negative income in each of the 12 years from 1978
through 1989. They reported a total income in those 12 years of
negative $9.4 million and paid income taxes in only one of those
years, 1978, when they paid $1,671.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has audited his returns every year but one since 1961,
Kanter said. He said that he had settled the audits through 1973,
but that each return since then was still in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   While Kanter, a senior editor of the Journal of Taxation, is
famous in tax circles for recommending complex trusts to cut taxes,
the judge found that Kanter had committed civil fraud, largely by
using simple accounting tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Couvillion's opinion notes that the IRS Criminal Investigation
Division investigated Kanter, but is silent about why no indictment
was returned. Under federal tax law, once a civil suit is begun, no
criminal case is allowed. The IRS and the Justice Department both
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The kickbacks, the judge wrote, began in the early 1970s with
payments by A.N. Pritzker to J.D. Weaver, a Tenneco executive, for
his help in steering the contract to manage a new San Francisco
hotel to the Pritzker family's Hyatt Hotels chain. Tenneco and
Prudential were partners in financing the hotel. No one answered
repeated calls Friday to the Pritzker family office for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who could not be located for comment, was to be paid 10
percent of the Hyatt management fees, but soon after the
Embarcadero Hyatt opened, Pritzker, the family patriarch, assigned
Kanter to negotiate a lower fee, the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As Kanter was negotiating with Weaver, the court found, Kanter
was also ``surreptitiously'' negotiating with Weaver to have 70
percent of the payments turned over to himself, Ballard and Lisle.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver eventually agreed to accept $150,000 cash from a company
Kanter controlled in return for relinquishing that 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it could find ``no reasonable explanation'' for
Weaver to give up millions of dollars of future income in return
for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the only possible explanation was that Lisle,
Ballard and Kanter wanted to share in the kickbacks for their roles
in steering the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter said that the judge completely mischaracterized financial
deals that were completely unrelated, fashioning from bits of
testimony a kickback scheme where none existed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Later, the court found, Ballard and Lisle steered Prudential
investments to a variety of hotel, condominium and office projects
of four developers: Frey of Glencoe, Ill., William Schaffel of New
York and Kenneth Schnitzer and John Eulich of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ballard and Lisle left Prudential in 1982. Ballard then
became a partner at Goldman Sachs, and has since retired. Lisle
joined Travelers, where, the Tax Court found that for the next six
years, until he retired, he steered Travelers investments to
developers who paid him kickbacks, sharing the proceeds with
Kanter. Travelers is now a unit of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Ballard and for the estate of Lisle, who died in
1993, said both men acted properly and that no kickbacks were paid.
The lawyer, Royal Martin, said Prudential knew the two men had
unrelated financial dealings with Weaver and the four developers.
He said he was not certain whether Travelers knew.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter, in an interview, also said that the payments were
unrelated to any financings by Prudential and Travelers and that
Prudential, at least, knew about them.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential's chief spokesman, Robert DeFillippo, said the
company was reviewing the case to determine what, if any, action it
might take.
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo declined to say what rules, if any, Prudential had at
the time, or has now, governing such financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers is ``researching what actions were taken, if any,
regarding Mr. Lisle,'' said Keith Anderson, a Travelers' spokesman.

   GROZNY, Chechnya _ After Dmitry Baidanov's legs were shattered
by mortar fire, he crawled for three days through the streets of
Grozny until he reached the Russian lines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the 19-year-old private was splayed out on his stomach,
unconscious in a field hospital on the western outskirts of the
Chechen capital. He may be one of the lucky ones. A row of six
corpses lay in the muddy field nearby, wrapped in shiny foil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than 10 wounded yesterday, and there will be more
wounded today,'' said Dmitry Turkov, a hospital orderly. ``They are
fighting less than 2 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a side of the Chechen war that most Russians are rarely
shown: patching up the wounded and the grisly task of disposing of
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the Russian military began its campaign against the Islamic
rebels, its generals vowed to win a speedy victory and hold down
Russian losses. But as Russia begins the New Year, its troops are
mired in urban warfare and the still popular war is claiming a
higher toll.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery is hurling round after round toward Grozny.
The firepower was supposed to break the will of the rebels before
Russian Interior Ministry troops moved block by block to ``clean''
the city. But the rebels are doggedly fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the army is mopping up in Grozny, we have another
wave of casualties,'' said Maj. Oleg E. Zayev, a military doctor
from St. Petersburg and a senior member of the Special Medical Team
Number 600, which runs the tent hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   Zayev said that the vast majority of his patients are stabilized
and then whisked by helicopter to the rear for extended treatment.
But just a few minutes after he spoke the militants claimed another
victim on a nearby hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Russian scouts scampered up a hill hospital to check for snipers
before inviting a small group of Russian and Western journalists to
venture forward for a commanding view of Grozny's Staropromyslovsky
district, the scene of heavy street fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On the march up the hill the reporters passed a soldier who had
just been shot through the neck and was being tended by paramedics.
By the time they marched down the hill 40 minutes later, he was
dead and his comrade torn by grief.
</P>
<P>
   The mood among the soldiers was edgy. Dec. 31 is the fifth
anniversary of the Russian military's disastrous attack on Grozny,
when Russian armored columns rushed into the center of the city
only to be annihilated by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were worried that the militants might commemorate the
date by mounting a counteroffensive. Some monitored a tactical
radio, trying to intercept the rebels' communications. As they
tried to make out the chatter, trucks full of fresh soldiers drove
toward Grozny for this chance to ``clean'' the city.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seemed to be little respite from the war at the
field hospital. Rumors of ghastly setbacks have circulated among
the medical team here. Turkov, the hospital orderly, said he had
heard that the fighting inside the city has been intense and that
the corpses of Interior Ministry troops have been ferried out of
Grozny by the truckload.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke thunderous blasts of Russian artillery rippled
through the hospital tents. Several batteries of Russian artillery
are deployed only a few hundred yards away, and they literally
fired 122-millimeter shells over the hospital tents toward Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Dmitry N. Kurochkin, a 20 year-old private from southern
Siberia who was wounded in the leg Saturday morning near Grozny's
Zavodskoi district, seemed too dazed to mind the artillery.
</P>
<P>
   His motorized infantry unit was never ordered to enter downtown
Grozny. Its role was to secure the outskirts of the city while
Interior Ministry troops carried out the dirty business of mopping
up. Even Grozny's suburbs, however, are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never actually go to Grozny,'' he said. ``We were just
outside Grozny for a week and half. I was in a trench and there was
a shot. I was the only one who was hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Sergei Shirokov, a hospital orderly, kept Kurochkin company
while he waited to be flown by helicopter to the rear. Shirokov
knows what the battle of Grozny is like.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago he was driving a T-62 tank that was hit by a
grenade during a firefight inside the city. The tank filled with
acrid smoke, the engine melted, but the crew stumbled out into the
frigid streets unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Shirokov was later hospitalized with bronchitis. When the
short-handed hospital asked him to stay and help out he jumped at
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Grozny many times,'' he said. ``We drive into a
neighborhood where they are multi-storied building. We shoot and
leave. There are snipers, and it's really horrible. I don't want to
go back.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital looked more like Hollywood on
New Year's eve as President Clinton tapped his long list of
celebrity friends to help him usher in the New Year with a glitzy
White House dinner followed by a Millennium extravaganza on the
National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 guests descended upon the White House for the
``Creator's Dinner,'' which honored America's artists, inventors,
scientists and scholars. Among the guests were Muhammad Ali,
Elizabeth Taylor and Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the guests, the president toasted the crowd and
praised America's ``endless capacity to express freedom and
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we celebrate all that is great about America, all that
is intrinsic to the American spirit, we welcome the dawn of our
future,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guests were seated outside in a heated tent in the
Rose Garden, a comfortable shelter with outside temperatures at
dusk in the balmy mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   Only a select 320 people held invitations to sit with the
president and first lady in the East Room and State Dining Room
inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among those chosen to sit down with the Clintons were Ali,
Taylor, De Niro, opera divas Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle,
historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., poet Rita Dove, concert
violinist Itzhak Perlman, playwright Neil Simon, and actors Jack
Nicholson and Mary Tyler Moore. The tables, draped with velvet
tablecloths, were set with white china with a silver _ that's real
silver _ band. In the middle of each table was a solid silver bowl
filled with white Phalenopsis orchids, white roses, white sparkle
holly and crystal balls. Adorning each silver bowl was a silver
candlestick with white tapers.
</P>
<P>
   Diners feasted on beluga caviar, lobster, foie gras and oyster
velout, served with Sterling Chardonnay, before moving on to the
main course of truffle marinated rack of lamb, roasted artichoke
and pepper rogo't and crispy garlic polenta served with Dehlinger
Pinot Noir. The dinner ended with a chocolate and champagne
delight, served with Iron Horse Brut champagne.

<P>
   (EDs: FOLLOWING THREE GRAFS ARE EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. EST)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the president gave another toast _ this one to his
wife _ and a short speech about the past and the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must come together to make this a true changing of the
times, a gateway to greater peace and progress and freedom in the
world,'' Clinton said. ``In the new century, we may not be able to
eliminate the hateful intolerance we saw too much of in this
century. But I believe we will see the rise of a healthy
intolerance of bigotry, oppression and abject poverty, not just in
our own communities but across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and their guests then traveled via shuttle vans to
the Lincoln Memorial for the splashy, 3-hour ``America's Millennium
Gala,'' a program hosted by rapper Will Smith.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (EDs: END OF EMBARGOED MATERIAL)

<P>
   The entertainment on the Mall also included Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Trisha Yearwood, Sam
Waterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell, accompanied by the
25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''In the final
half-hour of 1999, large projection screens erected beside the
Lincoln Memorial were scheduled to show an 18-minute millennial
movie, ``The Unfinished Journey'' by Steven Spielberg.At the end of
the movie, the president planned to speak briefly and then start
the evening's pyrotechnic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   With just 20 seconds left before midnight, Clinton was to light
a fuse that would burn its way along the length of the reflecting
pool, ending at the base of the Washington Monument, now surrounded
by an elaborate scaffold because of refurbishing work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 11:59:50 p.m., 10 successive bursts of brilliant white
stars were expected to rain down the sides of the monument, each 55
feet above the one before it. Finally, beginning at midnight, the
entire monument was expected to be covered with ``a stunningly
beautiful waterfall'' of white pyrotechnics, according to Philip
Butler, who is producing the show for Fireworks by Grucci, a Long
Island, N.Y., company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monument is a national icon which is held in great
reverence,'' Butler said last week, ``and we could never use it as
a fireworks stage, except for the scaffolding being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the gala, the first couple planned to return to the
White House for another party with about 1,000 guests ``that will
go for quite a while, we think, into the new year,'' said White
House spokeswoman Ann Lewis. For those revelers who make it, the
White House party was scheduled to end with breakfast ``a little

lady.

   ROME _ Technology failed to clash with tradition New Year's Eve
as more than 100,000 revelers packed the Vatican's St. Peter's
Square for an evening of music and a papal blessing with no worries
about technological glitches.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation known more for its culinary influence and historical
treasures than for civic organization, Italy passed into the Third
Millennium with barely a nibble from the so-called ``Y2K Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic square witnessed pilgrims and secular revelers
rubbing shoulders with nuns and priests while listening to the
ecclesiastical rhythms of the Harlem Gospel Singers among others.
Periodic pops could be heard from uncorked clandestine champagne
bottles smuggled into the celebration under the noses of the
omnipresent security.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening Pope John Paul II presided over Vespers
in St. Peter's Basilica to celebrate the beginning of the new
millennium and the closing of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those present at the celebrations had traveled to Rome
for the opening ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Grand Jubilee
which began on Christmas Eve and will end on January 6, 2001, the
day of the Epiphany. Upwards of 30 million pilgrims are expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight (local time) the crowd was too festive to worry
about Y2K problems that could complicate Italy's celebration. On
Dec. 30, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema issued a statement
stating that there would be no problem when the calendar turns to
Year Zero. Forty-thousand people burned the midnight oil to control
possible complications in all aspects of civil infrastructure.
Among them were police, coast guard, doctors and even cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in Rome, a ``war room'' of engineers worked around to
assure that all precautions and interventions had gone smoothly.
Italy's airports were empty Friday as all Alitalia flights were
cancelled between 10:45 p.m. New Year's Eve and 6:20 a.m. January
1, said Enrico Lepri, a spokesman for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after midnight the 79-year-old Pope appeared on
his balcony to bless the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
   After a festive cheer from the throngs the Pope said: ``The
clock of history strikes an important hour: at this moment the Year
2000 begins, and we enter a new millennium. For believers, this is
the year of the Great Jubilee. A Happy New Year to all of you, men
and women of every part of the world!''

   GROZNY, Russia _ After Dmitry Baidanov's legs were shattered by
mortar fire, he crawled for three days through the streets of
Grozny until he reached the Russian lines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the 19-year-old private was splayed out on his stomach,
unconscious in a field hospital on the western outskirts of the
Chechen capital. He may be one of the lucky ones. A row of six
corpses lay in the muddy field nearby, wrapped in shiny foil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than 10 wounded yesterday, and there will be more
wounded today,'' said Dmitry Turkov, a hospital orderly. ``They are
fighting less than 2 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a side of the Chechen war that most Russians are rarely
shown: patching up the wounded and the grisly task of disposing of
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the Russian military began its campaign against the Islamic
rebels, its generals vowed to win a speedy victory and hold down
Russian losses. But as Russia begins the New Year, its troops are
mired in urban warfare and the still popular war is claiming a
higher toll.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery is hurling round after round toward Grozny.
The firepower was supposed to break the will of the rebels before
Russian Interior Ministry troops moved block by block to ``clean''
the city. But the rebels are doggedly fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the army is mopping up in Grozny, we have another
wave of casualties,'' said Maj. Oleg E. Zayev, a military doctor
from St. Petersburg and a senior member of the Special Medical Team
Number 600, which runs the tent hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   Zayev said that the vast majority of his patients are stabilized
and then whisked by helicopter to the rear for extended treatment.
But just a few minutes after he spoke the militants claimed another
victim on a nearby hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Russian scouts scampered up a hill hospital to check for snipers
before inviting a small group of Russian and Western journalists to
venture forward for a commanding view of Grozny's Staropromyslovsky
district, the scene of heavy street fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On the march up the hill the reporters passed a soldier who had
just been shot through the neck and was being tended by paramedics.
By the time they marched down the hill 40 minutes later, he was
dead and his comrade torn by grief.
</P>
<P>
   The mood among the soldiers was edgy. Dec. 31 is the fifth
anniversary of the Russian military's disastrous attack on Grozny,
when Russian armored columns rushed into the center of the city
only to be annihilated by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were worried that the militants might commemorate the
date by mounting a counteroffensive. Some monitored a tactical
radio, trying to intercept the rebels' communications. As they
tried to make out the chatter, trucks full of fresh soldiers drove
toward Grozny for this chance to ``clean'' the city.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seemed to be little respite from the war at the
field hospital. Rumors of ghastly setbacks have circulated among
the medical team here. Turkov, the hospital orderly, said he had
heard that the fighting inside the city has been intense and that
the corpses of Interior Ministry troops have been ferried out of
Grozny by the truckload.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke thunderous blasts of Russian artillery rippled
through the hospital tents. Several batteries of Russian artillery
are deployed only a few hundred yards away, and they literally
fired 122-millimeter shells over the hospital tents toward Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Dmitry N. Kurochkin, a 20 year-old private from southern
Siberia who was wounded in the leg Saturday morning near Grozny's
Zavodskoi district, seemed too dazed to mind the artillery.
</P>
<P>
   His motorized infantry unit was never ordered to enter downtown
Grozny. Its role was to secure the outskirts of the city while
Interior Ministry troops carried out the dirty business of mopping
up. Even Grozny's suburbs, however, are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never actually go to Grozny,'' he said. ``We were just
outside Grozny for a week and half. I was in a trench and there was
a shot. I was the only one who was hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Sergei Shirokov, a hospital orderly, kept Kurochkin company
while he waited to be flown by helicopter to the rear. Shirokov
knows what the battle of Grozny is like.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago he was driving a T-62 tank that was hit by a
grenade during a firefight inside the city. The tank filled with
acrid smoke, the engine melted, but the crew stumbled out into the
frigid streets unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Shirokov was later hospitalized with bronchitis. When the
short-handed hospital asked him to stay and help out he jumped at
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Grozny many times,'' he said. ``We drive into a
neighborhood where they are multi-storied building. We shoot and
leave. There are snipers, and it's really horrible. I don't want to
go back.''

THIS HUDDLE WOULD BE WORTH GETTING INTO

   What would you pay to listen in on this conversation?
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, the National Football League may very well
have its own version of the Y2K bug if Patriots owner Bob Kraft has
to call the New York Jets asking for permission to speak with
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick about being New England's next
head coach. Kraft, or someone else in a position of power with the
Patriots, will have to ask none other than Bill Parcells for
permission. It would be interesting, since Kraft and Parcells have
not spoken since Parcells departed Foxborough for the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, there would be nothing Parcells could do to stop
Belichick from going to New England, or anywhere else. But
Belichick has a contract that says he &UR;  &LR; will be the next head coach
of the Jets. Owner Leon Hess, before his death last year, gave
Belichick a $1 million bonus to stick around and succeed Parcells.
Meanwhile, Belichick is the highest-paid assistant coach in the
NFL. Parcells has not yet made up his mind whether he is going to
coach another year. It will depend a great deal on what the next
owner has to say. And the next owner will be named in a week. The
Patriots, as soon as their regular season ends, can go after
Belichick, or anyone else they are interested in, right away.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant coach, Belichick, under normal circumstances,
would have to be allowed to interview for a head coaching vacancy.
However, if Belichick were the Jets' head coach, permission would
not be granted. But Belichick won't be the Jets' head coach Monday
because Parcells, most likely, won't decide on his future until he
meets with the new owner. The Patriots and Jets put commissioner
Paul Tagliabue in a bind three years ago in the battle over whether
Parcells could leave New England. Tagliabue made the Jets pay
compensation in the form of draft choices and New York wasn't happy
about it. What does Tagliabue do if the Patriots want to talk with
Belichick and the Jets say no, pointing out that the process to
bring in a new owner, in which the NFL is involved, has been so
slow that it has delayed Parcells's decision?

   Great observation by Joe Morgan, former Red Sox manager: ``ESPN
picks Michael Jordan the best athlete over Babe Ruth. Michael
Jordan tried to play baseball and couldn't even make it in Class A
ball. He was a failure. Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player
that ever lived. Baseball is a much tougher sport to play than
basketball, yet Michael Jordan is picked over Ruth. How does that
make sense?'' Well Joe, none of these polls make sense. The one we
had here lost all credibility when it started with Warren Spahn,
one of the greatest pitchers in history with more wins than any
other lefthander, ranked 100th. How about picking Babe Ruth at 18?
Ted Williams, our pick as the top sports ``figure,'' couldn't
compare to Bill Russell or Bobby Orr as an athlete. Russell should
have been No. 1, the second greatest basketball player of all-time
behind Jordan. Orr was the greatest hockey player who ever lived.
Everything that Wayne Gretzky could do, Orr could do better. He was
a better skater, better shooter, more physical, better in the
corners, better in open ice. Bobby Schmautz played with both and
had this comment: ``Orr was the greatest player I ever played with.
Gretzky was protected. Orr was a target.'' Rocky Marciano would be
third on my local poll. He retired as the undefeated heavyweight
champion, 49-0 with 46 knockouts, when boxing was boxing in the
1950s. Williams is a great sports figure, perhaps the most beloved
athlete to play here. But for most of his career, he could not run,
throw, or field, all of which has been overshadowed by his
greatness as a hitter.

   Here is my take on why Harry Sinden went to New Jersey to meet
with Pat Burns: Sinden got word that Burns was telling friends he
thought he was going to be fired. Sinden told Burns he was not (1)
so the Bruins would have no excuses for the way they were playing
and (2) so Burns would have no excuses at the end of the year if
the team fails to meet expectations. With the additions of Dave
Andreychuk, Marty McSorley, and Joe Murphy, this team should be
much better than it was a year ago, and it is not.

   Dan Duquette on the future of the Red Sox: ``When I came here I
wanted to develop a farm system that would have a steady flow of
talent. I think we have done that. If you have enough good players
you can do two things _ use them to make your own major league team
better or use them in a trade to get a veteran player from some
other team that fits your need. Some people have asked me why we
have been trading so many of our minor league players the last
couple of years and there is good reason for it. We can't protect
all of them. Sooner of later, if we didn't use them to make trades,
we would lose them in the draft. We lost a couple of young pitchers
this year in the draft.'' Duquette says the team's rule of thumb is
to decide on a minor league player by the end of his fourth year in
the organzation. Once every year Duquette sends his major league
scouts to evaluate all the minor leaguers and project those who
will make the big leagues.

   Terry Glenn did not completely withdraw the appeal of his
suspension. He couldn't get it done before Sunday's season finale
because much of the NFL was shut down for the holiday. Glenn was
suspended for not showing up to meetings, which might not stick
when the grievance is heard in April or May. You can't suspend a
player for missing a meeting but you can suspend him for
insubordination. Reportedly, when Glenn met with Pete Carroll to
explain his actions, Glenn was not responsive, which comes under
the heading of insubordination.

   Here is a scouting report on the Ravens from a coach whose team
plays them twice a year: ``A very physical team. New England better
be ready to meet the challenge because this is a team that plays
very hard. Outstanding defense. They have one of the fastest
defensive teams in the league. They put extreme pressure on the
quarterback. (Peter) Boulware and (Michael) McCrary are two of the
best pass rushers in the league. They come hard off the corners.
They use their interior down linemen to tie up the blockers so they
can't get out on the linebackers. Those guys inside slant a lot to
cause confusion. The linebackers can really run side to side. New
England won't get outside on them. (Middle linebacker) Ray Lewis is
one of the best in the game. They cover well at the corners, and
Rod Woodson is revived at free safety. Offensively, they are not
consistent, but they can make the big play. The two guys they have
on the outside, (Qadry) Ismail and (Patrick) Johnson, can hurt you
deep. I just watched some film of them playing Cincinnati last
week. They wanted that shutout. You could see it. Cincinnati scored
40 points in the two games before that one, and these guys shut
them right down.''

   Rams coach Dick Vermeil and Jim Mora of the Colts show it's not
how old you are, or what happened at your last job, it's whether
you can coach in the right situation. St. Louis wanted to get rid
of Vermeil at the end of last season but reportedly could not work
out a financial settlement, so he stayed. The Rams are now 13-2 and
will have home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. When
Bill Polian took over the Colts two years ago and was looking for a
head coach, he decided on Dick Jauron (another Swampscott
connection). Polian was just hours away from calling Jauron in
Jacksonville, where he was the defensive coordinator, to tell him
he had the job. However, Polian got a call from Chiefs general
manager Carl Peterson, recommending Mora. Polian had been told Mora
didn't want to coach anymore. Peterson said it wasn't so, and when
Polian spoke with Mora, he decided Mora was the guy. The Colts are
now 13-2 and AFC East champions.

   There has been a lot of talk about the Canadian government
possibly giving financial help to struggling NHL teams to keep them
in the country. If that fails, Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs thinks
the league might have to step in. ``We can't let some of those
teams fail,'' he said. ``It shouldn't be allowed to happen. These
Canadian players are still the lifeblood of our league. I think
eventually the league might have to ask the American teams to pitch
in financially to save them. If asked, I think we should do it.
It's a must as far as I'm concerned.''

   Go figure. Running back Cecil Collins didn't play for the
Dolphins the last six weeks because he was injured. In the interim,
he was arrested for allegedly climbing into a first floor apartment
and then, when surprised by the couple living there, jumped out the
window and ran away. By the way, the reason he can't play football
is he has a broken ankle. Not bad for a guy with a broken ankle.
But he'll have plenty of time to heal. He's facing four years in
jail in his native Louisiana for violating his parole agreement and
is expected to be shipped back their shortly.

RILEY, AMERICA TRUE ON COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, N.Z. _ In the closing weeks of the century, Dawn Riley
seemed destined to make sailing's year-end list as the most
significant American woman ever to haul a mainsheet or spin a
rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Two Whitbreads and an America's Cup women's breakthrough aboard
Mighty Mary in 1995 _ followed by her own current campaign _ would
easily earn the 35-year-old from San Francisco nomination to the
top of that list. Whitbread and America's Cup are the two biggest
sailing races in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But that was last century. And as a new one started
bombastically on this frenzied waterfront, a rather amazing
transformation has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   All week as America True's canary yellow hull thrashed through
the big seas of Hauraki Gulf practicing for the semifinal round of
the Cup trials that begin here Saturday, somehow the ``woman'' has
fallen away from Riley's mixed-gender team from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So has the patronizing smirk at the notion that women can
compete at the very top. Compete and win.
</P>
<P>
   Now the yellow boat looks dangerous under sail. Now it is
serious, far from the days when the women's entry into this, the
very pinnacle of international regattas, was thought by many a
glorified publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Even some on her own team gave a gentle chuckle when Riley set
as an early goal for her one-boat, underfunded campaign the role of
giant-killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the first round (in October), I had an informal
talk with a group of our people, including sailors, and they asked
me what I thought we were going to do,'' Riley said last week. ``I
said I'd be happy if we were first or second. Some of them said,
`Oh really?' Others just looked at me and laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the patronizing smiles disappeared the December
afternoon America True beat her bitter cross-town rival, Paul
Cayard in AmericaOne, to take an overall lead from Cayard, the
steadiest and highest-scoring American to that point.
</P>
<P>
   And most certainly, the crew aboard the New York Yacht Club's
Young America became true believers in Riley the day America True
sailed past them for the 9-point win in Round 3 of the trials,
driving the first serious nails into the coffin of the
high-rolling, pre-race favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even sweeter moment of triumph came when the
combination of her team's powerful sailing and Young America's
stumbling performance put the fate of the once-powerful New Yorkers
in Riley's hands. Not even a pallet load of Sam Adams beer sent to
Riley's camp by Young America as a ``diplomacy gesture'' would sway
the tough-minded Riley to race against her will.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Riley, Cayard, and Dennis Conner within days,
Young America arrived at the final weekend of the December series
needing not only a win of their own, but help from Riley. To have
any hope of gaining enough points to enter the top six slots in the
semifinals, Riley had to beat the French boat, Le Defi, on the
final day of racing.
</P>
<P>
   To Riley, who had already qualified for the semis, the points
meant nothing, and it was the night before race day that Young
America's John Marshall sent over the beer just to wedge open a
``friendly discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall now recalls the gesture with a mournful chuckle: ``Our
attempts at diplomacy failed.'' More seriously, some team members
from Young America complained that Riley had committed bad
sportsmanship in failing to give the French a fair race and New
York their shot at the semis.
</P>
<P>
   And an even darker theory has emerged, passed on via the
Internet by at least one Young America team member, that the other
Americans _ Cayard, Conner, and Riley _ had mathematically rigged
the series against New York by throwing races to weaker opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of that theory, which circulated as ``dock
talk'' for the week after the series, still sends the flame into
Riley's cheek and tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely ridiculous, and if we could prove who had
written it we would have taken legal action against them. It really
makes New York look like a bunch of whiners.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, says Riley, her decision not to race the French was
based largely on her not wanting to risk her single boat in rough
conditions. Especially in light of the breakup and near sinking of
Young America's hull 53 in November. ``In the end, we had to do
what was best for our chances. I would always rather sail than do
anything else, but there was nothing for us to gain out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, not with a bang but a whimper, New York was out, leaving
Riley's AmericaTrue not just in the semis but tied for second
place. Just where Riley said she wanted to be back when the bright
yellow boat from San Francisco was eye-catching in color only.
</P>
<P>
   It was a surprise to most Cup watchers who figured New York for
somewhere near the top and Riley's bid little more than a noble
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, however, the official word from Marshall and
Young America is that Riley made the correct pragmatic choice,
though it hurt them. Marshall disclaims any knowledge or belief in
the conspiracy theory about the other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``America True is my life, my personal life, everything,'' said
Riley, who has raced sailboats twice around the world, once as
skipper of her own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That simple quote seems to say it all about the powerfully built
athlete with the blond ponytail. When she started working on the
America True campaign after the last Whitbread, she had no doubts
about her sailing ability. Her first taste of Cup racing came
aboard Mighty Mary, Bill Koch's all-women entry in 1995 that ended
with a man joining the crew as race coach, Dave Dellenbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The move split the crew into two camps. Lest anyone mistake
Riley for a doctrinaire feminist, she led the pro-Dellenbaugh
faction on the simple grounds: ``If that will help us win, I'm all
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a question of sailing ability as she formed America
True, the real doubts concerned money. Some competitors have spent
from $50 million to more than $100 million to win the Cup in its
post-modern era that began in 1992 with the adoption of the new
International America's Cup Class 75-footers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Riley pushed in the early days, with a feisty doggedness
underlying her friendly casual nature. At one point, she was
raising funds on her personal credit card just to keep the ball
rolling, if ever so slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Helmsman Chris Coffin happened like a race-winning windshift.
The 41-year-old Internet entrepreneur, who now acts as CEO of the
syndicate, had just left the company he founded, the $1.9 billion
US Robotics, and decided to put seed money into the campaign and
take over as financial manager.
</P>
<P>
   With no intention of funding America True himself, Coffin sought
sponsors to help support the campaign's relatively barebones $21
million budget with its single-boat program and designer Phil
Kaiko.
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders in the top four, America One, Nippon Challenge,
and Prada, have built two new boats apiece and have much larger
budgets. But especially after the demise of New York, Riley
believes the America's Cup is not a crown to be bestowed upon the
royals in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's infallible. Because the America's Cup is more than
just a yacht race. It's an overall organization. It's a
corporation. It has motivation. It has momentum, and it has
interpersonal relationships. It has all these things and more put
into a pressure cooker once you start competing. To win an
America's Cup you have to find a way to manage it all.''
</P>
<P>
   With former Kiwi racer John Cutler on the helm, Riley prefers
the job in the pit, one of the physical jobs on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the pit, and then I come back and do the runners
(winched backstays) and help with the strategy and direct crew
work. Generally I call the mark roundings _ how we're going to drop
the sails and get them up again.''
</P>
<P>
   But does Dawn Riley, the first woman to enter an America's Cup
campaign in 149 years, believe she can be the first woman to win
the America's Cup at the dawn of the new century?
</P>
<P>
   In a word that she neither shouts nor hurries nor thinks about
for very long: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Note: Because New Zealand is 18 hours ahead of US East Coast time,
all action takes place a day ahead (i.e. a Sunday noon race there
is taking place Saturday evening here). To avoid confusion, all
time references in Boston Globe America's Cup stories will reflect
when the events took place according to Eastern Standard Time.)

AFTER THE PARTY, NEW BEGINNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly the sun rose Friday _ over Auckland, Sydney, Jerusalem,
the battered-but-unbowed Champs-Elysees. The world bathed in a
once-in-a-lifetime glow, rarer by far than Halley's comet.
</P>
<P>
   The impending birth of a new era called for grand gestures, and
those calls were heeded: Boris Yeltsin surprised the world Friday
by handing in his resignation, while the Dalai Lama sought to
provide an opening note of inspiration, urging the world to seize
the chance to render the next millennium one of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Over Times Square, a giant ball appeared in the New Year's Eve
dawn, delighting New Yorkers already awaiting the big night. In
South Africa, Nelson Mandela declared himself disappointed by the
20th century, and called for a more caring world in the one to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, where for some reason it is only 1992, responded to
the big event with a collective yawn.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight ticked by across the time zones, the end of the
world seemed to be confounding predictions of its arrival: power
didn't fail, computers weren't crashing, and ATMs seemed to
function. Destiny travels on its own schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For all the round-the-clock coverage on television, the
worldwide party seemed to be fizzling a bit. I started thinking
that all the party-planners had missed something. Maybe, for all
the festivity, this New Year's was more personal than public, more
a time of local reflection, than global merriment. Maybe the people
who passed up the tours to New Zealand and Greenwich were on to the
true spirit of the thing.
</P>
<P>
   I can't let the old year go without recalling a few tidbits from
1999 that I won't miss.
</P>
<P>
   Like reading and writing about controversies over a new home for
the New England Patriots _ the parking squabbles, the relocation of
tenants in the trailer park, Connecticut's overreaching Governor
John G. Rowland, and the all-star posturing at the Massachusetts
State House.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also happy to wave goodbye to Stephen Fagan, a kidnapper and
con artist whose greatest scam was to manipulate his daughters, the
media, and the public in a bizarre but successful bid for
martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Not many tears will be shed in South Boston for the lost
companionship of Peggy Davis-Mullen, the self-styled conscience of
the neighborhood who moved to West Roxbury with guns blazing. Once
she was an anti-heroin crusader, but before long she said drugs had
driven her out of the neighborhood. It had nothing, of course, to
do with her dwindling popularity among the voters who know her
best.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inauspicious year for some of the causes I care about,
with the continued erosion of affirmative action in the schools,
the Police Department, and the Fire Department. The new MCAS exam
also threatens to erode educational opportunities for minority
students, who so far have flunked it in droves.
</P>
<P>
   But New Year's Day is not a day for politics or causes. It is
local in a different way: a time for new beginnings, the first day
_ like every day _ of the rest of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   The hype has died down; the last champagne has stopped flowing.
The orchestra has packed up; the world didn't end. (Alas, your
hangover may be proving Y2K compliant.)
</P>
<P>
   Now what? Has your party ended, or is it just beginning? What,
exactly, did you ring in? What is your 2000 about?
</P>
<P>
   We all have our old-standby resolutions, the ones carried over
from last year and the year before that and the year before that.
The gym memberships. The resolve to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, New Year's Eve 1999 was supposed to be the
excuse for the party to end all parties. More recently, it was
supposed to be the end of the computer age as we know it. Then,
after fewer people than expected chose to circle the globe and the
world seemed unlikely to end, we were left without the party or the
chaos, left to chart our own courses.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's a small victory in that, a triumph of the personal
over the huge and commercial. It isn't only politics that ends up
being local.
</P>
<P>
   So as the new day dawns, I wish for all of you simply what I
wish for myself: peace, a bit of prosperity, and a bit of luck. Now
that the holiday is over, we get the real party, the daily
celebration of our ordinary lives.
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year.

AN EXCUSE TO LOOK BACK, AND AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By RICHARD EDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``But where are the snows of yesteryear?'' the poet Francois
Villon asked in the 15th century, not even halfway through the
millennium we are making a fuss about leaving. Nothing new under
the sun; though in his case it was not an early global-warming
alert but a lament for departed loveliness. Nothing new there
either.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the past is prologue, but here at the changing of the
hundred- and thousand-year guard, prologue is chiefly the past. The
flood of writing on the subject, including this additional
teacupful, looks back more than forward. ``Millennium'' has a great
gong sound, but is it the gong announcing the end of an era or
summoning the one to come? The first is bronze, the second is tin.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is another country where things are done
differently, as L.P. Hartley put it, at least it IS a country, with
features, memories good and bad and maybe lessons to be drawn. The
future is no country at all. At best it is a reservation made
through a fly-by-night travel agency that may send us quite
otherwise than we'd planned, or go out of business overnight and no
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   History, we are told, is the use the present makes of the past
for the sake of the future. This millennial looking-ahead is the
use the present makes of the future for the sake of the past _ to
salute or at least to confirm it. Hey, we call out ahead to the
year 3000 while stuffing a time capsule with our bric-a-brac and
bright ideas: This is where we are and what we've done with the
thousand years just gone. Show-and-tell time. Please grade.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is a notional plea. Having asked what truth was,
jesting Pilate didn't stay for an answer. We won't arrive for one.
Prophecy itself is a judgment on today, not tomorrow, a judgment
seasoned with triumphalism or foreboding, depending on who we are
and have been, and much less on what we foresee. Reading entrails
is most likely an older form of vaticination than reading stars.
Even stargazing is reading what happened millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as it casts ahead, ``millennium'' is a large package for
not very large thoughts. They rattle. Arranging this shindig, we've
rented a banquet hall for a takeout lunch; a journalistic
arrangement, among other things. So was the original ``Yes,
Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.'' Some of the more facile
examples of this prophetic bridge-building are not far from ``Yes,
Virginia, there is a future.'' Who knows, maybe the millennium will
fall under Andy Warhol's rule: famous for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the way to think about the 2000s is to let the thousands
go and fix upon the two. (That was my wife's suggestion; but then,
as a painter of landscapes and figures, she works to conjure past
and future in one stroke of the present.) What will next year and
the year after be like? That is quite a lot, even a terrifying lot,
considering the speeding-up of change. Terrifying to a sexagenarian
entrails-reader, that is; much less or even not at all to his
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the grandchildren? A note or two from a
foreboder:
</P>
<P>
   DETERIORATION OF PLACE. Chat rooms that are nowhere, e-marketing
that is nowhere and may end up contributing nothing, in the way of
taxes, to the upkeep of the pavements we nonvirtually walk upon.
(Why walk, of course, when we can Web?) Visiting, that magic
pleasure and terror (through the woods to grandfather's house or
maybe grandmother's or maybe the wolf that ate her), becomes a
riskless keystroke. For a long time we've had 800 numbers that are
nowhere and will-o'-the-wisp mortgages that flit from place to
place around the continent. Nowhere is not quite it: all of it is
somewhere, only the somewhere is all one same climate-controlled
cubicle and gray-white keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   DETERIORATION OF TIME, specifically the progressions of time
embodied in the generations. There are still parents and
grandparents, and a child can still draw on particular experience,
tempers and stories. Youth culture tends to bypass these things.
Children have always argued their contemporaries against the
parental hierarchy, and a good thing, too. There was liberating
growth in it. But so manipulated is it now _ one part spark to ten
parts marketing _ that it has become a revolution that not only
devours but predigests itself.
</P>
<P>
   DETERIORATION OF REALITY, which has always been a dialectic
between what we control and what we don't. The steel of necessity
strikes the flint of invention. Not much spark to be had when
necessity, supposedly bypassed, has been vanquished into a banana.
Plato's great myth told our life as the shadows cast by the light
filtering into a cave in contrast to the reality outside. Two
thousand years of civilization's fitful exploration has been a
reaching for the outside. The next thousand _ until war comes or
the power fails or the virtual culture produces immune rejection _
more than slightly suggests an advance back into the cave's
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Villon's ballad was a pulsing lament, a sense that we fall
through time instead of ascending through it. Seeming to look
backward, it is prophecy nonetheless. Today, 500 years after, the
pulse beats sooner or later even in the staunchest progress
believers. Arrhythmia, they may call it; for some of us it is
rhythm. Whichever; more sure than any predicting about the shape
and consequences of an information universe is that this pulse will
beat 500 years from now. Depending, of course, on what loveliness
remains to be lamented.
</P>
<P>
   What the ``snows of yesteryear'' is really asking is: Where are
the snows of next year? Ecology, pollution, warming come into it,
of course, but I think of the decline of specific and unique forms
in our life _ snow is not the only crystal _ unarranged,
unmanipulated, ungeneralized and unmarketed. Also the possibility,from night to morning, of finding the world transformed and renewed
by something we neither control nor are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a computer feels that way when rebooted. Mine died
entirely for 24 hours while I was trying to write this. Millennium
takes out a critic? Computer rebels against what it is being made
to say? Computer _ oh, God _ agreeing and shutting down in
sympathy?

RUSSIA'S NEW PRESIDENT STEPS OUT FROM THE SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With RUSSIA-YELTSIN) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After the Kremlin's newborn political party registered
a thumping victory in parliamentary elections last week, reporters
asked Prime Minister Vladimir Putin whether his strengthened hand
might lead to changes in the government. Putin was
characteristically forthcoming. ``We'll see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That much Russia now sees, in spades. But in its new president's
fashion, much about the man who now runs Russia, and who seems
likely to win the suddenly scheduled election for the presidency in
March, remains behind a veil.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is extolled by admirers as the ideal man for Russia's
darkest hour. He is, they say, for a strong Kremlin, but democratic
to the marrow; dedicated to government economic controls, but
pro-market; former President Boris Yeltsin's man, but apart from
his infamous entourage of tycoons, schemers and supposed thieves.
</P>
<P>
   And that may all be true. But President Putin so far remains an
empty vessel, his public record distinguished mostly by a popular
but brutal war in Chechnya and an election victory this month
which, by most experts' reckoning, made a hash of democratic
campaign norms.
</P>
<P>
   His private record _ and much of it is private _ conceals some
15 years with the KGB, largely as an intelligence officer based in
East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to say who he is. He's just a nicely
wrapped package,'' Andre Piontkovsky, a political analyst and one
of Putin's most merciless critics, said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, he suggested, may be the kind of strongman that some
liberal and democratic reformers now say they long for: a leader
willing to wring the last czarist and Communist impulses out of the
nation so that capitalism may come to full flower.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who may know Putin best, former St. Petersburg mayor
Anatoly Sobchak, says that is simply wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak taught law to Putin at Leningrad State University nearly
30 years ago, and later recruited him to a mayoral team of
democratic, pro-market activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is relying not on the army, but on political power,'' he
said in a telephone interview Friday. ``He's created his own
political party. And he is planning to work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin certainly speaks the lines of a democratic reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Russian society does not identify a strong and
effective state with a totalitarian state,'' he wrote in a newly
published treatise on Russia at the cusp of the millennium. ``We
have come to value the benefits of democracy, a law-based state,
and personal and political freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``at the same time,'' he added in the next sentence,
``people are alarmed by the obvious weakening of state power. The
public looks forward to the restoration of the guiding and
regulating role of the state to a degree which is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is not made any easier
by the fact that his analysis is very likely correct on both
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Trim, blue-eyed, balding, and, at 47, resembling more an actuary
than a politician, Putin is by all counts an extremely competent,
cautious and intelligent man. Born in Leningrad, later St.
Petersburg, he graduated with honors in 1975 from Leningrad State
University's law department, where he studied economic law under
Sobchak.
</P>
<P>
   He did not become a lawyer. Instead, he joined the KGB's foreign
intelligence arm, the First Chief Directorate, and by various
reports, served in Moscow before being assigned to Dresden, then
part of East Germany, in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Officially _ and perhaps actually _ his task was to track the
political leanings of East Germans and their contacts with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, according to news reports and Sobchak, Putin was
involved in economic intelligence-gathering, perhaps the KGB's
central task in the 1980s as the Soviet economic engine began
throwing rods and lurching toward collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Leningrad in 1989, speaking fluent German and
steeped in Western business knowledge, and left active KGB service
to join the university's international affairs department. Then and
now, many speculated that Col. Putin remained a KGB operative and
that his job was to monitor the city's flourishing democratic
reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, a leader of that movement, was by then chairman of the
Soviet equivalent of the Leningrad legislature, and he hired Putin
as an aide. When Sobchak became mayor in June 1991, Putin followed
him into city government, steadily rising to the post of first
deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely known then as ``the gray cardinal,'' a reference
not just to his influence but also to his penchant for remaining
out of public view. And he played a key role in bringing Western
investors to the city, signing the American firm KPMG to advise
officials on economic policy and luring Germany's BNP-Dresdner Bank
to set up offices there.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday, Sergei Stepashin, a former
Russian prime minister and now a Russian parliament deputy from St.
Petersburg, said Putin had another nickname: ``Stasi,'' after the
feared East German secret service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In outside appearance, he is a calm, inconspicuous, quiet
man,'' he told the television network NTV. ``But his grip, which
was felt by all the financiers in St. Petersburg, was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak lost a re-election bid in 1996, but Putin continued to
rise, apparently brought to Moscow and the Kremlin by another St.
Petersburg reformer, Anatoly A. Chubais.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's first Kremlin job was as a top aide to Pavel Borodin,
the Kremlin property manager who is now at the center of bribery
and corruption charges surrounding the vastly expensive renovation
of Yeltsin's residence and other official buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Putin rose swiftly through the ranks, first overseeing the
implementation of Yeltsin's presidential decrees, then in 1998
becoming head of the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service,
with a mandate to focus on economic intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   By last March, he was head of Yeltsin's security council,
roughly responsible for internal security and national defense. And
on Aug. 9, he replaced Stepashin as prime minister and Yeltsin's
heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin's political potential was dismissed from the start, but
wrongly. His aggressive pursuit of the war in Chechnya, which
followed the bombings of five buildings in Moscow and other cities,
blamed on terrorists, established his image as a tough and
no-nonsense leader at a time when Russians were seeking just such a
person.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin, a refined man by any standards, pointedly said last
fall that he would wipe out Chechen rebels even if they were killed
in their toilets _ a vulgar piece of Russian army slang _ he began
to rocket upward in the polls. By this month, nearly half of the
respondents in some polls favored him as Yeltsin's successor, an
astronomical figure in a nation where a politician with a 20
percent rating is considered a comer.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Putin was the originator or the beneficiary of such
shrewdness is less easily gauged. As a politician, his record is
mixed: He was one of the leaders of Sobchak's losing mayoral
campaign, and he oversaw a lackluster parliamentary campaign there
in the mid-1990s as a local leader of the pro-Yeltsin political
party Our Russian Home.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, he has benefited not just from the war and
the patriotic fervor enveloping it, but from an economic comeback
propelled by a rise in world oil prices and a devalued ruble. The
Russian media, much of it state-controlled or under the Kremlin's
sway, has been equally devoted: Putin's fondness for running and
contact sports like judo has been lovingly detailed in front-page
photos and television footage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's new Unity party is widely agreed to have performed
so well in December's parliamentary elections because its
candidates rode the coattails of Putin's popularity and because the
Kremlin waged a war of character assassination, disinformation and
manipulation against its principal rivals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   None of this says much about what kind of president Putin will
be when, and if, he is elected and becomes leader of a vast nation
on his own right rather than by fiat of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak has no doubts. ``Together with Putin I went through two
putches, in '91 and '93, and I know how he carried himself during
these trials. This is a completely courageous person on whom one
can rely and would never deceive you,'' he said. ``He does indeed
have democratic views regarding the future of the country. But he
understands very well that such a country as Russia requires strong
power. Without such a power, Russia will stop existing as a unified
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior administration official speaking on
condition of anonymity offered a Putin-esque assessment of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know him. He's a cool character. He's smart. I believe his
instincts are democratic,'' the official said. ``But we'll see.''

SLOWLY, SLOWLY, SLOWLY, THE YEAR'S FIRST DAWN 
</HEADLINE>

 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first to greet the new day on Taveuni Island, Fiji, were the
birds, singing from the treetops at the ocean's edge, skimming
along the surf, filling the pale pre-dawn with celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As the glittering surface of the ocean turned from black to iron
gray to silver, a flock of crimson lorys landed for just a moment
on the red fronds of an umbrella tree, then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Spiky white-and-pink blossoms from an overhanging poison fish
tree plopped into the hissing surf. A family of crabs crawled
carefully up the rocky shore. Inevitably, roosters crowed.
</P>
<P>
   Silhouetted among the spiky coconut palms, villagers gathered at
the shoreline to watch the new year's first dawn, here in the South
Pacific. From Tuvalu to Fiji to Tonga to the little islands off the
coast of New Zealand, the sun was rising along the international
dateline, almost a full day before it would rise in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This small island of 12,000 people is one of the few landfalls
of the 180 degree meridian, the basis for the international
dateline and the farthest point from the 0 degree meridian at
Greenwich, England.
</P>
<P>
   As they gathered at the island's eastern edge, some of the
villagers sat quietly, wrapped in blankets, staring at the horizon.
Others were still rowdy from their midnight celebrations, wading
out, laughing, into the shallow surf.
</P>
<P>
   A young man named Naibuku Petersen blew a whistle and shouted,
``I love the weather!'' A small van raced by in a cloud of dust,
its driver honking and whooping. Someone fired a skyrocket into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   But as dawn approached and the sharp sliver of moon began to
fade, the people along the shoreline grew quieter.
</P>
<P>
   The sky became pale, with hints of blue and green and pink,
suggesting a dazzling sunrise to come. A streak of gold appeared
above a cluster of blue-gray clouds on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming up now!'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the clouds, the sun seemed to pause, even as the sky
around it lightened and the smooth sea sparkled. For a while, it
seemed that this would be a day without a sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Without its sharp rays, the world turned dove gray _ the sea,
the clouds, the distant island of Qamea. Even the sea breeze had a
soft, dove-gray feel.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of sunrise had arrived, just before 6:30 a.m. But
still there was no sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be feeling shy to come up because so many people are
watching,'' said Elizabeth Pickering, 51, who wore a traditional
wraparound skirt and a white gardenia behind her ear.
</P>
<P>
   An ornate cluster of clouds huddled closer around the sun, as if
to shield it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clouds refuse to move,'' Mrs. Pickering said. ``Although
the breeze is there _ the wind _ but they are just staying there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the watchers also stayed along the rocky shoreline as the
rest of the world around them brightened into day, but still
without a sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour had passed beyond the appointed moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's teasing us this morning,'' said a woman named Mary
Erasito.
</P>
<P>
   The sun, it seemed, was preparing a grand entrance, an
overpowering debut more elegant than the showiness of a textbook
sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   First it fringed the sheltering clouds with a rim of light. Then
it turned them milky gray.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just past 7 a.m., it burst through above them,
blinding silver, emperor of a new century. And people began to
shout, ``Look at it! Look at it!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pickering shouted too: ``It's laughing at us!''
</P>
<P>
   Fra Hill, 57, a local silk-screen artist, kissed her hands and
held them out to the sun. She was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just looking and twinkling at me,'' she said. ``I've got
it. And it's got me. It can't get better than that. It just came
out full-blown. It's smiling, it feels so good. I'm so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She stared directly into the bright, white sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one chance in 1,000, and I've got it, I've captured
it,'' she said. ``It's beautiful, an oval shape, and there's a
curve underneath and it's bluish. Oh, it's beautiful and you see
the whole beautiful face of it, like a mirror, like a diamond,
round and beautiful.''

BILINGUAL CELEBRATIONS IN A BORDER BOOMTOWN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The last day of the 1900s arrived like any other
at the foot of International Bridge No. 1: old women and cowboys,
teen-agers and tourists, all of them and thousands of others
crossed back and forth from Mexico as if the notion of two
countries were mostly an inconvenience not of their making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like it was one city,'' said Terry Medinilla, a
salesperson at El Porvenir, a clothing store that depends on
customers walking across the bridge from Mexico. ``We can't be
without them, and they can't be without us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, naturally, Laredo and its Mexican sister city, Nuevo Laredo,
decided to ring in the year 2000 together, with a ceremony shortly
before midnight above the green waters of the Rio Grande that
divide them. With an intended dose of symbolism, the two mayors
planned to meet in the middle of the closed bridge and embrace, a
reminder of the artifice of boundaries created by a line on a map
or, for that matter, by a tick of a clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to remind the two countries how important our people
are, and the role they play for the economies of the countr
sides,'' Mayor Betty Flores of Laredo said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The future arrived in Laredo in 1994 with the North American
Free Trade Agreement. Even if prosperity now smells a lot like
truck exhaust, Nafta has made Laredo the busiest cargo crossing
point on the border and transformed a city once called the poorest
in the nation into one whose population has doubled to 200,000
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people refer to our town as the biggest truck stop in the
nation,'' said Maria Eugenia Guerra, the outspoken publisher of the
monthly newspaper LareDos.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a city on the make, a city whose many
contradictions were laid bare as it rang in the new year. Its new
rich, many of them recently arrived executives from sprouting
border industries, gathered at private parties, like the ones at
the La Posada Hotel and the local country club ringed by expensive
new homes. Yet in the old neighborhoods of shacks and shanties,
families held more modest fiestas or trickled down to the free
party at a city park beside the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the river from the party, a huge red, white and
green Mexican flag fluttered in the breeze. The night before, as
pedestrians with the appropriate documentation passed back and
forth over the bridge, two men in their underwear could be seen
wading across the Rio Grande. They each held a bundle of clothes
above the water as they reached the American side of the river and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the bridge seemed to notice or care. A few blocks
away, on the Mexican side of the river in Nuevo Laredo, a dinner
crowd trickled into the El Dorado Restaurant. A table of Mexican
cowboys in dusty blue jeans sat at one table, drinking beer and
listening to a Mexican band. Two American women wearing expensive
jewelry sat at another table, while two young American men flirted
with a table of even younger women. In a corner, a tourist fed her
baby in an Italian stroller as her husband ate a plate of cabrito,
or goat.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the border, the 21st century has arrived.

GORE'S CRITICISM OF BRADLEY'S DRUG-INDUSTRY TIES IGNORES HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Gore has denounced former Sen. Bill
Bradley for taking large amounts of campaign cash from drug
companies and, Gore says, doing their bidding during his 18 years
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, debates, advertisements and campaign literature,
the vice president has accused Bradley of repeatedly siding with
the pharmaceutical industry _ many of whose leading companies are
based in his home state of New Jersey _ while Gore portrays himself
as the consumer's advocate in Washington against predatory drug
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Bradley has championed some legislation favored
by the drug industry, but the Clinton-Gore administration has also
helped pharmaceutical companies on certain issues, and the
Clinton-Gore ticket raked in plenty of their money, too.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bradley-Gore debate on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' two
weekends ago, Gore, trying to paint Bradley as hypocritical on the
issue of campaign finance reform, noted that Bradley had received
campaign contributions from ``all the CEOs of the major
pharmaceutical companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley tried to respond, but the vice president abruptly cut
him off to press his attack.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, eight chief executives of drug companies _ including
the heads of Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., Johnson
&AMP; Johnson and American Home Products _ have contributed $1,000 each
to Bradley's campaign, as have dozens of other industry officials.
Bradley's presidential campaign had received about $65,000 from
employees of drug concerns as of Nov. 1, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, an independent watchdog group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a small fraction of the $27 million the former
senator has raised this year for his presidential bid. The drug
industry does not rank among the top industry groups contributing
to his campaign (his top contributors include individuals tied to
investment banks and law firms). None of Bradley's 30 top
fund-raisers is affiliated with a drug company or a health care
concern _ while several of Gore's closest advisers are paid
lobbyists for major drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley was widely considered one of the industry's most
effective defenders in Congress. He supported an array of measures
backed by the drug industry, including bills that would extend
patent protection for popular drugs and a large tax break for
manufacturing pharmaceuticals in Puerto Rico. He sponsored tariff
reductions for raw materials needed in drug manufacturing that
would benefit home-state pharmaceutical companies, and he voted to
kill a 1992 amendment that would have imposed cost controls on
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in campaign literature, also notes that Bradley received
$96,160 from employees of major pharmaceutical companies in his
three campaigns for the Senate from 1978 to 1990. Again, that is a
small percentage of his overall Senate fund-raising total of more
than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore has made Bradley's ties to the pharmaceutical
industry a central point of attack and a defining distinction
between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``For voters looking for a clear difference between the two
candidates, they don't need to look any farther than the
prescription drug issue,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman.
``Al Gore has devoted a good portion of his career to making
prescription drugs more accessible and more affordable while Sen.
Bradley has taken a lot of money from the New Jersey pharmaceutical
companies and represented their interests.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Gore's stand on prescription drugs has pitted
him against the pharmaceutical industry. But that did not stop the
industry from showering money on the Clinton-Gore campaigns in 1992
and 1996, as well as the Democratic Party. That money, in fact, far
eclipses the amounts that have gone to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential election alone, drug company employees
donated $94,325 to the Clinton-Gore committee _ almost as much as
Gore says Bradley received in his three Senate campaigns.
Pharmaceutical employees donated $36,000 to the 1992 Clinton-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also accepted $50,200 in donations from the political
action committees of major pharmaceutical companies for his House
and Senate races from 1983 to 1990 and for his political action
committee in 1998, according to a review of Federal Election
Commission reports by the Bradley campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, election commission records show that
pharmaceutical manufacturers gave the Democratic Party $2.3 million
in unrestricted soft money donations for the 1996 campaign and
$829,000 for the 1992 campaign, some of which almost certainly
benefited the Clinton-Gore ticket by paying for political
advertising, polling and get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane did not deny that Gore had received donations from the
drug industry over the years, but said that Gore had consistently
opposed their interests by supporting price controls on
prescription drugs and increased availability of generic
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, however, the Clinton-Gore administration has
been an industry ally. For example, the administration supported
dozens of patent extensions sought by name-brand drug makers to
protect their products from competition from cheaper generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the president signed into law a two-year extension of
the patent on Zantac, a popular ulcer medicine, that independent
analysts said provided a $1 billion windfall for its manufacturer,
Glaxo Wellcome Inc., which has contributed more than $200,000 to
the Democratic Party during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley voted against the Zantac patent extension, arguing that
generic substitutes for the medication would be cheaper for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the pharmaceutical industry said that Bradley had
been responsive to their concerns, but they dismissed Gore's
attacks as campaign posturing. They said that Bradley had not
consulted them before announcing his health care plan and expressed
concern that it could lead to price controls on prescription drugs
_ a move they consider the greatest threat government poses to
their industry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very serious issues at stake for the pharmaceutical
industry'' in this election, said Alan F. Holmer, president of the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade
association for the big drug companies. ``Reducing these issues to
politics doesn't help anyone, least of all patients who are waiting
for new cures and treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top drug industry official, John Doorley, director of
corporate communications at Merck &AMP; Co., said Bradley had listened
to drug makers' concerns _ and occasionally had supported their
positions in Congress. He added, however, that Bradley did no more
than would be expected of a senator whose state was home to several
large pharmaceutical companies. Merck, the world's largest drug
manufacturer, is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., in the
northwest part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of our two senators, and therefore he was important
to us and us to him,'' Doorley said. ``However, the pharmaceutical
industry is the largest manufacturing-based industry in the state
and a very important constituency to every member of the
congressional delegation. So there would be a relationship there
and that's all we would have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Bradley introduced legislation that would have saved
Merck $10 million in import duties on three chemicals used in the
manufacture of drugs. The measure was one of a series of bills
Bradley proposed that year to lift tariffs on materials used by New
Jersey companies, including one to benefit Warner-Lambert, another
big drug company with headquarters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Merck and Warner-Lambert have contributed about
$25,000 to Bradley's campaigns for the Senate and the presidency,
according to Federal Election Commission reports.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, the chief spokesman for Bradley, said the bills _
which never came up for a vote _ would have cost the Treasury a
small amount in lost revenue while saving consumers millions of
dollars in lower prices on prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hauser said the Clinton administration had also taken
pro-industry stands by extending patents on dozens of brand-name
drugs, costing consumers billions in higher prices by stalling the
introduction of cheaper generics.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said the vice president had recently proposed changes in
American patent law that would speed introduction of generic
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser strongly denied that Bradley was, for financial or
geographical reasons, beholden to the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was well known for his independence in the Senate and that
reputation came from his view that you decided things on the merits
and that influence from those with vested interests was never a
determining factor for him,'' Hauser said. ``There is plenty of
evidence to suggest that his record was balanced between the right
decisions for New Jersey and the right decisions for consumers.''

 &HT;    THIRD MILLENNIUM COMES TO BRITAIN: It's Zulu Time!
 &HT;    EDs: Thiswill be updated by 10 p.m. EST.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The new millennium arrived in London with the familiar
midnight toll of Big Ben followed by minutes of thundering,
dazzling bursts of fireworks over the rushing currents of the River
Thames.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion worth of fireworks filled the sky for more than
20 minutes. It was the much-anticipated climax of years of planning
to transform the British capital into party central for millennium
celebrations. By all early indicators, it was a rousing success _
or as rousing a success as such a celebration can be given its
tendency to attract hundreds of thousands of alcohol-soused
revelers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, police reported few more than routine incidents during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night in which Britain confronted its past and present.
In the waning hours of the millennium, the BBC Concert Orchestra
played ``Rule, Britannia!'' for the final time of the age in Royal
Albert Hall. The 6,000 concert-goers _ some in tuxedos, some in
jeans _ stood and sang jubilantly while waving British flags.
</P>
<P>
   The song holds a far different resonance at the end of a century
that has seen the dissolution of one of the world's great empires.
As it enters the 21st century, Britain faces the real prospect of
being reduced to only England, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and
Wales now enjoying a measure of independence from the central
government in London.
</P>
<P>
   But for Edgar Robertson who had come to the Albert Hall concert
with his family from Birmingham _ the one in England _ the night
and century seemed full of promise. ``There isn't an empire anymore
at the end of this century, ``but Britain remains such an important
force in the world,'' he said. ``Could anybody really imagine a day
when you would see American troops heading into some hot spot
without their British cousins at their sides? But this will be
America's millennium, won't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the elegant confines of Albert Hall, the night took on a
substantially less refined air. On The Mall, the broad ceremonial
boulevard that terminates at Buckingham Palace, a carnival lit the
night with the wattage of stomach churning rides.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds jammed the city's ancient thoroughfares and squares. Much
of the central city was turned into a huge pedestrian zone.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:30 p.m. (GMT), Admiral Nelson's column rose from a solid
mass of human bodies crammed into Trafalgar Square. Dominating the
skyline near Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament was the one
annoying glitch: the stunning, five-story London Eye. The
state-of-the-art Ferris wheel was idle because it failed a safety
test earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, none of the dreaded snags expected with the feared Y2K bug
appeared. So pleased was the government in the country's successful
performance that it issued a statement before midnight declaring
that all was running without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic visual scene was the Thames River, its swift
currents lit by dozens of spotlights and laser beams to be the
``river of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II sailed down the River Thames, the center of
festivities, to light a huge millennium beacon afloat on a barge,
two hours before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen smaller beacons blazed on bridges, and hundreds of
thousands of people gathered along the riverbanks in the center of
the capital to watch a 120-foot wall of flame race across the
</P>
<P>
   water's surface at the moment the century turned.
</P>
<P>
   That was the cue to light 40,000 fireworks waiting on barges
moored along the river for a 15-minute display of color and light.

 &HT;    CLINTON IGNITES FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR TO GREET 2000
 &HT;    EDs: A 1STLD will move by 10:30 p.m. EST, followed by an update
at midnight.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mild temperatures and a string of flawless midnight
New Year's rollovers around the globe enticed tens of thousands to
the National Mall for a fireworks spectacular ignited by President
Clinton to greet 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd that funneled through a handful of security
check-points with metal detectors and bag searches didn't approach
the 100,000 officials were expecting. As late as two weeks ago half
a million people were expected to converge on the Mall, but weeks
of terrorist warnings by high government officials dampened
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at events throughout the day, Clinton made no mention
of the unease that had settled on Washington in the weeks leading
up to Friday night. Fear of terrorism pegged to year-end
celebrations focused on Washington, New York and Seattle, leading
the Mayor of Seattle last week to cancel a major outdoor
celebration around the city's famed Space Needle. New York and
Washington shrouded their programs in security, but didn't change
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we celebrate did not begin today, and it will not end
tomorrow,'' Clinton said to a crowd at the Mall earlier in the day.
``There is no better opportunity to open a new chapter of progress
and possibility for all people ... no better time to be a truly
good neighbor to the people of the world who share this smaller and
smaller planet of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked God ``for this wonderful weather, so we all feel
good being out here. . . The sun is still rising on America.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sunlight faded on the day, the Siegel family of Richmond
played the card game Uno while sitting on the curb waiting, with a
few hundred others, to be let into a fenced off section of the Mall
nearest the Lincoln Memorial. Actor and musician Will Smith hosted
a 3-hour stage show called America's Millennium Gala for Clinton
and other dignitaries, including former Sen. John Glenn, at the
Lincoln Memorial. The show was broadcast on giant-screen
televisions on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the performers were actor Robert Duvall, actress Diane
Keaton, and musicians Don McLean, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross,
Kathy Mattea, Trisha Yearwood, and the 25-member company of the
Broadway production ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Siegels weren't worried about the dangers of either Y2K
chaos or terrorism. In fact, they joked about the festivities being
hosted by Smith, who has played the hero in a pair of futuristic
space-themed films, ``Men in Black'' and ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought since Will Smith is the host and he's killed aliens
and space bugs you couldn't be in a better-protected zone,'' joked
Dan Siegel, 46, who was there with his wife, Peggy, and children
Julia, 16, and Tommy, 14.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for danger made it possible to get a hotel
room within walking distance of the Mall just last week. And, in
their one concession to the Y2K bug, the Siegels settled on
Washington as their New Year's celebration destination because they
could make the trip from Richmond and back on a single tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case there's a problem and we can't get any more,''
said Peggy Siegel, also 46.
</P>
<P>
   For Benjamin McKenzie, 29, the trip to the Mall was just a walk.
He lives on Capitol Hill and brought his 15-year-old brother, who's
visiting from upstate New York, down for the fireworks. But he
couldn't get his friends to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said 'No way!''' McKenzie said. ``We know security is a
concern, but it's not overwhelming. It feels like a normal day.''

INTERNET REMAINS STABLE, AS USERS TRACK ARRIVAL OF NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the world slid nervously Friday through the shadow of its
first global technology challenge, many Year 2000 experts took
special comfort in the relatively stable behavior of one of their
key tools in dealing with the problem: the not-always-reliable
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Service in the vast network of networks linking 60 million
computers and over 150 users appeared to sag at times in isolated
locations as Internet users turned to e-mail, Web sites, newsgroups
and electronic chat rooms to track the arrival of the Year 2000 in
more and more time zones.
</P>
<P>
   But experts who mounted the most extensive effort ever to
monitor the Internet's global reliability said that the overall
performance was impressive and highlighted the indispensable role
the Internet had played in reducing Year 2000 risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might look back on this as graduation day for the
Internet,'' said Michael L. Todd, a computer consultant in Irvine,
Calif., who heads the Los Angeles chapter of the Internet Society,
an international organization of Internet users and developers.
</P>
<P>
   The sense that the Internet was facing a trial of sorts during
the Year 2000 rollover had grown steadily in recent weeks. Some
hospitals, government agencies and manufacturers decided to close
down World Wide Web sites or cut off e-mail during the rollover
after hearing predictions that hackers would be treating Y2K as an
occasion to spread computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   And a poll last week by the Information Technology Association
of America _ carried out over the Internet _ reported that
technology managers viewed the Internet as more likely to be hit by
Y2K glitches than any other computer system or public utility.
</P>
<P>
   But organizations monitoring performance Friday said there were
no signs yet of major problems. One broad measure of all equipment
on the Internet, including local service providers and some
customers, showed a slow decline in the percentage of sites
reachable during the day on both the Internet as a whole and the
World Wide Web in particular, but that may have been the result of
some regular Internet users disconnecting as a precautionary
measure, according to John D. Quarterman, chief executive of Matrix
Information and Directory Services, which publishes Internet
performance data.
</P>
<P>
   Most users stayed wired, though, and the unsubstantiated Y2K
rumors and anecdotes for which the Internet is infamous began
flowing within hours of the arrival of Jan. 1 in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One breathless e-mail signed ``familyman'' claimed that an IBM
emergency parts center (later said to be in Pennsylvania) was being
swamped by orders from New Zealand and Australia. IBM was
scrambling to charter aircraft to meet the demand, it claimed. An
hour later an IBM spokesman in Japan issued a sharp denial.
</P>
<P>
   But as they have regularly been doing with far less fanfare than
Y2K activists, workers in the Year 2000 project trenches also
flocked to Internet Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the Internet has emerged as a major
vehicle for distribution of Year 2000 reports and data within
companies and government agencies, for regulators like the Food and
Drug Administration, which used it to provide information on the
Year 2000 readiness of medical equipment, and industry groups like
Global 2000, the consortium of international banks that gathered
and shared data on the readiness of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Computer companies like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft that
increasingly rely on the Internet to quickly and inexpensively
distribute new versions of products or patches to old ones became
especially reliant on that new distribution channel as the end of
1999 neared. Hewlett-Packard said its web site listing technical
information about the Year 2000 status of its various products had
received over three million inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   One boomlet of traffic Friday involved a new report of a
potential Year 2000 problem for computers, traffic lights and
military equipment that get the time and date from the government's
atomic clock in Fort Collins, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Glass, a computer consultant based in Laramie, Wyo., had
recently learned that the atomic clock uses just two digits to
record the date. After a search this week of documents posted on
the Internet by the government, Glass concluded that the government
had never warned the public that some equipment linked to the clock
might need reprogramming or replacement to avoid mistaking Saturday
for Jan. 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' work was relayed rapidly into computer circles primarily
through David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer expert
who has more than 20,000 people on his e-mail list. ``There is no
other way to instantaneously alert so many people of a potential
problem,'' said Farber.
</P>
<P>
   Or to reassure them. The Australian government reported seven
million visitors to its Y2K site in a matter of hours Friday, all
of whom learned there were no major problems to report.

SECURITY OF LOUISIANA PRISON QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three days after a prison guard and an inmate were
killed in an escape attempt at the Louisiana State Penitentiary,
law enforcement officials in the area raised questions Friday about
the security of the infamous prison farm, known as Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the incident on Tuesday night, there were lapses and
escape attempts at the 18,000-acre maximum-security prison, said
Charles Shropshire, the district attorney for the section of the
state that includes the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a number of events that have raised questions
about the practices there,'' said Shropshire, who is weighing
whether to seek the death penalty for five surviving inmates
involved in the hostage-taking incident. ``You know, twice a year,
I have to take a grand jury to the prison to report on conditions
there to the court. I'm going to have to review how we conduct that
tour to make sure I don't expose the jurors to a hostage
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, four men sawed their way out of death row and nearly
made it out of the prison before being caught. The hacksaws they
used were apparently smuggled inside books. In January, four
convicted murderers escaped after a jail employee helped smuggle a
can containing guns inside the walls. They were caught, and the
employee is about to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before the incident, the Baton Rouge Sunday Advocate
published a lengthy article outlining how lapses and collusion by
prison guards had led to several escapes and life-threatening
situations. Citing internal prison documents, the newspaper
reported, an inmate with a six-inch knife walked out of the main
prison building and into another part of the complex, where he
nearly stabbed a guard before being overpowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been going on for quite some time,'' said Sheriff W.M.
Daniel of East Feliciana parish, where Angola is located. ``It's
been kind of deteriorating over a period of time where the inmates
are losing respect for the security personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper article was quite critical of the prison warden,
Burl Cain, who was not available for comment Friday. But Richard L.
Stalder, the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety
and Corrections, said in an interview Friday that the reports of
negligence were overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidents of violence at Angola are as low as they have
been since records have been kept,'' he said. ``The fact that this
escape did not take place, that a captain sacrificed his life to
protect public safety, that the tactical response was swift and
decisive, shows me that you don't have a security system with a
fatal flaw.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The uprising on Tuesday night was by far the most serious of the
recent incidents at Angola. Six convicted murderers serving life
sentences took three guards hostage after a botched escape attempt,
armed with metal shards and a plastic craft mallet stolen from a
leatherworking area. One of the guards, Capt. David Knapps, was
bludgeoned and stabbed to death in a bathroom after he refused to
give up his keys, before other guards subdued the rebellion with
percussion grenades. One of the inmates was shot and killed in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Knapps was buried Friday in Tunica, down the road from the
prison gates.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a state judge signed arrest warrants for the
remaining five inmates, accusing each of first-degree murder and
aggravated kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire said the repeated incidents at the prison made it
unclear whether this attempt was provoked by another hostage
standoff earlier this month in the parish, or county, jail in St.
Martinville, La. After a six-day siege, an unusual deal with Cuba
allowed seven Cuban inmates involved in the uprising to be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say whether they were related, because we've had
so many escapes,'' Shropshire said. ``But I do know they have a
problem there that the Department of Corrections needs to look
into.''

COMMENTARY: PENNY SERENADE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a penny, you could buy The New York Times on
June 2, 1908, and read these stories on the front page:
</P>
<P>
   The Mauretania beat the record of the Lusitania for fastest
ocean crossing. Wilbur Wright got an offer of $100,000 for his
flying machine. Teddy Roosevelt was jousting with Panama over the
canal. A young, beautiful ``gray-garbed'' ghost was haunting the
governor's mansion in Georgia. And big news from Philadelphia:
``Mrs. Frank Gould has lost several expensive gowns which she
brought to this city to attend the Horse Show.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother, Margaret Meenehan, was born on that distant day,
before cellophane, airplane fatalities, rap and the Gap. I asked
her to sum up 100 years in 500 words:
</P>
<P>
   1900-1909: ``I learned to eat solid food.''
</P>
<P>
   1910-1920: ``Washington was a small Southern village with horses
and carriages. My father managed my uncle's bar, Meenehan's. There
was a side entrance that said `Ladies Only.' But women never really
drank until Prohibition. We got one of the earliest automobiles in
Washington, a black, seven-passenger Reo touring car. You had to
crank it. We were also one of the first to have a telephone. My
friend Betty didn't have a phone. So I would call her friends down
the street who did, and they would run up to her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``During World War I, we would go out every Sunday for a drive
around Arlington Cemetery and look at the thousands of crosses. The
Germans used mustard gas. It blistered our boys' lungs. Pat
McGuinn, a suitor of your Aunt Greta, was gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   1920-1930. ``In January 1922, the roof of the Knickerbocker
movie theater collapsed under the snow. There were snowbanks taller
than I was. Ninety-eight people died watching a George M. Cohan
comedy. A girl in my class, the brightest one, was killed. We
prayed for her the next morning at Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a flapper. But my mother was very strict. I
couldn't go to fraternity houses. And she wouldn't let me ask
college boys home to dinner. Boys would go out with anybody for a
home-cooked meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all liked Rudolph Valentino and Mary Pickford. Before a
movie started, they would put a sign up on the screen: `Ladies,
please remove your hats.' We never understood what happened with
Fatty Arbuckle and that girl.''
</P>
<P>
   1930-1940: ``One night when your father was working, I went to
the drugstore. There was a nice gentleman with a mustache there
named Max Factor. He was just starting his business and wanted to
demonstrate his makeup. He told me to put the lipstick on the upper
lip first, then press into the bottom lip to make an impression. I
didn't have enough money to buy anything. He was just killing an
evening, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was alone on an elevator once with J. Edgar Hoover. I never
believed he wore dresses. He looked very masculine.''
</P>
<P>
   1940-1950: ``Bananas were very scarce during the war. There was
a fella who worked in the A&AMP;P produce department. Whenever a
shipment came in, he would meet me in the liquor store across from
the Sheraton Hotel and give me bananas. ``It was exciting but
overcrowded during the war. We moved three kids into one bedroom
and took in roomers, some Pentagon meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids went to bed listening to `The Shadow' and `The Lone
Ranger' on the radio. Then, in 1948, we got a seven-inch used

watching when Truman won. Later we rearranged the dinner hour so
we'd be through in time for `Dragnet' and `Milton Berle.' Radio had
better morals.''

   1950-1960: ``I was at a party at the Capitol. I met Jack
Kennedy. He was very attractive, coppery hair. Neat, like he just
came out of a bandbox.

   ``In 1952 your father brought me home a dryer for your
diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   1960-1970: ``It was unruly. There were riots and they shut down
Glen Echo, the amusement park. I wore my first pantsuit and my
first pantyhose. I never owned jeans. In my immediate circle,
nothing changed with feminism. Even before that movement, I had
never felt cramped. I never went outside the house to work. Your
father thought women belonged in the kitchen. But I didn't mind
'cause I liked the kitchen. I just wish mine had been bigger.''

   1970-1980: ``I was glad when polyester came along. I would love
anything you didn't have to iron.''

care much for yuppies. They were pretentious.''

   1990-2000: ``I feel sorry for Clinton. He reminds me of myself,
wanting so much to be liked. I think Monica is very pretty. And
Hillary looks great.

HOSTAGES LAND IN INDIA AFTER DEAL CLOSED WITH HIJACKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (With PAKISTAN-HIJACK) 
(nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Haggard and exhausted, more than 150 people
held hostage on a hijacked jet for eight days arrived here Friday
night from Afghanistan after India secured their freedom by
agreeing to release three jailed militants.
</P>
<P>
   The five hijackers, whose names and nationalities remain
unknown, clambered down from the Indian Airlines plane Friday
afternoon at the airport in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar
and sped away in a van with the three militants. India's foreign
minister personally delivered the three men, whom India considers
terrorists opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir, to the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers commandeered the plane on Dec. 24 during a flight
from Katmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi, then took it on a harrowing
journey from India to Pakistan, on to the United Arab Emirates, and
finally to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the Muslim fundamentalist movement that rules most
of Afghanistan, gave the hijackers and the freed militants 10 hours
to get out of the country, but it was not clear where they would
go. The nearest country, Pakistan, said they were not wanted there.
And Taliban officials did not spell out what they would do if the
hijackers remained in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the hijacking episode may have long-term political
consequences in the region. It may help legitimize the Taliban, a
group perceived by most of the world as providing a haven for
terrorists but praised by India in this case for helping to end the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   And it almost certainly will further sour relations between
India and Pakistan, nuclear-armed neighbors and bitter rivals for
control of Kashmir. Indian officials and many newspaper accounts
here suggested that Pakistan was the hidden hand behind the
hijacking _ a charge Pakistan angrily rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But at the airport here in New Delhi on Friday night, no one was
thinking about geopolitics, only about the human drama unfolding
before them. The scenes were both wrenching and joyous as families
were reunited. Most of the hostages were Indian citizens, and in
the smoky, polluted haze of a winter's night, entire extended
families passed through a gantlet of television cameras, clinging
to each other and often physically holding up sagging relatives who
had been held captive.
</P>
<P>
   Some former hostages, their faces covered with a week's stubble
of beard, their eyes bloodshot and puffy, strolled out and waved
jauntily to the thousands who greeted them with cheers. Others
wept, fainted or fled to waiting cars. An old man caressed the face
of a boy who had been held on the plane and now sat dazed in a
wheelchair, his neck ringed with garlands of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A few former hostages paused for snatches of conversation about
the hijackers. ``When the Indian government refused their demands,
they behaved more terribly with us,'' said C.P. Chawla. ``They were
very cruel people. I'm happy to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour before the former hostages landed here, Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, in a televised address to the
nation, pledged to combat terrorism. ``India shall join hands
across nations to rid the world of this crime against humanity,''
he said. ``Let this be our first resolution for the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   But criticism of the government's handling of the hijacking _
already vociferous over the past week _ grew even more intense in
the hours after the hostages were released. Leaders of the
opposition Congress Party said the decision to yield to some of the
hijackers' demands would boost the spirits of militants battling
Indian rule of predominantly Muslim Kashmir and would encourage
more hostage-takings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceding to the demands of the hijackers to release three
hard-core terrorists will have serious implications,'' said Pranab
Mukherjee, a senior Congress Party official. ``It will demoralize
the security forces and encourage terrorists to repeat this kind of
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a marked note of defensiveness in various
officials' explanations of the government's decision to make a deal
with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on the state-run television station whether the
hostages-for-militants swap was appropriate, Brajesh Mishra, one of
the prime minister's top advisers, insisted that the government had
made the best of a bad situation. The hijackers had demanded $200
million and the release of 36 militants, they noted. India only
gave up only three.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official Friday said it condemned the
hijacking, but was pleased that the hostages had been released
without the further loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Jaswant Singh, India's foreign minister, took no questions
during a news conference at the airport Friday night as the
hostages poured out of the international arrivals terminal. In a
brief statement, Singh, who had handed the militants over to the
hijackers just a few hours earlier, said, ``I want to let it be
known that no criminal who dares raise a hand against India shall
in the ultimate ever go unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh also took the opportunity to thank the Taliban once again
``for the cooperation, which was constructive all along this time
period.'' Like most countries, India has no diplomatic relations
with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   But while India has repeatedly and publicly praised the Taliban
during this crisis, some analysts and Indian diplomats say that it
is too early to determine whether the Taliban were truly taking a
firm stand against the hijacking. The most important test, they
said, would be the Taliban's handling of the freed hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   If no other country accepts the hijackers, will the Taliban
allow them to melt away into Afghanistan, or will it prosecute
them?
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a much clearer assessment after the event,
whether you would count the Taliban as having been helpful or not
helpful,'' one Indian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts and diplomats also noted that the hijackers never
made a demand for their own safe passage, presumably because they
assumed the Taliban would provide that. And they speculated that
some elements in the Taliban may have given the hijackers weapons
after they landed in Kandahar _ a theory that gained some support
from hostages Friday night who said the hijackers seemed to have
more guns after reaching Afghanistan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban played a key role in persuading the hijackers to
drop their demands for $200 million and the exhumed body of a slain
militant, but they also apparently pressured India to compromise on
the release of some militants by threatening to force the plane to
leave Afghanistan if the crisis was not quickly resolved.
</P>
<P>
   One of those released militants, a Pakistani Muslim cleric named
Maulana Masood Azhar, was a leader of Harakat ul-Ansar, a group on
the American State Department's list of terrorist organizations
that operated training camps in Afghanistan. Azhar was arrested in
India in 1994 and had been held there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The other two militants released by India were Mushtaq Ahmed
Zargar, who once headed a militant group active in Kashmir and who
was imprisoned in India in 1992, and Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheik, who
has been jailed in India since 1994 on charges of organizing the
kidnapping of four Westerners in an earlier effort to win Azhar's
release, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Taliban's quest for international recognition. some
security analysts also wondered whether Singh's determined praise
of the Taliban and his decision to accompany the freed militants
personally Friday on the flight to Afghanistan were part of a deal
with the Taliban to help secure release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release of the three militants was the public part of the
cave-in,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a defense expert at the Center
for Policy Research in New Delhi. ``What other demands were made
and what was agreed upon, I do not know.''

COMMENTARY: 'ROUND MIDNIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's only a number,'' my mother used to say. It's only a date
on a calendar. You're only as old as you feel.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder what she would have made of a date in which all
four digits of the calendar year flip over at once, and time is
measured only in hundreds and thousands. Certainly I find it
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the middle of this century _ oops, make that last
century _ I grew up in an era when the year 1984 loomed as a
terrifying marker of future shock that could never actually arrive.
When the year 2001 seemed as remote and incomprehensible as the
ending of the Stanley Kubrick movie that alighted upon that date
for the end of Western civilization as we now know it. When the
19th century _ during which my ancestors still lived in Europe and
spoke languages we have now forgotten _ seemed as far off as the
Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have imagined the current exponential leap? If time
stretches into infinity both behind and ahead of us, then
everything is small. Thinking in thousands reminds us not only of
the ephemeral nature of our own existence but that the American
experiment is a mere pup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we keep hoping to make sense of the big picture. Someday,
perhaps, another civilization will look back at this one and
wonder: What were they thinking of? How many millennium books,
lists, TV specials and tour packages did these nutty people create
to decode the significance in the passing of a year? There isn't a
single high school student, college professor, journalist,
clergyman or politician who hasn't been drafted into the frenetic
effort to add up all the digits, all the names, all the wars into a
sum total that somehow might answer the question ``What in God's
name does it mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this frenzy has added to our understanding isn't at all
clear. Perhaps the only correct answer to that question is the one
Samuel Beckett came up with in the 20th century: Nothing to be
done. But as our fin-de-siecle year of philosophizing,
pontification, punditry, fear-mongering and self-congratulation
dragged on and on, I found that my own perspective on the world
around me had changed. Not because I'd reached some cosmic
conclusion about the last or next 1,000 years of history but
because the sheer overload forced me to take stock of what matters
to me and what does not.
</P>
<P>
   The more I heard the word ``millennium'' and the more I tried to
wrap my mind around it, the more I found my own thoughts hewing
toward the small in scale. Rather than ponder whether the printing
press or the microchip was the invention of the millennium, or
whether Adolf Hitler or FDR should be marketed as the man of the
century, I found myself measuring what was near to me, right now,
right at this very minute, right at home.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself treasuring my wife and my children and the
country in which we have all flourished in ways unimaginable to our
impoverished ancestors in the Old World. Instead of contemplating a
millennium's worth of music or literature, I listened over and over
to the splintery piano of Thelonious Monk, and savored Proust's
delicate description of childhood in Combray _ turning, without
really realizing it, to artists who slow time down instead of
speeding it up, who hold each shard of the passing moment up to the
light, out of the conviction that each is precious and beautiful.
Like many other Americans, I stopped thinking about spending New
Year's Eve at an epic blowout in the company of strangers, but
looked forward to keeping it simple, with those I love close at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago a song popped into my head that I hadn't
thought about in years. ``Someone in a Tree'' was written a
quarter-century ago by Stephen Sondheim for his show ``Pacific
Overtures'' to dramatize a fateful historical event: Commodore
Perry and his American warships forcing Japan to end its isolation
from the West in 1853.
</P>
<P>
   In Sondheim's song, the official meeting of the Japanese and the
American landing party, of which there's no surviving indigenous
record, is described speculatively by a peasant and a warrior who,
Rashomon-style, purport to have eavesdropped on it from hiding
places in a tree and beneath the floorboards of the house where the
treaty was signed.
</P>
<P>
   These ordinary people knew that something big was happening, but
they didn't and couldn't know what it meant. They could only
describe what it was like to witness an epic event at close range
from their own humble, oblique perspective on its periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fragment, not the day,'' they sang. ``It's the
pebble, not the stream. It's the ripple, not the sea, that is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing here at the dawn of Jan. 1, 2000, I think I know how
they felt.

FOR BOWDEN, A LIFETIME OF PLUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The question came out as a ``What if''
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   What if Florida State beat Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl
Tuesday night, won its second national championship, and completed
its first unbeaten, untied season?
</P>
<P>
   ``What, exactly, would you do, Bobby Bowden?''
</P>
<P>
   The questioner was on a fishing expedition. What more could
Bowden accomplish in his career at Florida State? Wouldn't
everything else be a disappointment, a letdown?
</P>
<P>
   For a man with 303 victories in 34 seasons, for a man who is 70
and has accomplished every goal a coach can set for himself, it
sounded like a legitimate question. Why not ride off into the next
millennium on the shoulders of your team and on the highest
possible note?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win it, are you ready to ride off into the sunset?''
said Bowden. ``No, I'm not. When you retire, there is just one more
big event left. And I ain't ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says the answer is the simplest one he can give for a
simple reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love to coach,'' he said. ``I love to take a take a
group of young men in the late summer and turn them into a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has done that year in and year out since arriving at
Florida State in 1976. Since 1987, no Florida State team has
finished lower than fourth in the national polls, a mind-boggling
stretch of consistency. Even if the Seminoles should lose to
Virginia Tech Tuesday, they should drop no lower than third in this
season's final balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says he wants to continue coaching because that's not
only what he does, but who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was supposed to be a coach,'' he said. ``I was born
to be a coach. I lived behind goal posts at Woodlawn High School
(in Birmingham, Ala.). They kicked extra points in my backyard. I
had a garage there and a 12-foot-high fence. I'd get up there and
watch practice. I lived up there until I was 5. Then we moved three
blocks and there was a college campus with a football field. I
watched practice. I did that up until I was 17. So, I've always
been around college football. That's what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His son Tommy is the coach at Clemson. His son Terry used to be
the coach at Auburn. His son Jeff is an assistant at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   If you looked up the definition of coach in the dictionary, you
might find a picture of Bobby and his clan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet times have changed. Athletes are different, society is
different, and Bowden has taken some hits, none harder than this
season when a series of off-the-field incidents, highlighted by the
transgressions of wide receiver Peter Warrick, tarnished not only
the image of Florida State, but, to some extent, that of Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I didn't think it affected us,'' said Bowden at
Friday's Sugar Bowl media day. ``I said, `They're kids. They can
shrug it off.' But thinking back at it, I think it did affect us to
some extent. Now, I think we're over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is Bowden. He has reached the point where he
is more a CEO than a coach. He delegates authority to his
assistants, most specifically to offensive coordinator Mark Richt
and defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews. Yet, Bowden is very much
aware of what is happening around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Bowden is successful because he is a winner,'' said
Andrews. ``He hasn't backed off from working. He's a great
motivator who knows when to push and when to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has that been more the case than this season as the
Seminoles have dealt not only with maintaining a No. 1 ranking but
an unbeaten season, as well as a spate of off-the-field problems.
``There are times you have to compromise,'' said Andrews, who has
been on Bowden's staff for 16 seasons. ``There are times when the
players have to think they have gotten away with something, even if
they really haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says with 100 players to oversee he can't control or know
everything. ``There are a lot of things the players know that I
know nothing about,'' he said. ``They think it's Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden hopes it's Christmas again Tuesday. He knows the world
won't come to an end if Tech wins. After all, this will be the
third time in four years the Seminoles will be playing for the
national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go home and cut my throat or slit my wrists,'' he
said. ``We'll just try and get it again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for real,'' said Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer, who
will be coaching in his first national title game. ``They have done
it over and over and that goes back to Bobby and his staff. Bobby
is for real. To do what they have done year after year is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says he is comfortable with the success he has achieved,
but concedes he is not entirely comfortable being cast in the role
of favorite. ``I've always been the underdog,'' he said with a
laugh. ``If I had been one of a litter of puppies, they would have
thrown me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, of course, is years past that role and he knows it.
During the 1990s, the Seminoles were an incredible 108-13-1. But
Bowden still feels like an underdog, which is what keeps him going
and keeps him fresh and enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   And like he says, after you retire, there is only one big event
remaining in a man's life and he's not ready for that.
</P>
<P>
   Not even close.

INTERNET SURVIVES INITIAL ARRIVAL OF MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Power on, Internet fine, dogs healthy, and beer still cold.''
</P>
<P>
   After days of angst and uncertainty, that was about all there
was to the millennium madness on the Internet early Friday, at
least according to Perry Morrison, a management consultant in
Darwin, Australia. Exactly five minutes after the New Year arrived
down under in the Northern Territory (just after 8 a.m. EST),
Morrison posted that reassuring missive on Zone 2000, a grassroots
Web site set up to monitor Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that sentiment was echoed on Web sites, in chat rooms,
on bulletin boards, and in e-mail beamed across time zones as
Internet users went on line to gather news and get a glimpse of the
worldwide reverie. ``Everything is perfect,'' reported a Zone 2000
scribe in Beijing. ``Power is on. TV is on. Mobile is on.
Celebration is on.'' On the CNN message board, Vikki Ruth from
Canada noted, ``The only bug that has hit thus far is the flu
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as reports from official government and amateur sources
alike allayed fears of pending disaster, Internet users flocked on
line in droves throughout the day, causing sluggish response times
and repeated error messages on the most popular Y2K watch sites. At
various times during the afternoon, the Net was almost as slow as
the day the Starr Report was released on line.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly impossible, for instance, to access the live
images at Earthcam.com, a site that was billing its event as ``The
Webcast of the Century.'' The site had placed about 100 Web cams
all over the globe, promising a bird's eye view of the millennium
as it moved west from New Zealand to New York. But several hours
after the calendar turned over in New Zealand, the Web cam in
Gisborne showed the clock tower stuck at 10:40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting unbelievable traffic,'' Bruce Schartz,
Earthcam's vice president of marketing, said. The New Jersey-based
company had to borrow servers from other Web companies to boost its
network capability; by early evening, the Web cams were still
inaccessible, but the site was showing a live video stream from
Times Square, featuring miniature grainy images of the revelers in
the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Even if traffic was slow, for the most part, the Internet got a
green light Friday, both literally and figuratively. An
entrepreneur in Dortmund, Germany set up a site that automatically
checks the top 500 Web sites in the United States, New Zealand, and
Germany; some 99 percent of those sites were marked with a flashing
green light Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take more than 20 minutes to check all these sites if
you did it one at a time, but with a simple program you can do it
with light speed,'' said Marc Wasche, who launched the
www.inferno2000.com because he thought it was ``a cool idea.''
Along with other Net enthusiasts, he spent the day glued to his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wasche and other amateurs joined professionals and government
officials who planned to keep constant vigil on line. Folks at
Keynote Systems, a San Mateo, Calif., Internet performance
measuring company, tracked Web sites in each time zone. ``Overall,
the Internet appears to have cleared the hurdle in the first time
zones,'' Keynote spokesperson Mary Lindsay said Friday evening.
``The only anomoly is in countries with a large online community,
where performance degrades considerably after midnight. There is a
rush of traffic as people log on to make sure the Internet is still
operating.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people was Matt Sullivan, a computer-aided
draftsman in Glen Massey, New Zealand, who planned to stay up
around the clock as the millennium progressed around the globe. He
surfed the Net constantly before and after midnight (which was at 5
a.m. our time). Like the dog-loving Internet enthusiast in
Australia, he fired off an urgent missive about the four-legged in
his rural village. ``No cows strayed, the electric fence units kept
working, and the rain water still flowed,'' he wrote, confirming
that all was well in Glen Massey on the first day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the anxiety subsided on line, some Internet users
continued to point out that the real millennium doesn't begin until
Jan. 1, 2001, since there was no year zero. One user on the CNN
message board dismissed Friday's celebration as ``the
phoney-baloney balonium.'' Y2K reassurance notwithstanding, the
issue is sure to burn on line for yet another year.

QUIETLY CELEBRATING THE FIRST LOOK AT 2000

   LUBEC, Maine _ The pastel sky over the Bay of Fundy darkened
from peach glow to dim lavender. Taps sounded; the flag descended;
and there came the soft thunder of a muffled stampede: hearty
applause from more than 300 pairs of gloved and mittened hands.
</P>
<P>
   That is how, at 3:57 p.m. Friday, this easternmost town in the
continental United States bade farewell to the last day of the
1900s, with a bone-chilling ceremony at the candy-cane-striped
lighthouse at West Quoddy Head, the easternmost point of this
easternmost town. A children's chorus did its tentative best,
politicians spoke, and everybody went home for hot chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Maine's version of Times Square, right here in Lubec,
Maine,'' said Rep. John Baldacci.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Baldacci nor anybody else seemed to think the Maine
version came off the worse in that comparison.
</P>
<P>
   A town of about 1,800 miles from the nearest traffic light,
Lubec is heartily exploiting the prime viewing of the first dawn of
the 2000s that its easternmost position affords. National media
coverage has brought guests from as far as Virginia for Saturday's
dawn ceremony, and the caps and T-shirts reading ``First Light
2000'' and such have been selling fast.
</P>
<P>
   But the ceremonies, and the trinkets, and the town itself are
unmistakably homespun, from the festive baked bean supper to the
festive polar bear dip to the festive bonfire at the Frog Pond, and
that was the core of their appeal to many visitors, more than any
geographic distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small-town celebration, it's unique,'' said Brett
Golladay, 20, a student at the College of William and Mary,
explaining why she and her friend, Dan Degnan, had driven 15 hours
to get here. ``I wanted to do something unique for the new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the homespun appeal is that while they are happy to have
visitors and attention, townspeople are too sensible to make much
out of this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to be a party pooper but it's just another day,'' said
Hazel Avery, a volunteer with the town's historical society. She
was helping the society at the millennial craft fair at the school
gym, where handknit booties could be bought for $4. She planned to
skip Saturday's dawn ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay where it's nice and warm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the town post office, clerks offered a special ``Last Light
of the Old Millennium'' cancellation, but Edward Fletcher, a
fisherman stopping in on an errand, was not getting one. Nor was he
excited by the whole First Light thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up every morning and see the sun come up, it's no big
deal,'' he said. ``When I get up tomorrow I'm still going to have
bills, and I'm still going to be married to the same woman, so
what's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   But to more excitable types, the Lubec area offered multiple
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Sandy Kaynor, of Peru, Maine, planned to celebrate
midnight in New Brunswick, in the Atlantic time zone, then cross
the bridge to Calais, Maine, to celebrate in the Eastern time zone,
then, Peter Kaynor said, ``catch a quick nap and drive down here
for dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a bit of dispute over exactly where the first
rays of 2000 will hit in the continental United States. Some hardy
souls planned to climb Cadillac Mountain near Bar Harbor, Maine,
saying they believed it would get the first rays because of its
height. Nantucket Island also put forth a claim of first-light
primacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official Lubec millennium Web site, the Naval
Observatory said that sunrise in the three spots would be nearly
simultaneous, at about 7:04 a.m., but that Lubec would in fact be
first. Just to be sure, people in each spot plan to stay in contact
by cellular phone and announce when they first see the sunrise. The
competition, the Web site emphasized, is friendly in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   There is a serious side to Lubec's hoopla, however. The town may
call itself a ``sleepy fishing village,'' but the subtext is that
it depends on a troubled industry, and it is a poor town, with a
per capita income of under $9,000, in one of the poorest counties
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say they hope the attention paid Lubec this New
Year's, while it might not persuade many to visit in midwinter,
might pay off next summer in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really put us on the map because of this,'' said Junia
Lehman, owner of West Quoddy Gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Some brave travelers, though, were not about to wait for summer
and miss this special dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to do something a little different, and it's a
really comfortable, down-home place,'' said Jonathan Herzog, a
Manhattan lawyer, who made the the 10-hour trek with his friend,
Allen Roth, a real-estate developer, and his dog, Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square ``has too many people,'' Herzog said, adding,
``That's only for out-of-towners.''

MILLENNIUM ARRIVES _ AS A TV EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The global village shrank to the size of a television screen
Friday, as nonstop coverage ushered in a millennium that, as of
early evening, had mercifully failed to produce any newsworthy
disasters and instead linked the planet in a celebration of
humanity's common culture.
</P>
<P>
   From the dance that greeted the sunrise in the Kiribati Islands
to the fireworks display that lit up Shanghai's skyline to a
haunting choral rendition of ``Danny Boy'' in Derry, Northern
Ireland, the message of Friday's millennium vigil was inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   As comedian Barry Humphries, who plays ``Dame Edna'' in the hit
Broadway play, told ABC's Peter Jennings, ``You feel perhaps, peace
among men is a possiblity.''
</P>
<P>
   Three very different networks _ broadcast giant ABC, public
broadcasting's PBS, and cable news outlet CNN _ offered
wall-to-wall coverage of the opening hours of the millennium.
Despite the widespread fear of possible disasters ranging from the
technological (the Y2K bug) to the human (terrorism), the big news
stories Friday had nothing to do with the turn of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The major news was the surprise resignation of President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia and an end to the hostage crisis aboard the
hijacked Indian Airlines plane. In an acknowledgment of the
incredible US economic boom at the turn of the millennium, the
networks also cut live to the 1 p.m. close of the New York Stock
Exchange on a day when the Dow again broke a record.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, ABC's Times Square headquarters looked to be at
the epicenter of breaking news when smoke began billowing from the
building, firetrucks gathered, and Jennings noted that ``something
is going on above us . . . but we don't believe it is serious.''
The scare turned out to be a routine matter.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that the Y2K computer bug would create immediate and
significant problems was all but put to rest early Friday. Shortly
after 11 a.m., ABC's Sam Donaldson declared that there were no
reported problems in crucial locales like Australia, Japan, and
Russia. Following a similarly reassuring CNN report _ indicating no
glitches at Russian nuclear plants _ anchor Jim Clancy wondered
aloud if a lot of viewers were sitting in their living rooms
saying, ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a palpable sense of relief from potential trouble
spots when the millennium dawned with fireworks and celebration in
Moscow's Red Square and with singing and the release of doves in
the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   For one passing moment, however, there was anxiety when a US
military briefer announced the detection of ``three theater missile
events'' at a 4:30 p.m. press conference. Jennings quickly called
in ABC national security correspondent John McWethy, who explained
that the missile launches were related to the ``situation in
Chechnya'' and represented nothing dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three networks devoting extraordinary resources to
Friday's event covered the story from different perspectives. PBS's
approach was more anthropological and documentary in tone, letting
the camera linger on events such as the ``Millennium Birth'' dance
performed in Uhuru, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its newsier approach, CNN devoted more attention
to the other events of the day, particularly the hostage release
and the changing of the guard in Moscow. Having broken the news of
Yeltsin's resignation in the early morning hours, the network then
aired segments of an exclusive interview with his successor,
Vladimir Putin, who reaffirmed his commitment to democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's coverage, glued together by Jennings, was the most
analytical and chatty, featuring interviews with everyone from
scientist Stephen Jay Gould to singer Billy Joel and showcasing the
network's cast of star correspondents like Cokie Roberts and
Barbara Walters. In an unusual and touching moment, the Rome-based
Roberts interviewed her mother, Lindy Boggs, the US ambassador to
the Vatican. ``Thank you, mom, happy New Year,'' she said. ``Happy
New Year, beautiful,'' Boggs responded.
</P>
<P>
   The real story, however, was captured by the sounds and pictures
of people from all over the map celebrating the same event in
eminently recognizable fashion. There was rap music and break
dancing from Castle Square in Poland, flashing lights and gyrating
dancers partying along the Nile River, and a beautifully
choreographed pageant in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these images, good will seemed almost infectious. Quizzed
by Jennings for a new millennial prediction, Gould said he thought
some of mankind's most intractable problems could be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the basic goodness within us if we can only muster the
will,'' he noted. ``I remain a tragic optimist.''

NATION AWAITS LONG-PREPARED-FOR EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With equal parts anxiety and excitement, the nation awaited the
arrival of the epochal year 2000 amid festivals, fireworks, and
vast efforts to stave off feared computer-glitch disasters and
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in charge of cornerstones of modern society _ power,
water, public safety, and telecommunications _ were confident years
of work to fix the potentially system-crippling Y2K computer bug
would pay off with a smooth changeover to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2,200-member Massachusetts State Police, ``Nobody's
being granted a day off tonight,'' said Sgt. Tim White. Troopers
with blue lights spinning kept watch for terrorists at the Boston
Harbor tunnels and Tobin Bridge as 40 patrol teams fanned out
across the state targeting the chronic New Year's spate of drunken
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But repeated reports of New Year's Day arriving uneventfully in
industrialized nations like Australia, New Zealand, and Japan and
later Europe bolstered officials' confidence that the United States
would also see few problems related to the date changeover. Nuclear
weapons arsenals and power plants in China and Russia remained
secure, and by 6 p.m. Eastern Time time 36 countries from Vietnam
to Egypt reported no critical incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initial reports are positive,'' said John Koskinen, the top
White House official overseeing year 2000 preparations. ``The
chances of some unknown or unmanageable catastrophe happening are
minimized significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a common sentiment of officials who have spent years
preparing, Skip Patterson, the top Bell Atlantic official in charge
of its $430 million preparations, said: ``Let's get it over with,
and let's get on with the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of 2000 had been anticipated with widespread concern
by public officials, both because of worries that older computer
systems would misread the date 01-01-00 as 1900 and shut down or go
haywire, and because of fears anti-American or anti-technology
terrorists might have wanted to mark the watershed date with a
crippling attack.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Oregon late Thursday night, an electric transmission
line that feeds power from the Pacific Northwest to California was
toppled by saboteurs. However, computers automatically rerouted
power around the downed line in less than a second, and FBI
Portland chief David Szady said there was ``no evidence or
intelligence that this was Y2K- or millennial-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom had held that impoverished and developing
countries like India, Indonesia, and Russia were most likely to be
plagued by Y2K problems. So reports last evening of an almost
entirely uneventful New Year's in those countries boosted US
officials' confidence 2000 would arrive smoothly here.
</P>
<P>
   At the stroke of 7 p.m. time _ midnight at the Greenwich
observatory near London _ fireworks dazzled crowds at a
``children's celebration'' on Boston Common, the first of several
displays planned across the region. From huge TV screens erected on
the park, Bostonians could also watch the fireworks displays at
Paris's Eiffel Tower, Berlin, and Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   Seven o'clock was also a key hour for utilities, because many of
their computer systems work on Greenwich time. Initial reports
indicated the power grid that serves 12 million New Englanders
passed through what officials call ``the millennial boundary''
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   While many people already seemed turned off by the months of
hype about 2000 and planned to stay home, plenty of parties were
still scheduled throughout the region on a clear, starry night with
temperatures hovering at the freezing mark.
</P>
<P>
   Eastport, Maine, officials had planned a boat race ``back in
time'' from Campobello Island in New Brunswick, with captains
dressed as Santa Claus and Father Time at the helm. The idea was
that participants could celebrate New Year's twice: once at
midnight Atlantic time in Canada, and a second time at midnight
Eastern Standard Time in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequots expected up to 70,000
people to flock to their Foxwoods casino, the continent's largest,
to sip champagne, gamble at the 5,500 slot machines and gaming
tables, and take in performances by pop crooner Barry Manilow and
other stars.
</P>
<P>
   Woonsocket, R.I., staged a ``Jour de L'An'' French-Canadian New
Year's celebration with dancing, singing, and family gatherings.
And Bethel, Maine, residents hoped for snowfall to help their plans
to build 2,000 snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   But fed up with hype about the ``new millennium'' _ which
purists insist will not arrive until 2001, the first year of the
21st century _ many New Englanders were boycotting public
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're staying home where it's nice and safe,'' said Heather
Libby of South Portland, Maine. ``I've decided I don't want to be
around crowds. I'm not worried about Y2K, but I am worried about
terrorists and crazy people.''
</P>
<P>
   As of late last evening, however, officials in charge of key
sectors felt well prepared and optimistic. A rundown of Y2K
preparedness efforts in crucial fields:
</P>
<P>
   - Utilities: Because of the cascading chaos they could inflict,
Y2K-triggered power failures had been considered the single biggest
millennium bug risk, but New England electric grid officials were
confident utilities would come through without trouble, grid
spokesman Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   - Finance: As Wall Street closed early for the holiday and
global markets from Singapore to Moscow passed smoothly into the
new millennium, local financial services companies reported few, if
any, problems by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bangladesh supposedly cancelled its foreign exchange trading
for Monday, but I think we'll survive that,'' quipped one executive
at a Boston financial firm.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, State Street Corp., the giant money manager
and back-office financial transactions processor, said things had
gone off without a hitch. ``There have not been any glitches, and
at this point, we have experienced a smooth transition in all
markets globally,'' said Greg Ahern, the company's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments' Anne Crowley said calls from investors to
company representatives ``are even a little less than is typical
for this time of the year. Everything has worked fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And banks, which had feared a possible run on cash machines and
branches, found their efforts to boost cash supplies largely
unnecessary. ``We're seeing a very surprising and pleasing customer
reaction to Y2K,'' said Jim Schepker of FleetBoston Financial, New
England's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   While even President Clinton had recommended people take out
some extra cash to cover household needs, Schepker said average ATM
withdrawals Friday were up by only ``several percentage points''
compared with a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   Stock brokerages and other securities firms that collectively
spent $5 billion to fix their computers for the new century also
reported a smooth transition. ``So far, the processing of these
first trades to cross over into 2000 has been proceeding
normally,'' said Donald Kittell of the Securities Industry
Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   (Proving the point, at the stroke of midnight in Auckland, New
Zealand, a visiting Australian woman named Miriam Betcher ignored
the fireworks and took her place at a portable ATM in the Maritime
Village. As bells pealed, cannons fired, and boat horns roared
across the waterfront, Betcher inserted her card and withdrew a
fistful of bills she waved to a Globe correspondent.)
</P>
<P>
   - The Internet: Friday night is never an especially busy time on
the Net _ and the waning hours of 1999 were no different. ``So far,
we're seeing nothing but business as usual,'' said Craig Bailey,
director of customer care for GTE Internetworking of Burlington,
Mass., which serves a half-million residential users and 5,000
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, monitoring Y2K-related software viruses
or attacks on computer systems, said by late Friday things were
``fairly normal and quiet,'' center manager Kathy Fithen said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the worldwide Y2K picture looked overwhelmingly
positive as of last evening, the White House's Koskinen warned that
problems may still develop and become noticeable as the work week
begins Monday. ``We should all remember we have many miles to go
before we sleep,'' he said. ``Not all problems will be apparent
immediately.''

PUTIN TAKES REINS AS YELTSIN BOWS TO `NEW POLITICIANS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia entered the new century with a new leader, as
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took over as acting president after
Boris N. Yeltsin resigned suddenly with a plea for Russians to
forgive him for the shortcomings of his eight years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was time for ``new politicians'' to run Russia,
Yeltsin said he was stepping down immediately to clear the way for
his handpicked successor. Putin, a tough-talking former KGB spy who
has rapidly become the country's most popular leader in four months
as premier, quickly assumed control of the government and called
for a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin showed Putin, 47, into his Kremlin office, where the
acting president took possesion of the suitcase that contains the
controls to launch Russia's nuclear arsenal. While Russia's
Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II looked on, Yeltsin, 68, also handed
Putin his presidential pen and medals symbolizing his presidential
status.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic resignation made Yeltsin, the first democratically
elected leader in Russian history, also the only Kremlin chief to
voluntarily part with power in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's move was most likely motivated as much by his
political and personal concerns as by his desire to enshrine his
place in history. His resignation automatically moved up elections
that had been planned for next summer to March 26, which is perfect
timing for Putin, who has declared himself a candidate. The
premier's approval rating has soared to 70 percent, largely as a
result of his leadership of Russia's military campaign against
separatists in Chechnya. Putin's supporters scored a surprise
triumph in parliamentary elections just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's first decrees offered Yeltsin immunity from
prosecution and a lifetime pension. It also provided a government
country home and bodyguards and medical care for the former
president and his family. Yeltsin and his entourage, known here as
``The Family,'' have been buffeted by widespread allegations of
corruption in recent months, and have reportedly been looking for
assurances for their safety after he steps down. In a further sign
of loyalty to the outgoing president's team, Putin reappointed
Yeltsin's chief of administration, Alexander Voloshin, seen here as
a key member of the ``Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To cling to power for another six months when the country has
a strong person worthy of becoming president _ why should I stand
in his way?,'' said Yeltsin, looking pale and speaking slowly and
with apparent difficulty, in an address from his Kremlin office. He
sat in front of a glittering New Year's tree, the Russian tricolor,
and the golden state symbol, a doubleheaded Russian eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, Acting President Putin, speaking to the
nation from the same Kremlin office in a televised address just
before midnight, said Russia would continue to observe basic
freedoms gained under Yeltsin. Sounding his favorite theme _ law
and order _ Putin also vowed to guide the country to elections in
an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for one minute will there be a power vacuum,'' Putin said.
``The state has stood, and will stand, on guard for the safety of
each citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, whose popularity early in his presidency has faded to
nil during the hardships and inequities of his rule, said he deeply
regretted not meeting people's expectations after leading Russia
away from Soviet-style Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came
true. And also I would like to beg forgiveness for not having
justified your hopes,'' Yeltsin said. ``I beg your forgiveness for
having failed to jump in one leap from the gray, stagnant,
totalitarian past to the light, rich, and civilized future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton paid tribute to Yeltsin for
dismantling the communist system and putting a democratic structure
in place.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's sudden rise to power caused quiet concern both in
the West and Russia, and not only because of Putin's KGB past and
his flinty rebuttal of Western criticism of Russia's heavy-handed
offensive against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. The
new acting president likes to talk about reviving Russia as a great
power, and he warns of ``outside enemies'' and the need for a
strong state. He also rejects transformation to a liberal,
European-style democracy any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western and Russian critics see in all that the seeds for a
new authoritarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel shock, fear and sorrow,'' said Yevgeniya Albats, a
prominent Russian journalist. ``We have once again shown that we
are an unpredictable country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's quiet confidence and no-nonsense matter appeals to
many Russians, who see him as a leader who can bring order after
the economic decline, political chaos, and social inequities that
marked the later Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian stock market jumped to a 15-month high on the news,
with dealers saying hopes of strong new leadership would boost the
economy, which is already enjoying a revival thanks to high world
prices for oil and precious metals, Russia's main exports. Putin
has never laid out his plans for the economy and usually speaks of
the need for the state to take a stronger regulatory role over
Russia's markets.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to reassure doubters, Putin promised no changes in
government policies, including foreign relations. But he said
efforts to modernize and strengthen Russia's military would
continue and the state would ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom of
the press, the freedom of property rights _ these fundamentals of
civilized society _ will be reliably protected by the state,''
Putin said in his a New Year's address.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Yeltsin's resignation, while sudden, was no surprise
to many Russians, who have known about his many ailments for years
and who could see from his increasingly rare appearances that his
health was fading.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians had doubted the leader who half-jokingly called
himself Czar Boris would ever step down. Unpredictable to the end,
Yeltsin confounded those expectations by stepping down early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times I have heard it said, Yeltsin will try to hold onto
power by any means, he won't hand it over to anyone,'' Yeltsin
said. ``That is all lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The move left Putin's main rivals for the presidency _ Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, and former
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _ with the difficult task of
catching up to Putin in only three months.
</P>
<P>
   The task is made more difficult by Putin's positions as prime
minister, a job he will keep, and acting president. State
television was instrumental in the strong showing by three parties
he backed in last month's elections to the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, and now the Kremlin-controlled media is
expected go to work for Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, meanwhile, stood for a while with aides at a Kremlin
doorway, then gingerly stepped out into the snow and rode off in
his limousine to his suburban residence, out of politics forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In saying farewell, I wish to say to each of you the
following,'' Yeltsin said in his last address as president. ``Be
happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness and peace.
Happy new year, happy new century, my dear people.''

MILLENNIUM ARRIVES _ AS A TV EVENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The global village shrank to the size of a television screen
Friday, as nonstop coverage ushered in a millennium that, as of
early evening, had mercifully failed to produce any newsworthy
disasters and instead linked the planet in a celebration of
humanity's common culture.
</P>
<P>
   From the dance that greeted the sunrise in the Kiribati Islands
to the fireworks display that lit up Shanghai's skyline to a
haunting choral rendition of ``Danny Boy'' in Derry, Northern
Ireland, the message of Friday's millennium vigil was inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   As comedian Barry Humphries, who plays ``Dame Edna'' in the hit
Broadway play, told ABC's Peter Jennings, ``You feel perhaps, peace
among men is a possiblity.''
</P>
<P>
   Three very different networks _ broadcast giant ABC, public
broadcasting's PBS, and cable news outlet CNN _ offered
wall-to-wall coverage of the opening hours of the millennium.
Despite the widespread fear of possible disasters ranging from the
technological (the Y2K bug) to the human (terrorism), the big news
stories Friday had nothing to do with the turn of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The major news was the surprise resignation of President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia and an end to the hostage crisis aboard the
hijacked Indian Airlines plane. In an acknowledgment of the
incredible US economic boom at the turn of the millennium, the
networks also cut live to the 1 p.m. close of the New York Stock
Exchange on a day when the Dow again broke a record.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, ABC's Times Square headquarters looked to be at
the epicenter of breaking news when smoke began billowing from the
building, firetrucks gathered, and Jennings noted that ``something
is going on above us . . . but we don't believe it is serious.''
The scare turned out to be a routine matter.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that the Y2K computer bug would create immediate and
significant problems was all but put to rest early Friday. Shortly
after 11 a.m., ABC's Sam Donaldson declared that there were no
reported problems in crucial locales like Australia, Japan, and
Russia. Following a similarly reassuring CNN report _ indicating no
glitches at Russian nuclear plants _ anchor Jim Clancy wondered
aloud if a lot of viewers were sitting in their living rooms
saying, ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a palpable sense of relief from potential trouble
spots when the millennium dawned with fireworks and celebration in
Moscow's Red Square and with singing and the release of doves in
the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   For one passing moment, however, there was anxiety when a US
military briefer announced the detection of ``three theater missile
events'' at a 4:30 p.m. press conference. Jennings quickly called
in ABC national security correspondent John McWethy, who explained
that the missile launches were related to the ``situation in
Chechnya'' and represented nothing dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three networks devoting extraordinary resources to
Friday's event covered the story from different perspectives. PBS's
approach was more anthropological and documentary in tone, letting
the camera linger on events such as the ``Millennium Birth'' dance
performed in Uhuru, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its newsier approach, CNN devoted more attention
to the other events of the day, particularly the hostage release
and the changing of the guard in Moscow. Having broken the news of
Yeltsin's resignation in the early morning hours, the network then
aired segments of an exclusive interview with his successor,
Vladimir Putin, who reaffirmed his commitment to democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's coverage, glued together by Jennings, was the most
analytical and chatty, featuring interviews with everyone from
scientist Stephen Jay Gould to singer Billy Joel and showcasing the
network's cast of star correspondents like Cokie Roberts and
Barbara Walters. In an unusual and touching moment, the Rome-based
Roberts interviewed her mother, Lindy Boggs, the US ambassador to
the Vatican. ``Thank you, mom, happy New Year,'' she said. ``Happy
New Year, beautiful,'' Boggs responded.
</P>
<P>
   The real story, however, was captured by the sounds and pictures
of people from all over the map celebrating the same event in
eminently recognizable fashion. There was rap music and break
dancing from Castle Square in Poland, flashing lights and gyrating
dancers partying along the Nile River, and a beautifully
choreographed pageant in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these images, good will seemed almost infectious. Quizzed
by Jennings for a new millennial prediction, Gould said he thought
some of mankind's most intractable problems could be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the basic goodness within us if we can only muster the
will,'' he noted. ``I remain a tragic optimist.''

COMMENTARY: BOSTON E-PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer I was changing planes at Singapore's swank new
airport, which has lounges spread all over, at which transit
passengers can watch satellite TV. As I walked through the airport,
I bought a snack and sat down in one of these lounges.
</P>
<P>
   There I found two elderly Indian women, in traditional sari
robes, watching American professional wrestling. These two petite
Indian ladies were sitting transfixed, gazing at huge wrestlers in
Tarzan suits body-slamming one another. All I could think was:
``What in the world are they making of this?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've thought back on that scene often, because it captured an
essential truth about the world we are about to enter _ a world
increasingly without walls in which countries, cultures and
economies are going to meet, and wrestle with, each other so much
more directly _ for better and for worse. For months Cisco Systems,
makers of the Internet, have been running an ad showing young
people from all corners of the earth asking: ``Are you ready?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid we're not. There's an old adage in the computer
business that the hardware always runs ahead of the software. That
is, the computer and chip makers are always building faster
machines that the software writers have to catch up with. It's true
of people, too.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter the new millennium the agents of change in our lives
_ the technologies and networks that are tearing down walls,
weaving us together and forcing us all to speed up, downsize,
download, integrate and streamline _ are running ahead of the human
capacity to adjust and absorb. Our computers and robots may be Y2K
ready, but our bodies and our politics are not.
</P>
<P>
   Well then, some people say, let's put the walls back up, put
some sand in the gears and slow down the world _ not so I can get
off, but so I can stay on! Not so easy. Every time you try to
rebuild a wall, some new technology comes along and erases it. We
have no choice but to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know that, though, listening to the presidential
candidates. We have candidates out in Iowa debating ethanol while
the Internet is transforming the world, and it doesn't even get a
mention. That's because, for the moment, the Internet is primarily
ripping apart, and radically restructuring, business and shopping.
But in the next decade its creative destruction will hit education
and government with full force.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the candidates are talking about this at all,''
remarked one Internet exec, ``but then I guess if any of them
really understood the magnitude of the changes that are coming in
the next eight years they'd never run for office.``
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, the head of America Online, put it to me best: ``I
think we need to reconvene the Founding Fathers.'' I agree, because
the next decade is going to be as revolutionary and creative a
period in American politics as was the period between the
Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitutional
Convention in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   The fuse will be e-commerce and a new Boston Tea Party, led by
governors and mayors throwing computers overboard. Because as they
discover that their tax base is being lost to untaxed Internet
commerce, we will have to move to a national sales tax. This will
require a restructuring of relations between cities, states and the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Issues such as freedom of speech and libel are going to have to
be rethought as the Internet makes everyone a potential publisher
in cyberspace _ but with no censor or editor in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy protection is going to have to be rethought in a world
where for $39 Web sites will search out anyone's assets and home
address for you. And our safety nets are going to have to be
rethought in a world in which access to the Internet is going to be
viewed as a human right, essential for basic survival _ especially
as governments move more services to the Web. (Are you going to
wait in line for hours at city hall to get a license renewed when
you can now buy your whole car with one click on the Web?)
</P>
<P>
   Getting through this transition is going to require the best of
America, and for America to be at its best and help others. The
best of America was that unique blend of wisdom and fresh, youthful
thinking of the Founding Fathers. To re-engineer our society and
country we're going to have to revive that youthful, radically
creative spirit. This may be the millennium, but it's no time for
us to get old.
</P>
<P>
   I was once asked what I wished Israel on its 50th birthday, and
I said I hoped it would always remain true to the last lines of Bob
Dylan's ballad ``Forever Young.'' I wish that even more for America
today:
</P>
<P>
   ``May your hands always be busy / May your feet always be swift
/ May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift
/ May your heart always be joyful / May your song always be sung /
May you stay forever young.''

ELLIOT RICHARDSON, VERSATILE MAN, IS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Elliot L. Richardson, the Boston Brahmin who as US
attorney general in 1973 refused to fire Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox, thus making himself a national symbol of
political integrity, died in Massachusetts General Hospital Friday
of a brain hemorrhage. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson's action as attorney general triggered the
``Saturday Night Massacre,'' which helped lead to Richard Nixon's
resignation the following year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that Mr. Richardson ``put the
nation's interests first even when the personal cost was very high.
He was an unparalleled public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci and
Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift called Mr. Richardson a ``true
hero'' who ``served the Commonwealth and his country with courage,
dignity, and uncompromising valor.''
</P>
<P>
   The patrician as pluperfect public servant, Mr. Richardson
amassed an extraordinary resume that earned him the nickname ``The
Man for All Positions.'' He liked to joke that his versatility
meant he ``never held a job for more than two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being elected Massachusetts lieutenant governor
and attorney general during the 1960s, he served as assistant US
secretary of health, education and welfare and US attorney for
Massachusetts in the Eisenhower administration; undersecretary of
state, secretary of health, education and welfare, secretary of
defense, and attorney general in the Nixon administration;
ambassador to the Court of St. James' and secretary of commerce in
the Ford administration; and ambassador at large in the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approach any job in essentially the same way,'' Mr.
Richardson once said. ``I don't consider that the subject matter
makes any particular difference. If I don't know it, I learn it. I
try to find out what it is necessary to do, and then do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the aristocratic background that helped produce such
self-assurance worked against him when he ran for the GOP
nomination for US senator from Massachusetts in 1984. A
self-described ``radical moderate'' who liked to joke about the
burden of bearing three last names, Elliot Lee Richardson found
little support in a party that had come to be dominated by
conservative and ethnic voters. His opponent, Raymond V. Shamie,
defeated him by nearly 25 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling reversal for a man who had been regarded as a
possible vice presidential or even presidential nominee in 1976.
What had earned Mr. Richardson such consideration was his steadfast
performance in the face of mounting White House pressure during the
five months he served as attorney general, culminating in his
resignation on Oct. 20, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of Mr. Richardson's indispensability to the
Nixon administration that he was presiding over the Justice
Department at that time. As undersecretary of state, he had played
a crucial role as intermediary in the battles between Secretary of
State William Rogers and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1970, Mr. Richardson had taken over at HEW, a department
in considerable disarray and one responsible for such controversial
issues of the day as welfare reform and school desegregation. Mr.
Richardson's surehandedness there inspired Nixon to make him
secretary of defense 2 1/2 years later. He'd been at the Pentagon
barely four months when growing suspicions about White House
involvement in the Watergate scandal and the resignation of
Attorney General Richard Kleindienst forced Nixon to turn to Mr.
Richardson, with his double-barreled image as a ``Mr. Clean and Mr.
Fix-It,'' to head the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson's first decision was to appoint a special
prosecutor. He chose Harvard Law School Professor Archibald Cox and
guaranteed the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cox would have
complete independence.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Mr. Richardson began to meet with opposition
from the Oval Office. In the 10 weeks preceding his resignation,
Nixon met with him only once, and Mr. Richardson quipped that he
might soon be writing a book called ``Situation Wanted.'' He
likened his battles with the White House to his experience of
landing on Utah Beach on D-Day. ``All I could do was put down one
foot after the other, hoping each time that (no mine) would go
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters was the ongoing investigation of
Vice President Spiro Agnew on charges of tax fraud and bribery. Mr.
Richardson negotiated a settlement whereby Agnew would plead no
contest to a tax-evasion charge and resign from office. ``That guy
was so straight that he could not even think corrupt,'' an
investigator who worked on the case later said of Mr. Richardson's
handling of the episode.
</P>
<P>
   It became increasingly clear that Nixon wanted Mr. Richardson to
fire Cox. Matters came to a head when the White House refused to
surrender a group of subpoenaed tape recordings to US District
Judge John J. Sirica, offering instead a set of edited transcripts
to be authenticated by US Sen. John Stennis (D-Miss.). Cox rejected
the proposal. In what Mr. Richardson later described as a
``low-keyed but tense'' meeting, Nixon ordered him to fire Cox,
saying that at a time of international crisis _ superpower
negotiations over ending the Yom Kippur War were then underway _ it
would make him appear weak to the Soviet leadership if Cox could
flout presidential authority.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Richardson demurred, an angry Nixon said, ``I'm sorry
that you insist on putting your personal commitments ahead of the
public interest.'' ``Mr. President,'' the attorney general replied,
``I can only say that I believe my resignation (itals)is(unitals)
in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, also refused to
dismiss Cox and was fired. Solicitor General Robert Bork carried
out the order, setting off what White House chief of staff
Alexander M. Haig termed ``a firestorm'' of protest. Telegrams and
letters poured into Washington. Nixon was forced to appoint another
special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, and calls for the president's
impeachment mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson simultaneously found himself out of work and a
political folk hero. ``I sometimes feel like a walking
anticlimax,'' he ruefully confessed in 1974. ``I can hardly reenact
my resignation.'' He worked on a book, ``The Creative Balance''
(1976), delivered numerous speaking engagements, and, after Nixon's
resignation, served as Gerald Ford's ambassador in London for a
year before taking over the Commerce department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sterling reputation, Mr. Richardson faced severe
handicaps in any pursuit of higher office. For one, he belonged to
the dwindling band of Republican liberals. For another, his
penchant for reflection often made him seem verbose. ``Let me
finish this paragraph,'' he once told a reporter who had
interrupted him, not a word often heard in an age of sound bites.
Nor did he project a winning manner. Stiffness is a concomitant of
rectitude, and Mr. Richardson _ a warm, witty man in private _ came
across as stuffy and unbending in public.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson did not lack political genes. An uncle, Henry Lee
Shattuck, was a prominent Republican who served on the Boston City
Council and in the Legislature. But the family calling was
medicine. Mr. Richardson's great-grandfather, both grandfathers, a
grandmother, three uncles, his father, and both his brothers were
physicians. Mr. Richardson said of his failure to go to medical
school, ``Medicine is like reading a book where you know what's
going to happen. I wanted a life with more surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Edward P. Richardson and Clara (Shattuck) Richardson,
he was born in Boston on July 20, 1920. Mr. Richardson grew up in
Brookline and graduated from Milton Academy. A philosophy major at
Harvard, he later described his ``main college activity'' as
cartooning for the undergraduate humor magazine, the Lampoon, and
he remained an inveterate doodler. Other hobbies included bird
watching and painting water colors. A devoted outdoorsman and
athlete, Mr. Richardson was Harvard middleweight boxing champion
and enjoyed fishing, mountain climbing, and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   As a combat litter bearer, Mr. Richardson won a Bronze Star and
two Purple Hearts during World War II. He rose to the rank of
lieutenant and was in the first US Army unit to enter Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson graduated from Harvard Law School in 1947, having
been president and editor of the law review. He clerked for US
Appeals Court Judge Learned Hand and US Supreme Court Justice Felix
Frankfurter. The latter was so impressed with him that in 1953 he
proposed the 33-year-old Mr. Richardson for the presidency of
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, Mr. Richardson met his future wife, Anne F.
(Hazard) Richardson, at a Bachelors Ball in Boston. She was a
Radcliffe senior, 10 years his junior. ``I looked around for the
most attractive girl I could spot so that I could cut in on her,''
he later recalled. ``Which I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She died in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson spent four years at the Boston law firm of Ropes
&AMP; Gray, joined the Washington staff of US Sen. Leverett
Salstonstall (R-Mass.) for two years, returned to Ropes &AMP; Gray,
then served as acting counsel to Governor Christian A. Herter.
Named assistant secretary for legislation at HEW in 1957, he played
a major role in drafting the National Defense Education Act. He
returned to Boston two years later, as US attorney. His most
important case was the successful tax-evasion prosecution of
Bernard Goldfine, a wealthy manufacturer whose gifts to White House
chief of staff Sherman Adams led to Adams's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Mr. Richardson ran for the Republican nomination for
attorney general, losing to future US Sen. Edward W. Brooke. Two
years later, he was elected lieutenant governor. He played an
activist role in what had been a largely ceremonial office,
coordinating social welfare programs for the administration and
urging Gov. John A. Volpe to sponsor the state's Racial Imbalance
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson was elected attorney general in 1966. Shortly
before Election Day, he charged his opponent, Francis X. Bellotti,
with improperly taking a retainer from an insurance company while
Bellotti was lieutenant governor. The accusation was widely
denounced as reckless and unfair, and Mr. Richardson later admitted
he was unwise to have made the charge.
</P>
<P>
   What Mr. Richardson called his ``longest and most demanding tour
of duty in any government job'' was the nearly four years he spent
as head of the US delegation to the United Nations Conference on
the Law of the Sea in the late '70s. He was the primary draftsman
of the global treaty the conference produced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Mr. Richardson joined the Washington office of the New
York law firm Milbank, Tweed Hadley, &AMP; McCloy as a senior partner.
He did not abandon public life, however, serving, for example, as a
monitor in UN-supervised elections in Namibia in 1988 and, a year
later, as the UN Secretary-General's personal representative at the
Nicaraguan national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
the nation's highest civilian honor, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two sons, Henry of Washington, D.C., and Michael of
Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Nancy Carlson of Burlington, Vt.; a
brother, George of Nahant; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is being planned.

GLITCH-FREE MILLENNIUM ARRIVES THE GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Whatever 2000 becomes, initial indications suggest it
is not the Year of the Bug.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about the computer malfunction known as the Millennium
Bug, not to mention terrorist attacks, turned out to be largely
exaggerated. While not glitch-free, the new year, new century, and
new millennium began with far less chaos across the globe than had
been expected.
</P>
<P>
   There were problems reported in some telecommunication systems,
particularly cellular phone networks, but they were attributed not
to the Millennium Bug but to heavy volume, a phenomenon known as
the ``Mother's Day effect,'' as millions dialed to wish a happy new
year to friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight passed in the first industrialized nations of New
Zealand, Australia, and Japan, there were no reports of major
disruptions in gas, water and electricity distribution systems. One
power outage in New Zealand was attributed to bad weather. There
were minor glitches in devices monitoring Japanese nuclear power
plants and weather and seismological conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were there reports of major infrastructure problems in the
less developed nations, from China, through India, and across the
vast African continent. Italy, considered western Europe's least
prepared country, reported no major glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Mother nature and human error had more of an impact than the
dreaded Millennium Bug. In France, some 2 million people saw the
new century in without electricity, victims of last week's storms.
In London, the Millennium Wheel known as the London Eye, the
world's newest and biggest Ferris wheel, began to turn but could
not take passengers because it failed a safety test.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively smooth start to the new year in the Asia-Pacific
region led officials in Paris, London, Washington and other major
western capitals to predict that the Y2K transition would come off
smoother than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reports are positive,'' said John Koskinen, the
chairman of the President's Council on Y2K Conversion in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Koskinen and other experts warned that the gradual
deterioration of some computer systems could lead to
slowly-developing degradation of information systems in some of the
nations that have made the Y2K transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all remember we have many miles to go before we
sleep,'' he said. ``Not all problems will be apparent
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen was particularly encouraged by reports from Japan,
which while heavily reliant on information technology had been
tardy in launching a Y2K compliance program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has always been a bellwether,'' said Koskinen.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the bombshell was political, not technological, as
Russians watched their longtime president Boris Yeltsin resign and
interim president Vladmir Putin gave the traditional New Year's
television address. In Eastern Russia, the Bilibino nuclear power
plant made the transition without any difficulty and the industrial
port city of Vladivostok was operating normally.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China, and Indonesia were among the countries that US
officials thought most at risk. Experts had suggested that Belize,
Egypt, Oman, Qatar, Madagascar, Tajikistan, and Ukraine were the
countries least prepared and most at risk for Millenium Bug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty minutes into the new millennium, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi went on live television to proclaim that Japan had not
fallen victim to any major Y2K disasters. He may have spoken too
soon, however. Hours later, reports emerged that minor problems had
affected two nuclear plants. The radiation monitoring system
stopped functioning at a nuclear power plant in Ishikawa prefecture
in western Japan. At another nuclear plant in northern Japan, a
radiation monitor stopped transmitting data for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A few other glitches in the country's meteorological and
seismological monitoring capabilities were also detected. The
national meteorological agency's internal clock changed from the
year 1999 to 100.
</P>
<P>
   At Gokokuji temple and other places of worship in central Tokyo
_ the traditional places in Japan to ring in the new year _ many
people did not come until well after midnight. Security officials
reasoned that many Japanese waited to venture out until after the
New Year began, to make sure that no Y2K problems had occurred.
Those who did come out complained about fear mongerers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media hyped Y2K too much,'' said Shiro Yamada, 57, a
construction company worker. ``I didn't see any reason to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 million people crammed into central London, many of them
lining up at ATMs to withdraw money, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect any major problems, but I don't want to risk
having no money, either,'' said John Forry, a 32-year-old computer
technician who planned to spend the night on Tower Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from government officials throughout Latin
America that most main services were Y2K compliant, sporadic
reports of problems and concerns over uncertainty surfaced
throughout the region. Officials in Mexico City were unable to
renew drivers licenses for thousands of motorists this week because
of computer problems blamed on Y2K conversion software.
Nevertheless, officials throughout Latin America, a region less
dependent on computer technology than the United States, Europe or
Asia, said utilities, banks and emergency agencies were ready for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the world, and particularly in the Middle East and
Europe, officials had been worried about terrorists seeking to
exploit the millennium with a high-profile atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   But even the writer Salman Rushdie, who last year was told the
fatwah, or death sentence imposed by Islamic militants, against him
had been lifted, felt comfortable enough to attend the London
opening of the Millennium Dome, the $1.3 billion exhibition center
that is the focal point of Britain's celebrations. Rushdie said he
was unconcerned by warnings about possible terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an astonishing building,'' Rushdie said after viewing the
Dome, whose 20-acre roof is the biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, more than 2 million firefighters, police officers,
civil servants and members of the defense forces were on alert. No
major disturbances were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Friday was a unique confluence of the calendars of
the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian calendars. It was the last Friday
prayer of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the ushering in of
Shabbat for Jews at sunset, and the marking of the 2,000th year of
the Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Brown, 65, of Manhattan's West Side, was strolling
through the streets of the Old City packed with some 400,000 Muslim
believers exiting their noon prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is wonderful to see all of these faiths together,
and to be here for the new millennium,'' she said, shouldering an
old Nikon camera and a packback.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department's travel warnings seemed to have
deterred many American tourists from coming, but they meant nothing
to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, come on, I'm from New York,'' she said. ``I wouldn't
have missed this for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But when night fell in Jerusalem, the streets emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Chief Rabbinate had decreed that there should be no
public celebrations, no fireworks, or parties that would violate
the Jewish sabbath. The most visible presence on the streets were
the Israeli police and soldiers clad in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the 12,000 police and military who fanned out
across the country was in Jerusalem's Old City, where calm
prevailed. Islam's holy site, the Dome of the Rock, sits literally
atop Judaism's most sacred site, the Western Wall of the Temple
Mount. The Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus was crucified and buried,
lies within a few hundred yards.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of all the sites has created concerns over a
profound security risk in Israel, where officials feared an attack
on the Dome of the Rock by extremist Christians or Jews who believe
the Muslim shrine must be destroyed in order for the Jewish Temple
to be rebuilt, and the messiah to return.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus, Palestinian security forces
were also out in full force. Dressed in camouflage fatigues, they
ringed Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   In London, more than 6,000 police were on the streets.
Antiterrorist police officers had spent the last few days scouring
the capital for bombs, fearing that, among others, dissidents from
Northern Ireland would seek to undermine the recent progress in the
peace process there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared,'' said Metropolitan Police assistant chief
constable Ian Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, it appeared, was the rest of the world.
</P>

ELLIOT RICHARDSON, VERSATILE MAN, IS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Elliot L. Richardson, the Boston Brahmin who as US
attorney general in 1973 refused to fire Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox, thus making himself a national symbol of
political integrity, died in Massachusetts General Hospital Friday
of a brain hemorrhage. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson's action as attorney general triggered the
``Saturday Night Massacre,'' which helped lead to Richard Nixon's
resignation the following year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that Mr. Richardson ``put the
nation's interests first even when the personal cost was very high.
He was an unparalleled public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci and
Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift called Mr. Richardson a ``true
hero'' who ``served the Commonwealth and his country with courage,
dignity, and uncompromising valor.''
</P>
<P>
   The patrician as pluperfect public servant, Mr. Richardson
amassed an extraordinary resume that earned him the nickname ``The
Man for All Positions.'' He liked to joke that his versatility
meant he ``never held a job for more than two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being elected Massachusetts lieutenant governor
and attorney general during the 1960s, he served as assistant US
secretary of health, education and welfare and US attorney for
Massachusetts in the Eisenhower administration; undersecretary of
state, secretary of health, education and welfare, secretary of
defense, and attorney general in the Nixon administration;
ambassador to the Court of St. James' and secretary of commerce in
the Ford administration; and ambassador at large in the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approach any job in essentially the same way,'' Mr.
Richardson once said. ``I don't consider that the subject matter
makes any particular difference. If I don't know it, I learn it. I
try to find out what it is necessary to do, and then do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the aristocratic background that helped produce such
self-assurance worked against him when he ran for the GOP
nomination for US senator from Massachusetts in 1984. A
self-described ``radical moderate'' who liked to joke about the
burden of bearing three last names, Elliot Lee Richardson found
little support in a party that had come to be dominated by
conservative and ethnic voters. His opponent, Raymond V. Shamie,
defeated him by nearly 25 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling reversal for a man who had been regarded as a
possible vice presidential or even presidential nominee in 1976.
What had earned Mr. Richardson such consideration was his steadfast
performance in the face of mounting White House pressure during the
five months he served as attorney general, culminating in his
resignation on Oct. 20, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of Mr. Richardson's indispensability to the
Nixon administration that he was presiding over the Justice
Department at that time. As undersecretary of state, he had played
a crucial role as intermediary in the battles between Secretary of
State William Rogers and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1970, Mr. Richardson had taken over at HEW, a department
in considerable disarray and one responsible for such controversial
issues of the day as welfare reform and school desegregation. Mr.
Richardson's surehandedness there inspired Nixon to make him
secretary of defense 2 1/2 years later. He'd been at the Pentagon
barely four months when growing suspicions about White House
involvement in the Watergate scandal and the resignation of
Attorney General Richard Kleindienst forced Nixon to turn to Mr.
Richardson, with his double-barreled image as a ``Mr. Clean and Mr.
Fix-It,'' to head the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson's first decision was to appoint a special
prosecutor. He chose Harvard Law School Professor Archibald Cox and
guaranteed the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cox would have
complete independence.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Mr. Richardson began to meet with opposition
from the Oval Office. In the 10 weeks preceding his resignation,
Nixon met with him only once, and Mr. Richardson quipped that he
might soon be writing a book called ``Situation Wanted.'' He
likened his battles with the White House to his experience of
landing on Utah Beach on D-Day. ``All I could do was put down one
foot after the other, hoping each time that (no mine) would go
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters was the ongoing investigation of
Vice President Spiro Agnew on charges of tax fraud and bribery. Mr.
Richardson negotiated a settlement whereby Agnew would plead no
contest to a tax-evasion charge and resign from office. ``That guy
was so straight that he could not even think corrupt,'' an
investigator who worked on the case later said of Mr. Richardson's
handling of the episode.
</P>
<P>
   It became increasingly clear that Nixon wanted Mr. Richardson to
fire Cox. Matters came to a head when the White House refused to
surrender a group of subpoenaed tape recordings to US District
Judge John J. Sirica, offering instead a set of edited transcripts
to be authenticated by US Sen. John Stennis (D-Miss.). Cox rejected
the proposal. In what Mr. Richardson later described as a
``low-keyed but tense'' meeting, Nixon ordered him to fire Cox,
saying that at a time of international crisis _ superpower
negotiations over ending the Yom Kippur War were then underway _ it
would make him appear weak to the Soviet leadership if Cox could
flout presidential authority.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Richardson demurred, an angry Nixon said, ``I'm sorry
that you insist on putting your personal commitments ahead of the
public interest.'' ``Mr. President,'' the attorney general replied,
``I can only say that I believe my resignation (itals)is(unitals)
in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, also refused to
dismiss Cox and was fired. Solicitor General Robert Bork carried
out the order, setting off what White House chief of staff
Alexander M. Haig termed ``a firestorm'' of protest. Telegrams and
letters poured into Washington. Nixon was forced to appoint another
special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, and calls for the president's
impeachment mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson simultaneously found himself out of work and a
political folk hero. ``I sometimes feel like a walking
anticlimax,'' he ruefully confessed in 1974. ``I can hardly reenact
my resignation.'' He worked on a book, ``The Creative Balance''
(1976), delivered numerous speaking engagements, and, after Nixon's
resignation, served as Gerald Ford's ambassador in London for a
year before taking over the Commerce department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sterling reputation, Mr. Richardson faced severe
handicaps in any pursuit of higher office. For one, he belonged to
the dwindling band of Republican liberals. For another, his
penchant for reflection often made him seem verbose. ``Let me
finish this paragraph,'' he once told a reporter who had
interrupted him, not a word often heard in an age of sound bites.
Nor did he project a winning manner. Stiffness is a concomitant of
rectitude, and Mr. Richardson _ a warm, witty man in private _ came
across as stuffy and unbending in public.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson did not lack political genes. An uncle, Henry Lee
Shattuck, was a prominent Republican who served on the Boston City
Council and in the Legislature. But the family calling was
medicine. Mr. Richardson's great-grandfather, both grandfathers, a
grandmother, three uncles, his father, and both his brothers were
physicians. Mr. Richardson said of his failure to go to medical
school, ``Medicine is like reading a book where you know what's
going to happen. I wanted a life with more surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Edward P. Richardson and Clara (Shattuck) Richardson,
he was born in Boston on July 20, 1920. Mr. Richardson grew up in
Brookline and graduated from Milton Academy. A philosophy major at
Harvard, he later described his ``main college activity'' as
cartooning for the undergraduate humor magazine, the Lampoon, and
he remained an inveterate doodler. Other hobbies included bird
watching and painting water colors. A devoted outdoorsman and
athlete, Mr. Richardson was Harvard middleweight boxing champion
and enjoyed fishing, mountain climbing, and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   As a combat litter bearer, Mr. Richardson won a Bronze Star and
two Purple Hearts during World War II. He rose to the rank of
lieutenant and was in the first US Army unit to enter Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson graduated from Harvard Law School in 1947, having
been president and editor of the law review. He clerked for US
Appeals Court Judge Learned Hand and US Supreme Court Justice Felix
Frankfurter. The latter was so impressed with him that in 1953 he
proposed the 33-year-old Mr. Richardson for the presidency of
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, Mr. Richardson met his future wife, Anne F.
(Hazard) Richardson, at a Bachelors Ball in Boston. She was a
Radcliffe senior, 10 years his junior. ``I looked around for the
most attractive girl I could spot so that I could cut in on her,''
he later recalled. ``Which I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She died in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson spent four years at the Boston law firm of Ropes
&AMP; Gray, joined the Washington staff of US Sen. Leverett
Salstonstall (R-Mass.) for two years, returned to Ropes &AMP; Gray,
then served as acting counsel to Governor Christian A. Herter.
Named assistant secretary for legislation at HEW in 1957, he played
a major role in drafting the National Defense Education Act. He
returned to Boston two years later, as US attorney. His most
important case was the successful tax-evasion prosecution of
Bernard Goldfine, a wealthy manufacturer whose gifts to White House
chief of staff Sherman Adams led to Adams's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Mr. Richardson ran for the Republican nomination for
attorney general, losing to future US Sen. Edward W. Brooke. Two
years later, he was elected lieutenant governor. He played an
activist role in what had been a largely ceremonial office,
coordinating social welfare programs for the administration and
urging Gov. John A. Volpe to sponsor the state's Racial Imbalance
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson was elected attorney general in 1966. Shortly
before Election Day, he charged his opponent, Francis X. Bellotti,
with improperly taking a retainer from an insurance company while
Bellotti was lieutenant governor. The accusation was widely
denounced as reckless and unfair, and Mr. Richardson later admitted
he was unwise to have made the charge.
</P>
<P>
   What Mr. Richardson called his ``longest and most demanding tour
of duty in any government job'' was the nearly four years he spent
as head of the US delegation to the United Nations Conference on
the Law of the Sea in the late '70s. He was the primary draftsman
of the global treaty the conference produced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Mr. Richardson joined the Washington office of the New
York law firm Milbank, Tweed Hadley, &AMP; McCloy as a senior partner.
He did not abandon public life, however, serving, for example, as a
monitor in UN-supervised elections in Namibia in 1988 and, a year
later, as the UN Secretary-General's personal representative at the
Nicaraguan national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
the nation's highest civilian honor, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two sons, Henry of Washington, D.C., and Michael of
Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Nancy Carlson of Burlington, Vt.; a
brother, George of Nahant; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is being planned.

MONITORING MISSILES FOR Y2K COMPLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ The new decade arrived well before
dawn here Friday at Peterson Air Force Base, but there was more
relief than celebration as the world's 24 time zones began passing
from the 20th century without nuclear conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   In a collaboration that would have been inconceivable before the
Cold War ended just a decade ago, American and Russian military
personnel sat side by side inside an ad hoc Center for Y2K
Strategic Stability, where they monitored data that would reflect
any ballistic missile activity around the world.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, there was none _ at least none that the American
and Russian authorities here would discuss. Major General Thomas B.
Goslin Jr. of the Air Force confirmed that the North American
Aerospace Defense Command, which is 13 miles from here inside
Cheyenne Mountain, had detected recent launchings of three missiles
but said the missiles' inability to travel more than 500
kilometers, or 310 miles, made them irrelevant to operations here.
</P>
<P>
   From the American perspective, any moments of real concern had
passed by the turn of the millennium at Greenwich Mean Time,
midnight in London. Every American missile system operates on
Greenwich Mean Time, which means precise timing is imperative for
encryption and other programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But it also meant that the new year had passed without incident
through all 11 times zones of Russia, as well as through all of
Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The center is largely a public relations device, created in
September so that each country could reassure the other that any
missile launching was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing the American and Russian personnel monitored here
was exclusive to them, anyway, making center operations largely
redundant. Rather, they were watching data relayed instantaneously
from Cheyenne Mountain, where the monitoring of missile activity
around the world by American and Canadian personnel is continuous.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, American and Russian officials decided that, for
good measure and good will, a special center could provide an added
layer of assurance against the possibility of an accidental
launching _ unlikely as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of all this is additional insurance, No. 1,'' said
Captain Michael W. Luginbuhl, a Naval officer. ``But also, there's
the world perception that the two greatest nuclear powers are
coordinating and collaborating to go the extra step to make sure
nothing goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Russia and the United States were concerned, nothing
was ever expected to go wrong. In any case, Luginbuhl said that any
launching required so much human intervention that even a ``false
indicator'' from a computer would not likely send a missile
skyward.
</P>
<P>
   But as a further precaution, the center was equipped with direct
telephone lines _ to Cheyenne Mountain for the Americans, to Moscow
for the Russians _ to question any glitch, real or perceived. In
the 24 hours through 7 p.m. New York time Friday, the only
abnormality occurred on Thursday, officials said, when the Russians
used their ``red phone'' (which is actually black) to call home and
the phone in Moscow did not ring. The problem was fixed momentarily
after officers in Moscow discovered their phone had not been turned
on.

FAA CHIEF FLIES CONFIDENTLY INTO THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON BOARD AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 1099 _ Wearing a navy pants
suit with a single strand of pearls and showing absolutely no
trepidation, Jane F. Garvey, the nation's top aviation official,
sat in the first row of the coach section on board American
Airlines flight 1099 Friday, so she could be airborne as the
country's air-traffic control system struck midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last-minute Y2K-related fixes to the system, Garvey was
supremely confident that the flight would be uneventful. In a
preflight press conference at Washington's National Airport, US
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater praised Garvey and US
Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, chairman of the Senate aviation
subcommittee, for being on a flight that ``will take off in the
20th century and land in the 21st century.'' The flight, he said,
is ``a visible symbol of the journey the nation is taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, has spent
more than $350 million making sure its computer-dependent
air-traffic control systems function smoothly. The airlines spent
another $750 million domestically to insure that flying today is as
safe as any other day.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the FAA invested millions of man hours in checking
computer code so antiquated that retired IBM employees were called
in to assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of FAA men and women have worked on this, and they
have responded just wonderfully to a remarkable challenge,'' Garvey
said on the first leg of the trip, to Dallas-Fort Worth. Television
cameras jostled for space in the single-aisle airplane to record
Garvey selecting her seat.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute change to the air-traffic-control software _
involving less than 10 lines of computer code _ took place this
week and was tested Thursday, when it was discovered there was a
remote possibility that if two pieces of equipment failed
simultaneously on Jan. 1 it could momentarily shut down the main
computers at the nation's 21 en route centers, which direct all of
the high-altitude air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1099, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-80, pushed back from the
gate at 5:12 p.m. at National Airport and was roaring down the
runway at 5:22, in plenty of time to insure that Garvey would be in
the air at midnight Greenwich Mean Time (7 p.m. Eastern Standard
Time). That's the hour at which the nation's air-traffic control
system, which is coordinated with computers all over the world,
would recognize the date change to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was scheduled to land in Dallas at 8:43 p.m. Eastern
time. Following another press conference, Garvey was to take off
for San Francisco aboard American Flight 1435, which was scheduled
to land at 3:09 a.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 p.m., as the aircraft flew over Trenton, Tenn.,
Garvey, Slater, and President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, John
Koskinen, were linked in a telephone conference call through the
FAA operations center. Koskinen was on a plane to New York, and
Slater was at the FAA Air Traffic Control Command Center in
Herndon, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of happy faces up here,'' Garvey reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our flight is as uneventful as yours,'' Koskinen replied.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne was uncorked as Janet S. Rhodes, a passenger from Long
Beach, Calif., exclaimed, ``We're still flying and heading in the
same direction. Isn't it marvelous!''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey also read a copy of a letter faxed from her office to
President Clinton, saying that ``the nation's airspace system is up
and running safely and efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   She closed the letter with a quotation from a telegram sent by
flight pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright nearly a century ago,
``Success (Stop) . . . Inform press (Stop).''
</P>
<P>
   No indications of trouble were reported in the minutes after 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 133-seat flight to Dallas was nearly empty, save for Garvey;
some members of her staff; Ray Long, the former head of the FAA's
Y2K office; Senator Gorton; a dozen members of the news media; and
about 25 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a struggle in many ways for Garvey, a former commissioner
of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, to make this
flight at all.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after she was named to head the FAA in August 1997,
Garvey was confronted with the fact that the agency was not
adequately prepared for potential year 2000 problems. But long
before she knew how the problems would be fixed, she vowed that
they would be. Two years ago, she promised to make this flight
across the country to show that the United States has the world's
safest aviation system.
</P>
<P>
   But due to a lack of demand for travel on this date, Garvey
notwithstanding, American Airlines kept canceling flights she
wanted to take.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American canceled about 20 percent of its domestic
flights on Dec. 31, virtually all of them after 2 p.m. Garvey's
plane is the last American flight scheduled to land at the
airline's busy Dallas hub.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA reported that about 3,000 planes were in the air at 4
p.m. Eastern time, and that number was expected to drop steadily
through the evening. The San Francisco leg of Garvey's trip is
considered to be pure public relations, an opportunity to be in the
air over the United States when it is midnight on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey has boasted that she will celebrate the New Year three
times in one night. If her timing is good, that will happen. In
addition to the all-important Greenwich Mean Time system rollover,
she is scheduled to be in the air at midnight in the Mountain and
Pacific time zones.

COMMENTARY: WHY DIE? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the instincts in animals, the strongest is
the will to survive. In the human animal, that inborn defense is
sometimes overcome by the maternal instinct, by love of country or
comrades in battle, or by an illness like depression. But in most
of us, nothing makes the weak strong or the fearful brave as much
as our bodies' innate drive to stay alive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of that survival instinct, in the millennium to come a
curious question will occupy the minds of our descendants. It seems
almost nutty to ask it today, but tomorrow's question will be: Why
die? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One sober-sided school of scientific thought holds that Homo
sapiens sapiens, our species now celebrating its 100th millennium,
is born with an inner clock. That genetic clock directs our cells
not only to grow but to age and decay. It is set to run no more
than 120 or 130 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few of us live to that full span because of illness, accident or
war. But the clear trend is toward filling up more of that span: in
the past century alone, life expectancy in the U.S. has gone from
46 to 76. Now add the ingredient of diseaselessness: conservative
scientists say that in the coming century cures will be found for
the leading killers _ heart disease, cancer and stroke _ and
genetically influenced diseases will be engineered out of
existence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the major killers gone, and with organ transplants or
prosthetic innards replacing worn-out human parts, more people will
be pushing up against that presumed clock. Centenarians will be
common.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now take the leap: What if the hypothesis of the clock-watchers
is mistaken? As the lengthening of life in the 20th century showed
us, a life span of ``three score and ten'' is not the most reliable
prediction in the Bible. Where is it written in our genes that a
signal will direct our bodies to close up shop at 120?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I put that question to the great Johns Hopkins neuroscientist
Dr. Guy McKhann. He and his wife, Professor Marilyn Albert, the new
head of the Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute in Boston, are
completing a book about the untapped potential of the aging brain.
(They are ``experts on aging''; never call them ``aging
experts.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're asking the wrong question,'' says McKhann.
``Assume there is some finite span of time set by an internal
clock, as studies of other species suggest. Then the real question
becomes: Can we reset the clock?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's what all the recent excitement among scientists over stem
cells is about. If the next-to-last year of the second millennium
is remembered for anything, it will be for the discovery of the
human body's ability to regenerate itself.
</P>
<P>
   These stem cells _ nondifferentiated globs of cells that divide
randomly and blossom into nerve or muscle or brain cells _ are
being shown to be a source of replacement of dead or dying cells.
We never thought that to be possible. These wild-card cells may be
found not just in embryos but in adult bodies, and could, in
effect, reset the clock _ time and again, doubling and redoubling
the life span. Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth may be within our
reach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some organs, like the liver, will be relatively easy to
regenerate,'' says McKhann. ``The brain is harder, but we should be
able to replace parts of the brain afflicted with diseases, as well
as to improve short- and long-term memory in the renewing brain.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a millennium's turn, we can think even bigger. If the
instinct for survival remains paramount, most of the geezers of the
next few hundred years will want to stick around. At first, that
seems troubling; as the Ira Gershwin lyric observed: ``Methusaleh
lived 900 years. / But who calls dat livin' / when no gal'll give
in / to no man what's 900 years?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answer: For future people, doddering will no longer be an
option. Throw out those second-millennium images of codgers in
wheelchairs staring at the wall. The Gramps of a century or so from
now will be swiveling on the dance floor with his replacement hips
and fresh lungs and newly enlivened brain and pocketful of potency
pills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as mortality recedes and babies keep coming, it could
get a little crowded here. After the population of earth reaches 30
billion, what then? Solution: Start shipping the spry old folks out
on a mission to colonize the solar system. ``Happy 200th birthday,
Grandma _ here's your ticket to Mars, and say hello to your parents
out there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This calendar-induced speculation is not directed at those of us
today who will probably keel over even before our genetic clocks
run out. But for those readers of a distant tomorrow who will flip
back through the millennia to access The New York Times Archive,
one will say, ``You know, this fellow was incredibly prescient.''
And another will respond, with all human skepticism, ``Sure, he was
right _ but do you really want to live forever?''

CITYWIDE SPECTACULAR TO LIGHT UP HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Hollywood, the semireal place that helped the 20th
century shape so much of its own image, bid it farewell Friday
night with a citywide spectacular of song and showmanship, kitsch
and multiculturalism grandly intended to herald the emerging Los
Angeles of the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, the icon of choice was not a microchip, a
container ship, a freeway or even a digital video camera, but the
hoariest symbol of local self-promotion: the HOLLYWOOD sign.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of midnight, Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles
and Jay Leno, the host of the ``Tonight'' show, were scheduled to
flip a switch to light each letter of the sign in a sequential
countdown, to be shown on local and world television.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the lighting was still scheduled, but had been
scaled back. A laser-light show and a drop by synchronized
skydivers were canceled in deference to dry weather that had
created fire hazards in the hills below the sign (though it rained
off and on Friday).
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment came from homeowners, who had opposed
lighting the sign, which was originally built to advertise a
residential housing development called Hollywoodland in the 1920s
and was last lighted during the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Only residents and their guests were allowed to drive into the
neighborhood Friday night, in hopes of holding down parking and
traffic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a very dry season,'' said Noelia Rodriguez, the
deputy mayor of Los Angeles and Riordan's chief spokeswoman. ``The
fire hazards certainly played into it. The last thing we need is to
torch the Hollywood sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The festivities began Friday afternoon with a musical
celebration dubbed Opus 21, in which churches, choirs and other
groups began a simultaneous sounding of bells, cymbals, gongs and
shofar.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, pouring rain and minor street flooding had
scattered a crowd of several hundred people from Grand Avenue in
downtown Los Angeles, where the theme was ``The Global Village.'' A
street fair on Grand Avenue featured face painters, a Ferris wheel
and considerably fewer than the 2,000 marching band members that
had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' said Linda Miller, who came from nearby
Torrance, Calif., with her husband, Dave, to watch their daughter
march in the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish it didn't have to rain.'' Surveying the crowd,
Mrs. Miller added: ``It's a little thin. I think they were a little
light on the advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on Olvera Street, the site of the city's
original Spanish settlement, crowds were thicker.
</P>
<P>
   This being Los Angeles, there had to be at least one glitzy
event, and a private party on a lot at Paramount Studios was the A
ticket Friday night, a benefit dinner for 560 people intended to
raise $1 million for the Los Angeles Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   With tables costing $25,000, food by Wolfgang Puck, music by
Frank Sinatra Jr. and a backyard view of the Hollywood sign, the
event was also to honor Lew Wasserman, the founder of MCA, as
Hollywood's ``Man of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Giant video screens linked this exclusive party to the more
populist ones around the city, which were also to get a special
treat: excerpts of a concert at the new Staples Center arena
featuring the Eagles and Jackson Browne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself to be working tonight,'' said Janet Karatz,
the chairwoman of the charity dinner. ``And I can't imagine wanting
to do anything else.''

ELLIOT RICHARDSON DIES AT 79; STOOD UP TO NIXON AND RESIGNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elliot L. Richardson, the archetype of the cultivated New
England Brahmin who served in an astonishingly broad range of high
public positions, and who was best known for his refusal during
Watergate to obey President Richard M. Nixon's order to fire a
special prosecutor, died Friday in his native Massachusetts. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson died at the Massachusetts General Hospital from
complications after a cerebral hemorrhage, his son Michael
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who was descended from some of Boston's earliest
settlers, was sometimes referred to by friends as ``the former
everything'' because of the great variety of positions he held both
in Massachusetts and in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   He served as attorney general and U.S. attorney in
Massachusetts, was second-in-command at the State Department and
held four cabinet positions, more than anyone else in history. He
also served as ambassador to Britain, negotiated the worldwide
treaty on the Law of the Sea and was the chief representative of
the United Nations in monitoring Nicaraguan elections in 1990,
among other assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Richardson's stand during Watergate when he was
Nixon's attorney general that was widely lauded as a special moment
of integrity and rectitude that secured him a place in the nation's
history. Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Archibald M. Cox, the
special Watergate prosecutor, but Richardson chose to resign
instead.
</P>
<P>
   After Richardson resigned, his second-in-command, William D.
Ruckelshaus was fired after similarly refusing to fire Cox. Those
events, on Saturday, Oct. 20, 1973, became known as the Saturday
Night Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Bork, who was then the solicitor general and thus the
Justice Department's highest-ranking remaining official, accepted
the assignment and fired Cox. Bork's behavior was a source of
criticism in 1987 when the Senate refused to confirm his nomination
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The orders to fire Cox came as Nixon struggled to limit the
investigation that stemmed from the June 17, 1972, break-in at the
Democratic Party's headquarters at the Watergate complex.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 book, ``Reflections of a Moderate,'' Richardson
recalled that he came to see events clearly in the midst of that
tension-drenched time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I thought about it,'' he wrote, ``the clearer it
seemed to me that public confidence in the investigation would
depend on its being independent not only in fact, but in
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he recalled in an article in The Atlantic Monthly, that
he came to realize he was in a ``peculiar no-man's land between the
special prosecutor and the president.'' He eventually decided he
was being exploited by Nixon to get rid of Cox, who was determined
to obtain tape-recordings made surreptitiously in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Richardson recalled in the article how he went home and
discussed the events with his wife, Anne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that I could not carry out the instruction,'' he
wrote and his wife joked that he would be carried out of the
Justice Department in a mahogany coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also ruminated on the cause of Nixon's failings in
the Watergate scandal, attributing it in part to his refusal to
stop dwelling on his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second ingredient of Watergate, an amoral alacrity to do
the president's bidding, was traceable less to flaws in his own
political character (although it was reinforced by them) than to
the political and cultural evolution of 20th century America.''
</P>
<P>
   He lamented that the character of the president's men was not
uniquely evil but merely an extension of the increasingly common
values of ``get-ahead, go-along organization men who take on the
coloration and the value system of whatever organization'' they
belong to.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Richardson wrote that he never understood how Nixon and his
advisers could have assumed that he would fire Cox, who had
objected to having limits placed on his ability to subpoena White
House materials.
</P>
<P>
   He could only have dismissed Cox for ``extraordinary
impropriety,'' he said, and Cox's position was ``not only
defensible but right.''
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation, Richardson was surprised and embarrassed
to find himself called a modern-day Sir Thomas More. But if he wore
that description modestly, it also made him sought after as a moral
arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   His role as the chief monitor when Nicaragua voted out the
Sandinista government gave that election credibility. When he
publicly declared that he thought Edwin Meese III, a fellow
Republican, unfit to become attorney general, it carried great
weight. Last year, he urged the House to censure President Clinton
but not impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of Richardson's death, Clinton said that
Richardson ``put the nation's interests first even when the
personal cost was very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Lee Richardson was born in Boston on July 20, 1920, the
son of a prominent doctor who was professor of medicine at the
Harvard Medical School. He once told friends that he spent his
years at Harvard College mostly drawing cartoons for the Lampoon,
the comedy magazine. But he graduated near the top of his class and
enrolled in Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He studied there only a short time before enlisting in the Army
to serve in World War II. As a first lieutenant, he landed in
Normandy on D-Day with the 4th Infantry Division. In the ensuing
months he earned a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen E. Ambrose, the historian, wrote in his account of D-Day
that Richardson, then a 23-year-old platoon leader, risked his life
to cross a minefield to rescue another officer whose foot was blown
off. Years later, Richardson, in conversations with friends, would
compare his feelings at that time with those he experienced when he
was asked to fire Cox.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Harvard Law School in 1945 where he became editor
and president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a law clerk for
Judge Learned Hand and then for Justice Felix I. Frankfurter.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Ernest J. Sargeant of Wellesley, Mass., recalled
Friday how Richardson negotiated with Frankfurter to be allowed to
have an hour to himself each morning to read Shakespeare.
Frankfurter was so impressed with Richardson that in 1953 he
recommended that he be named president of Harvard even though he
was only 33 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Although his father, two grandfathers and several uncles had
been physicians in Boston, he chose a career in politics and public
administration, starting in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Henry Lee Shattuck, who served on the Boston City
Council and played the Yankee antagonist to the city's
Irish-American Democrats, became Richardson's political mentor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Richardson began his public career as an aide to Sen. Leverett
Saltonstall, a venerable Republican. He returned to Boston in 1959
as the U.S. attorney there. In 1969, he was appointed
undersecretary of state at the State Department, a position he held
until 1970, when he was named to head the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   He was named defense secretary at the beginning of 1973 and
became attorney general after four months, serving until his
resignation in October 1973. He later served as secretary of
commerce in the administration of President Gerald R. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Carr, a Washington lawyer who is writing a biography of
Richardson said his research showed that no one had ever held four
cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 Richardson ran unsuccessfully for the Republican
nomination for the Senate from Massachusetts. Richardson, according
to press accounts at the time, had a difficult time in electoral
politics. The voters, even in a Republican primary, did not easily
warm to his reserved ways. He asked to be known as Muggsy in what
turned out to be an ineffectual effort to appear more of a casual
figure to voters, who nonetheless chose his opponent by a 2-to-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
nation's highest civilian honor, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's wife, Anne, died last July. He is survived by three
children, Nancy Carlson of St. George, Vt., Henry of Washington,
and Michael of Upper Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Mary Conrad of
Albuquerque, N.M.; and a brother Dr. George Richardson of Nahant,
Mass.

SOLEMNITY AND FLASH IN THE LAND OF JESUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG and WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a beautiful, almost ethereal scene, about 2,000 Christians
quietly ascended the Mount of Olives as midnight approached.
Following a lighted crucifix, they carried votive candles that
flickered in the still darkness of a city devoid of any official
celebration of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   At the top, they planted the crucifix and gathered round, moved
by the serenity. Then, switching in a flash from the sublime to the
cheesy, it turned into a Dick Clark New Year's Eve special with a
Fellini-esque cast, set in the heart of the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   There, a Franciscan priest stepped onto a rickety sound stage
and into an emcee persona. Beckoning the crowd closer, he led a
heavily accented English countdown to midnight. An amplified
electronic keyboard let loose a bad disco version of ``Auld Lang
Syne.'' And the people, from the Italian nuns to the Catholic
church group from Texas, all ran for cover as sparks from a
fireworks display rained on their moment of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very beautiful, the fireworks, but very, very close,'' said
Sister Elisa, a Spanish nun, as she brushed a spark from her habit.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the festivities around the world, at ground zero
in the land where Jesus lived and died, the celebration was a
modest, even rinky-dink, affair. Midnight marked just another day
in the year 5760 on the Jewish calendar and 1420 on the Islamic
one. Most of Jerusalem was shuttered; the Israeli government staged
no events.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem was another story. Manger Square was packed, a
Palestinian block party par excellence, culminating in a resounding
fireworks show that coincided with the release of 2,000 doves for
peace. Stunned, the doves crashed and bumped their way into the
night, somewhat startled and tentative symbols, but the crowd was
elated.
</P>
<P>
   Like Manger Square, the rocky hillside of the Mount of Olives,
venerated by Jews for its ancient cemetery and by Christians as a
place where Jesus preached and prayed, was heavily guarded by
security officials.
</P>
<P>
   But it could not have been more peaceful. The faithful lined up
on the steps of the Church of All Nations, praying in many
languages and singing Latin hymns as they gazed on the
spectacularly lit Old City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time of looking forward to the future with hope, and
not toward disaster and doom and all that,'' said the Rev. Mitchell
Pacwa of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after midnight, the foreigners scattered, back into
their hotels, tour buses and taxis, leaving only the few
Palestinians walking home and the many Israeli soldiers packing up.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Sakhel, a Palestinian Catholic, descended the mount with a
group of friends. ``Look at them,'' she said, smiling at the
Israelis. ``They were protecting us. Protecting us from what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who expected violence are those who do not believe in
God,'' she said.

 &HT;    Longhorns press on without their suspended stars
 &HT;    (Eds: Adds statements from coach)
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton, Kirk Bohls and Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The four suspended University of Texas football players
left Dallas on Friday morning, while their coach refused to discuss
if or when the three underclassmen will be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mack Brown said Friday he will not talk about the duration
of the suspensions of junior wide receiver Kwame Cavil, junior
defensive end J.J. Kelly and redshirt freshman linebacker Jamal
Joyner until after the Longhorns complete their season today
against Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Senior defensive end Aaron Humphrey also was suspended, and his
career at Texas is finished.
</P>
<P>
   The four were suspended late Thursday for violating team rules,
Brown said. The players were drug-tested earlier this week by the
NCAA, and if any of them flunked the test, they would be subject to
a year's suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Brown nor Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds would discuss
specifics of the suspensions, saying the Buckley amendment
precluded them from doing so. The federal law prevents school
officials from discussing a student's academic record.
</P>
<P>
   Jafus Cavil, father of Kwame Cavil, said Friday that no decision
has been made concerning his son's future at UT. The younger Cavil,
long before the suspensions surfaced, had been contemplating giving
up his final year of eligibility to apply for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Jafus Cavil said he has yet to be told how long his son's
suspension will be.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his son had flunked a drug test, Jafus Cavil said,
``I've been told not to answer that by my attorneys, so I'll have
no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Humphrey, father of Aaron Humphrey, also declined
comment, saying, ``We'll let his four years there speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls placed to Kelly's home were not returned, and Joyner could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns went through a brief practice Friday afternoon at
the Cotton Bowl. Brown and his players then met on the field for
about 30 minutes. Former Longhorns great James Street, the
quarterback who led Texas to a 15-14 win to clinch the national
championship against Arkansas in 1969, spoke to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little family setback (Thursday),'' Brown said after
Friday's practice. ``We've got great kids, and when you have great
kids, when something happens, you pull together. You'll see a great
effort (today) from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scrambling a little bit. I told the coaches that it's no
different than an injury in the first quarter. We have to take what
we have and plug it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Late suspensions before a bowl game are not unprecedented. Coach
Lou Holtz, who coached Arkansas when the Razorbacks played in the
1978 Orange Bowl, suspended three players on the eve of the game,
including star running back Ben Cowins and leading wide receiver
Danny Bobo. Arkansas beat Oklahoma 31-6, and Cowins' replacement,
Roland Sales, set an Orange Bowl record with 205 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Coach Houston Nutt was a freshman backup quarterback on
that Razorbacks team. Nutt, coincidentally, announced that starting
tailback Cedric Cobbs missed a team meeting and will not start as
planned today.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience just from being in the Orange Bowl is that (the
Texas suspensions) will be a rally cry,'' Nutt said. ``That'll be a
good wakeup. When Coach Holtz kicked off three of our best players,
we got a little closer. We played a little harder. That's what I
told our team (Friday).
</P>
<P>
   ``They have depth, they have players. It's just names we're not
familiar with. We'll see as the game goes on, but personally I
don't think it will matter much.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Texas four years ago was rocked by scandal the day
before the Longhorns took on Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl, when
it was discovered that defensive back Ron McKelvey was actually a
30-year-old named Ron Weaver who had played six years of college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil and Humphrey, both All-Big 12 Conference selections, were
two prime reasons for the Longhorns' success this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil's 100 catches for 1,188 yards broke the conference record
for catches and yards in a season. Humphrey's 10 sacks also led the
conference. He was selected as the Longhorns' most valuable player
in a vote by his teammates last month and also was named team
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 16 years as a head coach,'' Mack Brown said, ``I have never
suspended a player. I've been very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis tried to put the best
face on the scenario but said: ``Look at the numbers. Obviously
it's going to hurt us, but our biggest concern is for the kids. I
really don't know for sure, but I feel like we'll play together.''

 &HT;    Hokies' Moore too explosive to be ignored
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ You can't really blame Virginia Tech sackmaster
Corey Moore for going off on reporters at the opening bell of
Friday's Sugar Bowl media day interview session.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, how much restraint is a man supposed to show when the
first thing he's asked is so vile, so incendiary ... well, let's
just say it took a great deal of discussion on the part of my
bosses before the decision was made to run the provocative question
in full.
</P>
<P>
   Here it comes, but be warned, this is the raw and unedited
version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Corey. How are you enjoying New Orleans so far
and how do you plan to celebrate the new year?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, as you might expect, the Big East defensive player of the
year wasn't about to allow a bunch of pantywaist reporters to
challenge his manhood in such an unspeakable manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrate for what?'' Moore said. ``I don't give a damn about
the new year and I don't give a crap about the millennium. You guys
aren't gonna win for us. Who cares? I don't care about the city
right now. I don't care about being here. I don't care about you
all and I don't particularly care to have those cameras in my face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to write about something, write about how I dissed
you guys. Now get the hell out of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the defensive end with the offensive mouth left the
specially marked podium where he was assigned to spend 90 minutes
of interview time and stormed off across the Superdome carpet to
tell various other groups of national reporters, most of whom had
never even met Moore before Friday, that he hates them and their
``little stories,'' too. Oh, and he also hates the BCS formula that
``almost screwed'' Virginia Tech out of its shot at No.1 Florida
State in the national title game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways for a reporter to interpret a performance
like that. One may seriously ponder whether Moore has a reason to
be angry at the media, who merely voted him the Bronko Nagurski
Trophy winner (college football's defensive player of the year) and
the Lombardi Award winner (the nation's top lineman) but stopped
well short of electing him president or pope. Or one may go to the
Virginia Tech media guide for clues to Moore's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, it says under personal interests that Moore likes
watching pro basketball, until recently the domain of dizzy Dennis
Rodman, and PlayStation, the video conduit to an entire universe of
indiscriminate explosions, and pro wrestling, where the actors are
athletes and each angry script is spattered with spittle.
</P>
<P>
   What we've got here is a football player too explosive to be
ignored, the most dominating Hokies defensive end since Bruce
Smith, and yet he revels still in the theatrical role of snarling
underdog. It is a misguided leadership ploy calculated by an
intelligent man who actually graduated from Virginia Tech last May,
who plans to study law, who calls his mother before every game.
</P>
<P>
   It is the logical extension of a sports culture where the most
memorable sound bites have nasty teeth in them and the most honored
coaches are willing to indulge the indiscretions of their
All-Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Corey Moore a great deal,'' Virginia Tech coach
Frank Beamer said Friday when told of his star's illogical
ramblings. ``He's a bright guy. He says what he means and he
believes what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Charley Wiles, the Hokies' defensive line coach, threw a similar
blanket of absolution over anything Moore might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see Corey do that,'' Wiles said of Moore's verbal
implosion. ``He's a first-class kid. But I don't know what he's
feeling. I don't know what kind of pressure he's under. That's kind
of how he gets ready to play. You've got to get yourself ready.
Corey's gonna be right. He's got his game face on.''
</P>
<P>
   If only he can hold that ugly sneer for three more days, the
senior will have his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win, lose or draw,'' said Moore, ``I want to go out with a
bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year? Better smile when you say that, partner.

&HT;     Y2K BUG HAS NO BITE IN THE NEW YEAR _ BUT SOME SLOT MACHINES GO
BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Updating and editing throughout)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of the world rolled into the new century
Friday with only a smattering of Y2K glitches _ the most
significant at a Japanese nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear plant, the Shika Nuclear Power Station about 170
miles northwest of Tokyo, lost its radiation alarm system shortly
after midnight there. John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K
command center, said Japanese officials described the problem as
minor and that the plant would remain in operation.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, slot machines went bonkers in Delaware, as
if to underline the lack of serious problems here. The 150 slot
machines at three Delaware rack tracks temporarily shut down
Thursday night after the slots' time-based computer chips _
programmed to read three days ahead _ became confused when they
rolled over to 2000. The slots were quickly repaired, Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and Thomas Pickering, the No. 2 official at the State
Department, gave upbeat reports all day Friday as the new year
swept across the globe's 24 time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, after the new year had been greeted in Europe, Asia
and Africa, Pickering said there were `no significant Y2K
difficulties there.''
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' Pickering
declared. The biggest problem was the `Mothers' Day phenomenon'' of
telephone circuits being overloaded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. EST Friday _ midnight Greenwich Mean Time _ computers
that control airline traffic, power grids and military operations
appeared to roll over into the new year without incident. The
computers are based on GMT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said. She was
aboard a jet traveling from Washington, D.C. to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate his confidence in the air traffic control system,
Koskinen took a commercial airline flight to New York so that he
was in the air at midnight GMT. After landing safely, he returned
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen cautioned that he wouldn't have a clear picture of any
computer-related problems in the United States until late Monday
after a day of normal business operations following the long
holiday weekend. He said he would withhold any decision about
problems in the developing world until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also appeared confident that the United States would
weather the transition into the New Year with smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never felt that there was any significant chance that
the United States would have would have a major problem in the
infrastructure, either nationally or regionally,'' Koskinen said.
``And I continue to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Russian joint operation center located near Colorado
Springs, Colo., reported no incidents. The center was set up to
protect against any mistaken perceptions that one or the other
nuclear powers had launched a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Koskinen said the Y2K transition was `the biggest
management challenge the world has had in 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that industrialized society moved into the new year
without any problems should not lead to anyone to `underestimate
the nature of the problem that was originally there.''
</P>
<P>
   `Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits
``00'' as 1900 rather than 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Early good news came to the White House center as New Year's eve
slipped past midnight in Western Pacific time zones first. For
example, New Zealand celebrated the arrival of the New Year at 6
a.m. EST. As Japan, Australia and other industrialized nations
joined the '00 honor roll, optimism grew at the White House Y2K
coordination center that years of preparedness were paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, undersecretary of state, reported that the Bilibino
nuclear reactor in the Russian Far East passed into the new year
without incident, a reassuring note because of concern about
Russia's attention to the Y2K issue and its aging nuclear reactors.
Later, he reported that all of Russia's reactors had smoothly
rolled over into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen noted an increase in public interest in the Y2K
phenomenon as Jan. 1 approached. The White House Y2K web site had
about 250,000 hits on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guam was the first U.S. territory to make the transition without
incident; Koskinen said, noting that officials on the island
reported soon after midnight that a baby was born and an airplane
had landed there.

BRUINS IN FREE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins ended 1999 stumbling badly, 2-9-4 in their
last 15 games, and they lost their last two in overtime. So, what's
really going on here? It isn't just a blip on the screen. After an
0-5-4 beginning and now this latest skid, there are some key
factors that can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   --Lack of training camps for key players. Jason Allison, Byron
Dafoe, P.J. Axelsson, and Hal Gill were absent from or late for
camp. In addition, the two players added during the season _ Marty
McSorley and Joe Murphy _ missed about eight months of hockey
before being signed. That's practically half the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check Owen Nolan's stats last year, when he missed training
camp, and this year,'' said coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose forward had 19 goals and 45 points in 78 games last
season. In only 41 games this year, he has 27 goals and 52 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't miss training camp,'' said Burns. ``These are facts.
These are not excuses. I know it's a problem and I know it's a
problem for other teams, too. If you have that many guys miss
training camp, you'd better hang on. It's unfair to the team and
it's unfair to the coach when you miss training camp. I know it's
all contractual stuff. I don't blame the players. A lot of times
it's not the players, it's who is running their lives. If Byron
wouldn't have gotten mad and come in, he'd probably still be out.
(Gill), the poor kid, hasn't been the same because he came in
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said it was painful to watch Gill in the third period of
Thursday's loss in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a left winger but he ends up playing left wing
because he just got out of the penalty box,'' he said. ``We just
killed a penalty for two minutes and he ends up along the boards
trying to get the puck out and he's sitting there like a moose in
the water trying to fight to get the puck out. I almost ran out on
the ice, took the puck, and threw it in the net because I knew it
was going to go in. Sure as Jesus, it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   That tied the game at 4-4 with 5:23 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   --Byron Dafoe. Last season, Dafoe was the MVP of the team, hands
down. This year, he has played very well at times and outstanding a
couple of times (such as in Ottawa), but Dafoe has yet to steal a
game for the Bruins as he's done so many times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think the Leafs are so good?'' asked Burns.
``Curtis Joseph wins how many games for them? Why do you think the
Buffalo Sabres had so much success last year? Dominik Hasek won a
bunch of games for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe agreed that he hasn't yet been the same player he was last
year in terms of dominance. When asked if he felt he'd stolen any
games, Dafoe said, ``No, definitely not the same amount. Maybe the
Phoenix game, but no, Ottawa maybe would've been the closest
second. If you look at it that way, missing six months of hockey
definitely doesn't give you the fresh start of the season and the
exhibition games to get into it. It could be a bit of a factor in
terms of my personal statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   --Penalty killing. Simply put, it stinks. The Bruins were tops
in the league last year. This year, they're dead last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't not bring up Tim Taylor and Dmitri Khristich,'' said
Dafoe. ``I know (president/general manager Harry Sinden) doesn't
want us talking about them because what's done is done, but I'm
telling you, look at our PK last year and they were key players.
Dmitri being able to play center, Tim is a center, we only have one
center on this team. Robbie DiMaio doesn't know how to play center
and he'd be the first to tell you that. People say, `So what,' but
it's what they do in our own end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's confusion. If you look at the goals that are being
scored against us, it's a lot of open men on open sides with open
nets. Why is that? It's missed coverage. Is it someone's fault?
Well, yeah, it is and it isn't. They're not used to their position
and they get confused, but it is their guy and they don't realize
it and that's why we're having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say why are we doing this and we didn't do it last
year, that we're the same team. But it's not the same team. It's
only a couple of guys, but they were key guys. I'm not taking away
from the guys we got to replace them, but you look at our PK, going
from first in the league to worst? That's a huge differential when
you're talking about one-goal hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   --Lack of centermen. Joe Thornton is the only healthy natural
center on the team. Allison can't take draws and everyone is trying
to fill in, with disastrous results.
</P>

   ``Anson Carter's not a center,'' said Burns. ``DiMaio is not a
center. You can only do it one or two games and get away with it.''

   The Bruins play the New Jersey Devils Saturday night and the
club is hoping the new year will be the beginning of a new start.

FEAR OF COMPUTER GLITCH GROUNDS THOUSANDS OF AIR TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airports around the world, ordinarily quiet on New Year's Eve,
were unusually so Friday as thousands of potential travelers stayed
put while the world's air traffic system rolled over to the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite such fears and recent concerns about terrorism,
commercial aviation entered the new year without incident as
midnight passed in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The major test for commercial aviation came at midnight in
London when the global air traffic control system, which observes
Greenwich Mean Time, crossed over into the new year without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,350 commercial jets were in the air at the time,
according to the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's
trade group. That was less than half the number of planes that flew
last New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines around the world canceled thousands of flights because
of low demand.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol, the organization that coordinates air traffic over
Europe, estimated that about 50 jets were in the air at midnight, 5
percent of the peak traffic on a typical winter day.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines and American Airlines, the world's two largest
carriers, said they had canceled about one-third of their flights
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, airports across the United States appeared
desolate. The three New York airports _ Kennedy International,
LaGuardia and Newark _ were expecting to handle only 270,000
passengers Friday, compared with 430,000 on the same day last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many airline executives and aviation officials around the world
had hoped to reassure the public by being passengers themselves on
New Year's Eve. Jane Garvey, chief of the Federal Aviation
Administration, booked herself on several flights that were
subsequently canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, flanked by the head of the FAA's Year 2000
effort, two public affairs officers, Sen. Slade Gorton of
Washington and a score of journalists, she boarded an American
Airlines flight from Washington to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 empty seats available on the jetliner, the only
passenger not directly connected to Ms. Garvey's efforts appeared
to be Janet S. Rhodes of Long Beach, Calif., who said she came to
Washington on Friday so that she could greet the new millennium
aloft and tell her grandchildren about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhodes said she had told her four sons, ``Just follow Jane
Garvey's progress on television and you'll know where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's airlines and air traffic control centers spent an
estimated $2.5 billion to assure that their computers could read
the year 2000 correctly. But experts did not consider air safety to
be particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co., the world's largest producer of commercial
airliners, said it surveyed thousands of airborne systems on its
planes and found only three that were date sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many passengers said they were not taking any
chances by being in the air at the witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will probably be OK, but I'm trying to get home
before midnight,'' said Del Turner, who was waiting for a flight at
Los Angeles International Airport. ``Something will happen. They
haven't fixed everything.''

COLORADO RAMBLES OVER BC, 62-28 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Boston College's first bowl game in five years
began ominously enough when the University of Colorado's mascot, a
buffalo called Ralphie IV, was released from her holding pen at the
south end of Arizona Stadium and taken by her handlers for a romp
around the field just before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forecast of the stampede that followed.
</P>
<P>
   After earning their first postseason berth since the 1994 Aloha
Bowl, the Eagles arrived in Tucson _ by United Parcel Service
charter flight, no less _ ranked 25th in the Associated Press poll
and installed as 8-point underdogs. But BC wound up spread eagle
after getting flattened by the Buffaloes, 62-28, in Friday's
Insight.com Bowl before an announced crowd of 35,662.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this was a very disappointing end to a great season,''
said BC coach Tom O'Brien. ``As I said before, if we couldn't
contain their speed, then we'd have a lot of trouble, and we did.
We didn't tackle well, we turned the ball over on offense, which
you can't do against a good football team, we had breakdowns in the
kicking game. It was a bad game all around and in all phases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take responsibility because I didn't do a good
enough job in getting this football team ready to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles managed just 255 total yards (96 rushing) and
struggled to mount any offense after Colorado scored on its first
two possessions to take a 14-0 lead on a 10-yard run by sophomore
running back Cortlen Johnson _ who was selected offensive and
overall MVP with 15 carries for 201 yards and a pair of touchdowns
_ and a 2-yard keeper by quarterback Mike Moschetti (14 of 24, 149
yards).
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes, playing to remove the lingering aftertaste of a
bitter 33-30 overtime loss against Nebraska in their regular-season
finale Nov. 26, established eight school bowl records _ six by
halftime _ in delivering coach Gary Barnett his first bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably our most dominant performance,'' said Barnett.
``But as dominant as we were, I know this was a bad day for Boston
College, so I don't want to harp too much on our dominance, but I
know how things can happen to you like what happened to them today.
Things like that happen sometimes, but we played pretty well, we
played consistently, and had a pretty good game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   BC, whose senior-laden defense had been hit by a flu bug that
caused six of 11 starters to miss practice time this week, allowed
the most points in school history, and surrendered 523 total yards,
including 365 rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck also struggled, completing 13
of 32 passes for 146 yards, and wound up getting victimized when
Colorado linebacker Jashon Sykes stepped in front of a screen pass
intended for Cedric Washington and returned it 29 yards for a
touchdown for a 21-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the play that just took the wind out of their
sails,'' said Johnson, who did his best to do the same by pacing
Colorado's offensive assault. ``It was just a bad game all around
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And it only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   With 11:41 remaining in the second quarter, redshirt freshman
quarterback Brian St. Pierre came on in relief of Hasselbeck for a
series and proceeded to expand Colorado's lead to 28-0, throwing an
interception on his second attempt that was returned 21 yards by
safety Rashidi Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Kelly, Colorado's outstanding junior cornerback and return
man, dealt the Eagles another blow when he fielded a booming
55-yard punt by Kevin McMyler and returned it 88 yards to give the
Buffaloes a commanding 35-0 lead with 8:50 remaining before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   BC senior strong safety George White finally put the Eagles on
the board when he intercepted Moschetti and brought it back 78
yards for a touchdown, but White scored no style points with
O'Brien when he did a swan dive into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping that it would be a jump-start for the
team,'' White said. ``I just did what I could to help the team get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was it wasn't enough as Colorado kept up the
offensive pressure, getting a 2-yard TD run by Johnson and a
26-yard Jeremy Aldrich field goalfor a 45-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, we challenged the guys that the rankings were out
of our control,'' Barnett said. ``But we had a little sign in our
room with a `1999' and `Final Rankings' and a question mark by it.
We knew this was our only chance to get that question mark changed
to a number.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Buffaloes succeeded in doing so by
continuing the onslaught in the second half. After Aldrich
converted a 21-yard field goal to make it 48-17, BC's Bryan Arndt
recovered a William Green fumble in the end zone to cut the deficit
to 48-14. But Roman Hollowell tallied on an 18-yard lateral and
backup quarterback Zac Colvin converted on a 4-yard keeper to make
it 62-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles scored twice in the final 7:37 as Hasselbeck hit
Jamal Burke with a 1-yard TD toss that capped a tortuous 18-play,
72-yard drive, and on Doug Bessette's 9-yard return of a Ralph
Parent blocked punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to everybody in their conference and they said they
were the most talented team and the fastest team in the (Big 12),''
O'Brien said. ``We knew coming in as a coaching staff that we'd
have some problems, but obviously I didn't get that across to these
kids.''

'00 COMPUTER GLITCHES ARE MOSTLY A NO-SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a few sputters and glitches, the world's computers
appear to have survived the Year 2000 rollover without major
problems _ and with humanity's faith in technology intact, at least
for another day.
</P>
<P>
   As clocks passed midnight around the world, there were a flurry
of reports of minor problems: ticketing machines on some buses in
Australia jammed, and computers in a few government offices in
rural Japan crashed when the date 2000 was typed in, for example.
</P>
<P>
   What technology failures occurred were more likely to be the
result of crowding _ circuits jammed when too many people tried to
make cellular phone calls in Japan, New Zealand and elsewhere _
than attributable to computer software that could not fathom the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the day arrived without the kind of catastrophic problems
once feared, like widespread power failures or planes crashing. The
computers of the U.S. power grid and air-traffic control system
rolled over to the New Year just past 7 p.m. Eastern time, which is
midnight Greenwich Mean Time, and things went without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt there was any significant chance the United
States would have any problem in its infrastructure,'' said John A.
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion. But he cautioned against complacency in the United
States and around the world. ``There are likely to be some glitches
along the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real test, experts say, will come in the days and weeks
ahead as people return to work, as factories, offices and stores
begin normal operations. ``To look at midnight as the main event
would be a mistake,'' said David Cassano, general manager of IBM's
Year 2000 program. ``We'll really start to find out where we stand
in the first weeks of January as businesses run their systems for
the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, expectations about the severity of the Year 2000 problem
have been scaled back sharply in recent months. The prospect of
computer failures cascading destructively across the world economy
was taken as a serious threat not long ago. But most analysts now
regard such warnings as exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, computer specialists are now watching mainly for a rash
of small, but fixable, glitches in computer programs related to the
Year 2000 problem. These problems, most analysts say, should amount
to an economic headache, not a serious illness _ though there are a
few analysts who say that a recession early this year is still
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet around the world, fears about Y2K, as the computer problem
is known, were the exception. As he withdrew a few hundred dollars
from an automated teller machine in Rome on Friday, Federico
Pacifici, 44, said: ``I have faith in technology. I don't think
normal people will have any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the reaction was not quite so relaxed, but there was
no evidence of Year 2000 panic. Strolling through Tokyo's Ginza
district last night, Masao Ito, 66, observed, ``I was a bit worried
about Y2K, but I didn't think it would be a lasting problem, so I
wasn't terribly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are accustomed to stockpiling basic goods as a
precaution against earthquakes, and the government had recommended
that citizens have extra goods on hand in case of Year 2000
breakdowns. Masato Takahashi, a student, said he had put away
enough water and food for a week. ``I'm not expecting anything
major,'' he said. ``I just thought there might be some problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the isolated cases of panicky reactions, the explanation
seemed more cultural than technological. In rural Thailand, for
example, the government said farmers and villagers had been
withdrawing cash from banks and clearing out food markets because
of Year 2000 fears. ``It doesn't make sense,'' said Kitti
Patpongpaibul, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand. ``Almost
none of these people own credit cards or computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Astrologers in the Thai countryside have apparently been
spreading dire Year 2000 predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, the more common sentiment seemed to be that of
Spaniards. Surveys have found that Spaniards are largely
unconcerned by the computer problem, known as ``Effecto 2000'' in
Spain, and 90 percent said they had made no special preparations.
``There's been no panic buying here,'' said Carlos Lizana, the
manager of a Supersol supermarket in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   If the economic fallout is minimal from the Year 2000 problem,
it will be largely because many governments and corporations
eventually listened to the dire warnings of Year 2000 readiness
advocates. And they invested more than $250 billion worldwide in
finding and fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government alone spent $8.4 billion to fix the glitches
in the computers that handle everything from sending out Social
Security checks to tracking airplanes with the Federal Aviation
Administration's air-traffic control system. The government's
efforts accelerated sharply after Koskinen became the head of the
administration's Year 2000 program in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Companies may have been slow to start _ an estimated 90 percent
of corporate fix-it spending has occurred since 1997 _ but once
they began they invested heavily to tackle their Year 2000
problems. Citigroup, for example, spent roughly $950 million to get
its banks, securities trading desks and insurance operations ready
for the Year 2000 rollover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been massive investments made to address the Y2K
issue and those investments will mean that the most severe problems
should be avoided,'' said Lou Marcoccio, the Year 2000 research
director for the Gartner Group, a computer consulting and market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem has proved so costly to try to fix because
it has been a painstaking task for thousands of people worldwide,
searching through billions of lines of programming code, much of it
decades old. The problem dates back to before the 1960s. Back then,
storage space on disks was scarce and costly, so programmers
routinely omitted the first two digits in year dates. The danger is
that computers will fail to interpret the ``00'' date as 2000, and
shut off or malfunction.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Around the world, the Year 2000 rollover has meant that much of
the computer industry is on around-the-clock duty, watching for
problems and ready to fix ones that do crop up. It was a quiet
watch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   From her desk in Hewlett-Packard's Year 2000 center in Palo
Alto, Calif., Kathy Hahn filed her first status report at 3:45 a.m.
Like the reports she filed afterward, it was a green light: The
company's field office in Auckland, New Zealand, reported that
there were no apparent problems plaguing the company's computer
systems at night.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Hahn, director of Hewlett-Packard's Year 2000 planning,
Friday's lack of problems were a rewarding finish to nearly three
years of hard work in preparation. ``It feels like I've been
pregnant for two and a half years,'' she said. ``I'm feeling a
great sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, a leading Wall Street economist, said it was
much too early to relax about the Year 2000 problem. Yet even he is
revising his earlier dark warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Yardeni warned that the computer problem
could be the catalyst for a recession as severe as the 1974-75
downturn in the aftermath of the first oil shock. But he has done
some rethinking recently. ``It's certainly not going to be as bad
as I thought it would be,'' said Yardeni, chief economist of
Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni still thinks it is likely there will be a recession in
the first half of 2000 but says it will be a brief, shallow
economic dip.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts do not go that far, but they caution against
being too encouraged by the first-day reports. ``The real test is
coming in the days and weeks ahead, and I think there is a good
chance the world's going to have a digital hangover for the three
to six months,'' said Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, who
has testified before Congress on the Year 2000 issue.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Tech Stocks Uncork Champagne Year  
 By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Unless you spent the past 12 months in a cave waiting for Y2K to
run its course, you already know the two words that were sweet
music to Wall Street in 1999: tech stocks.
<P>
   ``All of the gains in the major indexes were produced by
technology stocks,'' said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at
Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. ``You take them away, and the
market was basically flat.''
</P>
<P>
   No index benefited more from the trend than the tech-heavy
Nasdaq composite index, which soared an additional 32.44 points to
a record close of 4,069.31 yesterday, bringing its gain for the
year to 85.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This surpassed the previous annual record gain for a leading
index _ an 81.7 percent rise posted by the Dow Jones industrial
average way back in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow turned in a respectable performance in '99, but nowhere
near the Nasdaq's stratospheric ascent. The benchmark index
advanced 25.2 percent, to 11,497.12, for the year, including a
44.26 point gain yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 brought up the rear with a more modest 19.5- &LR; 
percent gain for the year. It climbed 4.78 points yesterday to a
record 1,469.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news of strong earnings more than offset the bad news
of rising interest rates,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bay Area's tech leaders, database softwaremaker Oracle
Corp. was typical of those posting white-hot results. The Redwood
Shores company blew by analysts' estimates last month with
quarterly profit of $384 million (26 cents per share).
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Oracle's stock handsomely rewarded investors,
emerging in the fall from months of doldrums to more than triple to
$112.06. But despite its impressive showing, Oracle wasn't among
the Bay Area's pacesetters when it came to annual percentage gains.
</P>
<P>
   According to data on 370 local firms compiled by San Francisco's
Davis Skaggs Investment Management, a subsidiary of Salomon Smith
Barney, the shares covering the most ground belonged to San Jose's
Puma Technology, a provider of mobile computing systems. The
company's stock jumped more than 3,770 percent during the past 12
months to finish at $130.63.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 370 Bay Area companies saw their stocks rise by a
weighted average of 197 percent for the year, including an average
74 percent gain in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skyrocketing over the broad S&AMP;P 500 market by 10 times and
even dwarfing the high-flying Nasdaq, the Bay Area stocks are in
the stratosphere,'' said Paul Tiao, vice president of Davis Skaggs.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies, not surprisingly, thoroughly overwhelmed their
analog cousins in terms of local stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Puma in the top 10 were Redwood City's Broadvision (up
1,494 percent for the year), Los Gatos' Metricom (1,416 percent),
Mountain View's Verisign (1,190 percent), San Jose's BEA Systems
(1,042 percent), Santa Rosa's Optical Coating Lab (1,038 percent),
Santa Clara's Exodus Communications (1,006 percent), San Jose's SDL
(1,000 percent), Milpitas' Network Peripherals (950 percent) and
Sunnyvale's Harmonic (913 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Silicon Valley's domination of the Bay Area rankings is
so complete that you have to travel all the way down the list to
No. 96 _ import retailer Cost Plus _ to come across a company not
involved in one way or another with tech, telecom or biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   (Oakland's Cost Plus saw its stock rise 155 percent in '99,
proving that wicker furniture and Indonesian knickknacks still have
their place in a world of routers, servers and broadband
connections.)
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, while the Internet figures prominently in the
operations of most local companies on the Davis Skaggs list, you
don't come across a pure Internet play until No.42 _ San
Francisco's Cnet, which saw its share price rise by 326 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Yahoo placed No.56 with a 265 percent advance,
while San Mateo's Inktomi was No.86 with a 174 percent increase and
Menlo Park's E-Trade Group came in No.124 with a 123 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Among softwaremakers, Oracle was No.48 with a 290- &LR;  percent
rise, Mountain View's Intuit No.101 with a 148 percent increase and
Emeryville's Sybase No.113 with a 130 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the better-known, and widely held, tech powerhouses took
a back seat to newer arrivals on the list. Palo Alto's Sun
Microsystems finished the year at No.58 with a 262 percent rise,
while San Jose's Cisco Systems was No.112 with a 131 percent
increase and Santa Clara's Intel Corp. ended all the way down in
the No.191 spot with a 39 percent advance.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale's Cardiac Pathways Corp., a maker of heart diagnostic
products, was at the very bottom of the list, with its stock down
82 percent for the year. The company is still awaiting approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a system that uses
ultrasound technology to treat heart abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, taking a longer and broader view, it's clear that
tech stocks were the engine driving Wall Street's advance through
the entire decade. In terms of percentage gain, no one topped
mighty Cisco, which has risen about 125,000 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was a distant second with a more than 81,000
percent gain, followed by Dell Computer Corp. (up more than 72,000
percent), data-storage dynamo EMC Corp. (68,000 percent) and
Internet investment firm CMGI (57,000 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech will continue to lead the way in 2000,'' said Allan
Roness, research director at JW Genesis Securities in Boca Raton,
Fla. ``But some will powder out, and some others will become
leaders again.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to crawl out on a limb with specific predictions.
However, Roness noted that ``there was a ton of IPOs that won't be
profitable anytime soon. There are e-tailers who don't understand
the costs of doing business on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   As for IPOs, while it's not yet clear how much 1999's crop
contributed to the Nasdaq's massive run-up, they certainly had an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg News, about 70 IPOs nationwide
subsequently appreciated from their offer price by at least 500
percent, 40 climbed by at least 700 percent and no fewer than 30
new share offerings soared by more than 1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While United Parcel Service won the blue ribbon for money raised
in '99, walking off with a cool $5.5 billion, VA Linux Systems
shattered all records for first-day gains, skyrocketing almost 700
percent in its trading debut.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bay Area companies, Redwood City's Liberate Technologies,
a developer of software for bringing Internet content to TV set-top
boxes and other appliances, set the pace for IPO gains, surging
1,161 percent since arriving on the market at an initial $16 in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Prudential Securities' influential technical
analyst Ralph Acampora said he expects the Nasdaq to top 5,000 this
year _ a forecast that, in light of the index's recent advances,
doesn't seem like such a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the Dow moving as high as 14,000, and the S&AMP;P 500
cruising as high as 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   Another closely watched analyst, Goldman Sachs' Abby Joseph
Cohen, said she envisions the Dow hitting 12,300 by year's end and
the S&AMP;P 500 reaching 1,525. These numbers jibe with most other
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's going to continue to pour into the market,'' said
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum and Co.
in Kansas City. ``This will keep growth-fund portfolio managers
fully employed.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects the market's tech leaders in 1999 to remain out front
in 2000. Among Belski's top picks are Cisco, Microsoft Corp.,
Lucent Technologies, Oracle and Dell.
</P>
<P>
   First Albany's Johnson likes these stocks as well but is finding
that the higher they go, the less comfortable he feels about their
valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own Oracle, I own Cisco,'' he observed. ``But I have to ask
myself why I'm not having more fun. The answer is because the
market has not been entirely rational over the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an understatement. With the Nasdaq setting no fewer than
61 records in 1999, ``rational'' is probably the last word that
comes to mind in describing the market's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get a return in the double digits, you're taking
a fair amount of risk to get there,'' said Steve Adams, managing
director of First Security Van Kasper in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we'll see some of these crazy valuations calm down in
2000,'' he said. ``Historically, all bubbles pop. There's no
rationale for the current run-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts foresee the gravy train continuing. ``The
general expectation in early 1999 was that the U.S. economy would
slow down,'' noted Stein Roe's Kugel. ``Things ended up being
better than expected, and that set the tone for the market.''
</P>
<P>
   As for 2000, he said it doesn't look like an economic downturn
is likely. ``If anything,'' Kugel said, ``economic growth worldwide
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq 6,000, anyone?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although it had seen many huge crowds over the
years, for inaugurations, Fourth of July fireworks, protests and
parades, never in memory had the Mall in the nation's capital drawn
multitudes for New Year's. But on this mild winter night with a
lovely sunset, people here thronged to the Mall for a long-planned
celebration on the last New Year's Eve of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very friendly crowd,'' Sgt. Frank R. Onolfi of the
U.S.Park Police said as afternoon turned to evening. He knows
something about crowds, having attended five presidential
inaugurations and various other capital gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Other police officers agreed that the crowd was friendly and, at
least early in the evening, virtually free of troublemakers. As the
throng grew by the minute, the party horns and noisemakers became
louder, but hardly a vulgarity was heard.
</P>
<P>
   The partygoers spoke in many languages and accents, befitting a
cosmopolitan city and a changing America. The celebration drew
people from all over the country and from Washington itself. People
who live in the District tend to be blase about motorcades and
potentates and ceremonies, but many Washingtonians thought Friday
night's event was something they could not miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally stay home on New Year's, but we had to see the
millennium celebration,'' Thea Anderson said. She and her husband,
Clarence, who have lived in the District for 27 years, were at
first a little nervous about venturing out, given the talk of
danger, however remote. But in the end, they took the Metro
downtown and were glad they did.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and Jane Wilson of Greenville, S.C., arrived Friday
morning, early enough to get close to President Clinton at an event
before midday. Mrs. Wilson was delighted to get pictures of the
president, and the couple were pleased with the crowd-control
measures, which they found efficient without being oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so laid-back,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ``There's no
pushing or shoving.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of Friday made the Wilsons feel at home again, in a
sense. They were out of the country for several years _ she travels
a lot for business _ and their return has not been altogether
pleasant. They said they had noticed heightened suspicions at
airports and other gathering places, and she has had to explain why
she has been to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Many people at the Mall Friday night wore party hats. One
merchandise tent offered ``millennium celebration'' certificates.
An entrepreneur hawked T-shirts labeled, ``I survived Y2K.'' The
going rate was $5.
</P>
<P>
   For a relative few, the evening called for tuxedos and formal
gowns _ proper attire for the White House Millennium Dinner, where
the first family greeted guests before leaving for fireworks
festivities on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Joggers threaded their way nonchalantly through the Mall
celebrators. There was lots of room, the Mall being one of the
jewels that make this a pedestrian-friendly city.
</P>
<P>
   For all the anticipation, some people were just not getting it.
Connie Liang brought her children _ one 18-months-old, the other
3-years-old. ``My children are too young to remember this,'' she
said, ``but at least they will be able to say they were here.''

GROZNY: A FEW HOLIDAY TOKENS IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fighting still rages in Grozny, but the soldiers there made a
few bows to the holiday, and seemed oblivious to the political
earthquake of President Boris Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital's mess tent, cooks prepared a special holiday
dinner. One soldier, a woman, dragged a yolka, a Russian holiday
tree, past a row of corpses and toward a complex of tents.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of a nearby armored unit received a small plastic bag
filled with cheap cologne, a plastic pen and ``Dear Soldier''
letters from Russian schoolchildren, like one from Andrei Malakhov,
a seven-year-old boy from Yefremov, a small town south of Moscow,
who said he hoped all the Russian soldiers would come home alive.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, they had already broken open several bottles
of vodka and were feasting on bread and pickled cabbage. They had
set up camp in a series of trenches that separatist rebels had
occupied just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, who gave only his first name, Aleksandr, said the
``terrorists'' in Chechnya would be finished off within six months.

 &HT;    THIRD MILLENNIUM COMES TO BRITAIN: It's Zulu Time!
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The new millennium arrived in London with the familiar
midnight toll of Big Ben followed by 20 minutes of thundering,
dazzling bursts of multi-colored fireworks reflected in the rushing
currents of the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, Queen Elizabeth II marked the millennium with a
glass of champagne and very circumspect peck on the cheek for her
husband, Prince Philip. The royal couple linked arms with Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, to sing ''Auld Lang
Syne.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the much-anticipated climax of years of planning intended
to make London the center of the worldwide millennium celebrations.
By all early indicators, it was a rousing success _ or as rousing a
success as such a celebration can be given its tendency to attract
hundreds of thousands of alcohol-soused revelers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, police reported few extraordinary incidents during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night in which Britain confronted its past and present
by saying good-bye to a century that has engulfed ``the empire'' in
two devastating wars and forced it to relinquish its colonial
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning hours of the 20th Century, the BBC Concert
Orchestra played a rousing ``Rule, Britannia!'' for the final time
of the age in Royal Albert Hall. The 6,000 concert goers _ some in
tuxedos some in jeans _ stood and sang jubilantly while waving
British flags.
</P>
<P>
   The song holds a far different resonance at the end of a century
that has seen the dissolution of one of the world's great empires.
As it enters the 21st Century, Britain faces the real prospect of
being reduced to only England with Scotland, Northern Ireland and
Wales now enjoying a measure of independence.
</P>
<P>
   But for Edgar Robertson who had come to the Albert Hall concert
with his family from Birmingham _ the one in England _ the night
and century seemed full of promise. ``There isn't an empire anymore
at the end of this century, but Britain remains such an important
force in the world,'' he said. ``Could anybody really imagine a day
when you would see American troops heading into some hot spot
without their British cousins at their sides? But this will be
America's millennium, won't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the elegant confines of Albert Hall, the night took on a
substantially less refined air. On The Mall, the broad ceremonial
boulevard that terminates at Buckingham palace, a carnival of
stomach-churning rides formed a fairway that would rival any
American state fair.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds jammed the city's ancient thoroughfares and squares. Much
of the central city was converted into a pedestrian zone.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:30 p.m. (GMT), Admiral Nelson's column rose from a solid
mass of human bodies crammed into Trafalgar Square. Dominating the
skyline near Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament was the one
annoying glitch: the stunning, five-story London Eye. The
state-of-the-art Ferris wheel was idle because it failed a safety
test earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, none of the dreaded snags expected with the feared
``Millennium Bug'' appeared. So pleased was the government with the
country's success at avoiding Y2K pitfalls, that it issued a
statement before midnight declaring that all was running without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic visual scene was the Thames River, its swift
currents lit by dozens of spotlights and laser beams to be the
``river of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before midnight, the queen sailed down the Thames, the
center of festivities, to light a huge millennium beacon afloat on
a barge. A dozen smaller beacons blazed on bridges, and hundreds of
thousands of people gathered along the riverbanks in the center of
the capital to watch a 120-foot wall of flame race across the
water's surface at the moment the century turned.
</P>
<P>
   That was the cue to light 40,000 fireworks waiting on barges
moored along the river.
</P>
<P>
   In typical British fashion, the crowds eventually were dispersed
by perhaps the most English of all methods _ the rain. A cold
drizzle began to fall shortly after midnight sending the partygoers
capable of deliberate movement to seek refuge and head home.

FUTURE THREATENS A PLACE WITHOUT CALENDARS

   EKAMBU, Namibia _ The red sun was falling, the cooking fires
were burning and the village elder's naked shoulders were shivering
in the afternoon cool as he described the eagerly awaited arrival
of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the thunderstorms start and the leaves grow from the
ground, that's how we know it's the new year,'' said Maverihepisa
Koruhama, wrinkling his brow as he tried to calculate the
auspicious date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' he said finally, ``the new year came about one
month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in this tiny village of mud huts and wildflowers, in the
craggy, arid hills of northwest Namibia, there are no calendars, no
electricity and no words in the native language for millennium,
computer or Y2K. A telephone is a three-hour drive away.
</P>
<P>
   As the modern world celebrated the coming of 2000 with confetti
and champagne, the Himba people started and ended their day much as
they have for nearly 300 years, whistling to their goats, milking
their cows and sleeping with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   These nomadic shepherds in this remote corner of the world stand
as living links between the old world and the new, walking proudly
with their age-old traditions into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   They measure time by the shifting sun and mark the coming of the
new year with the arrival of seasonal rains that transform the
parched red soil here into a carpet of green. (In their Herero
language, the word for ``day'' is the same as the word for ``sun,''
and the word for ``year'' literally means ``rain.'')
</P>
<P>
   Koruhama said his family had never heard of the year 2000 or the
year 1999, for that matter, since the Himba do not use numbers to
count years. But he watched proudly Friday as his young sons chased
wayward cattle and his three wives soured milk for butter as their
ancestors did when they came to this region centuries ago from what
is now Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a day like any other,'' said Koruhama, amused by a
foreign visitor's questions. ``My father and my grandfathers, they
were surviving from goats and cattle. That is what I am doing
today. And I am teaching my children to look after cattle. That is
our way. That is our future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges confronting the estimated 7,000 to 10,000
Himba who hope to carry the old ways into the future are great.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the modern world is beginning to touch isolated
villages like this one in the region known as Kaokoland, where the
huts in the hills are accessible only by foot or by vehicles with
four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Himba have begun to send some of their children far away to
school, and some come home wearing Reebok baseball caps along with
their traditional loincloths. In some places, shepherds trade goats
for bright yellow tarpaulins to protect their mud roofs from leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Himba have left their villages altogether, turning their
backs on the ways of their community, where bare-breasted women
still stain their skin with glossy red ochre and men still cover
their long hair in turban-like wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my extended family, they've left and gone to the
towns,'' said Kamukazona Koruhama, Koruhama's sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They change the way they dress, the way they look,'' she said
sadly. ``They don't come back. It's many, many Himba people living
now in towns. People are asking: ``Why do they leave? Why do they
move to the place that belongs to other people? Why don't they come
back?'''
</P>
<P>
   For the family of Koruhama, it is difficult to understand. They
cannot understand the appeal of the western way of life. People in
town often forget the old ways, they warn their children.
</P>
<P>
   Will they remember that the boiled root of the sour plum tree
cures diarrhea, their parents ask. Or that the mopane tree makes
the best firewood? Or that one cannot communicate with the
ancestors without the sacred fire that burns in every village?
</P>
<P>
   ``Move to town?'' repeated Koruhama, scoffing at the idea that
his children might someday leave his village. ``That doesn't make
any sense. Goats are afraid of cars. How will the goats live in
town with all the cars down there?''
</P>
<P>
   But change is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The Namibian government is determined to develop their remote
region, starting with a $550 million dam on the border with Angola
that would flood the grazing grounds of 1,000 people and 100
ancestral graves while providing the country with much-needed
power.
</P>
<P>
   The project _ still in the planning stages _ would bring
thousands of workers to Kaoakoland, and with them the benefits of
electricity, roads and clinics as well as the problems of
prostitution and AIDS, government officials acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the only region in Namibia that is completely in
darkness, no roads, no infrastructure, nothing,'' said Paulinus
Shilamba, director of energy for the Ministry of Mines and Energy
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project will change the whole face of that region,''
Shilamba said. ``The present culture of the Himba people will
gradually disappear. The Himba will change. They will get cars, get
jobs and go to school like everyone else. In my mind, that's
better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the Himba are battling the plan, saying it would
irreparably damage what is regarded as one of southern Africa's
most successful, self-sufficient tribes.
</P>
<P>
   But Zepauandoui Tjambiru Koruhama, another of Koruhama's
sisters-in-law who lives nearby, believe some change is good.
</P>
<P>
   She is a traditional wife. She covers her body with ochre and
butterfat every morning and prays to her ancestors. She wears a
conch shell around her neck and calf-skins to cover her hips. She
knows her year of birth by its proper name, based on its most
significant event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in the year of my great-grandfather's death,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She has never heard of New York or America and has no idea who
won this country's presidential election, which was held last
month. She has eight children and many more cows to manage. Her
life is full.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also very hard, and she does not romanticize it.
</P>
<P>
   During the dry season, when water is scarce, her family moves as
many as 10 times, searching for grass for the cattle to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the rainy season, the soil is often too dry to grow
corn or other vegetables, and her family must often subsist on
milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are hard ways, the same hard ways of my grandmothers,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she and her husband decided to compromise. One son would tend
the sheep in the traditional fashion. Another boy would go to
school, to learn English and modern ways. And every year now, her
husband trades three goats to cover the annual school fees.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the boy, Aaron, was at home from school on break,
wearing an Adidas jacket and faded Puma sneakers. He is about 17
(most Himba do not know their exact ages), and he knows all about
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, he says, he hopes to get a job, buy a car, help his
family. He says he will make his life in a city somewhere, not
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get money to help my mother and father, to buy food,
to buy blankets for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother listens to him quietly and then sends him off to tend
the cattle. She prays he will work for a while and then return home
to his traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says now these new ways are so beautiful, but I hope
someday he will realize it's not the best way,'' she said, sighing.
``But I can't see the future. Only the ancestors know what the new
rains will bring.''

MEMORIES THAT STING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ The score was not the worst part, and frankly, the
score is never what hurts most in games like this. It just looks
that way when you're watching on television.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with basic cable service could have watched Colorado
score 62 points on Boston College. Knowing that millions of people
watched you on your worst day of the year can easily extend a bad
afternoon to a bad month. But that's not what the BC players were
thinking about after they lost the Insight.com Bowl to the
Buffaloes, 62-28.
</P>
<P>
   Really, what hurts most for players are the scenes their fans
don't see on TV.
</P>
<P>
   What makes you angry _ and what hurts _ is when you're standing
on the Arizona Stadium sideline late in the fourth quarter and look
across at the Colorado players. If you look near the 25-yard line,
you can see two defensive linemen, Sean Jarne and Jesse Warren,
laughing and posing for a photo. During the game. You never forget
things like that.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes rewrote eight of this game's records and had set
six by halftime. But that didn't hurt as much as having to walk
back to your locker room afterward, only to be met by several boxes
of pizza and disappointed teammates (some of whom you'll never play
with again). Your friends tell you that they understand how you
feel, but they really don't if they weren't here experiencing
everything with you. And that includes the New Year's Eve party at
the team hotel, the party that was not as fun as it could have
been.
</P>
<P>
   You don't forget things like that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in Iowa and Indiana and Georgia, a bored
channel-surfer flicked to this game, laughed at the lopsided score,
passed out shortly after the ball dropped on 2000, and couldn't
remember this morning who won and where the game was played. But BC
senior Chris Hovan, who will most likely be a first-round draft
pick in the spring, will be able to recite all the details 10 or 20
years from now. He may win a Super Bowl some day, but he'll never
forget this one.
</P>
<P>
   So, I guess if you were watching on TV it would be easy to laugh
at these guys. They dropped passes, missed tackles, and always
appeared to be chasing Olympic sprinter Maurice Greene even though
they were actually running after guys named Cortlen Johnson and
Mike ``Machete'' Moschetti. If they wanted they could make a
documentary on the weirdness of time, how everything can go wrong
in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   There were two interceptions returned for touchdowns, one each
thrown by Matt Hasselbeck and Brian St. Pierre. As one of those
touchdowns was unfolding, a BC cheerleader sprained an ankle. There
was a punt returned 88 yards for a touchdown. There were the 62
points, the most allowed in BC history. There was rain here for the
first time since September. There was the strange dynamic of not
seeing many people in the stands (announced attendance was 35,762)
but knowing that anybody in the country could be watching. Even
after all the penalties and turnovers were coming to a close, the
Spirit of Unlikeliness reached outside the stadium when the person
delivering pizza to the BC locker room momentarily lost her sense
of direction.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much Colorado speed. ``I think Virginia Tech
probably is the fastest team we've played all year,'' Hasselbeck
said, ``but Colorado's defensive backs . . . those guys can fly.''
There was also miscommunication. BC coach Tom O'Brien said he
obviously didn't get his message across to his players and took
responsibility for the loss. Hasselbeck tossed another interception
when he threw to one area and Carlton Rowe turned in the other
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing all of that, it was almost impossible to make fun of the
huge target. Before the season, the Eagles didn't expect to be here
and there was a good reason for that: They willed themselves here
with good fortune moreso than extraordinary talent. They struggled
with Northeastern, Baylor, and Navy. They lost to an unofficial
Division 2 team, Temple. The truth? The 8-4 Eagles aren't quite at
the level of the Buffaloes, despite Colorado's 7-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll say that,'' Hovan said. ``I'll just say
they were better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan said he was just as disappointed as his teammates, but
``I'm not going to throw any chairs or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes spent most of the week looking disinterested. They
would have gone to a more prestigious bowl if they could have
defeated Nebraska Nov. 26, but they lost in overtime. It must have
been clear to any Eagle that the Colorado players didn't have a lot
of respect for their work. Colorado borders Arizona, yet BC sold
more tickets to the game. So, yes, BC wanted to smash this team,
although the opposite happened.
</P>
<P>
   As Hovan said, losses like this don't make you throw chairs.
There are players on this team who have had more devastating things
happen to them than losing a football game on national TV. But if
you are an actor, ballerina, or engineer, you understand how hard
it is to forget your worst day.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with the athletes from BC, especially those like Rowe
and Hovan and Pedro Cirino, who have played their final games at
the Heights. The score? It doesn't hurt as much as you might think.
Memories can imprison you sometimes, and it's the memories that
sting.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital looked more like Hollywood on
New Year's eve as President Clinton tapped his long list of
celebrity friends to help him usher in the New Year with a glitzy
White House dinner followed by a Millennium extravaganza on the
National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 guests descended upon the White House for the
``Creator's Dinner,'' which honored America's artists, inventors,
scientists and scholars. Among the guests were Muhammad Ali,
Elizabeth Taylor and Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the guests, the president toasted the crowd and
praised America's ``endless capacity to express freedom and
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot help but think how different America is, how
different history is and how much better because of those of you in
this room and those you represent were able to imagine, to invent,
to inspire,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guests were seated outside in a heated tent in the
Rose Garden, a comfortable shelter with outside temperatures at
dusk in the balmy mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   Only a select 320 people held invitations to sit with the
president and first lady in the East Room and State Dining Room
inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among those chosen to sit down with the Clintons were Ali,
Taylor, De Niro, opera divas Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle,
historian Arthur Schlesinger, poet Rita Dove, concert violinist
Itzhak Perlman, playwright Neil Simon, and actors Jack Nicholson
and Mary Tyler Moore. The tables, draped with velvet tablecloths,
were set with white china with a silver _ that's real silver _
band. In the middle of each table was a solid silver bowl filled
with white Phalenopsis orchids, white roses, white sparkle holly
and crystal balls. Adorning each silver bowl was a silver
candlestick with white tapers.
</P>
<P>
   Waited on by 160 butlers, diners feasted on beluga caviar,
lobster, foie gras and oyster velout, served with Sterling
Chardonnay, before moving on to the main course of truffle
marinated rack of lamb, roasted artichoke and pepper rogo't and
crispy garlic polenta served with Dehlinger Pinot Noir. The dinner
ended with a chocolate and champagne delight, served with Iron
Horse Brut champagne.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the president gave a short speech about the past
and the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``By far my most solemn prayer for this new millennium is that
we will find somehow the strength and wisdom in our hearts to keep
growing together, first as one America and then as one people on
this ever smaller planet we all call home,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and their guests then traveled via shuttle vans to
the Lincoln Memorial for the splashy, 3-hour ``America's Millennium
Gala,'' a program hosted by rapper Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment on the Mall also included Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Trisha Yearwood, Sam
Waterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell, accompanied by the
25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''In the final
half-hour of 1999, large projection screens erected beside the
Lincoln Memorial were scheduled to show an 18-minute millennial
movie, ``The Unfinished Journey'' by Steven Spielberg.At the end of
the movie, the president planned to speak briefly and then start
the evening's pyrotechnic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   With just 20 seconds left before midnight, Clinton was to light
a fuse that would burn its way along the length of the reflecting
pool, ending at the base of the Washington Monument, now surrounded
by an elaborate scaffold because of refurbishing work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 11:59:50 p.m., 10 successive bursts of brilliant white
stars were expected to rain down the sides of the monument, each 55
feet above the one before it. Finally, beginning at midnight, the
entire monument was expected to be covered with ``a stunningly
beautiful waterfall'' of white pyrotechnics, according to Philip
Butler, who is producing the show for Fireworks by Grucci, a Long
Island, N.Y., company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monument is a national icon which is held in great
reverence,'' Butler said last week, ``and we could never use it as
a fireworks stage, except for the scaffolding being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the gala, the first couple planned to return to the
White House for another party with about 1,000 guests ``that will
go for quite a while, we think, into the new year,'' said White
House spokeswoman Ann Lewis. For those revelers who make it, the
White House party was scheduled to end with breakfast ``a little
before dawn,'' according to Toby Graff, spokeswoman for the first
lady.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In four months as Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin has
gone from a dry and derided nobody to the Russians' favorite for
president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history shows how volatile Russian politics can be, but
if nothing changes between now and the rescheduled presidential
elections next March, we are probably looking at the new master of
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of popularity since launching the second Chechnya
war in September, the 47-year old former spymaster was designated
Friday by outgoing President Boris Yeltsin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin did not run in the parliamentary elections on
Dec. 19, his hard-line policy is seen as having contributed to the
success of a new pro-Kremlin bloc Unity which he endorsed in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of polling, Russian television showed the black-belt
judo expert throwing an opponent to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is encouraging Russians to feel pride in themselves
owes his sudden rise to an act of expediency by Boris Yeltsin who,
earlier this year, appeared to be in danger of sinking in the mire
of post-communist corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Few now remember the prime minister's ignominious beginning or
stop to reflect that Putin is still linked to the hated Yeltsin
regime. The Russians were ready for a national savior and soon saw
Putin as their avenging angel.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's blue-eyed protege has exceeded all
expectations and, right across the spectrum, Russian politicians
now find it advisable to express support for Putin. Anyone who
dares criticize him risks being called a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   All it took for Putin, who has never held elected office, to win
Russian hearts was one impassioned outburst.
</P>
<P>
   After terrorist bombs destroyed four apartment blocks in
September, killing Muscovites and other Russians as they slept in
their beds, the prime minister allowed himself the use of vulgar
language: ``We will wipe the terrorists out wherever we find them.
If we find them sitting on the toilet, then that's where we will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That short sentence expressed all the pent-up frustration not
only over Chechnya but over all the failures of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The average Russian responded to this tough guy talk in the same
emotional way he once worshipped Yeltsin for showing that he could
drink vodka as well as the next man.
</P>
<P>
   Russian women seemed to experience an almost sexual thrill _ at
least one woman confessed in a newspaper article that she had
erotic dreams about Putin.
</P>
<P>
   At last, masochistic Russians had what they wanted, a strong
hand and someone else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Putin's popularity rating soared from the miserable 2
percent of public support he could count on in August when
President Yeltsin appointed him prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Russians were angry that the Kremlin leader,
casting about for a successor he could trust to protect him from
prosecution in retirement, had dumped another perfectly good prime
minister, the youthful and amiable Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   They openly laughed at Putin and laid bets as to how long he
would last. But the promise that the terrorists would get their
comeuppance, even on the toilet, changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   The grey suit _ a man who began his career serving the KGB in
Germany, went on to deputize for the liberal mayor of St.
Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, then helped to run Yeltsin's
administration and headed the Federal Security Service (former KGB)
_ suddenly had character.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that 47 percent of Russians see Putin as
their next president, almost enough for him to win the election in
a single round.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he has done virtually nothing to tackle the
problems of the Russian economy, apart from reassuring investors
that he sees no sense in renationalizing what has been privatized.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he called for a regulated market economy which would
avoid both blind adherence to Western liberalism and a return to
the Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made clear that because of its history, Russia could
not become a Western-style democracy like the United States because
of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Higher world oil prices have cushioned Russia financially during
its latest Chechnya offensive. The financial cost will be felt
later, and perhaps, if the war drags on, there will be a higher
human price for Moscow as well
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Russians feel it is all worth it, because they
are bombing Chechnya, which is not only a place but also a symbol
of all that ails them. And no amount of hand-wringing by the West,
perceived to have given bad advice in the period of ``reforms,''
will stop them. &QL;

FAA CHIEF FLIES CONFIDENTLY INTO THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ON BOARD AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 1099 _ Wearing a navy pants
suit with a single strand of pearls and showing absolutely no
trepidation, Jane F. Garvey, the nation's top aviation official,
sat in the first row of the coach section on board American
Airlines flight 1099 Friday, so she could be airborne as the
country's air-traffic control system struck midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last-minute Y2K-related fixes to the system, Garvey was
supremely confident that the flight would be uneventful. In a
preflight press conference at Washington's National Airport, US
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater praised Garvey and US
Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, chairman of the Senate aviation
subcommittee, for being on a flight that ``will take off in the
20th century and land in the 21st century.'' The flight, he said,
is ``a visible symbol of the journey the nation is taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, has spent
more than $350 million making sure its computer-dependent
air-traffic control systems function smoothly. The airlines spent
another $750 million domestically to insure that flying today is as
safe as any other day.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the FAA invested millions of man hours in checking
computer code so antiquated that retired IBM employees were called
in to assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of FAA men and women have worked on this, and they
have responded just wonderfully to a remarkable challenge,'' Garvey
said on the first leg of the trip, to Dallas-Fort Worth. Television
cameras jostled for space in the single-aisle airplane to record
Garvey selecting her seat.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute change to the air-traffic-control software _
involving less than 10 lines of computer code _ took place this
week and was tested Thursday, when it was discovered there was a
remote possibility that if two pieces of equipment failed
simultaneously on Jan. 1 it could momentarily shut down the main
computers at the nation's 21 en route centers, which direct all of
the high-altitude air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1099, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-80, pushed back from the
gate at 5:12 p.m. at National Airport and was roaring down the
runway at 5:22, in plenty of time to insure that Garvey would be in
the air at midnight Greenwich Mean Time (7 p.m. Eastern Standard
Time). That's the hour at which the nation's air-traffic control
system, which is coordinated with computers all over the world,
would recognize the date change to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was scheduled to land in Dallas at 8:43 p.m. Eastern
time. Following another press conference, Garvey was to take off
for San Francisco aboard American Flight 1435, which was scheduled
to land at 3:09 a.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 p.m., as the aircraft flew over Trenton, Tenn.,
Garvey, Slater, and President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, John
Koskinen, were linked in a telephone conference call through the
FAA operations center. Koskinen was on a plane to New York, and
Slater was at the FAA Air Traffic Control Command Center in
Herndon, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of happy faces up here,'' Garvey reported.

<P>
   ``Our flight is as uneventful as yours,'' Koskinen replied.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne was uncorked as Janet S. Rhodes, a passenger from Long
Beach, Calif., exclaimed, ``We're still flying and heading in the
same direction. Isn't it marvelous!''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey also read a copy of a letter faxed from her office to
President Clinton, saying that ``the nation's airspace system is up
and running safely and efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   She closed the letter with a quotation from a telegram sent by
flight pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright nearly a century ago,
``Success (Stop) . . . Inform press (Stop).''
</P>
<P>
   No indications of trouble were reported in the minutes after 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 133-seat flight to Dallas was nearly empty, save for Garvey;
some members of her staff; Ray Long, the former head of the FAA's
Y2K office; Senator Gorton; a dozen members of the news media; and
about 25 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a struggle in many ways for Garvey, a former commissioner
of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, to make this
flight at all.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after she was named to head the FAA in August 1997,
Garvey was confronted with the fact that the agency was not
adequately prepared for potential year 2000 problems. But long
before she knew how the problems would be fixed, she vowed that
they would be. Two years ago, she promised to make this flight
across the country to show that the United States has the world's
safest aviation system.
</P>
<P>
   But due to a lack of demand for travel on this date, Garvey
notwithstanding, American Airlines kept canceling flights she
wanted to take.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American canceled about 20 percent of its domestic
flights on Dec. 31, virtually all of them after 2 p.m. Garvey's
plane is the last American flight scheduled to land at the
airline's busy Dallas hub.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA reported that about 3,000 planes were in the air at 4
p.m. Eastern time, and that number was expected to drop steadily
through the evening. The San Francisco leg of Garvey's trip is
considered to be pure public relations, an opportunity to be in the
air over the United States when it is midnight on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey has boasted that she will celebrate the New Year three
times in one night. If her timing is good, that will happen. In
addition to the all-important Greenwich Mean Time system rollover,
she is scheduled to be in the air at midnight in the Mountain and
Pacific time zones.

<P>
   In four months as Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin has
gone from a dry and derided nobody to the Russians' favorite for
president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history shows how volatile Russian politics can be, but
if nothing changes between now and the rescheduled presidential
elections next March, we are probably looking at the new master of
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of popularity since launching the second Chechnya
war in September, the 47-year old former spymaster was designated
Friday by outgoing President Boris Yeltsin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin did not run in the parliamentary elections on
Dec. 19, his hard-line policy is seen as having contributed to the
success of a new pro-Kremlin bloc Unity which he endorsed in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of polling, Russian television showed the black-belt
judo expert throwing an opponent to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is encouraging Russians to feel pride in themselves
owes his sudden rise to an act of expediency by Boris Yeltsin who,
earlier this year, appeared to be in danger of sinking in the mire
of post-communist corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Few now remember the prime minister's ignominious beginning or
stop to reflect that Putin is still linked to the hated Yeltsin
regime. The Russians were ready for a national savior and soon saw
Putin as their avenging angel.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's blue-eyed protege has exceeded all
expectations and, right across the spectrum, Russian politicians
now find it advisable to express support for Putin. Anyone who
dares criticize him risks being called a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   All it took for Putin, who has never held elected office, to win
Russian hearts was one impassioned outburst.
</P>
<P>
   After terrorist bombs destroyed four apartment blocks in
September, killing Muscovites and other Russians as they slept in
their beds, the prime minister allowed himself the use of vulgar
language: ``We will wipe the terrorists out wherever we find them.
If we find them sitting on the toilet, then that's where we will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That short sentence expressed all the pent-up frustration not
only over Chechnya but over all the failures of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The average Russian responded to this tough guy talk in the same
emotional way he once worshipped Yeltsin for showing that he could
drink vodka as well as the next man.
</P>
<P>
   Russian women seemed to experience an almost sexual thrill _ at
least one woman confessed in a newspaper article that she had
erotic dreams about Putin.
</P>
<P>
   At last, masochistic Russians had what they wanted, a strong
hand and someone else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Putin's popularity rating soared from the miserable 2
percent of public support he could count on in August when
President Yeltsin appointed him prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Russians were angry that the Kremlin leader,
casting about for a successor he could trust to protect him from
prosecution in retirement, had dumped another perfectly good prime
minister, the youthful and amiable Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   They openly laughed at Putin and laid bets as to how long he
would last. But the promise that the terrorists would get their
comeuppance, even on the toilet, changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   The grey suit _ a man who began his career serving the KGB in
Germany, went on to deputize for the liberal mayor of St.
Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, then helped to run Yeltsin's
administration and headed the Federal Security Service (former KGB)
_ suddenly had character.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that 47 percent of Russians see Putin as
their next president, almost enough for him to win the election in
a single round.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he has done virtually nothing to tackle the
problems of the Russian economy, apart from reassuring investors
that he sees no sense in renationalizing what has been privatized.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he called for a regulated market economy which would
avoid both blind adherence to Western liberalism and a return to
the Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made clear that because of its history, Russia could
not become a Western-style democracy like the United States because
of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Higher world oil prices have cushioned Russia financially during
its latest Chechnya offensive. The financial cost will be felt
later, and perhaps, if the war drags on, there will be a higher
human price for Moscow as well
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Russians feel it is all worth it, because they
are bombing Chechnya, which is not only a place but also a symbol
of all that ails them. And no amount of hand-wringing by the West,
perceived to have given bad advice in the period of ``reforms,''
will stop them. &QL;

September, killing Muscovites and other Russians as they slept in
their beds, the prime minister allowed himself the use of vulgar
language: ``We will wipe the terrorists out wherever we find them.
If we find them sitting on the toilet, then that's where we will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That short sentence expressed all the pent-up frustration not
only over Chechnya but over all the failures of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The average Russian responded to this tough guy talk in the same
emotional way he once worshipped Yeltsin for showing that he could
drink vodka as well as the next man.
</P>
<P>
   Russian women seemed to experience an almost sexual thrill _ at
least one woman confessed in a newspaper article that she had
erotic dreams about Putin.
</P>
<P>
   At last, masochistic Russians had what they wanted, a strong
hand and someone else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Putin's popularity rating soared from the miserable 2
percent of public support he could count on in August when
President Yeltsin appointed him prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Russians were angry that the Kremlin leader,
casting about for a successor he could trust to protect him from
prosecution in retirement, had dumped another perfectly good prime
minister, the youthful and amiable Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   They openly laughed at Putin and laid bets as to how long he
would last. But the promise that the terrorists would get their
comeuppance, even on the toilet, changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   The grey suit _ a man who began his career serving the KGB in
Germany, went on to deputize for the liberal mayor of St.
Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, then helped to run Yeltsin's
administration and headed the Federal Security Service (former KGB)
_ suddenly had character.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that 47 percent of Russians see Putin as
their next president, almost enough for him to win the election in
a single round.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he has done virtually nothing to tackle the
problems of the Russian economy, apart from reassuring investors
that he sees no sense in renationalizing what has been privatized.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he called for a regulated market economy which would
avoid both blind adherence to Western liberalism and a return to
the Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made clear that because of its history, Russia could
not become a Western-style democracy like the United States because
of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Higher world oil prices have cushioned Russia financially during
its latest Chechnya offensive. The financial cost will be felt
later, and perhaps, if the war drags on, there will be a higher
human price for Moscow as well
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Russians feel it is all worth it, because they
are bombing Chechnya, which is not only a place but also a symbol
of all that ails them. And no amount of hand-wringing by the West,
perceived to have given bad advice in the period of ``reforms,''
will stop them. &QL;

KEEPING HIS PROMISE, POPE OPENS NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Paul II gave his first blessing of the Year 2000 as
fireworks exploded and church bells tolled, ushering in the new
year across Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we cross the threshold of the new year, I would like to
knock at the door of every home, to bring to each of you my cordial
good wishes,'' the pope said to about 100,000 people gathered in
St. Peter's Square beneath his study window, many holding up
torches and candles.
</P>
<P>
   After he spoke, the crowd erupted in cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the pope has not made a midnight appearance on
New Year's Eve, preferring to perform an evening vespers service,
and then get a good night's sleep before a Jan. 1 Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But this New Year's Eve falls at the start of a Holy Year for
the Roman Catholic Church, one that commemorates the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Christ. Ever since he was elected in
1978, the pope has said he has been looking forward to the moment
when he would lead the faithful into the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And people came from all over the world to witness the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this would be memorable, not only for the Christian
meaning, but because Rome was the center of civilization 2,000
years ago,'' said Rory Conway, 21, a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   At a vespers service Friday evening, the ailing 79-year-old pope
glided up the aisle of St. Peter's Basilica, his hands clutching
the handle of a wheeled staircase pushed by his aides. It was the
second time this week that he has used the device, which helps him
preserve his strength and also allows the crowds to get a better
glimpse of him.
</P>
<P>
   He gave thanks to God in his homily but also asked for
forgiveness. ``Let us ask for pardon because too often, alas, the
conquests of science and technology, so important to real human
progress, are used against mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the pope retires to his country residence of Castel
Gandolfo outside of Rome to rest between Christmas and New Year's.
This year, despite his fragile health, the pontiff elected to stay
at the Vatican to remain close to the religious pilgrims who
traveled to Rome for the Holy Year. On Saturday, he will open the
holy door of Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, and celebrate Mass
there.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope appeared, the waiting crowds were entertained by
a multicultural concert which included from Queen Esther Marrow, a
Harlem gospel singer, a choir of 5,000 children from various
countries around the world, and Italian pop singer Claudio
Baglioni.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's homily, the pope cited the discovery of
America, ``which initiated a new era in the history of humanity,''
as a key development of the last 1,000 years.

<P>
   In four months as Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin has
gone from a dry and derided nobody to the Russians' favorite for
president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history shows how volatile Russian politics can be, but
if nothing changes between now and the rescheduled presidential
elections next March, we are probably looking at the new master of
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of popularity since launching the second Chechnya
war in September, the 47-year old former spymaster was designated
Friday by outgoing President Boris Yeltsin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin did not run in the parliamentary elections on
Dec. 19, his hard-line policy is seen as having contributed to the
success of a new pro-Kremlin bloc Unity which he endorsed in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of polling, Russian television showed the black-belt
judo expert throwing an opponent to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is encouraging Russians to feel pride in themselves
owes his sudden rise to an act of expediency by Boris Yeltsin who,
earlier this year, appeared to be in danger of sinking in the mire
of post-communist corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Few now remember the prime minister's ignominious beginning or
stop to reflect that Putin is still linked to the hated Yeltsin
regime. The Russians were ready for a national savior and soon saw
Putin as their avenging angel.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's blue-eyed protege has exceeded all
expectations and, right across the spectrum, Russian politicians
now find it advisable to express support for Putin. Anyone who
dares criticize him risks being called a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   All it took for Putin, who has never held elected office, to win
Russian hearts was one impassioned outburst.
</P>
<P>
   After terrorist bombs destroyed four apartment blocks in
September, killing Muscovites and other Russians as they slept in
their beds, the prime minister allowed himself the use of vulgar
language: ``We will wipe the terrorists out wherever we find them.

ABSENCE OF `MIDNIGHT' DOESN'T DARKEN SPIRITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the midsummer sun standing high over the South Pole,
painting its vast featureless snow fields with light so intense it
hurt the eyes, scientists and support staff began celebrating the
new year along with a planeload of tourists and seven intrepid
skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight itself was almost meaningless; at this time of year,
the sun shines 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   A New Year's Eve party began at 8 p.m. New Zealand time
(America's Antarcticans set their clocks to Christchurch) in a
garage at the Amundson-Scott South Pole Station, which is in one of
the tunnels leading to the cavernous, snow-covered dome that
shelters many of the station's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were quite a few colorful costumes,'' said Ed Blain, the
area manager for the station. ``There was a live band and drinks
and champagne for all. The New Year's struck with quite a wild
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists, who flew in on a specially equipped Twin Otter
aircraft, left later for a campsite in central Antarctica. The
skiers, four from Singapore and three from Britain, are camping
near the polar station.
</P>
<P>
   And staff members began the annual placing of the stake marking
the latest position of the true geographic South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Although the South Pole itself is stationary, the two-mile-thick
ice sheet covering the rocky continent slips gradually, moving
generally seaward about 30 feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   So each year, on New Year's Day, a new stake is driven into the
ice over the latest South Pole position. Affixed to the stake is an
ornamental medallion designed and made by shop workers during the
three-month-long winter night at the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays, which come just about halfway through the South
Pole summer research season, are typically an occasion for play.
</P>
<P>
   In past seasons, artists have used chain saws and other tools to
create vast ice sculpture menageries, and scientists and support
staff who normally work virtually nonstop on astrophysics research,
astronomy, climate studies and other projects, take time out for
silly games and contests, like chili cook-offs held outdoors in
temperatures of 20 below. This year there was a pool championship,
with 27 station personnel playing.
</P>
<P>
   Some years, casualities or even deaths in the previous winter
have dampened spirits. But this year, except for the station's
doctor, who had to be evacuated several months ago after she
discovered she had breast cancer, there have been few problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the New Year festivities are over, Blain said, ``We are
hoping for a quiet restful season. We have 45 days left.''

 &HT;    FEW COMPUTER PROBLEMS ARISE AS Y2K ROLLS AROUND GLOBE
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts new 3rd, last grafs to freshen. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hundreds of billions of dollars spent stamping
out Y2K software bugs appear to have paid off, with the world's
computers moving smoothly through the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said Friday as upbeat reports about computer operations
poured into his command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, transportation, banks,
power grids or other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that most worried Y2K experts _ Russia, Ukraine and
China _ appear to have moved through the date change with all
nuclear weapons, reactors and other vital facilities in good shape.
``Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' said Thomas
Pickering, the No. 2 official at the State Department
</P>
<P>
   The United States' first major tests of Y2K bugs passed quietly
at 7 p.m. EST, when the new year began for aviation, shipping,
military operations and about a third of the nation's electric
power grid. Those systems all operate on Greenwich Mean Time, five
hours earlier than the East Coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>

   ``It is far too early to declare victory,'' he said. ``I would
stress that we need to continue to monitor all of these systems
over the weekend _ and particularly on Monday when we open for
business again _ to see exactly what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, business and government leaders have been
pushing computer programmers to find and fix the so-called Y2K bug,
a software flaw that caused computers to read only the last two
digits of a date. For those computers, the date ``00'' was
understood as 1900, rather than 2000. Without repairs, that
seemingly simple problem could cause equipment to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said Friday that U.S. taxpayers have spent about $8.5
billion fixing federal computers. Private industry has spent
another $100 billion, and perhaps another $200 billion has been
spent collectively by other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Getting business and political leaders to take the Y2K problem
seriously was difficult at first, because few believed that a
single flaw could have such big implications. But many became
converts in 1998 when store clerks starting finding customers'
credit cards being rejected whenever they had an expiration date of
``00.'' The computerized equipment mistakenly assumed the cards had
expired in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the effort to wipe out the bug has been
massive, with the United States helping take the lead around the
world. Koskinen described the anti-bug campaign as ``the biggest
management problem the world has seen in 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going as well as can be expected and maybe even
better,'' Bruce McConnell, director of the International Y2K
Cooperation Center, said Friday as developing nations turned in
positive reports as their midnights passed.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said he had received some reports of Y2K problems, but
they all amounted to ``oddball things,'' such as a brief Y2K-linked
failure of some 150 slot machines at three Delaware race tracks.

 &HT;    FEW COMPUTER PROBLEMS ARISE AS Y2K ROLLS AROUND GLOBE
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts new 3rd, last grafs to freshen. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hundreds of billions of dollars spent stamping
out Y2K software bugs appear to have paid off, with the world's
computers moving smoothly through the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said Friday as upbeat reports about computer operations
poured into his command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, transportation, banks,
power grids or other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that most worried Y2K experts _ Russia, Ukraine and
China _ appear to have moved through the date change with all
nuclear weapons, reactors and other vital facilities in good shape.
``Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' said Thomas
Pickering, the No. 2 official at the State Department
</P>
<P>
   The United States' first major tests of Y2K bugs passed quietly
at 7 p.m. EST, when the new year began for aviation, shipping,
military operations and about a third of the nation's electric
power grid. Those systems all operate on Greenwich Mean Time, five
hours earlier than the East Coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far too early to declare victory,'' he said. ``I would
stress that we need to continue to monitor all of these systems
over the weekend _ and particularly on Monday when we open for
business again _ to see exactly what happens.''
</P>

RECORDS MEANT TO BE BROKEN, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That was some century for athletic endeavor. We
were bigger, faster, stronger. We reached dizzying heights and then
went higher. We routinely trampled records. We evolved into a
physical marvel, then laughed at our pubescence and matured to
another level.
</P>
<P>
   Every decade we were better. We learned more about training, our
bodies and our sport, and the result was an almost endless stream
of superior athletic performances.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question as we enter into a new century: Are we
approaching the limits of human performance?
</P>
<P>
   At some point it has to end, doesn't it? The body can run only
so fast, leap so high. Somewhere there has to be a ceiling on
athletic accomplishment ... doesn't there?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but not one anybody is eager to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to say that years ago, that there were limits,''
said Dan McCann, a professor of exercise science at Gonzaga
University. ``But everyone kept getting proved wrong, so people
have stopped saying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any end in sight, it's just going to keep going. I
don't think there is a limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, general managers, ex-athletes and those in scientific
research point to a multitude of reasons why new athletic
achievements will be reached and records will continue to fall into
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For despite great strides made in nutrition, training and
technology, more is on the horizon. Greater numbers of athletes are
being identified throughout the world, and more are specializing in
a specific sport at a young age. New sports, particularly for
women, offer new opportunities. Then there are new drugs, over the
counter and otherwise. And most ominous, the prospect of genetic
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up, and few expect the growth in athletic performance to
subside in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the potential is perhaps almost endless,'' said Anita
De Frantz, vice president of the International Olympic Committee
and former Olympic medal winning rower. ``This is just the
beginning, not the end.''
</P>
<P>
   NO END TO RECORDS FALLING
</P>
<P>
   There were times when people weren't so sure records would fall.
Certain numbers seemed beyond approach. None more than the sub
4-minute mile, a frustrating and glamorous barrier to milers for
decades. Then on May 6, 1954 a young Oxford medical student named
Roger Bannister ran it in 3:59.4, and suddenly all things seemed
possible.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no looking back. In track and field, in all
sports, records are written in pencil. The record in the mile has
now fallen to Hicham El Guerrouj's 3:43.13.
</P>
<P>
   Times are no longer kept by the tenths of a second, but the
hundredths, as if an acknowledgment that we are straining to keep
alive these record-shattering ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see continuous but infinitesimal improvement going on
for quite some time,'' said Nick Warner, professor of physics at
USC. ``When we're measuring speed of swimming in hundredths of
seconds, I'm sure we can continue to shave off the odd few
hundredths every now and then. I don't suddenly see somebody
running a 3-minute mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start really pushing the outside, you're going to run
into the structural limitations of the bones and the body, the
ability to take impact, to repeat motions at great speeds, or
simply to lift somebody out of the starting blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said stress fractures and dislocated shoulders now seem
more common at top levels, signs he wonders are not suggesting a
limit to what the body can endure.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Bergman, chairman of the USC physiology department,
said efforts to scientifically gauge the body's athletic limits
have been elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible to calculate the maximum amount of stress the
bone structure can withstand, but to my knowledge no one has
calculated the maximum possible performance,'' Bergman said. ``The
reason is we don't have real good measures of what it takes to do
certain kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why certain unbelievable individuals occasionally
exist. Somebody like Einstein, who was so much more intelligent
than everybody else, is an individual who probably wouldn't have
been predicted. Maybe Tiger Woods wouldn't have been predicted,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   SIZE DOES MATTER
</P>
<P>
   Records have continued to fall in large degree simply because
the modern athlete has continued to grow in size. We're not just
living longer, we're livin' larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 50 or 100 years, Americans in particular _ and
probably other advanced countries _ have gotten larger and stronger
and more agile than ever before,'' said Dr. Frank Jobe, the
ground-breaking orthopedist. ``If you talk to clothing
manufacturers, at the turn of the century they used to make more
size 36s (coats) for men, but now they make more 42s.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just in the United States. Countries throughout the
world are improving their diets, and the results are quickly
becoming obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Asia many times, and I've noticed over the last
13 years people there are generally getting taller,'' said Bob
Girandola, a professor of exercise physiology at USC. ``And a lot
of that has to do with nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if people in general are getting bigger, the athletes are
going to get bigger. I remember in football when the average
offensive lineman used to weigh 250 in professional football. Now
it's unlikely to see someone under 300.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger, Gonzaga's McCann said, typically leads to being more
powerful and greater performance. Every time observers begin to
think they have a feel for the body's limitations, along comes a
new prototype. The rules continually have to be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally when they were trying to break 10 seconds in the
100 meters, people thought it was physically impossible, but it
wasn't,'' McCann said. ``It might have been for the people who were
running at that time because of their size and the amount that they
trained. But now that they're bigger and stronger and more
powerful, it's not a limitation anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't extrapolate into the future based on the past.
It doesn't seem to work. It hasn't worked in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Training has been another area of vast improvement. The
linebacker doesn't do the same exercises as a swimmer, a sprinter
the same as a wrestler, the pitcher the same as a gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science field has developed a little more, so that we know
the specificity of exercise if you want to improve,'' Girandola
said. ``It's not like you jog for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY MAKES A DIFFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Jobe designed an entire series of exercises for pitchers to
build arm strength and help avoid injury. And athletes are not just
training better, but often longer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic swimming coach Mark Schubert said record times
started dropping dramatically in the '60s and '70s not only because
the technology of the pools improved, but because swimmers started
using goggles. With less eye irritation, he said they doubled their
training time.
</P>
<P>
   Schubert, however, predicts a records overhaul at the 2000
Olympics because of continually improved techniques and another
leap in technology: new fabrics. He said the latest fabrics are far
superior in drag coefficient to even shaven skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Olympics you're going to see a lot of new suits coming
out that are actually going to go down the swimmers' wrists and to
their ankles _ full body suits,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I don't see an end to records being broken. At
this Olympics, because of the combination of the improved technique
and improved suits, you're probably going to see more records
broken at this Olympics than have ever been broken before.''
</P>
<P>
   De Frantz said any sport that incorporates technology, will only
see improved performance in the coming years. Whether it's better
bicycles, blades on an oar, running surfaces, golf clubs, car
engines, shoes, skates, skis, rackets or whatever, it's constantly
being improved.
</P>
<P>
   Even baseball witnessed the destruction of Roger Maris' home run
record two seasons ago by Mark McGwire, who crushed 70 with a
6-foot-5, 250-pound frame that would dwarf over most Hall of
Famers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire plays in several new retro-styled ballparks that are
smaller than many of the older ballparks and the stadiums built in
the '70s. But not everyone agrees the modern ballplayer is
physically superior to the player from 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're greater athletes,'' said Tom Lasorda,
the Dodgers vice president involved in baseball for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't as many guys who throw 100 mph. Take the Dodgers.
Just tell me where you look at guys who are really hard throwers
now. They're all throwing forkballs and cut fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has regressed. When I was growing up 50 years ago the
only two sports people played was baseball and boxing. Nobody
played golf or tennis, only the wealthy. Nobody played basketball
when there was no money going to play professional basketball. The
same with football. The only two major sports guys partook in,
because it was an opportunity for them to make something, was
boxing and baseball. And I believe those are the two sports that
have regressed, while the others have progressed.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIALIZATION LEADS TO BETTER ATHLETES
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are more sports, and more money in them, than at
any time in our history. That breeds interest, which begets more
athletes and a greater opportunity to discover the unique talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like survival of the fittest,'' McCann said. ``As
we grow in population, there are more individuals on the end of the
continuum who have these potentials. And because sports is such a
revered activity now, and there are millions of dollars in it and
everyone is interested, there is more reason for people to pursue
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '40s, '50s and '60s, there probably wasn't that
much interest or opportunity for people to become professional
athletes. When I was a track runner back in the '60s, there was no
way you could make a living running track. Now a guy like Michael
Johnson, or all the world record holders, they're millionaires. You
can be sure if there are any talented people out there, there's a
much higher chance they're going to end up professional athletes.
It's more obvious to everyone there is the potential for career,
wealth and popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, too, talent is being discovered in areas to push the
athletic envelope. World records in track are set by athletes from
Brazil, Morocco, Algeria, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is what used to be third-world countries are
getting developed and the individuals out of there that have the
genetic abilities are being found,'' McCann said. ``They're finding
athletes we didn't even know existed before. Who's to say what we
might find?''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing number of new sports in itself offers fresh
opportunities for new accomplishment. And women are now being given
nearly the same number of sports opportunities as men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world of women's sports is just going to be
explosive,'' De Frantz said. ``That's where the dramatic increases
will continue to come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 Olympics is the 100th anniversary of women competing
in the Games. In 1900 women had two sports to compete in. In 2000
women will compete in all but two _ wrestling and boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who participate in athletics often are choosing a singular
sport early, and concentrating on developing those specific skills.
The three-sport star continues as a vanishing breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see kids specialize at a very early age,''
said Lakers vice president Jerry West. ``Instead of participating
in everything, you're seeing kids play just one particular sport
year-round. Sports have become very selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basketball we're seeing some incredibly physically gifted
athletes who also have incredible skills. In the past, we might
have had some unbelievably physically gifted athletes, but maybe
they didn't have the skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time a sport seems to have peaked, a Michael Jordan, Ken
Griffey Jr., Michael Johnson, Janet Evans or Tiger Woods comes
along to raise the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere out there, there may be limits to human athletic
performance, just no one able or ready to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if most people who read literature in
this area didn't say, `Well, we just don't know,''' McCann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safe bet is we're going to get better, we're going to get
bigger, we're going to get faster. I don't think you're going to
find anyone who will put their reputation on the line and say this
is as good as it's going to get.''

PARTIES ON THE BEACH, THEN PIOUS REFLECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The land that made Carnival and the samba art forms loves
nothing more than a party. So the beginning of the 2000s in Rio de
Janeiro turned into what authorities proudly called the largest
celebration in Brazilian history: an estimated 3.5 million people
lining Copacabana, Ipanema and more than 25 miles of other beaches
in an event that blended the spiritual and the profane.
</P>
<P>
   For believers of Candomble, Brazil's home-grown mixture of
Catholicism and African-derived animist beliefs, New Year's Eve is
traditionally the feast day of Iemanja, the fair-skinned goddess of
the sea who appears in the guise of the Virgin Mary and is
considered the mother of all living things. Beaches are always
packed with worshipers who come to seek her blessing on that night,
but with the celebration of the millennium, everything that has
gone on in the past was multiplied.
</P>
<P>
   The day had been cloudless and sunny; the hottest of the summer
so far. Rio's beaches were crowded with sunbathers, surfers and
volleyball and paddleball players.
</P>
<P>
   But as the sun dipped over Gavea Peak and sank into the sea, the
sportsmen retired, a cooling breeze appeared and individuals,
couples and entire families began emerging from apartments,
restaurants, buses or the subway and streaming to the shore.
</P>
<P>
   To turn away from the sea was to glimpse silhouetted figures
clinking their glasses, dancing and kissing as they watched the
goings-on from the verandas of million-dollar apartments in
Ipanema.
</P>
<P>
   At the water's edge, though, the scene was largely one of piety,
as devotees of Iemanja stood quietly, their heads bowed and arms
outstretched, and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike were dressed entirely in white in deference
to Iemanja. Many of the bouquets of roses, lilies, carnations and
gladioli they carried also were white, and were ceremoniously
thrown into the Atlantic as offerings to the goddess. Other
worshipers tossed wads of money or even pieces of jewelry into the
sea in her honor, or let the waves wash over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new millennium, a new start,'' said Maria Zenaida Rodrigues
Alves as she emerged soaked from the surf. ``I have washed away my
sins and the Lady of the Sea has made me a new person.''
</P>
<P>
   Delia Correia Costa put it another way: ``If we cleanse
ourselves at the start of this new millennium, then maybe the world
can also be cleansed and we can usher in an era of universal peace
and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar celebrations were going on in other cities along
Brazil's 4,000 miles of coastline, but Copacabana was clearly the
focal point of the nation's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen cruise ships and assorted yachts and sailboats
floated just offshore, hundreds of jet-setters and political
dignitaries joined President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in a special
tent set up at Fort Copacabana, and some of Brazil's most renowned
pop music stars performed on stages that had been erected at four
points along the beach.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the working poor, though, the night was primarily a
chance to make a little money. They circulated among the revelers,
selling coconuts, ears of corn, beer, soft drinks and even bottles
of Champagne. ``Whether it is 1999 or 2000, I still have to put
food in the mouths of my children,'' said Jose Ovidio Ramos
Mendonca, a vendor of grilled meats. ``I can always rest
tomorrow.''

MIDNIGHT TICKS ACROSS GLOBE, BRINGING A NEW AGE WITH IT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two thousand years after Christ's obscure birth in a dusty town
in Judea, the world's 6 billion people _ most of them non-Christian
and many of them preoccupied with terrorism, computers, diets, bank
accounts, politics and the perils of the future _ rode their
turning blue planet across time's invisible line Friday and, by
common consent, looked into the dawn of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw first was a party. It was garish, glittering and
global, and millions, setting religious considerations and personal
concerns aside, joined in the festivities to celebrate the
conjunction of a new year, a new century and a new thousand-year
cycle of history. They also put aside the inconvenient fact that
the millennium, technically, is still a year off.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly mattered. In New York's Times Square and across the
United States, in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, in cities and
towns all over the world, bells pealed, crowds shrieked and surged,
skyrockets soared into the night, fireworks burst into supernovas,
``Auld Lang Syne'' rang out, lights pulsed, loved ones and friends
embraced, and the music and Champagne flowed.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when moods ran the spectrum from tensions and prayers
to euphoria and irresistible hyperbole, what most were calling
Christianity's Third Millennium arrived in 24 stages as the earth
revolved through the time zones and midnight elapsed again and
again in an around-the-clock, around-the-world series of golden
moments that began at the International Dateline in the Pacific and
raced westward across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.

   In New York, a vast crowd of revelers _ the guesses ran as high
2 million _ packed Times Square and much of Midtown Manhattan for
the biggest public event ever held in the city _ a 26-hour, $7
million marathon of music, fireworks, confetti and deafening voices
culminating as a 1,070-pound crystal ball descended at midnight,
while the police sweated out an enormous potential for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And there were lavish celebrations in Washington, London, Paris,
Rome, Berlin, Jerusalem, Moscow, Cape Town, New Delhi, Shanghai,
Beijing, Tokyo, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and
hundreds of other cities. There were parties, concerts, dances,
torchlight parades and televised extravaganzas that brought the
worldwide show to billions more at home and to the crowds in Times
Square over giant video screens _ a case of celebrators watching
celebrators.

   To a Martian earthwatcher (tuning in with delicate ear and
Cycloptic eye), it might have appeared that the inhabitants of the
third world from the Sun had suddenly lost their senses or gone to
war again. But it was only humanity on the threshold of a new age,
exercising its primal urge to celebrate.

   There had been an avalanche of happy millennial overkill in
recent days _ claims of the last-game, last-meal, first-baby kind _
and Friday it was the turn of world leaders in government,
religion, science and other fields, who spoke of the millennium's
meaning in more serious tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we celebrate more than the changing of the calendar,''
President Clinton, extending millennium greetings to the world,
said in an address to diplomats and children from 100 nations. ``We
celebrate the opportunity we have to make this a true changing of
the times, a gateway to greater peace and freedom, to prosperity
and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Boris Yeltsin, who has been plagued with heart and
other problems for most of his eight years as Russia's president,
unexpectedly announced his resignation. ``Russia must enter the new
millennium with new politicians, new faces, new intelligent, strong
and energetic people,'' he said. ``And we who have been in power
for many years must go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II, fulfilling his dream to lead
the Roman Catholic Church across the threshold of 2000, gave his
blessing to a vast crowd in St. Peter's Square, reiterated his
calls for an end to war and poverty, and thanked God for ``the
events of this year, this century and this millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   There were millions around the world who had no reason to be
festive, people like Tom Nganga, 40, who lives in Kangemi, a vast
slum of Nairobi, Kenya. ``We as Kenyans and people of Kangemi are
very, very angry as we celebrate this millennium,'' he said.
``People are very poor. People have nothing to eat. We have nothing
to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the millennium celebrations drew millions, there were
relatively few casualties. In the Philippines, two people were
killed by stray gunfire and a 5-year-old boy died after a
firecracker exploded in his face. At least 200 other Filipinos were
injured by fireworks. In Paris, 70 people were hurt in crowds.
</P>
<P>
   After years of concern over Y2K computer problems that had cost
billions of dollars to fix, there were no immediate reports of
computer-related disasters anywhere in the world _ no plane
crashes, major power failures, nuclear plant shutdowns or collapses
of banking, business, government or health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   But elevators, intercity trains and subways in many American
cities and in other countries as well were halted briefly over the
witching hour, and some airlines canceled flights for the day, just
to be safe. Many airports were all but deserted, with wary
travelers staying put. Experts said it might take days for some
computer problems to develop, in part because many businesses and
government agencies were closed for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been fears that terrorists, publicity seekers or
the insane might set off explosions or mount chemical or biological
attacks as millions gathered to celebrate, while vast audiences
watched on television. No specific threats had been reported,
although some suspects had been seized recently. Still, there were
no immediate reports of trouble, and law enforcement authorities
seemed ready for almost anything.

   The millennium, an idea with overtones ranging from Biblical to
commercial, had swelled recently into a coercive miniculture as the
countdown ticked away and a flood of books, articles, television
specials and studied commentaries by academic, political and
religious leaders reflected upon the last thousand years of human
achievements and missteps, and speculated on the next thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Purists still insist that the millennium will not start until
Jan. 1, 2001, and they are no doubt right. The calendar, at best,
is arbitrary. There were problems from ancient times based on
inaccuracies in measuring the year's duration and its uneven
division into days, weeks and months. By 1582, the spring equinox
was 10 days early, and the days were dropped when the Gregorian
Calendar replaced the old Julian version. While Pope Gregory's
calendar uses the birth of Christ in 1 B.C., as a starting date,
many scholars now suggest that the year was probably closer to 4
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, as Voltaire noted, history is the lie that
historians agree upon, and the tide of popular opinion has swept
nearly everyone along. And with the climax of celebrations, and
especially when the nines rolled into zeros at midnight and
humanity went ballistic, purists' talk of technicalities was the
last thing anyone wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   For doomsayers who had prophecied conflagrations, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions and other end-of-the-world scenarios (and kept a
weather eye out for UFO rescue ships), the new millennium was
something of a nonevent, although the anxiety prompted by all the
wild predictions of chaos was real enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Revelations, Chapter 20, speaks of a resurrection of
the dead and a judgment day, of sinners cast into a lake of fire
and Christ reigning for a thousand years. But if it was not the
Second Coming of Jesus as foretold in the Bible, there was still a
year to go, or this was the wrong millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as some said, even the idea of a Third Christian
Millennium was a Western conceit in a world where Christians are a
minority, and one that overlooked other calendars calling this 1420
(Muslim) or 5760 (Jewish), it was also true that the world had long
ago come by economic and social necessity to agree upon the Western
calendar for trade, travel and other common purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium, if nothing else, was a celebration of history,
marking human survival after a deadly century of wars, genocide and
revolution that saw the end of colonialism, fascism and communism,
as well as the achievements of the past thousand years _ printing
and widespread literacy; the exploration of the last frontiers on
earth; the first ventures into outer space, the inner mind and the
microscopic universe, and the flowering of democratic government,
and of art, literature, science, technology and communications into
undreamed eminences.
</P>
<P>
   The world on this Millennium Day was still beset with terrible
problems _ with grinding poverty that afflicted a third of its 6
billion inhabitants, with ethnic and national strife, with the
continuing curse of racial and religious bigotries, and with the
exclusion of countless millions from adequate health care,
education, jobs and even such basic needs as shelter and clean
water, not to mention freedoms of speech and political association.
</P>
<P>
   But with a few exceptions _ notably threats of terrorism and
limited wars in the Balkans, Chechnya and other regions _ it was a
world largely at peace, with the apocalyptic threat of nuclear
annihilation receding and new understandings growing between old
enemies in the Middle East, Ireland, South Africa and other
long-troubled areas.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a world on the threshold of a new era _ one that
offered visions of astounding strides in science and technology and
seemed to hold out anew the ancient promises of universal peace and
prosperity, although the only certainty seemed to be that the world
a thousand years from now would be unrecognizable.

   As Dec. 31, 1999, gave way to Jan. 1, 2000, in each time zone at
midnight, with atomic clocks marking it to a millisecond,
celebrants went ecstatic. It began in Fiji and the Kiribati and
Marshall Islands in the Western Pacific (it was 7 a.m., EST Friday)
and moved westward, hour by hour, as the earth turned and 23 more
midnights fell across Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas
and back across the Pacific, ending in Samoa at 6 a.m., EST
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders in Kiribati welcomed the millennium with the mournful
sounds of a conch shell and with traditional chants and dancing on
the beach of a normally uninhabited coral atoll, dubbed Millennium
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, which has absorbed many of the trappings of the
Western world while preserving its own cultural and religious
traditions, bells tolled in a Buddhist ritual to dispel evils as
thousands flocked to temples and shrines. In Tokyo, the first of
the world's major cities to mark the new year, people went to
parties and crowds swarmed to bayside events, including rock
concerts and lavish fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   In China, torchbearers in Imperial-era costumes lighted signal
fires on the watch towers of the Great Wall, which snakes 3,000
miles from the Gobi Desert to the North China Sea, and President
Jiang Zemin lighted an eternal flame to greet the new millennium
and pledged a ``great rejuvenation'' by reuniting with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Over Hong Kong Harbor there were brilliant fireworks displays,
and parties abounded, a prelude to the Chinese new year, the Year
of the Dragon, which starts Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The festivities for most of India's 1 billion people were muted
by comparison with those in wealthier nations, but hundreds of
thousands danced, drank and ate at open-air stalls in New Delhi and
partygoers were out in force in other major cities, celebrating the
peaceful end of an eight-day hostage crisis aboard an Indian
Airlines hours before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Iran and its Persian Gulf neighbors largely ignored the new
millennium, which fell during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a
time for prayer and reflection.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, where religious tension is high at the best of times,
security was heavy as three religions and some doomsday cultists
marked the occasion, each in its own way. It was especially tight
on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, where Christian fundamentalists had
camped to witness the end of the world, and at the Old City's
Temple Mount, with sites sacred to Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   On the last New Year's Eve of the Christian millennium,
observant Jews ushered in the sabbath, as they do every Friday, and
many went to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site,
while 400,000 Muslims flocked to the al-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount
to mark the last Friday of prayer and fasting in the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, with new lighting on buildings, boulevards and bridges
over the Seine twinkling like the bonfires of a great Medieval
encampment, people packed the Champs-Elysees from the Tuileries to
the Arc de Triomphe as a digital clock at the Eiffel Tower counted
down _ overcoming an old-fashioned glitch that shut it down five
hours before midnight _ and announced the millennium in a burst of
20,000 electronic flashes.
</P>
<P>
   In London, 2 million people lined the Thames for a spectacular
fireworks show, as Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Tony Blair and
other dignitaries gathered under the 20-acre Millennium Dome, a
flying-saucer-like colossus at Longitude Zero in Greenwich, to mark
the transition while the bells of St. Paul's and Westminster and
churches across Britain pealed. Huge street parties were held in
hundreds of Britain's cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, floodlights, lasers and fireworks illuminated the
ancient pyramids at Giza and electronic music reverberated over the
desert as 50,000 people wined and dined in luxury tents and watched
a sparkling millennium show under the watchful eyes of police
officers on camels.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there were torchlight parades in the streets of
Stockholm; fireworks and singing by massed choirs in Reykjavik,
Iceland; concerts and a ball at the opera house in Tallinn,
Estonia; and a Millennium Ball at the Catherine Palace in St.
Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, it was a day to remember. The centerpiece was the
spectacle billed as ``Times Square 2000: the Global Celebration at
the Crossroads of the World.'' Worried authorities had closed 50
blocks of midtown to traffic, banned alcohol in open containers and
flooded the area with 8,000 officers just in case. All vehicles
were towed away as a precaution against car bombs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Throughout the city, all 37,000 police officers were on duty,
and there was plenty for them to do. The Times Square celebration
was only one of 329 public events in the city, the biggest of them
at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration in Times Square went off as planned with
all-day, all-night pulsing music and cacophonous entertainments by
1,000 musicians, actors, dancers, puppeteers and other performers
working from a stage on Seventh Avenue between 45th and 46th
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway, curving like a dancer's leg, was packed from 42rd
Street to Central Park, along with most of the sidestreets between
the Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue. The old wickedness of
Times Square was missing, but for most in the crowd it was an
adventure just to be caught, shoulder to shoulder, jostling for
happiness at the intersection of past and future.
</P>
<P>
   The party ran all day and all night, from 6 a.m. Friday to 8
a.m. Saturday, and thousands showed up early to stake claims near
ground zero. By the time the sun went down, the crowds were already
gigantic. They came in shoals from the suburbs, from across the
nation and from countless places abroad, and they swept into the
vast clogged carnival, determined to experience the exotic and
illusory evening.
</P>
<P>
   They were in a euphoric mood, capped and scarved and padded like
armadillos against the cold. They watched twilight print the sky
with darkness, and the blue night city come to life, glittering
like a tiara. By midevening, much of midtown was seized up in human
gridlock. Laser lights slid up the skyscrapers and washed over the
writhing mass of Lilliputian figures below.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were squeezed into police-barrier pens to create
lanes for emergency vehicles, and many had to watch events on giant
video screens. The closer to One Times Square, where the ball
descended, the more bleary the crowd looked, many having stood
their ground for a day and a half. A stench arose from a layer of
garbage underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of celebrants watching others celebrate was
continued on a global scale. Live video feeds from festivities
around the world were pumped into Times Square, and the scenes
there were beamed by 45 networks out to a worldwide audience of 1
billion people or more.

DON'T GIVE STEVENS' CAREER SHORT SHRIFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ When Gary Stevens, then the leading jockey at
Longacres Park near Seattle, moved to the tougher Southern
California circuit in 1984, he had the audacity to think it was
``ripe for the taking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Shoemaker had to be getting close to retirement,''
Stevens said this week, recounting his reasoning. ``Fernando Toro
had to be getting close to retirement. Laffit Pincay had to have
only four or five years left. Eddie Delahoussaye and Chris McCarron
had to be getting close to retirement ...''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Shoemaker and Toro did retire _ six years later, when Shoe
was 58 and the master of the turf was 49. ``The rest,'' Stevens
noted, ``outlasted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday afternoon, after wincing through four rides on
opening day at Santa Anita, Stevens surprised everyone except his
family and close friends by announcing his retirement. He's only
36, but has an arthritic right knee and just can't do it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCarron, 44, and Delahoussaye, 48, are still in the
top 10, and Pincay, who turned 53 Wednesday, just won the Hollywood
Park riding title.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention paid lately to Pincay, to Shoemaker (whose
career-wins record Pincay broke Dec. 10), and to Johnny Longden
(who was 59 when he retired in 1966 with the record Shoemaker would
overtake), might have left the impression that every great jockey
goes on riding until the racetrack grit is permanently embedded in
his wrinkled cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   In all the writing about Pincay, Shoemaker and Longden, we might
have implied that a jockey must pile up years and victories to be
considered great.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' career proves otherwise. It's only a bit too dramatic
to say the 5-foot-3 Idaho native, taking nearly every trophy
available into a premature retirement, is horse racing's Sandy
Koufax or Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he should be remembered as the rider of the '90s on
the Santa Anita-Hollywood Park-Del Mar circuit _ despite having
competed in the deepest jockey colony in the nation _ his
versatility, intelligence and competitive drive making him
virtually slump-proof when healthy.
</P>
<P>
   National recognition came slowly. Stevens deserved to go into
the Hall of Fame before finally making it in 1997. And he deserved
an Eclipse Award before he finally won that annual honor in 1998 _
by which time, he was winning races with his savvy, admittedly not
the athlete he'd been on two good legs.
</P>
<P>
   But as a go-to guy for the nation's leading stakes trainers,
Stevens was the West's answer to the East's Jerry Bailey and the
Midwest's Pat Day.
</P>
<P>
   He won two Kentucky Derbies (with Winning Colors, 1988, and
Thunder Gulch, 1995) for D. Wayne Lukas, and one (with Silver
Charm, 1997) for Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   He won seven Santa Anita Derbies, including 1999's aboard
Baffert's General Challenge, to tie Pincay for second behind
Shoemaker, who won eight.
</P>
<P>
   He won three Santa Anita Handicaps and three Hollywood Gold Cups
always on or near the lead.
</P>
<P>
   He won Breeders' Cup races seven times, including the 1999
Juvenile aboard Anees, the winter-book favorite for the 2000
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   He was adventurous about exploring the racing world beyond the
United States, riding in Hong Kong for three months in 1995 and in
Europe as the stable jockey for English trainer Michael Stoute.
</P>
<P>
   What eluded him, in 20 years of winning races, was the Breeders'
Cup Classic, in which he finished second aboard Pleasant Tap in
1992, Bertrando in 1993 and Silver Charm in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to go after that one some other way some day,''
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, son of a trainer, brother of a jockey, president of the
national Jockeys' Guild (an office he'll have to relinquish) and a
well-reviewed television analyst from time to time, will have his
pick of a variety of job offers.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he received a ``tempting'' offer _ he wouldn't
specify the responsibilities from Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Salman's
Thoroughbred Corp., the owner for which he'd ridden under contract
since August.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll take at least a month to think about his future,
meanwhile enjoying more time with his family and at the dinner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens retired with 4,512 victories. That's about half of what
Pincay is likely to end up with.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only how long you ride that counts.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream opens: Gulfstream Park north of Miami begins a 63-day
season Monday, highlighted by the Feb. 5 Donn Handicap for the
heavyweights and the March 11 Florida Derby for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The track shares the national spotlight with Santa Anita for
most of the winter, and now the two tracks share an owner as well,
since this is Gulfstream's first meet under Frank Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach _ who also owns Golden Gate Fields, Remington Park and
Thistledown _ faces a Jan. 15 deadline to decide if his tracks will
remain members of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. In
a press conference on opening day at Santa Anita, he repeated his
demands that the NTRA clarify its mandate, select its board
democratically and fight state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Brave Act (Alex Solis riding) will try to defend
his title in the San Gabriel Handicap on turf today, facing Native
Desert, Bouccaneer and Ladies Din, who were second, third and sixth
behind him in the recent Citation at Hollywood Park. The young
challenger is new 4-year-old Manndar, coming off a second to Super
Quercus in the Hollywood Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold (Solis), an unlucky second to Artax in the Breeders'
Cup Sprint, heads the El Conejo Handicap on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's Monrovia Handicap sprint for fillies and mares was
moved off the wet turf. Show Me the Stage and Kent Desormeaux led
all the way to upset Honest Lady. Tuzla was among the scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity stunt of the millennium: The year's final race
happened too late to get the result in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The Pompano Park harness track in Florida scheduled its 14th
race on New Year's Eve to begin at 11:59 p.m., meaning the roughly
two-minute event will start in 1999 and finish in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, also, the nine pacers will literally take their
birthdays in stride, since Jan. 1 is the day every racehorse
officially turns a year older. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Thursday): David Flores, 5
wins; Kent Desormeaux, Corey Nakatani, Laffit Pincay, Alex Solis
and Pat Valenzuela, 4. Trainers: John Dolan, 3; Bob Baffert,
Leonard Duncan, Ron Ellis, Bobby Frankel and Richard Mandella, 2. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: At first glance the Santa Anita main track is
favoring horses with come-from-behind ability. The first 14 sprints
of the meet were won from behind. Counting sprints and mile-and-up
races, front-runners were a weak 3 for 26 through Thursday, after
winning 32 percent during the Oak Tree meet. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: today, $150,000 San Gabriel
Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 1[ miles on turf, and $75,000 Run for
the Roses Handicap, fillies and mares 4 and up, 1 mile; Sunday,
$100,000 El Conejo Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 5{ furlongs, and
$75,000 Hill Rise Handicap, 3-year-olds, 1 mile on turf. At Golden
Gate Fields: today, $75,000 Millennium Mile, 4-year-olds and up, 1
mile on turf. At Gulfstream Park: Monday, $100,000 Appleton
Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1 1/16 miles on turf; Wednesday,
$75,000 Spectacular Bid, 3-year-olds, 6 furlongs. &QL; 
Mileposts: Laffit Pincay was ordered to serve a suspension Jan. 5-7
for causing interference will riding Captain Ben to seventh place
in Thursday's fourth race.... Turf Paradise in Phoenix, which was
the last racetrack owned by R.D. Hubbard's Hollywood Park, Inc., is
being sold to Jerry Simms, a real-estate developer who describes
himself as a big racing fan.... Cavonnier, the 1996 Santa Anita
Derby winner and heartbreak Kentucky Derby runner-up, has finally
been retired after finishing an indifferent fourth in Monday's Ack
Ack Stakes. The California-bred trained by Bob Baffert went 1 for 5
in his comeback 2 years after being injured in the Belmont
Stakes.... Edgar Prado's victory aboard Prince of Theater Thursday
at Miami's Calder Race Course took him to the 400-wins mark for the
third straight year, a streak accomplished previously only by
Russell Baze and Chris McCarron. The Northern California-based Baze
will finish in the 370s this time after missing more than a month
with back injuries.... With four wins in the first four days at
Santa Anita, jockey Kent Desormeauxequaled his total for the entire
Hollywood Park autumn meet.... Kentucky-based Storm Cat leads the
1999 national sire standings in both the overall (his offspring
earning nearly $10 million) and 2-year-old (nearly $1.5 million)
categories. California-based sires are led by General Meeting....
Los Alamitos' on-site attendance average dropped to 1,731 but
overall wagering averaged a track-record $1.2 million at the latest
quarterhorse meet. The Orange County track began its harness season
Sunday. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin astonished the world
and his people Friday by announcing on the last day of the 20th
century that he was stepping down after almost a decade in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing around making their last-minute preparations for the
millennium, Russians were taken completely off guard by his
theatrically timed announcement that he was retiring early and
entrusting the country to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   As the news broke at noon, when the first television channel

she said. ``If he has chosen Putin, then now I will vote for him.

   Some Muscovites, while welcoming Yeltsin's decision and his

</P>
<P>
   ``Did he have to do it today?'' asked Valentina, a cook. ``Could

   MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin astonished the world

   Rushing around making their last-minute preparations for the

SCARY THOUGHT: ENGINEERING GENES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It sounds like something out of science fiction,
or shrouded in a darkened 1970s East German laboratory. Richard
Bergman knows all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want is to sound like some mad scientist,''
said Bergman, who is anything but as the chairman of the USC
physiology department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is out there, looming menacingly over the future of
athletic performance _ genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, science comes closer to identifying the
full mysteries of DNA and the genetic code. When it does, and it
will soon, the possibility becomes very real that genes could be
altered to produce the super athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next five to 10 years, we will have some idea what the
genes are that favor one or more specific abilities,'' Bergman
said. ``We could then either look for people who have those genes
and train them, or frighteningly, we could even try to design genes
or engineer the genetics of people to be able to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those with specific genes are sought out and then
trained _ either for sports, music, writing, or whatever the
desired ability _ or the genes are actually re-engineered, Bergman
fears for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been an implied relationship between genetic
choice and totalitarianism that is quite inconsistent with what we
consider to be the social democratic principals we try and live by
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fear of the unknown. What good is sports if it turns
out to be a genetic competition as opposed to a sports
competition?''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said if society accepts genetic engineering, its
practical use would not be far behind identifying the genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If society does accept it, one can estimate conservatively
that in three decades it will be possible to do such a thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics aside, Bergman hesitates to discuss the future of human
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing,'' he said. ``I can't answer a
hypothetical question I don't think is ever going to apply. I don't
think there is going to be genetics aside, and I wouldn't be
surprised if there were people right now that are actually
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're not trying to give us Captain America.
</P>
<P>
   Even if genetics did not effect the future of sports
performance, the medical and pharmacology world will continue to
have a major impact on its development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs are the unknown factor,'' said Bob Girandola, professor
of exercise physiology at USC. ``Just the last two or three years
with this creatine, it's created a tremendous amount of interest.
It looks like about 50 percent of the athletes seem to benefit from
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, in five years something else may come out that
offers athletes improvement in certain type of athletic
performances. There's always something that comes out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Steroids have been the bane of sports for more than 20 years,
and no one has yet to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   Said Anita De Frantz, vice president of the International
Olympic Committee: ``The people doing the drugs that are
performance enhancing always seem to be working on the next
compound to try and trick any doping tests, and to say it's not
something that would be considered illegal. That's the challenge of
the future, is to really have ethical sports.''

BROOKLYN MAN CHARGED IN TERROR PLOT IS HELD WITHOUT BOND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Algerian man arrested in Brooklyn on charges of
being part of a terrorist bomb plot was ordered held without bond
Friday in a court proceeding that otherwise offered few new details
about the suspect or his activities.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Abdel Ghani, sat quietly in a gray turtleneck
sweater as his lawyer sought unsuccessfully to have the charges
dismissed, contending that the specific acts Ghani was accused of
had not occurred in Manhattan, where the charges had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate, Ronald L. Ellis of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, agreed that the issue was a ``close issue,'' but sided
with the government after a prosecutor said the case was properly
charged given Ghani's flights into New York and phone calls in the
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani, 31, was arrested on Thursday and accused in a criminal
complaint of being an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who
was arrested at the Canadian border near Seattle in mid-December as
he tried to bring explosives and bomb components into the United
States. Ressam is believed to be part of a gangster-terrorist group
with a base in Montreal, anti-terrorism investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, an assistant U.S. attorney, David N. Kelley,
revealed that Ghani, an Algerian national, had been in the United
States illegally. He said little else about Ghani, whose name and
phone number in Brooklyn were found on a scrap of paper Ressam had
when he was arrested, according to a criminal complaint filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said in the complaint that they had tracked
Ghani's activities. FBI agents staked out his apartment building at
944 Newkirk Ave. in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, went through a
trash bin where he had discarded several documents including a
ripped up plane ticket for a flight from Seattle to New York, and
ultimately established that he had been in Seattle, waiting to meet
Ressam, between Dec. 11 and Dec. 16, according to the criminal
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint charged that Ghani had knowledge of ``a terrorist
network of Algerian nationals'' that also included Ressam, and that
Ghani was also planning to travel with Ressam to Chicago to raise
money for the group.
</P>
<P>
   After court Friday, Ghani's lawyer, Roland Thau, of the federal
defender's office, said his client would plead not guilty to the
charges, including one that contends that he supported and
concealed Ressam's effort to carry out the bomb plot and another of
credit card fraud. Thau refused further comment about Ghani's
activities or background.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery about the defendant and continuing questions about
any broader plot only underscored Friday that his arrest may signal
the beginning rather than the end of a long and far-reaching
investigation into what the authorities described as a
well-organized Algerian group with anti-American aims.
</P>
<P>
   The government, for example, has not said whether Ghani is a
member of the violent terrorist organization in Algeria called the
Armed Islamic Group. A Canadian woman arrested last month as she
crossed the border into Vermont with another Algerian man has been
described by the authorities as having ties to two members of the
Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. intelligence official has said that the CIA's latest
assessment is still that the Armed Islamic Group, as an
organization, is not coordinating attacks against the United
States, although members of the group may be involved in carrying
out attacks on their own.
</P>
<P>
   An official has said that contingency plans to arrest Ghani had
been in place for several days. That raised the possibility that
the authorities timed Ghani's arrest to coincide with planning for
the millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came on a day when the FBI questioned, and in some
cases held, Algerian immigrants in several cities. Federal agents
indicated privately that they had intended the sweep as a warning
or deterrent to potential terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Manhattan announcing Ghani's arrest,
both the police commissioner, Howard Safir, and Lewis D. Schiliro,
the assistant director of the FBI in charge of the New York office,
opened their remarks by stressing that New York would be safe for a
festive New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   They each also repeated that there was no evidence of specific
credible threats to New York City or its environs, and Schiliro
said that no explosives or explosive devices had been found in
connection with the arrest and investigation of Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Thau challenged the evidence against Ghani, saying
there was ``not an iota of factual assertion in the complaint
showing that the defendant assisted Mr. Ressam.''
</P>
<P>
   Thau said that the detailed criminal complaint, based on an
affidavit filed by an FBI agent, ``does not even assert that the
defendant ever met Mr. Ressam or spoke with him or communicated
with him in any fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor, Kelley, disagreed, and added that Ghani had
sought to conceal his role in the plot, traveling under an assumed
name, and later destroying his airplane ticket.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Brooklyn Friday, Newkirk Avenue residents said they had
noticed what they believed to be undercover officers in the
neighborhood for at least a week. Plainclothes officers sat in
unmarked cars, they said, and a small plane even repeatedly circled
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the residents interviewed said they knew the men
apprehended _ the authorities had initially detained a total of
four men _ and believed they were innocent. They said they feared
that the arrests would only add to bias against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are giving the impression that all Muslims are involved
in terrorism,'' said Tariq Mahood Khokhar as he walked down Newkirk
Avenue late Thursday night from his mosque. He said one of the men
taken into custody had worked at a corner convenience store and had
never been involved in any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a police state,'' Khokhar said. ``Why are they blaming
Muslims?''
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the door at the apartment where the arrest
occurred said late Thursday night that he had no comment. The door
to the apartment _ which still had a large hole where the lock had
been ripped out _ had been propped shut.

<P>
   Vladimir Putin is Russia's Mr. Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone admires him. Like a young prince, he exudes the charm
of political freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Constantly on the move, this man with a sailor's gait still
appears to be shy, even though in a mere five months he has
ascended from being an unknown bureaucrat to prime minister and now
_ as of New Year's Eve _ to acting president of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And the people's affection for the young, dynamic politician,
who is never at a loss for words, has been growing even as he has
tried to avoid being labeled a Russian hero.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long yearned for light at the end of the tunnel, and
with Putin we have received hope that we are going to see it after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Putin, 47, a former KGB official and, more recently,
head of the domestic intelligence agency, has for months exercised
control of the military and much of the government's daily
operation, given the increasing inconsistency and infirmity of the
68-year-old Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I honestly believe, Putin is ready to work selflessly
for the good of this humiliated country.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who think that Putin's popularity is
exclusively the result of the Chechen factor _ that is, his tough
prosecution of what the Kremlin has called a ``fight against
Islamic bandits and terrorists'' in the rebellious republic of
Chechnya. I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the focus of many old and new aspirations of the
Russian people: for a strong arm, for youthfulness and integrity of
political leadership, and for national revival. Liberals and
patriots, pro-marketeers and statists, rich and poor, generals and
human-rights activists are equally willing to stake their hopes on
him.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin showed the rare talent of being all
things to all men. Placing their bets on him were men as different
as media mogul Boris Berezovsky, economic reformer Yegor T. Gaidar
and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, who led a '93 coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In August, when Yeltsin _ with his corruption scandals, health
debacles and single-digit approval ratings _ abruptly named Putin
heir-apparent, it was predicted that surely this would nip Putin's
career in the bud. Actually Putin appeared to thrive on the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 19, when Russia's parliamentary elections were
dominated by the new pro-government Unity political bloc, and other
candidates who backed Putin, the Kremlin has been in a state of
euphoric glee. At last it found a winner! Although Yeltsin could be
rightly criticized for a lot of things and certainly lost plenty of
authority, it must be admitted that he was determined to keep the
country under control _ indeed to his last political breath.
</P>
<P>
   To Putin's credit, however, the hoopla did not swell his head.
He seemed little inclined to overrate his own success: One has to
hand it to him. Presumably, he realized that soon enough there
would be harder things to accomplish. Now, the most difficult
questions he may be asking himself are these: What is my most
effective political resource? How long will this training flight
last? What will I have to face when I touch down?
</P>
<P>
   Being a sensible person, Putin must realize that there is a good
deal of the irrational and fairytale-like in the popular affection
for him, which is generally characteristic of the Russian people.
Putin says he will improve the people's life, and they believe him.
He says he will get the better of the Chechen rebels, and everyone
gives a cheer. He swears he will uproot corruption, and we
desperately want to take it on trust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lurking behind Putin's sudden and effortless emergence are
some formidable problems. Suppose, as everyone is predicting, he
does win the election, which is now rescheduled for March 26, and
he becomes Yeltsin's successor?
</P>
<P>
   What will happen the day after he is installed at the Kremlin?
Who will be the first to enter his office and get down to real
work? Will he have anyone to rely on? His ``king makers,'' perhaps?
Or an enchanted nation of people who, having cast their votes, will
expect him to wave his magic wand and put all things right?
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd of eager political associates, itching to share
the ``spoils of war'' and bust through the Kremlin gate, there are
none disinterested enough to share the burden and responsibility of
stabilizing the country.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is one thing to say: ``I assume responsibility for
Chechnya,'' using Yeltsin's backing and power, but quite another to
run the country full-time.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Kremlin's aggressiveness in the run-up to the
December parliamentary election certainly was Putin's most
effective resource. The public was treated to a barrage of
pro-Chechen-war, pro-government, pro-Putin, anti-opposition
propaganda on the major national media outlets, which are
monopolized and controlled by the Kremlin and its allies such as
Berezovsky. But popularity cannot be kept up indefinitely by these
means alone.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, by tacitly encouraging the persecution of his
political opponents, Putin not only made powerful rivals but also
effectively brought them to a boiling point. Very soon he will need
to set efficient policies _ economic, financial, social, scientific
and cultural. Will Putin be able to mobilize the type of contacts
and resources he needs for this?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's political demise, as well as a ``change of guard'' at
the top, will surely reanimate the political power blocs that have,
especially in recent months, been deactivated and suppressed by the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Putin has won out because his approval ratings have
soared to a dizzy height. I am afraid that in the long term,
however, the backing of his newfound liberal Kremlin allies will
not be strong enough. Putin's political fate largely hinges on
himself. Above all, on his readiness to meet halfway those who are
currently, and somewhat artificially, presented as his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's tradition of intrigue and ugly power politics,
even if Putin does achieve success in the presidential election, he
will have an uphill struggle lying ahead.

 &HT;    CLINTON'S Y2K CZAR ABOARD DELTA FLIGHT AS 2000 ARRIVES
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD DELTA FLIGHT 1764 _ An ebullient John Koskinen, the White
House's Y2K czar, declared victory over the Y2K bug Friday night
aboard Delta's Washington-to-New York shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen told the handful of reporters who tagged along on the
flight that he felt like he had been ``completely successful'' in
the job President Clinton gave him nearly two years ago, heading
the President's Council on Year 2000 Compliance.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that it would several days ``before it is
completely clear that the problem is fixed,'' Koskinen declared,
``We've got the systems fixed, and we've got enough information to
the public so that there has been no gratuitous reaction to create
a secondary problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen was obviously pleased with the reports coming in
throughout the day indicating virtually no problems in computers
shifting from 1999 to 2000 as the New Year dawned around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest problem I've had today has been to schedule a time
to eat,'' he said. He brought a turkey sandwich with him for the
flight and tried to eat it as he answered questions from reporters
aboard the immaculate 727 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was originally intended to demonstrate the
administration's confidence in its Y2K efforts. ``I thought it was
important for people to understand that somebody who knew about
this was willing to do that,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight became for Koskinen a ``nice respite'' from a day
of meetings and conference calls as the New Year began in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, during the flight, he participated in yet another
conference call. Using a seatback phone, he spoke with FAA
Administrator Jane Garvey and Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater. Garvey was on a cross-country American Airlines flight, and
Slater was at the FAA Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The conference call began at 7:05 p.m. EST, just five minutes
after the world's airlines, all of which use Greenwich Mean Time,
flew into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviation has reached the year 2000, and I am pleased to report
to you and Secretary Slater that the nation's air-space system is
up and running safely and efficiently,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen acknowledged that people who feared problems arising
from computer chips imbedded in thousands of different electronic
devices ``would not be on this plane with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 157-seat aircraft carried only 11 paying passengers,
including three reporters. The flight from Washington's Reagan
National Airport to New York's La Guardia is typically filled to
capacity, according to Delta officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Koskinen, Flight 1764 was a victory lap. Although he
said he had been warning people all day that ``it's too early to
declare victory,'' he said of his own efforts: ``I wouldn't have
done anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said the success of the administration's efforts
``shows the public can handle and deal with complicated information
a lot better than people have given it credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted how only two weeks ago, news organizations were warning
of problems that ``did not materialize.'' But he acknowledged that
when he took on the job of White House Y2K czar, ``it was not clear
... that it was going to work this way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, there were people on Web sites saying it would
be impossible to solve this problem _ there would be urban riots
and it's time to buy a lot in Mexico,'' he recalled, jokingly.
``What the public wanted to know was that people were taking the
problem seriously and working to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tapped Koskinen for the job not for his computer skills
but for his reputation as a trouble-shooter, having spent nearly
two decades overhauling financially failing corporations, among
them Penn Central Transportation Co. and Levitt and Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen admitted on the Friday night flight that prior to
taking on the Y2K job, he had ``never used the computer to get on
the Internet or send e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen was met at LaGuardia airport by New York Port Authority
police with a bomb-sniffing dog. He conducted several interviews at
the airport before catching a return shuttle flight back to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As he boarded the return flight, he signed boarding passes as
souvenirs for some of the 17 passengers bound for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving back at the nation's capital, Koskinen took the subway
back to the federal government's Y2K command center. He said he
feared a taxi could not get through the crowded streets around the
Mall, the site of a huge New Year's celebration.

 &HT;    THIRD MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS CAST LIGHT ON TWO MEXICOS
 &HT;    EDs: This story may be updated at 12:30 a.m. EST.

   OAXACA CITY, Mexico _ As much of Mexico welcomed the Third
Millennium with fireworks, concerts and dancing, the celebration
was muted in rural areas by fear of rebel attacks and the so-called
Y2K bug's negative impact on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in this well-known colonial city, hotel operators blamed a
drop off in tourism on international travelers _ especially those
from the United States _ over possible Y2K computer troubles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mexico City airport director Roberto Canovas Therio
said 40 percent of flights on Dec. 31 were cancelled because of
``mostly last-minute cancellations. Many (customers) feared
traveling in airplanes that could fall victim to Y2K computer
troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, young Mexican boys in Oaxaca City celebrated the new
millennium as they do any New Year's Eve, by tossing firecrackers
in the fiesta-filled streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was a prelude to a planned massive fireworks display that
would take place over the colonial-era cathedral in the city
center, although many residents said they planned to celebrate
quietly with a traditional family New Year's Eve supper.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the more festive atmosphere prevailing in
streets of the capital Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The historic Paseo de la Reforma, the city's main boulevard, was
filled with tens of thousands of revelers, coming to see parades
and live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral bells rang in the main square, called the Zocalo,
where 300,000 people would turn out for shows by Mexico's famous
singer Juan Gabriel and to hear 200 mariachis sing Las Golondrinas,
a traditional song that says good-bye to the old year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the millennium fervor, President Ernesto Zedillo, in a
video-taped address, said, ``We are a country that does not measure
our history in months or years, but in millenniums.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican capital, there was little talk of Y2K computer
glitches following months of claims by government officials that
Mexico is among the most Y2K-complaint nations in the hemisphere.
It has installed computer programs to prevent banking errors, and
to keep the national stock market _ the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores _
from crashing on the new year's first day of business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mexico's central bank has gone overboard trying to
assure Mexicans that their accounts are safe from Y2K errors, and
urging people with accounts to wait until after Jan. 1 to make
large withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing that, you will have the security of knowing your
money is safe,'' said Gilberto Cavillo, the central bank's systems
director.
</P>
<P>
   Few problems were expected in more rural areas, like Oaxaca
City, where water and electric systems rely on technology that
pre-dates computers.
</P>
<P>
   A larger concern for the government is the threat of armed
guerillas of the Popular Revolutionary Army, or EPR, in the
mountain villages of the Sierra Madre del Sur in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed soldiers could be seen watching over villages near
Oaxaca City, thought to be rebel strongholds and stopping vehicles
at military checkpoints on the highways outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the government is bringing troops to indigenous
villages to stop the rebels,'' said Pedro Nava Rodriguez, director
of the Organization of Towns and Neighborhoods in Guerrero. ``But
they are violating the human rights of innocent people who have
nothing to do with guerilla struggles.''

&HT;     Y2K BUG HAS NO BITE IN THE NEW YEAR _ BUT SOME SLOT MACHINES GO
BAD

   WASHINGTON _ Most of the world rolled into the new century
Friday with only a smattering of Y2K glitches _ the most
significant at a Japanese nuclear plant. In the United States, slot
machines went bonkers in Delaware, as if to highlight the lack of
serious problems here.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese nuclear plant, the Shika Nuclear Power Station
about 170 miles northwest of Tokyo, lost its radiation alarm system
shortly after midnight there. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
described the system as a backup system and said it did not affect
plant safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 slot machines at three Delaware rack tracks temporarily
shut down Thursday night after the slots' time-based computer chips
_ programmed to read three days ahead _ became confused when they
rolled over to 2000. The slots were quickly repaired, according to
John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K command center.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and a host of other top government officials gave
upbeat reports all day Friday as the new year swept across the
globe's 24 time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, after the new century had been greeted in Europe,
Asia and Africa, federal officials reported no significant Y2K
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's been a good Y2K day for the world,'' Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. EST Friday _ midnight Greenwich Mean Time _ computers
that control airline traffic, power grids and military operations
appeared to roll over into the new year without incident. The
computers are based on GMT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said. She was
aboard a jet traveling from Washington, D.C. to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate his confidence in the air traffic control system,
Koskinen took a commercial airline flight to New York so that he
was in the air at midnight GMT. After landing safely, he returned
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen cautioned that he wouldn't have a clear picture of any
computer-related problems in the United States until late Monday
after a day of normal business operations following the long
holiday weekend. He said he would withhold any decision about
problems in the developing world until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also appeared confident that the United States would
weather the transition into the New Year with smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never felt that there was any significant chance that
the United States would have would have a major problem in the
infrastructure, either nationally or regionally,'' Koskinen said.
``And I continue to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Russian joint operation center located near Colorado
Springs, Colo., reported no incidents. The center was set up to
protect against any mistaken perceptions that one or the other
nuclear powers had launched a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Koskinen said the Y2K transition was `the biggest
management challenge the world has had in 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that industrialized society moved into the new year
without any problems should not lead to anyone to `underestimate
the nature of the problem that was originally there.''
</P>
<P>
   `Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits
``00'' as 1900 rather than 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Early good news came to the White House center as New Year's eve
slipped past midnight in Western Pacific time zones first. For
example, New Zealand celebrated the arrival of the New Year at 6
a.m. EST. As Japan, Australia and other industrialized nations
joined the '00 honor roll, optimism grew at the White House Y2K
coordination center that years of preparedness were paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the No. 2 person at the State Department,
reported that all 29 of Russia's nuclear power plants passed into
the new year without incident, a reassuring note because of concern
about Russia's attention to the Y2K issue and its aging nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen noted an increase in public interest in the Y2K
phenomenon as Jan. 1 approached. The White House Y2K web site had
about 250,000 hits on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guam was the first U.S. territory to make the transition without
incident; Koskinen said, noting that officials on the island
reported soon after midnight that a baby was born and an airplane
had landed there.

BAD TIMES FOR STORR

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jamie Storr looked lost amid the celebrating in
the Los Angeles Kings locker room after Thursday night's 8-2
victory over the Edmonton Oilers. Said he feels lost, too.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who took over as the Kings' top goaltender in early
November, was in street clothes, recovering from a concussion
suffered Dec. 11 when he struck his head on the crossbar during a
4-2 victory over the Montreal. Until Thursday, that was the last
time the Kings won.
</P>
<P>
   He started two more games he probably wished he hadn't, a 7-1
loss to New Jersey and an 8-3 blowout to the New York Rangers.
That's when he realized something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now it could be two weeks before he is just back on skates and
still longer before he returns to the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still isn't much I can do,'' said Storr, who has just
begun light riding on an exercise bike. ``I can't even push that
because I still have dizziness and light-headedness. I'm not sure
when I'll get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stephane Fiset hasn't played poorly in goal since Storr
went out, this is a critical time for the Kings at the position.
The club is expected to protect just one goaltender in this
summer's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, 29, recently signed a three-year contract extension. But
Storr, who turned just 24 last Tuesday, is considered the club's
future at the position. Now everything is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike defenseman Garry Galley, who is skating again after
suffering a concussion around the same time, Storr's next step is
adding a little endurance to his bike work. That will be a big day
and it still is a ways off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concussions are mysterious because everyone responds
differently,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``No two are alike. We
laugh because Jamie is a different kind of fellow when he's
healthy, but there is nothing funny about concussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Concussions are a swelling of the brain caused by a blow to the
head. Repeated concussions can cause brain damage and have forced
several players _ most notably Pat Lafontaine _ to retire in their
primes.
</P>
<P>
   Storr suffered a concussion two years ago during the Kings'
playoff series against St. Louis. Like this time, he continued to
play several games after the initial blow with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   After the injury in Montreal, Storr was cleared by doctors to
play against New Jersey and New York but was replaced after one
period in each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I shouldn't have done that, but the team wasn't doing
well and you want to help out,'' he said. ``You want to be part of
the solution, but I only made it a bigger problem. Now we have to
move slowly. It was great to see this win, but it was hard not to
be a part of it.''

RUSSIA'S NEW PRESIDENT STEPS OUT FROM THE SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS party name in graf begin.: ``But whether Putin...''
CORRECTS spelling of ``putsches'' in 3rd graf from end.) 
 (With RUSSIA-YELTSIN) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After the Kremlin's newborn political party registered
a thumping victory in parliamentary elections last week, reporters
asked Prime Minister Vladimir Putin whether his strengthened hand
might lead to changes in the government. Putin was
characteristically forthcoming. ``We'll see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That much Russia now sees, in spades. But in its new president's
fashion, much about the man who now runs Russia, and who seems
likely to win the suddenly scheduled election for the presidency in
March, remains behind a veil.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is extolled by admirers as the ideal man for Russia's
darkest hour. He is, they say, for a strong Kremlin, but democratic
to the marrow; dedicated to government economic controls, but
pro-market; former President Boris Yeltsin's man, but apart from
his infamous entourage of tycoons, schemers and supposed thieves.
</P>
<P>
   And that may all be true. But President Putin so far remains an
empty vessel, his public record distinguished mostly by a popular
but brutal war in Chechnya and an election victory this month
which, by most experts' reckoning, made a hash of democratic
campaign norms.
</P>
<P>
   His private record _ and much of it is private _ conceals some
15 years with the KGB, largely as an intelligence officer based in
East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to say who he is. He's just a nicely
wrapped package,'' Andre Piontkovsky, a political analyst and one
of Putin's most merciless critics, said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, he suggested, may be the kind of strongman that some
liberal and democratic reformers now say they long for: a leader
willing to wring the last czarist and Communist impulses out of the
nation so that capitalism may come to full flower.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who may know Putin best, former St. Petersburg mayor
Anatoly Sobchak, says that is simply wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak taught law to Putin at Leningrad State University nearly
30 years ago, and later recruited him to a mayoral team of
democratic, pro-market activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is relying not on the army, but on political power,'' he
said in a telephone interview Friday. ``He's created his own
political party. And he is planning to work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin certainly speaks the lines of a democratic reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Russian society does not identify a strong and
effective state with a totalitarian state,'' he wrote in a newly
published treatise on Russia at the cusp of the millennium. ``We
have come to value the benefits of democracy, a law-based state,
and personal and political freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``at the same time,'' he added in the next sentence,
``people are alarmed by the obvious weakening of state power. The
public looks forward to the restoration of the guiding and
regulating role of the state to a degree which is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is not made any easier
by the fact that his analysis is very likely correct on both
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Trim, blue-eyed, balding, and, at 47, resembling more an actuary
than a politician, Putin is by all counts an extremely competent,
cautious and intelligent man. Born in Leningrad, later St.
Petersburg, he graduated with honors in 1975 from Leningrad State
University's law department, where he studied economic law under
Sobchak.
</P>
<P>
   He did not become a lawyer. Instead, he joined the KGB's foreign
intelligence arm, the First Chief Directorate, and by various
reports, served in Moscow before being assigned to Dresden, then
part of East Germany, in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Officially _ and perhaps actually _ his task was to track the
political leanings of East Germans and their contacts with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, according to news reports and Sobchak, Putin was
involved in economic intelligence-gathering, perhaps the KGB's
central task in the 1980s as the Soviet economic engine began
throwing rods and lurching toward collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Leningrad in 1989, speaking fluent German and
steeped in Western business knowledge, and left active KGB service
to join the university's international affairs department. Then and
now, many speculated that Col. Putin remained a KGB operative and
that his job was to monitor the city's flourishing democratic
reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, a leader of that movement, was by then chairman of the
Soviet equivalent of the Leningrad legislature, and he hired Putin
as an aide. When Sobchak became mayor in June 1991, Putin followed
him into city government, steadily rising to the post of first
deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely known then as ``the gray cardinal,'' a reference
not just to his influence but also to his penchant for remaining
out of public view. And he played a key role in bringing Western
investors to the city, signing the American firm KPMG to advise
officials on economic policy and luring Germany's BNP-Dresdner Bank
to set up offices there.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday, Sergei Stepashin, a former
Russian prime minister and now a Russian parliament deputy from St.
Petersburg, said Putin had another nickname: ``Stasi,'' after the
feared East German secret service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In outside appearance, he is a calm, inconspicuous, quiet
man,'' he told the television network NTV. ``But his grip, which
was felt by all the financiers in St. Petersburg, was amazing.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sobchak lost a re-election bid in 1996, but Putin continued to
rise, apparently brought to Moscow and the Kremlin by another St.
Petersburg reformer, Anatoly A. Chubais.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's first Kremlin job was as a top aide to Pavel Borodin,
the Kremlin property manager who is now at the center of bribery
and corruption charges surrounding the vastly expensive renovation
of Yeltsin's residence and other official buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Putin rose swiftly through the ranks, first overseeing the
implementation of Yeltsin's presidential decrees, then in 1998
becoming head of the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service,
with a mandate to focus on economic intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   By last March, he was head of Yeltsin's security council,
roughly responsible for internal security and national defense. And
on Aug. 9, he replaced Stepashin as prime minister and Yeltsin's
heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin's political potential was dismissed from the start, but
wrongly. His aggressive pursuit of the war in Chechnya, which
followed the bombings of five buildings in Moscow and other cities,
blamed on terrorists, established his image as a tough and
no-nonsense leader at a time when Russians were seeking just such a
person.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin, a refined man by any standards, pointedly said last
fall that he would wipe out Chechen rebels even if they were killed
in their toilets _ a vulgar piece of Russian army slang _ he began
to rocket upward in the polls. By this month, nearly half of the
respondents in some polls favored him as Yeltsin's successor, an
astronomical figure in a nation where a politician with a 20
percent rating is considered a comer.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Putin was the originator or the beneficiary of such
shrewdness is less easily gauged. As a politician, his record is
mixed: He was one of the leaders of Sobchak's losing mayoral
campaign, and he oversaw a lackluster parliamentary campaign there
in the mid-1990s as a local leader of the pro-Yeltsin political
party Our Home Is Russia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, he has benefited not just from the war and
the patriotic fervor enveloping it, but from an economic comeback
propelled by a rise in world oil prices and a devalued ruble. The
Russian media, much of it state-controlled or under the Kremlin's
sway, has been equally devoted: Putin's fondness for running and
contact sports like judo has been lovingly detailed in front-page
photos and television footage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's new Unity party is widely agreed to have performed
so well in December's parliamentary elections because its
candidates rode the coattails of Putin's popularity and because the
Kremlin waged a war of character assassination, disinformation and
manipulation against its principal rivals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   None of this says much about what kind of president Putin will
be when, and if, he is elected and becomes leader of a vast nation
on his own right rather than by fiat of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak has no doubts. ``Together with Putin I went through two
putsches, in '91 and '93, and I know how he carried himself during
these trials. This is a completely courageous person on whom one
can rely and would never deceive you,'' he said. ``He does indeed
have democratic views regarding the future of the country. But he
understands very well that such a country as Russia requires strong
power. Without such a power, Russia will stop existing as a unified
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior administration official speaking on
condition of anonymity offered a Putin-esque assessment of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know him. He's a cool character. He's smart. I believe his
instincts are democratic,'' the official said. ``But we'll see.''

 &HT;    ATTN EDs: sub out final 2 grafs with grafs beginning 'In
Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem . . . '
 &HT;    RELIGIOUS FERVOR, HEIGHTENED SECURITY IN MIDEAST
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ New Year's Day arrived with two hallmarks of the
Middle East _ religious fervor and the security concerns that so
often accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, more than a thousand people _ Israelis,
Palestinians and foreign tourists _ cheered the new millennium and
watched small fireworks displays from the summit of the Mount of
Olives. They overlooked Jerusalem's Old City and some joked, while
toasting with champagne, that the ``messiah'' had not arrived as
some believers said he would.
</P>
<P>
   While New Year's might be just a turn of the calendar on many
lands, here it was seen in its more original form _ roughly the
anniversary of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   There were Catholic masses in the Basilica of Gethsemane, where
Christ is believed to have sweated blood. Protestants prayed in the
Garden Tomb, where they believe Christ was crucified. A few planned
to walk with a trumpet around Jerusalem's Old City walls, calling
in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   By a quirk of fate, Friday was a holy day for all three faiths
here.
</P>
<P>
   The focus was on the small hill-top campus area known to Jews as
the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram esh-Sharif. The site
is home to the rock where Jews believe God asked Abraham to
sacrifice a son and where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, more than 350,000 Muslims prayed there as part
of the annual holy month of Ramadan. Friday evening, hundreds of
Jews brought in the weekly Sabbath with prayers at the Wailing
Wall, a retaining wall at the base of the mount.
</P>
<P>
   But, there were also record numbers of Israeli police and
paramilitary troops on duty. About 7,000 police and 5,000 police
volunteers patrolled the night shift Friday _ more than four times
the usual amount. Many though, seemed bored, talking on mobile
phones and chatting with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem, police were searching
crowds at a New Year's celebration for members of the so-called
``Concerned Christians.'' U.S. authorities reportedly believed that
members of the Denver, Colo.-based group intend to commit violence
in the Holy Land in order to hasten the return of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several hours after midnight, the lights of Jerusalem
were still shining brightly. Emergency operations officials
reported that electric, water, traffic and telephone systems were
all functioning throughout Israel. The country had made extensive
preparations to combat computer and other infrastructure problems.
No problems were reported in Palestinian areas either.

   LONDON _ How do you plan to spend New Year's Day? Well, you
could start the day with a speedball, clock up some mouse miles
reading v-mail and go out in the evening to see your favorite
synthespian in a hotsy film.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose vocabulary is rooted in the Nineties, that means
you'll have a coffee with an extra shot of espresso, spend time at
the computer, check video attachments on your e-mail, then go to
see a box-office hit film with _ what else? _ a computer simulation
of a dead actor.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the future: it is now. English is already
assimilating words that spring from our obsession with the newest
technologies as well as our continuing obsession with drinking
coffee and watching fashionable movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographers say the new century is bringing a new vocabulary.
Inelegant as they may sound, hotsy, synthespian and cleffer are the
new buzz-words for dictionary compilers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced this year's Encarta World
English Dictionary, has 320 experts in 20 countries keeping watch
on what is fashionable in English _ now spoken by two billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   They have selected a top-10 of words and phrases that are tipped
to become part of our everyday language by next year and which are
to be included in the next edition of the Encarta dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we do speak millennial English, Bloomsbury's research
has also confirmed that many of us cannot spell it.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the new millennium, one of the most commonly
misspelt words is millennium. Many people miss the fact that there
are two l's and two n's.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion, say Encarta specialists (perhaps assuming that a
classical education is more ubiquitous than it is), relates to the
fact that although millennium and millennial have two n's,
millenarian and millenary have only one. This is due to the words'
different Latin origins.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rooney, editor-in-chief of the Encarta, said: ``The
English language is constantly changing and developing, so
Bloomsbury have initiated a worldwide language-monitoring program
to record how words are used, how meanings change and to look out
for new coinages as they appear in books, films, newspapers,
journals and, of course, on the Internet.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ Millennium bug viruses may have infected computers,
where they will lie dormant until Jan. 1, after which they will
wreak havoc when the machine is next switched on.
</P>
<P>
   The warning about ``millennium bug viruses'' has come from a
number of companies that write ``anti-virus'' software. They say
they have detected half a dozen such viruses, transmitted via
e-mail, and that more may already have been sent.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses affect computers in a number of ways, ranging from
wiping all the data on the user's machine, to having no effect at
all because of bugs in the virus's own programming.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses are intended to appear to the unwary user to be a
``Y2K'' or millennium bug problem, by not showing up until the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   All share the common trait that, on arrival, they do nothing but
check the year date on the machine's battery-powered internal
clock. As long as that is not 2000, they will remain dormant. But
as soon as the machine is switched on after Jan. 1, 2000, the
viruses will go to work and deliver their ``payload.''
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are small chunks of computer code, usually spread as
files attached to e-mails. When the file is opened the virus copies
itself on to the user's machine.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Viveros, group marketing manager for total virus defense at
Network Associates, an American anti-virus company, said: ``We've
actually already seen postings on some of the Usenet (chat) groups
(for virus writers and hackers) where they are discussing how to
use Y2K to `hose' systems.''
</P>
<P>
   David Emm, a product manager at Network Associates in Britain,
said the most dangerous Y2K virus identified so far was called
``Mypics,'' which would disrupt the internal clock after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at the Symantec Anti-virus
Research Center in Santa Monica, Calif., said: ``It's possible that
we could see 200,000 viruses around Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think thefears are being hyped, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are viruses which will wipe your hard disk on Jan. 1,
but some will do that on any day of the year,'' said Graham Cluley,
senior technology consultant at Sophos in Abingdon, Oxfordshire,
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``This talk of 200,000 viruses; well, there are 48,000 known
viruses in existence. It's asking a lot to expect 152,000 viruses
to be written in the next few days. We really aren't expecting a
virus deluge.'' &QL;

   David Emm, a product manager at Network Associates in Britain,
said the most dangerous Y2K virus identified so far was called
``Mypics,'' which would disrupt the internal clock after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at the Symantec Anti-virus
Research Center in Santa Monica, Calif., said: ``It's possible that
we could see 200,000 viruses around Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think the fears are being hyped, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are viruses which will wipe your hard disk on Jan. 1,
but some will do that on any day of the year,'' said Graham Cluley,
senior technology consultant at Sophos in Abingdon, Oxfordshire,
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``This talk of 200,000 viruses; well, there are 48,000 known
viruses in existence. It's asking a lot to expect 152,000 viruses
to be written in the next few days. We really aren't expecting a
virus deluge.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YEAR _ From the black drizzle of dawn until the pyrotechnic
spectacle of midnight, a mighty crush of New Year's merrymakers
welcomed the year 2000 in Times Square, the world's most famous
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by fears of terrorism or Y2K havoc, the Times Square
crowd showed every sign of being the biggest and noisiest ever,
bent on watching history happen, watching themselves on huge video
screens and hoping that friends and relatives were watching them on
television at home.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, at an early-evening briefing at the
city's command center, said that Times Square was as full at 5 p.m.
as it had been at midnight last year. ``I'm not in the business of
crowd counts,'' the mayor said. ``But the streets are pretty well
full.''
</P>
<P>
   The most die-hard of the revelers arrived a day ahead of
schedule, camping overnight in soggy cardboard huts and sleeping
bags, unmolested by battalions of police officers, in order to
stake out prime viewing spots for the party to end all parties.
</P>
<P>
   They won the bragging rights for being in Times Square at 7 in
the morning, when the year 2000 arrived in the islands of the South
Pacific, 17 time zones away. At that moment, with the sky still
dark and the streets rain-slick, the 83,000-watt Waterford crystal
ball was hoisted to the top of its tower to the strains of
Copland's ``Fanfare for the Common Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamar Stratyevskaya, 23, could have used a hot shower by then.
She had spent the night in a makeshift village of cardboard
lean-tos, just the sort of encampment mayors from coast to coast
have been trying to dismantle. She had brought soda, cookies,
noisemakers, a bottle of contraband Champagne and a quilt. When the
rain started, she moved under a movie marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know thought I was crazy,'' said Ms. Stratyevskaya,
a resident of Washington Heights in upper Manhattan. ``But
actually, it's kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Other less compulsive celebrants came in waves throughout the
day: families who wanted a taste of the excitement before
nightfall, when Times Square can become a rowdy place; immigrants
eager to ring in the New Year twice, once along with their homeland
and once in their new home; and tourists and New Yorkers alike who
wedged themselves into spectator pens set up by the police to await
the midnight saturnalia.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Rogers and Troy Blakely, sweethearts living in New York for
less than a year, ventured forth from their East Side apartment
shortly before noon, the New Year in Indonesia, for a quick peek.
``We came to see it before it got crazy,'' said Ms. Rogers, a
special education teacher. ``It was a fun feeling. And someday we
can tell people we were there at 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New Yorker with an appetite only for a glimpse was Diane
Keller, a social worker, who had a simple game plan. She would stay
long enough to shoot one roll of film, for posterity, and then head
for the sales at Lord &AMP; Taylor. ``I wouldn't be here at night, no
way,'' Ms. Keller said. ``I'll be home in front of my fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalia Aragon, with her 10-year-old son and several colleagues
from work, zipped in and out of Times Square in under two hours,
watching the New Year arrive in Southeast Asia. Then they all took
the train back to New Jersey for quiet celebrations at home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aragon kept the trip a secret from her mother, who thought
it was dangerous. One of her co-workers , Ed Czekaj, came despite
the objections of his wife, who hates crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this way we got both worlds,'' Czekaj said. ``Boom, boom,
just to say we were here, and then back to our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aragon would have liked to see her home country, Mexico,
usher in the New Year, but that would not come until after
midnight. Kazutaka Noma and his family were luckier _ they were
able to celebrate at 10 a.m., just as his parents were popping
champagne in Japan. A hail of pink confetti, meant to resemble
cherry blossoms, rained down on Noma, a graduate student, his wife
and their 10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By accident, an hour later, Li Zhong and Ke Xu of Raleigh, N.C.,
arrived in Times Square just as a million Chinese marked the New
Year in Tiananmen Square. ``It's incredible to be here and watching
everyone at home at the same time,'' said Li, a computer
programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists, as usual, seemed to dominate the crowd, many of them
college kids doing a cold weather version of spring break in Fort
Lauderdale. Typical was a pile of five young men, who had met just
moments before but were sharing an air mattress and what smelled
suspiciously like a marijuana cigarette. They boasted of long bus
trips to New York, pockets empty of money and all-night adventures
in Harlem and Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   A quieter group was the Thompsett family from Kentucky, who were
saving money by staying in a Holiday Inn in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and
hoping to catch a 1 a.m. train after watching the ball drop. They
reached Times Square at mid-afternoon, when spectator pens were
already full up to 47th Street. There, they claimed a spot, which
they dared not abandon, with a decent view of the ball and a
barricade to lean on when they got tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it's going to be long and boring,'' said John
Thompsett, an Army recruiter, as his children, Aaron, 13, and
Lillian, 15, rolled their eyes. ``I'm trying to get them educated
in once-in-a-lifetime things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janet Mouradian, a surgical pathologist at Cornell Medical
Center and a most unlikely denizen of Times Square on this
particular night, kept herself busy editing an Armenian play,
written by her New Year's companion, Herand Markarian. Dr.
Mouradian, an Armenian immigrant, had braved this scene once
before, in 1964, her first year in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what I enjoy in life and there's only one millennium,''
Dr. Mouradian said, undaunted by the crowded spectators' pen and
the hours of waiting, which had given her time to make new, young
friends. ``He's from Oregon,'' she said, her voice full of marvel.
``And he's from Alaska. And that one, next door, he's from Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking down on the square at intervals through the day and
evening was Peter Jennings, the anchorman for ABC-TV's 24-hour
broadcast. He would stand pressed to the bulletproof windows of the
studio, staring at the mobs below. They, in turn, would wave to
him, seeking the perfect position in front of an ABC camera so they
could simultaneously wave to the folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   The pantomime was a perfect metaphor. New Year's Eve here,
despite the extravagant performance _ dancers, puppets, souvenirs,
sound-and-light shows, commissioned by the Times Square Business
Improvement District _ is all about seeing and being seen. Thus the
run on camcorders at the electronics stores along Broadway. And the
posters (Mom, We Made It Fine, Trust Jesus, Sammy Loves Christine)
raised high to any camera nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Yury Verduga, a salesman at an electronics store, repeated a
conversation he had had dozens of times. ``Camcorder? $199? Let me
see it! OK.'' Also a fast seller, Verduga said, were disposable
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Many people came prepared with supplies to keep them
comfortable, occupied and fed: beach chairs and blankets, chess
sets and mystery novels, and munchies of all kinds. One family
turned a carton upside down to make an ad hoc picnic table, then
unpacked a loaf of bread, jars of peanut butter and jelly and a
half gallon of milk.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd for the most part was jolly. But not Shelley Brown,
from Maryland, who sat sniffling and hacking in a lawn chair,
wrapped head to toe in scarves and blankets. At her feet was an
overnight bag, stuffed with tissues and cough syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown had come down with the flu at the most inopportune of
times. But she didn't want to disappoint her husband, Ryan. ``I've
been talking about this for the last seven years,'' he said. ``I
grew up watching Dick Clark on television and thought it would be
so cool. We had to be here.''

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS LINK PLANET AS Y2K FEARS ABATE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As clocks ticked past midnight on Friday across the
planet, billions of people from all corners of the Earth joined in
a satellite-linked celebration of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside technical arguments that the third millennium of
the Christian Era will not actually start for another year,
hundreds of millions of people partied around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread joy at the long-waited advent of the year 2000
was tempered in some places by fears of terrorism and technology
gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 200 countries, governments, financial firms,
communications' carriers and airlines girded for signs of the
dreaded Y2K bug, which could cause computer systems to fail at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications, however, suggested that the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent stamping out Y2K software bugs appear to
have paid off. As the world's computers moved smoothly through the
transition to 2000, potential problems appeared well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said as upbeat reports about computer operations poured
into his Washington command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, banks, power grids or
other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that most worried Y2K experts _ Russia, Ukraine and
China _ appeared to have passed into the New Year with all nuclear
weapons, reactors and other vital facilities in good shape.
``Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' said Thomas
Pickering, the No. 2 official at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the tiny South Pacific island of Kiribati became the
first nation to see the dawn of the new millennium. It occurred at
5 a.m. EST. Kiribati was so intent on being the first that it
realigned its chunk of the international date line east by two
hours to stage the first ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   While Y2K seemingly fizzled out as a big news story, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin managed to startle the world on the last
day of the 20th century by choosing to resign after eight years as
leader of the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the New Year's Eve ceremonies, world leaders paused to pay
tribute to Yeltsin's key role in stage-managing the collapse, after
more than 70 years, of the communist-led Soviet Union and his
championing of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, President Clinton opened the extended
ceremonies on the National Mall during the morning, spoke to
children and to diplomats in the afternoon, and then hosted
millennial ceremonies late in the evening and into New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In his New Year's Eve remarks, Clinton returned to a favorite
theme: the need for national unity to promote racial harmony.
Citing the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us pledge that each year will be closer to this, our
founding principle. Let us pledge that the new millennium will
bring, in the words of the great emancipator, 'a new birth of
freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first family also hosted a special millennial dinner for
more than 300 VIP guests at the White House, followed by a
celebrity-studded gala and a huge fireworks display at the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a 95-year tradition, the single largest party in
the United States took place in New York's Times Square, where
hundreds of thousands of exuberant people gathered for a
24-hour-long millennium gala that went forward amid a large police
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II served as the
guest of honor at a so-called ``Millennium Dome Party,'' held under
the largest roof in the world at a newly built futuristic $1.2
billion edifice south of London.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated two million people lining the river banks, the
heart of the city appeared ablaze with thousands of flaming
beacons. Hours before a 200-foot ``River of Flames''' was set to
sweep down the River Thames at midnight, in a fireworks display
visible from space, police shut two London bridges to traffic
because of the crush of people pouring into the center of the
venerable British capital.
</P>
<P>
   The London festivities were to have included rides on the
world's largest Ferris wheel, but at the last moment the
450-foot-high wheel was declared unsafe for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   One time zone earlier, across the English Channel, the
millennial countdown clock on the Eiffel Tower, which had been
running steadily for 1,000 days, suddenly stopped five hours before
Paris ushered in the new year. A light rain failed to halt what has
been called the ``ultimate block party'' on one of the world's most
famous boulevards _ the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   In Vatican City, St. Peter's Square was packed with the
faithful. They held a candlelight vigil while listening to Pope
John Paul II issue his first blessing of the new millennium in a
halting voice just after the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 arrived in Bethlehem on the wings of 2,000 doves
released on the stroke of midnight in Manger Square. A huge crowd
gathered to celebrate both the New Year and the Palestinian control
of Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a New
Year's Eve call for the destruction of Israel, as millions
nationwide held rallies to protest Jewish control of Jerusalem on
what Iranians call Al-Quds Day. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Pyramids, built more than two millennia before Christ,
served as the focal point of Egypt's New Year's celebrations.
Lasers lit the ancient funerary monuments while hard rock music
blasted across the desert under the watchful eye of security guards
mounted on camels.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites celebrated New Year's Eve eight hours ahead of
Washington time after learning earlier in the day that Yeltsin had
resigned. Accepting the news in their stride, hundreds of thousands
of Russians threw vodka-fuelled parties near the blazing lights of
the Kremlin's onion domes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military leaders said the country's nuclear missiles
were safe from any potential Y2K computer glitches. Meantime, a
joint American-Russian task force uneventfully monitored the
strategic polar scene from an air force base in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   At the Great Wall of China, revelers in the world's most
populous nation lit up the clear night skies with fireworks and
dragon dancers weaved through the ancient parapets that stretch
across China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who heads an officially atheistic
regime, touched on religion in a televised address he delivered
moments before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight the people of all countries of the world, whether in
the east, west, north or south, regardless of their nationalities
and faiths, are elated over the arrival of this historic moment,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been fears of terrorist attacks throughout the world.
But the only terrorist activity came when five hijackers freed all
155 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines plane in Afghanistan after
India released two Muslim militants and an Islamic cleric, ending a
crisis that began on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At the bash in Washington, enormous crowds gathered for a
fireworks-studded evening of entertainment led by movie stars and
musical artists. The carefully choreographed show called for the
president and a group of children, at precisely 10 seconds before
midnight, to light a fuse at the base of the Lincoln Memorial that
would travel across the reflecting pool in a spout of fireworks to
the base of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The final ``Midnight Moment,'' held amid extraordinarily tight
security precautions, required 3,120 hours of preparation, 15 days
to set up, 135 miles of wiring, 26 pyrotechnists and 188 firing
cues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different sort of technological challenge that, five
years ago, caused the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, to
forecast that it would cost Americans as much as $600 billion to
fix computer programs that read two-digit ``00'' dates as 1900
instead of 2000 in the trillions of lines of code that make up
systems controlling everything from airplane traffic to banking
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the firm's prediction proved to be well off the
mark: The Department of Commerce currently estimates U.S. costs at
about $100 billion.

   The Great Pyramids, built more than two millennia before Christ,
served as the focal point of Egypt's New Year's celebrations.

blasted across the desert under the watchful eye of security guards

   Muscovites celebrated New Year's Eve eight hours ahead of
Washington time after learning earlier in the day that Yeltsin had
resigned. Accepting the news in their stride, hundreds of thousands
of Russians threw vodka-fuelled parties near the blazing lights of
the Kremlin's onion domes.

   Russian military leaders said the country's nuclear missiles
were safe from any potential Y2K computer glitches. Meantime, a

   Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who heads an officially atheistic
regime, touched on religion in a televised address he delivered
moments before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight the people of all countries of the world, whether in

and faiths, are elated over the arrival of this historic moment,''
he said.

<P>
   There had been fears of terrorist attacks throughout the world.
But the only terrorist activity came when five hijackers freed all
155 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines plane in Afghanistan after
India released two Muslim militants and an Islamic cleric, ending a
crisis that began on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At the bash in Washington, enormous crowds gathered for a
fireworks-studded evening of entertainment led by movie stars and
musical artists. The carefully choreographed show called for the
president and a group of children, at precisely 10 seconds before
midnight, to light a fuse at the base of the Lincoln Memorial that
would travel across the reflecting pool in a spout of fireworks to
the base of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The final ``Midnight Moment,'' held amid extraordinarily tight
security precautions, required 3,120 hours of preparation, 15 days
to set up, 135 miles of wiring, 26 pyrotechnists and 188 firing
cues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different sort of technological challenge that, five
years ago, caused the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, to
forecast that it would cost Americans as much as $600 billion to
fix computer programs that read two-digit ``00'' dates as 1900
instead of 2000 in the trillions of lines of code that make up
systems controlling everything from airplane traffic to banking
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the firm's prediction proved to be well off the
mark: The Department of Commerce currently estimates U.S. costs at
about $100 billion.

POWER SHIFT IS NOT VIEWED AS A THREAT TO U.S. TIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said Friday that
President Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation would not
dramatically alter relations with Russia and could improve the
chances that Moscow and Washington will break a stalemate over a
major arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   By advancing Russia's presidential elections by three months, to
late March, Yeltsin's decision might allow the newly elected
Russian leader to negotiate with authority Washington's proposal to
modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has objected to changes that the United States wants that
would allow both nations to field national defenses against limited
long-range missile attacks. Moving up the election could buy both
sides three more months to resolve the dispute before next summer,
when President Clinton is to decide whether to begin building a
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't misunderstand me, this isn't going to be easy,'' said an
administration official. ``But this gives us a little more cushion
before the president's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials cited no evidence that Acting President Vladimir Putin
would take a different view of the missile treaty than Yeltsin and
conceded that their hopes were based mainly on the notion that his
early election would simplify negotiations by taking them out of
the realm of electoral politics in Russia. (However, the issue
could remain entangled in the American presidential election.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If Putin emerges, he'd have the authority to make a deal that
might not otherwise be available, but it's still a very tough
issue,'' said Coit Blacker, a Russia specialist in Clinton's first
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In wistful tones, Clinton praised Yeltsin for ``dismantling the
Communist system'' in Russia and replacing it with a fledgling
democracy, largely glossing over major differences that have
strained relations between the two countries, including the
lingering tensions over NATO's air campaign in Kosovo, allegations
of Russian corruption and the grinding war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under his leadership since 1991, the Russian people have faced
the unprecedented challenge of creating new institutions and
building a new life after decades of corrosive Communist rule,''
Clinton said in remarks at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lasting achievement has been dismantling that Communist
system and building new political institutions under democratically
elected leaders within a constitutional framework,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by reporters why he admired the Russian president,
whom he has met with 19 times since 1993, Clinton struck a more
personal note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked him because he was always very forthright with me,''
he said. ``He always did exactly what he said he would do. And he
was willing to take chances to try to improve our relationship, to
try to improve democracy in Russia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yeltsin told Clinton in a 20-minute
telephone call that Russia would remain committed to democracy,
open markets and arms control, said Joe Lockhart, the White House
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with Moscow has soured in recent months,
largely over Chechnya. Visiting Moscow just eight days ago, the
deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, accused Russia of
``indiscriminate killing'' in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, knows
Putin from his days as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, Russia, and
when he was the rough equivalent of a national security adviser to
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first test, and a fundamental test of Russian democracy,
`` Berger said in an interview, ``is whether power is passed freely
and fairly from one democratic president to another in March.''

ANCIENT TEMPLE IN TOKYO RINGS IN JUST A NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As the monks in their long black robes and golden sashes
put the finishing touches on preparations for the New Year
celebrations here, there was little room for doubt that this was a
big day for Zojoji Temple, one of Tokyo's great Buddhist houses of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   There was the altar to be prepared in front of the huge bronze
bell to be sounded 108 times to relieve the soul of its many
agonies and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   There was the huge tarpaulin-like collection vessel to be strung
up and secured to gather in the many pounds of coins to be tossed
in offering. And there were the helium balloons to be filled that
at the right moment would carry people's prayers skyward.
</P>
<P>
   But as that moment drew near, conversations with the people who
filled the sprawling grounds of the huge complex to the bursting
point made clear that for Japanese, from the Buddhist cleric to the
high school lovebirds strolling arm in arm, the celebration of the
New Year, always a huge event for the nation's Buddhist temples and
Shinto shrines, was only incidentally related to the global hoopla
about the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every aspect of the millennium events here bore reminders
that Japan, more than any other place on earth, has managed to
absorb all of the outward trappings of the Western world while at
the same time remaining profoundly, and quite proudly, different.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Tokyo television tower, a replica of the Eiffel
Tower that glowed brightly close by at the stroke of midnight,
seemed like a neon advertisement of the dichotomy, as visitors
crowding the temple grounds snatched up the last of the white
arrows on sale there to be hung in the home to ward off evil, while
clerics blew the reedy, ancient court music, or gagaku, from their
flutes.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the sermon delivered by Kyoshin Todo, the
elaborately robed head monk of this temple, which was founded in
880.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 1999 years since the birth of Christ, but Buddha
was living long before then,'' he said, stooping deeply as he
clutched a long white hairy whisk. ``We have all _ whether Japanese
or Chinese or Indian Buddhists _ gone over to keeping dates this
way. If the Buddha were alive today, what would he think?
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't say anything, because he has a huge heart. And
that is what God is trying to teach us, that we must accept each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Japanese have a wide variety of choices for keeping
calendars, from the birth of Buddha, in 563 B.C., to the
imperial-based date system still in official use. This year is
Heisei 12, the 12th year of Emperor Akihito's reign, according to
that method.
</P>
<P>
   There are others, too, from the traditional Chinese lunar
calendar to the Shinto dating system, whose count begins with the
reign of Jimmu, the mythical, divinely born first emperor, starting
in 660 B.C. The celebration of the new year on Jan. 1 only began
with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar and other Western
inventions under the Meiji Restoration of 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the little lecture, which seemed in part a mild reproach
to Asians for having forsaken many of their traditions for Western
ways, seemed almost redundant, judging from the comments of those
who flocked here. Almost none of them said they regarded the start
of the new year as an entry into a new era in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mill, millen, millennium,'' Yaeko Mizoguchi, a 60-year-old
woman said, laughing as she struggled with the word borrowed from
English. ``We are Japanese. It is too hard to pronounce, and we
cannot be bothered with it anyway.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her husband, Mutsumi Mizoguchi, 63, a retired engineer, added:
``We have our own culture to live in, just as Americans have
theirs. We enjoy our own traditions, our own flags, our own songs.
When you celebrate your own culture properly, then you can go forth
into the world proudly.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they had been celebrating the New Year in the
same way all their lives. But young couples who turned out here in
large numbers showed no greater interest in the millennium and no
less fidelity to this country's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism came to Japan from China and Korea in the 6th century
and gradually took its place alongside Shinto, the ancient
indigenous animistic religion, as one of the country's two
principal forms of worship. Although it has not always been the
case, the two now live in a sort of easy cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese pick and choose which of the two religions to use to
mark important moments during the year, often on the basis of
nothing more spiritual than which temple or shrine is closest to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we don't have much faith,'' said Yukio Hoshi,
28, a salaryman who came to the temple to make New Year's wishes
with his girlfriend, Akiko Kuji. ``More than anything else, we've
come here out of habit. This is how you celebrate occasions like
this in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   At a long table provided for the occasion, the couple carefully
filled out cards listing their wishes for the new year and then
joined the long line to enter the temple where a golden Buddha sat
atop a richly decorated altar.
</P>
<P>
   Their wishes? ``Health for our families, success in work and
happiness together,'' said Miss Kuji, 25, tugging a blanket around
her shoulders against the cold.
</P>
<P>
   For most young couples, Christmas is the biggest time for
year-end parties. New Year's, by contrast, is traditionally a
quiet, contemplative holiday, when ancestors are remembered, people
seek atonement and make new wishes, and families draw close.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year I believe Japanese are seeking renewal
and spiritual refreshment,'' said Nichihiro Kuya, a monk who is
director of publications for Zojoji Temple. ``That's pretty much
the same thing that Westerners are seeking too, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the ease with which Japanese people
switch among religions, including Christianity, which claims less
than 1 one percent of the population as regular worshipers but
whose wedding rites are wildly popular here, he managed to find a
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese have a history of flexibility, and will accept
anything if they think it is good, whether it is Buddhist, Shinto
or a Christian-style wedding,'' he said. ``Of course we would like
as many believers as possible for our sect, but this adaptability
is a strong point of our culture.''

   The snow everyone had been waiting for all winter finally came.
The narrow streets leading down to Red Square, usually clotted with
traffic, were empty. For all its imperfections, Moscow on New
Year's Eve seemed suddenly, subtly perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites who would normally elbow each other rushing to work
flowed out of the subway station and toward the edges of the
Kremlin. All that had changed in Moscow and all that had stayed the
same in this decade of unimaginable twists was here.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the KGB building, an open-air disco rolled its bass
line down the blocked-off street. A 20-foot electronic billboard
pulsed, ``Internet. Da!'' And people gathered where they had for
generations to see in the New Year, which, for most Russians, is
Christmas and Carnival rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come here for five years, though there's more people
here now,'' said Sasha Zorkin, a 30-year-old wielding a video
recorder. ``I want things to work out for Russia in the New Year,
which means that obviously they would work out for me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense that all Russian preoccupations for the last
364 days had been cast aside. For a few minutes, this was not a
city where terrorist bombs went off three months ago. President
Boris Yeltsin's resignation was something to be laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great present Boris Nikolayevich gave us!'' said Aleksandr
Suldin, a Grandfather Frost whose cotton-ball beard kept slipping
off.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness over the course the country has taken was spit out.
Sweet Russian champagne and chocolates were passed around. The
bottle rockets each small party set off seemed grander than the
official fireworks. Together, everyone's screams and kisses blocked
out the Kremlin chimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some dared to believe in a better future after the century's
see-saw madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a horrible century for Russia _ it seemed we lived
well under the czars and are knocked down now,'' Lena Razumova, a
22-year-old unemployed French teacher, shouted over the
firecrackers and her friends singing next to her. ``But we've come
here to celebrate the New Year with all Russians. I'm an optimist.
I am!''

FROM SIX-GUNS TO CELL PHONES 
 BY DENNIS WAGNER  
  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(Phoenix) - Sometime during the 20th cen tury in Arizona, the
six-gun sur rendered to the cell phone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Old West faded into the sunset, and a remote territory
populated by Indians and pio neers became America's 48th state,
overrun by city slick ers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a young country like the United States, seldom has any
region undergone such a grand metamorphosis in a mere 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   We've changed the food we eat, the work we do, the clothes we
wear _ for many of us, even the air we breathe.
</P>
<P>
   A century that opened under the fist of Anglo males is closing
amid the burgeoning influence of Hispanics and with women occu
pying the state's top political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Many impoverished Native Americans have grown flush with casino
wealth. Schools and neighborhoods were desegre gated, deserts
irrigated into gar dens; family shops were replaced by superstores,
trails by free ways, cowboys by capitalists, tel egraphs by
satellites, ranches by country clubs. Television grew from a
novelty to a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   A region that Edward Abbey once described as ``an appalling,
burned-out wasteland'' is now among the nation's leaders in boats
and swimming pools per capita.
</P>
<P>
   But of all Arizona's 20th-cen tury changes, the most obvious
involves people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, Phoenix counted 5,544 residents. The first automobile
rolled into town that year, spell ing doom for electric trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Phoenix is America's sixth-largest city; plan
ners dream of bringing back the trolleys to combat traffic snarls
and smog.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was among the na tion's fastest-growing states in nine
of the past 10 decades. Its construction explosion now eats an acre
a day _ not just in Peoria and Phoenix, but also in rural burgs
like Payson and Pres cott.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wilder, director of the University of Arizona's South
west Center, says the paradigm shift was swift and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this century, Arizona changed from a place that epito mizes
the old Southwest to a place that epitomizes the Sun Belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's famous ``five C's'' (copper, cotton, cattle, citrus
and climate) no longer control the economy, he says.
</P>
<P>
   They've been supplanted by construction, computers and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Mining has been devalued like a copper penny. Ranching rode to
its last roundup long before Phoenix adopted the slogan ``From
Cowtown to Wowtown.'' Cotton fields and citrus groves have been
overrun by tract hous ing.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area towns that were once distinct have all blurred
together. You can drive from Apache Junc tion to Avondale without
seeing anything like a desert except for the xeriscape medians
installed by state government workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all urbanized into one big megalopolis,'' observes
Jack Pfister, a lifetime resident and an executive with Salt River
Project. &QL; 
CATALYSTS OF CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Historians, always argumenta tive, quibble over Arizona's prin
cipal catalysts of change.
</P>
<P>
   David Tatum, chief curator with the Arizona Historical Soci ety,
believes power tools were instrumental in a 20th-century shift
``from muscle power to mechanization.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robert Woznicki, au thor of The History of Arizona,
says the World War II arrival of military bases and high-tech
companies was crucial. Motorola, he insists, was ``the Padre Kino
of industries here.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Iverson, an Arizona State University history professor,
says federal spending _ on dams, railroads, mining opera tions,
agriculture, forestry and parks _ made Arizona possible. It is no
small irony, he adds, that a state renowned for political
independence was grubstaked by Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Creighton, publisher of Arizona Capitol Times and a 33-year
Phoenix area journalist, says the 1960s adoption of a one-man,
one-vote rule ripped power away from country folks and gave it to
urbanites, especially in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the greatest politi cal change in the history of
Arizona,'' Creighton asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever most prompted Ari zona's evolution, the human out come
is undisputed: A territory born of sweat and blood has been overrun
by city folk with mani cured hands and yards.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1940s, more than half the population lived on
farms or ranches. Today, the number is under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, of the UA's Southwest Center, speaks of a ``monumental
change'' from isolated families who lived off the land and helped
one another to urban transients who squeeze together yet remain
socially alienated and ``largely disinterested in their historical
antecedents.'' &QL; 
WAY BACK WHEN
</P>
<P>
   Real development began with prospectors in the 1800s, digging up
the landscape in search of shiny rocks. They found enough to create
a few gold rushes and leave a few ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1880s, cattle barons had moved in with monster herds,
creating their own rule on the range. But nature's laws proved
stronger: Drought and overgraz ing wiped out the grasses, eroded
the soil and littered the state with bovine skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   As gold and silver veins tapped out, a quest for copper brought
giant corporations with giant ma chines. Labor was imported from
Europe, Mexico and China. Com pany towns arose overnight in
Clifton, Globe and Jerome.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the railroads. Prompted by government contracts that
included millions of acres of free land, they opened Arizona to
more development. Settlers moved in to start tilling soil long
abandoned by the Hohokam.
</P>
<P>
   But nature didn't make it easy. The state's inhospitableness
prompted Gen. William Tecum seh Sherman to remark: ``We went to war
with Mexico to get Arizona, and now we should go to war with her
again to make her take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculators, always a fixture on the Arizona scene, didn't quote
Sherman in their brochures. Nor did they mention scorpions, rat
tlers and dust storms.
</P>
<P>
   Grady Gammage Jr., attorney and author of Phoenix in Per
spective, says land scammers ultimately helped settle this state,
attracting hapless immi grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the children of gener ations of con men,'' Gammage
notes. ``This whole place really is the product of real-estate
specu lation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, notions of manifest des tiny prevailed, thanks to two of
the key developments in Arizona history: dams and air-condition
ing. &QL; 
FLOOD AND DROUGHT
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, the Salt, Verde, Gila and Colorado rivers staged
periodic rebellions, flooding towns and farms, then trickling to
drought levels.
</P>
<P>
   Early settlers were obsessed with harnessing the water for
safety and progress. In 1902, Congress approved construction of
Roosevelt Dam. Nine years later, Arizona had the world's largest
man-made lake _ a mar vel of engineering, a monolithic start on
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing decades saw many more dams go up, along with a
Central Arizona Project that delivers water from the Colorado
River. Dams meant ag riculture and electricity, semi conductor
plants and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of Americans moved into the ``Nile of the West.'' During
the Dust Bowl era, refu gees en route to California stopped and
settled. World War II introduced Air Force personnel and suppliers.
Motorola arrived in 1948, drawing more industry.
</P>
<P>
   But summers remained hellish, until air-conditioning arrived in
the 1950s. First used to cool factories, refrigeration was a
godsend to homeowners and builders. Arizona finally had an answer
to the desert's cruelest element. &QL; 
CULTURAL STEW
</P>
<P>
   Today, Arizona contains 113,596 square miles of people who are
as diverse as their landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mongrel state full of folks who mostly weren't born here
and don't plan on staying. Each year 300,000 new ones ar rive and
100,000 move out.
</P>
<P>
   What some mistake for an Arizona identity crisis is really a
multiple personality. From Navajos to New Agers, the one thing we
have in common is that we don't have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Rootless diversity sometimes means conflict, often alienation.
Just in the past decade, Arizo nans passed a Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday, adopted an Eng lish-only law and fought over whether this
is a Christian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Goode, the former Phoenix councilman, recalls be ing
turned away from high school in Yuma a half-century ago be cause of
his African heritage. Today, Goode says, ``we have made some
progress, but we have not yet arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Gutierrez, a former state senator, says Hispanics
achieved stunning advances in education and economics here after
the civil-rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was, in the '50s, a kind of hierarchy where Hispanics
and Native Americans were at the bottom of the heap,'' Gutier rez
said. ``That kind of psycho logical state has been demolished,
wonderfully. . . . There's a helluva lot of reason for hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area economist Elliott Pol lack also stresses the
brighter side of modernization.
</P>
<P>
   As 2000 begins, Arizona's popu lace is more educated, diverse
and active than ever, Pollack says. Jobs are plentiful, crime is
down, opportunities abound. Even the state's environment has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy here has in creased 80 percent since 1900.
Residents earn about six times more in real dollars _ not count ing
the benefit of indoor plumb ing, modern medicine, phones and other
conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Those with nostalgic yearnings might recall that a century ago,
folks seldom had time for such luxuries. Instead, Pollack notes
bluntly, ``they were working their (butts) off.'' &QL;

BANK EMPLOYEES HELD HOSTAGE IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER, MATT STEARNS and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ Two female robbers held between four and six bank
employees hostage Friday night in a botched heist, as more than 50
FBI agents and Olathe police officers surrounded the bank.
</P>
<P>
   About 9 p.m. _ four hours into the ordeal _ two women left the
bank. One was a freed hostage, leaving three to five hostages in
the bank. The other woman re-entered the bank. Authorities did not
know whether she was a robber or a hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Police had made phone contact with the robbers, but declined to
describe the robbers' state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting demands,'' said Lt. Larry Griffin of the
Olathe Police Department. ``We're just trying to get them to come
out without hurting anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were called to the Bank of America at 175 N.
Clairborne Road in Olathe at about 5 p.m. after a phone call to
police from inside the bank.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said the robbery was interrupted by the
arrival of Olathe police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did try to rob the bank,'' Lanza said. ``There's no
indication it's related to Y2K or terrorism or anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said he had heard reports that a shot was fired about 5:15
p.m. inside the bank, but could not confirm them.
</P>
<P>
   SWAT teams from the Olathe Police Department and the FBI
surrounded the bank as the sun set on 1999 _ a year that saw a
record-breaking 71 bank robberies in the Kansas City metro area.
</P>
<P>
   But this bank robbery attempt was unique in two ways _ hostages
were taken for the first time in at least nine years, and the
robbers were women, Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a blue moon we get a female bank robber,'' Lanza said.
``I don't remember having two female bank robbers in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Lights on the side and front of the bank were cut off about 6:45
p.m. so police and FBI teams could take positions without being
seen by anyone inside the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But police said there were no immediate plans to storm the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're confident nobody's being hurt,'' Griffin
said, ``we'll keep talking.''

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS LINK PLANET AS Y2K FEARS ABATE
 &HT;    EDs: Updates Times Square crowd estimate in 16th graf.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As clocks ticked past midnight on Friday across the
planet, billions of people from all corners of the Earth joined in
a satellite-linked celebration of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside technical arguments that the third millennium of
the Christian Era will not actually start for another year,
hundreds of millions of people partied around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread joy at the long-waited advent of the year 2000
was tempered in some places by fears of terrorism and technology
gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 200 countries, governments, financial firms,
communications' carriers and airlines girded for signs of the
dreaded Y2K bug, which could cause computer systems to fail at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications, however, suggested that the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent stamping out Y2K software bugs appear to
have paid off. As the world's computers moved smoothly through the
transition to 2000, potential problems appeared well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said as upbeat reports about computer operations poured
into his Washington command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, banks, power grids or
other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that most worried Y2K experts _ Russia, Ukraine and
China _ appeared to have passed into the New Year with all nuclear
weapons, reactors and other vital facilities in good shape.
``Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' said Thomas
Pickering, the No. 2 official at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the tiny South Pacific island of Kiribati became the
first nation to see the dawn of the new millennium. It occurred at
5 a.m. EST. Kiribati was so intent on being the first that it
realigned its chunk of the international date line east by two
hours to stage the first ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   While Y2K seemingly fizzled out as a big news story, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin managed to startle the world on the last
day of the 20th century by choosing to resign after eight years as
leader of the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the New Year's Eve ceremonies, world leaders paused to pay
tribute to Yeltsin's key role in stage-managing the collapse, after
more than 70 years, of the communist-led Soviet Union and his
championing of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, President Clinton opened the extended
ceremonies on the National Mall during the morning, spoke to
children and to diplomats in the afternoon, and then hosted
millennial ceremonies late in the evening and into New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In his New Year's Eve remarks, Clinton returned to a favorite
theme: the need for national unity to promote racial harmony.
Citing the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us pledge that each year will be closer to this, our
founding principle. Let us pledge that the new millennium will
bring, in the words of the great emancipator, 'a new birth of
freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first family also hosted a special millennial dinner for
more than 300 VIP guests at the White House, followed by a
celebrity-studded gala and a huge fireworks display at the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a 95-year tradition, the single largest party in
the United States took place in New York's Times Square, where well
over a million exuberant people gathered for a 24-hour-long
millennium gala that went forward amid a large police presence.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II served as the
guest of honor at a so-called ``Millennium Dome Party,'' held under
the largest roof in the world at a newly built futuristic $1.2
billion edifice south of London.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated two million people lining the river banks, the
heart of the city appeared ablaze with thousands of flaming
beacons. Hours before a 200-foot ``River of Flames''' was set to
sweep down the River Thames at midnight, in a fireworks display
visible from space, police shut two London bridges to traffic
because of the crush of people pouring into the center of the
venerable British capital.
</P>
<P>
   The London festivities were to have included rides on the
world's largest Ferris wheel, but at the last moment the
450-foot-high wheel was declared unsafe for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   One time zone earlier, across the English Channel, the
millennial countdown clock on the Eiffel Tower, which had been
running steadily for 1,000 days, suddenly stopped five hours before
Paris ushered in the new year. A light rain failed to halt what has
been called the ``ultimate block party'' on one of the world's most
famous boulevards _ the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   In Vatican City, St. Peter's Square was packed with the
faithful. They held a candlelight vigil while listening to Pope
John Paul II issue his first blessing of the new millennium in a
halting voice just after the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 arrived in Bethlehem on the wings of 2,000 doves
released on the stroke of midnight in Manger Square. A huge crowd
gathered to celebrate both the New Year and the Palestinian control
of Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a New
Year's Eve call for the destruction of Israel, as millions
nationwide held rallies to protest Jewish control of Jerusalem on
what Iranians call Al-Quds Day. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Pyramids, built more than two millennia before Christ,
served as the focal point of Egypt's New Year's celebrations.
Lasers lit the ancient funerary monuments while hard rock music
blasted across the desert under the watchful eye of security guards
mounted on camels.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites celebrated New Year's Eve eight hours ahead of
Washington time after learning earlier in the day that Yeltsin had
resigned. Accepting the news in their stride, hundreds of thousands
of Russians threw vodka-fuelled parties near the blazing lights of
the Kremlin's onion domes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military leaders said the country's nuclear missiles
were safe from any potential Y2K computer glitches. Meantime, a
joint American-Russian task force uneventfully monitored the
strategic polar scene from an air force base in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   At the Great Wall of China, revelers in the world's most
populous nation lit up the clear night skies with fireworks and
dragon dancers weaved through the ancient parapets that stretch
across China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who heads an officially atheistic
regime, touched on religion in a televised address he delivered
moments before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight the people of all countries of the world, whether in
the east, west, north or south, regardless of their nationalities
and faiths, are elated over the arrival of this historic moment,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been fears of terrorist attacks throughout the world.
But the only terrorist activity came when five hijackers freed all
155 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines plane in Afghanistan after
India released two Muslim militants and an Islamic cleric, ending a
crisis that began on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At the bash in Washington, enormous crowds gathered for a
fireworks-studded evening of entertainment led by movie stars and
musical artists. The carefully choreographed show called for the
president and a group of children, at precisely 10 seconds before
midnight, to light a fuse at the base of the Lincoln Memorial that
would travel across the reflecting pool in a spout of fireworks to
the base of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The final ``Midnight Moment,'' held amid extraordinarily tight
security precautions, required 3,120 hours of preparation, 15 days
to set up, 135 miles of wiring, 26 pyrotechnists and 188 firing
cues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different sort of technological challenge that, five
years ago, caused the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, to
forecast that it would cost Americans as much as $600 billion to
fix computer programs that read two-digit ``00'' dates as 1900
instead of 2000 in the trillions of lines of code that make up
systems controlling everything from airplane traffic to banking
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many computer experts feared programmers would not
be able to complete the job by 2000, especially in poorer
countries. But international cooperation appears to have paid off,
with richer countries helping poorer ones move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the firm's prediction proved to be well off the
mark: The Department of Commerce currently estimates U.S. costs at
about $100 billion.

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS LINK PLANET AS Y2K FEARS ABATE
 &HT;    EDs: Updates Times Square crowd estimate in 16th graf.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As clocks ticked past midnight on Friday across the
planet, billions of people from all corners of the Earth joined in
a satellite-linked celebration of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside technical arguments that the third millennium of
the Christian Era will not actually start for another year,
hundreds of millions of people partied around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread joy at the long-waited advent of the year 2000
was tempered in some places by fears of terrorism and technology
gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 200 countries, governments, financial firms,
communications' carriers and airlines girded for signs of the
dreaded Y2K bug, which could cause computer systems to fail at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications, however, suggested that the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent stamping out Y2K software bugs appear to
have paid off. As the world's computers moved smoothly through the
transition to 2000, potential problems appeared well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has been well spent,'' John Koskinen, the nation's
Y2K czar, said as upbeat reports about computer operations poured
into his Washington command post. As midnight struck in one country
after another around the world, no governments reported significant
problems with telecommunications systems, banks, power grids or
other vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, warned Americans not to relax entirely. The full impact
of the Y2K software flaw may not be felt until factories and
offices open for business next week.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that most worried Y2K experts _ Russia, Ukraine and
China _ appeared to have passed into the New Year with all nuclear
weapons, reactors and other vital facilities in good shape.
``Nothing out of the ordinary has been experienced,'' said Thomas
Pickering, the No. 2 official at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the tiny South Pacific island of Kiribati became the
first nation to see the dawn of the new millennium. It occurred at
5 a.m. EST. Kiribati was so intent on being the first that it
realigned its chunk of the international date line east by two
hours to stage the first ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   While Y2K seemingly fizzled out as a big news story, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin managed to startle the world on the last
day of the 20th century by choosing to resign after eight years as
leader of the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the New Year's Eve ceremonies, world leaders paused to pay
tribute to Yeltsin's key role in stage-managing the collapse, after
more than 70 years, of the communist-led Soviet Union and his
championing of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, President Clinton opened the extended
ceremonies on the National Mall during the morning, spoke to
children and to diplomats in the afternoon, and then hosted
millennial ceremonies late in the evening and into New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In his New Year's Eve remarks, Clinton returned to a favorite
theme: the need for national unity to promote racial harmony.
Citing the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us pledge that each year will be closer to this, our
founding principle. Let us pledge that the new millennium will
bring, in the words of the great emancipator, 'a new birth of
freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first family also hosted a special millennial dinner for
more than 300 VIP guests at the White House, followed by a
celebrity-studded gala and a huge fireworks display at the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a 95-year tradition, the single largest party in
the United States took place in New York's Times Square, where well
over a million exuberant people gathered for a 24-hour-long
millennium gala that went forward amid a large police presence.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II served as the
guest of honor at a so-called ``Millennium Dome Party,'' held under
the largest roof in the world at a newly built futuristic $1.2
billion edifice south of London.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated two million people lining the river banks, the
heart of the city appeared ablaze with thousands of flaming
beacons. Hours before a 200-foot ``River of Flames''' was set to
sweep down the River Thames at midnight, in a fireworks display
visible from space, police shut two London bridges to traffic
because of the crush of people pouring into the center of the
venerable British capital.
</P>
<P>
   The London festivities were to have included rides on the
world's largest Ferris wheel, but at the last moment the
450-foot-high wheel was declared unsafe for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   One time zone earlier, across the English Channel, the
millennial countdown clock on the Eiffel Tower, which had been
running steadily for 1,000 days, suddenly stopped five hours before
Paris ushered in the new year. A light rain failed to halt what has
been called the ``ultimate block party'' on one of the world's most
famous boulevards _ the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   In Vatican City, St. Peter's Square was packed with the
faithful. They held a candlelight vigil while listening to Pope
John Paul II issue his first blessing of the new millennium in a
halting voice just after the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 arrived in Bethlehem on the wings of 2,000 doves
released on the stroke of midnight in Manger Square. A huge crowd
gathered to celebrate both the New Year and the Palestinian control
of Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a New
Year's Eve call for the destruction of Israel, as millions
nationwide held rallies to protest Jewish control of Jerusalem on
what Iranians call Al-Quds Day. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Pyramids, built more than two millennia before Christ,
served as the focal point of Egypt's New Year's celebrations.
Lasers lit the ancient funerary monuments while hard rock music
blasted across the desert under the watchful eye of security guards
mounted on camels.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites celebrated New Year's Eve eight hours ahead of
Washington time after learning earlier in the day that Yeltsin had
resigned. Accepting the news in their stride, hundreds of thousands
of Russians threw vodka-fuelled parties near the blazing lights of
the Kremlin's onion domes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military leaders said the country's nuclear missiles
were safe from any potential Y2K computer glitches. Meantime, a
joint American-Russian task force uneventfully monitored the
strategic polar scene from an air force base in Colorado.
</P>

AGREEMENT TO LIMIT TAX INCENTIVES FALLS BY THE WAYSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER and MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City-area leaders are scrapping an
ineffective truce designed to discourage local governments from
using tax incentives to entice businesses from neighboring cities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, brokered by the Mid-America Regional Council
nearly three years ago, was touted as a treaty to curb
cross-boundary business raids. Nineteen cities and five counties
adopted the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kansas City Metropolitan Alliance for Economic
Cooperation has done little to limit tax breaks, because businesses
are savvy at playing growth-hungry communities against each other
to get incentives.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, area politicians and economic development officials
are not extending the truce, which expires today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is here on paper is a soft agreement,'' said David Warm,
executive director of the MARC. ``As soft as the agreement was, it
was very hard to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   While forging the agreement, many leaders balked at provisions
that would have required cities to conduct a cost-benefit analysis
of tax breaks and to share information regarding incentives offered
to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe, Kan., for example, did not join in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe Mayor Larry Campbell said the goals of the agreement did
not mesh well with what his city has been trying to accomplish. His
city gave out 15 tax abatements between 1993 and 1998 in hopes of
building up a commercial tax base to help support public services
demanded by booming residential growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a mode where we've got to attract commercial
business, and the tax incentives that we offer is the way we do
it,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get everyone to do away with abatements, we
should,'' Campbell said. ``If (the agreement) would have achieved
that, then that's a whole different story. But it wasn't going to
achieve it. It wasn't practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Development lawyer Charles Miller said the agreement did not
have a noticeable impact on how cities dealt with businesses
regarding tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anybody say to me, `We're not going to do this
or that because of this agreement,' '' Miller said. ``I've never
had anybody bring it up as part of our discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cities would contact other cities when a company was about
to relocate and receive tax breaks, Miller said, but that was ``to
minimize the appearance of plundering another city's tax base.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Miller said such a limited metropolitan area agreement
could not eliminate a bigger issue - the use of tax breaks in
cities across the country. He said the only resolution is a
``global settlement'' at the federal level that restricts the use
of tax breaks nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The MARC-brokered agreement did not prohibit cities from
offering tax breaks, but it encouraged leaders to share information
about incentives awarded throughout the metropolitan area. Many
leaders said they thought that the MARC would collect and compile
that data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policies are great, but unless there's some accountability to
make sure you're following them and measuring them, I am not sure
it was very valuable time that was spent discussing it in cities
around the area,'' said Overland Park, Kan., City Council President
Greg Musil.
</P>
<P>
   Warm said the agreement had not been intended to set standards
or set up MARC as a clearinghouse for information.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's simple rules urged cities to talk to each other,
to put economic-development policies in writing, to analyze the
effectiveness of incentives and to create an annual report of tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Cities interpreted those rules differently. Some cities filed
copies of their economic policies in MARC's office, while others
maintained their own records.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, which has been the area's most aggressive purveyor
of tax breaks as it attempts to rebuild older parts of the city,
simply did not provide information to MARC. Instead, the city kept
records on file with each agency that handles tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Manager Bob Collins said the agreement was only
marginally effective because corporate executives shop to find the
biggest tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Farmland Industries Inc. is building a new
headquarters near Kansas City International Airport. The
farmer-owned cooperative considered sites on the Kansas side of the
state line before accepting a package of tax breaks worth about $10
million from Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox Electric, now called Airsys ATM Inc., reviewed proposals
from Lee's Summit and Shawnee, Kan., before leaving Kansas City for
a new tax-abated building in Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   Shawnee also gave $1.5 million in tax incentives for Harte Hanks
Kansas City to move its office space from Lenexa and Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Before the MARC-brokered metropolitan area agreement, Lenexa
City Administrator David Watkins said Missouri cities would send
letters directly to Lenexa businesses encouraging them to move
across the state line. Since the MARC agreement, Watkins said, that
practice has stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But Watkins said there's not much that can be done if cities
want to use tax breaks in hopes of building their tax base.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just come to accept it and hope in the long run that
communities...quit relying on incentives as much as they have,''
Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's Summit Mayor Karen Messerli noted that her city,
Independence and Blue Springs have an agreement not to actively
recruit businesses away from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Messerli also questioned MARC's ability to hold cities
accountable throughout the wider metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the enforcement?'' Messerli asked. ``Where's the
ability that MARC has to hold someone accountable and say, `You did
not live up to the terms of this agreement'?''
</P>
<P>
   In light of such skepticism, MARC officials have concluded that
the agreement should expire today without follow-up studies. Warm
said the group might reconsider the issue of incentives at a later
date, but the study is not a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a non-issue as it's not a front-and-center
issue,'' Warm said. ``The concept of an agreement has taken us as
far as we could go.''

Y2K WATCH: HIGHLIGHTS AS THE BUG BITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so this isn't the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   But after covering this year 2000 thing for nearly 17 months,
it's time for the first and only Bug Bite Highlights, our way of
drawing attention to the good, bad and indifferent of the Y2K
world.
</P>
<P>
   Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Lamest excuse to cloak concerns about Y2K...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to eBay, the online auction site. This notice was posted on
the Web site this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``The eBay system will be unavailable ... from 23:00 PST,
Friday, Dec. 31, to 03:00 PST, Saturday, Jan 1. During this
downtime, we will perform routine maintenance on the database.''
</P>
<P>
   Most off-the-wall Y2K prediction...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to Gary North, a Tyler, Texas, Christian-oriented historian
and poster boy of the Y2K doomer crowd. In a Jan. 7, 1999, online
interview in which he questioned himself, and provided his own
answers, North said:
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're saying that all production will stop (because of Y2K
problems)?
</P>
<P>
   A. Close enough to ``all'' to threaten your life and the lives
of a billion or more people. ... I worry about the industrial
world. ... Two billion people could die.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst financial advice...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to Y2K doom-and-gloom author Jim Lord, a Maryland software
consultant and author of A Survival Guide for the Year 2000
Problem. Here's his stock market advice from March 1998:
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is too significant that there will be serious, even
terrible, problems with the stock market and the economy in
general. I think the prudent person should get out. And I think
Dec. 31, 1998, is the latest point in time to pull the plug.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has since risen more than 2,300 points _ about 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ``why hurry?'' award...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to Microsoft Corp., which posted a Y2K fix for Microsoft
Excel 2000, a popular spreadsheet program used by millions of
computer owners, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Best-tasting glitch...
</P>
<P>
   Goes jointly to gift merchant Harry and David, and gift
recipient Teddi Oppenheimer of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Writes Oppenheimer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Had my first Y2K glitch _ and it isn't even 2000! Got a Harry
and David gift package for Christmas and a package of nuts was
included. On the back of the package it said, `Use by July 1900.' I
took a chance and ate them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst economic prediction...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities, for this report from March 1998:
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that we're going to suffer a year of
technological disruptions, followed by a decade of depression. ...
We're likely to be living in an environment much like the Third
World countries some of us have visited, where nothing works
particularly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni also gave his Y2K stock prediction for late 1999 and
early 2000 (note: the Dow on Friday closed at 11,497):
</P>
<P>
   ``A possible recession that would drag the market back down to
6,500 sometime in 1999 or early 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K hypester of the year...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to Mike Adams of the Y2kNewswire. From the beginning, Adams
and his followers have been convinced there is a conspiracy to keep
the truth from the American people. Although earnest, Adams began
each Y2K dispatch from a point of view and then tried to make the
facts fit.
</P>
<P>
   At his zenith, he accused Kansas City's Mid-America Regional
Council of orchestrating a conspiracy to block NBC from airing
``Y2K: The Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He also gave those conducting countless Y2K studies far too much
credit for the ability to sway public opinion and promote hidden
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Bungled information
</P>
<P>
   The National Emergency Number Association put an undue scare
throughout the country in the final months of the year when it
released a study to the White House saying only half of the
nation's emergency 911 call centers were ready for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Not true.
</P>
<P>
   The study, a simple, two-question Internet poll that went to
less than half the call centers, was poorly handled, admitted the
organization's executive director. Nonetheless, the results were
picked up without question by major news outlets and sparked many
cities to re-evaluate 911 readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, released Dec. 15, contacted nearly every one of
the nation's 4,300 call centers and shows 98 percent are prepared
to provide enhanced services.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up is the U.S. Navy, which released a study saying
many major cities were unprepared for Y2K. Again, the methodology
was flawed. The study assumed that in cases where researchers could
get no information, the city was ill-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Shame-on-you award...
</P>
<P>
   Goes to all the freeze-dried food peddlers who took Y2K for a
profitable ride. After decades without a major disaster to energize
their industry, the pinto-bean and powdered-drink set seized on Y2K
to make bucks. It happened in Kansas City, and it happened across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Best prediction about Y2K...
</P>
<P>
   Again goes to economist Yardeni. In qualifying his March 1998
prediction of a stock crash, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Might I be wrong about all of this? Absolutely!''

 Stock certificates, now a dying breed, have a fascinating history  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1972, author and business journalist Bob Tamarkin got this
idea of writing a book about stock certificates, those often
elaborately engraved and decorated pieces of paper showing we own a
piece of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until last year that Tamarkin and co-author Les
Krantz, along with stock certificate dealer George LaBarre,
actually got around to taking on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The result is The Art of the Market, an informative and
sometimes fascinating look at the history of designing and
producing stock certificates, which in our computerized age are on
the brink of becoming extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies no longer issue stock certificates,'' Tamarkin
said. ``Instead they issue electronic `book entries.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pieces of paper provide a unique glimpse of corporate
America. For instance, during this country's great Industrial Age,
some stock certificates depicted great columns of black, billowing
smoke. Now, Tamarkin said, stock certificates are environmentally
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Most early certificates reflected only shades of grays, blacks
and browns. But after the Civil War and then the Gilded Age, they
became more colorful and elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale interest in stock certificates as collectible items
first took off in Europe in the late 1970s, mostly in Switzerland
and Germany. Next came England. As supplies tightened there,
European dealers turned their eyes toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that determine the value of a certificate, besides
supply and demand, the book states, include condition, age,
historical significance, aesthetics, the type of company, the type
of engraving process and the quality of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Another whole aspect to the collectibility of a security is
signatures, Tamarkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes some of these particularly valuable is the
signature of some of the great capitalistic titans of America,''
Tamarkin said. ``Plus, some of the designs are magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Many also reflect changing social mores. For instance, when
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner was running his empire, stock
certificates for Playboy Enterprises showed a reclining nude.
</P>
<P>
   Once his daughter, Christie Hefner, took over, the certificates
were changed to show a robed woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an example of social sensitivity,'' Tamarkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that determines value is scarcity. For instance,
many of the certificates for Chicago area companies from the 1840s,
1850s and 1860s are scant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, a lot of them burned,''
Tamarkin said. ``Today many of them are difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The record price for a certificate for an American company is
thought to be $33,000, one bought by an American collector for the
Bank of North America. The certificate, dated June 7, 1783, is
thought to be the nation's oldest existing stock certificate.
</P>
<P>
   So does Tamarkin think his book will send people scurrying to
their attics, hunting through Grandpa's old trunk?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early yet to tell,'' Tamarkin said. ``There aren't a
lot of collectors worldwide, but it's starting to catch on. It's
still relatively cheap to start a collection.''

ANNOUNCEMENT ON MERGER OF KCP&AMP;L, WESTERN RESOURCES COULD BE MADE
SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An announcement about the fate of the
problem-plagued merger of Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. and Western
Resources Inc. _ possibly even to kill the deal _ could be made in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Both Western Resources and KCP&AMP;L have the option to undo the
merger because it wasn't completed by midnight New Year's Eve.
Western Resources said it wouldn't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to do the deal,'' said Michel' Philipp, a
spokeswoman for Topeka, Kan.-based Western Resources.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L was more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only comment I can give is that the board will carefully
examine all of KCP&AMP;L's options ... consistent with KCP&AMP;L's
obligations under the merger agreement,'' said Phyllis Tilden, a
KCP&AMP;L spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L shareholders who called the utility in recent days asking
for an update were told to call back next week, when more could be
said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which the utilities have been trying to complete
since early 1997, has been dogged in the past year by the plunging
price of Western Resources. Shares in Western Resources this week
dropped to their lowest level since the deal was announced, closing
Friday at 16 15/16, down 3/16. The stock had traded in the mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in KCP&AMP;L closed Friday at 22 1/16, up 1.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal had closed Friday, KCP&AMP;L shareholders would have
received about a third less than they were originally told to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L management cashed out most of its stock options when the
stock price was near 30.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L and Western Resources have two options to end the merger
without penalties. Under the first choice, the board of either
company would vote to end the merger if the deal wasn't completed
by Dec. 31. If they wanted to continue the merger, they would do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The second opportunity to cancel would probably come early this
year, just before the deal closes, and would allow the merger to be
dismantled if Western's stock price drops below $29.79.
</P>
<P>
   For some frustrated KCP&AMP;L shareholders, the time has come to
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to complete it or get out,'' said Stuart Johnson, a
KCP&AMP;L shareholder. ``I'm for getting out.''

 &HT;    MASSIVE CROWD GATHERS TO WATCH CLINTON IGNITE FIREWORKS
SPECTACULAR TO GREET 2000
 &HT;    EDS: Writethrough. Story will be updated at midnight EST.
 &HT;    With PHOTOS
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mild temperatures and a string of flawless midnight
New Year's rollovers around the globe enticed a massive crowd to
the National Mall for a fireworks spectacular ignited by President
Clinton to greet 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although daytime activities in the nation's capital drew modest
crowds, throngs streamed in by nightfall to find grassy seats on
the heavily-secured patch of the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   They choked into long thick lines through a handful of security
checkpoints where revelers submitted to searches. At one point,
crowds on 17th Street waiting to pass through security entrances
pushed through barriers and rushed past police who were helpless to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, officials had been scaling back the size of the
crowd they expected from an original estimate of 500,000. But as
midnight closed in, the streets teemed with people and there seemed
to be little left of the anxiety over terrorist attacks that
prompted the mayor of Seattle last week to cancel a major outdoor
celebration around the city's famed Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's three-hour show, with a pricetag of $12 million,
competed on television with the customary Times Square celebration.
While New York's gala featured the traditional ball of light
descending in the seconds before midnight, Washington's had a white
light of fireworks cascading up the 555-foot Washington Monument,
sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool from the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Tresca and her husband, Sal, of Rhode Island, left the
friends they were visiting in a Maryland suburb to come down to the
Mall where the gala at the Lincoln Memorial also was shown on a
large screen TV set up on the grass. Their friends wouldn't leave
their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too busy holding onto their bottled water,'' Diane
Tresca said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wasn't concerned about terrorism. ``No,'' she said,
``I'm more concerned about not being able to see the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at events throughout the day, Clinton made no mention
of the unease that had settled on Washington in the weeks leading
up to Friday night. Fear of terrorism pegged to year-end
celebrations focused on Washington, New York and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we celebrate did not begin today, and it will not end
tomorrow,'' Clinton said to a crowd at the Mall earlier in the day.
``There is no better opportunity to open a new chapter of progress
and possibility for all people ... no better time to be a truly
good neighbor to the people of the world who share this smaller and
smaller planet of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked God ``for this wonderful weather, so we all feel
good being out here. . . The sun is still rising on America.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sunlight faded on the day, the Siegel family of Richmond
played the card game Uno while sitting on the curb waiting, with a
few hundred others, to be let into a fenced off section of the Mall
nearest the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Actor and musician Will Smith hosted the three-hour stage show
called America's Millennium Gala. Clinton and other dignitaries,
including former Sen. John Glenn, watched at the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Among the performers were actor Robert Duvall, actress Diane
Keaton, and musicians Don McLean, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross,
Kathy Mattea, Trisha Yearwood, and the 25-member company of the
Broadway production ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Siegels weren't worried about the dangers of either Y2K
chaos or terrorism. In fact, they joked about the festivities being
hosted by Smith, who has played the hero in a pair of futuristic
space-themed films, ``Men in Black'' and ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought since Will Smith is the host and he's killed aliens
and space bugs, you couldn't be in a better-protected zone,'' joked
Dan Siegel, 46, who was there with his wife, Peggy, and children
Julia, 16, and Tommy, 14.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for danger made it possible to get a hotel
room within walking distance of the Mall just last week. And, in
their one concession to the Y2K bug, the Siegels settled on
Washington as their New Year's celebration destination because they
could make the trip from Richmond and back on a single tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case there's a problem and we can't get any more,''
said Peggy Siegel, also 46.
</P>
<P>
   For Benjamin McKenzie, 29, the trip to the Mall was just a walk.
He lives on Capitol Hill and brought his 15-year-old brother, who's
visiting from upstate New York, down for the fireworks. But he
couldn't get his friends to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said 'No way!''' McKenzie said. ``We know security is a
concern, but it's not overwhelming. It feels like a normal day.''

IN HUNGARY, NEW YEAR'S EVE PLANS GO AWRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the last minute, Hungary's millennium planners turned into
the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players.
</P>
<P>
   Two unusual events had been set for midnight: the first spin of
a giant Wheel of Time holding an hourglass containing seven tons of
customized sand, and a special session of Parliament to celebrate
1,000 years of Hungarian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Money and technical problems delayed the wheel _ it will ring in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Political wrangling put the parliamentary session off for about
12 hours, suggesting that Hungarian lawmakers do not yet have the
sense of television that their American counterparts do. The
livelier part of the event, the procession that is to carry the
11th-century Crown of St. Stephen to its new home in Parliament,
will still take place Saturday afternoon _ and there will be a
make-up party in Heroes Square for those who missed the millennial
one.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the high-priced blowouts in richer countries,
Eastern Europe planned relatively modest celebrations. And even
these were not spared controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw, Poland, held a disco party in Jozef Pilsudski Square,
which Catholic leaders and veterans groups condemned as tasteless
because the square contains the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and
Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass there twice. The stage for Boney
M and other performers was on the same spot as the papal altar.
</P>
<P>
   In Budapest, even the half-laid plans went awry. Just before
fireworks surrounded the beautiful riverside Parliament, the
subzero weather raised a cold fog from the Danube, rendering them
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   What would, in many other countries, be all the ingredients for
a riot were in place: Tens of thousands of chilled teen-agers
carrying yard-long cardboard horns, with which, by local habit, one
belts total strangers over the head without provocation. Crates of
$2 champagne on sale everywhere, the price jacked up to $4. Big
cherry bombs underfoot. No public toilets. And nary a cop in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, given the same provocations, the streets would run
with blood, suggested a journalist who had been belted for the
second time in a minute. ``But we have no guns here,'' explained
Zsuzsanna Langi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, in Poland we do this,'' replied Sylvester, the next
stranger to belt the same journalist, taking the opportunity of a
brief interview to bop him twice more before his horn was bent
double. ``In Poland, I do very bad things. But we don't kill.
Because in Poland to do such bad things is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it was a peaceful crowd of extraordinarily
happy drunks. In Vorosmarty Square, at the stroke of midnight, the
locals stiffened and sang the sad, solemn national anthem, ``God
Bless the Hungarians.'' And were walloped for it by visiting Poles
and Slovenes.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ They are the first college football matchups of
the 21st century, these eight remaining bowl games. All of them
promise to be entertaining, but only one will decide the national
title: the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore has already predicted
the upset of top-ranked Florida State by his No. 2-ranked Hokies in
the Bowl Championship Series title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt we will win,'' said Moore, this season's
Lombardi Award winner as the nation's best lineman. ``It's been a
dream season. It's going to be even better after we win and burn
down New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   But before those 11-0 teams match up, 12 teams square off
Saturday and two more Sunday for big bowl payouts and with the
hopes of moving up in the final polls. The best game of the first
day of 2000 should be the last one, when Alabama (10-2) meets
Michigan (9-2) in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide overcame a preseason sexual harassment
controversy involving Coach Mike DuBose and an early loss to
Louisiana Tech to win the Southeastern Conference and a berth in
one of the coveted BCS games.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Alabama guaranteed $11 million to $13 million (the
per-team payout in the BCS bowls), but reaching the Orange Bowl
demonstrates that the Crimson Tide is back among the elite after
coming off probation imposed by the NCAA. Michigan quarterback Tom
Brady, coming off his second consecutive 2,000-yard passing season,
will have help from running back Anthony Thomas, who has gained
more than 100 yards in each of his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Michigan wins will depend on how it handles Alabama
running back Shaun Alexander, who gained 1,383 yards in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Shaun Alexander very well,'' Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr
said. ``We recruited him at Michigan, and I've had a number of
people tell me that he is the best back in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big-money game Saturday is the Rose Bowl, where the
Heisman Trophy winner, Ron Dayne, and Wisconsin (9-2) take on
Stanford (8-3). The Badgers are trying to become the first Big Ten
team to win consecutive Rose Bowls _ they beat UCLA last January,
38-31, behind Dayne's 246 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just one of the best backs to play in a long time,''
Stanford Coach Tyrone Willingham said. ``He has the size, speed and
ability to anticipate running lanes. That's what really separated
him from the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   As if stopping the 253-pound Dayne is not enough of a challenge,
the Cardinal apparently lost an integral part of its offense when
the all-American wide receiver Troy Walters dislocated his wrist
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Nebraska (11-1) plays Tennessee (9-2) in the
Fiesta Bowl, the same game in which the Volunteers capped an
undefeated 1998 season by beating Florida State for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Tee Martin, Tennessee's senior quarterback,
will try to finish his career with a 22-2 record. Coach Frank
Solich will try to recall the Huskers' winning tradition. After
being picked by the legendary Tom Osborne to replace him as
Nebraska coach in 1998, Solich led his first team to an
unsatisfying 9-4 record. Big Red fans were not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but that's also why you go to Nebraska, because
there are those expectations,'' tight end Tracey Wistrom said.
``There'd be a lot of schools out there that would be happy with a
9-4 record. They'd think of it as a pretty successful season. But
in Nebraska, you're going to be looked upon as not very
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The early matchups, Purdue (7-4) versus Georgia (7-4) in the
Outback and Georgia Tech (8-3) against Miami (8-4) in the Gator,
feature intriguing quarterback duels.
</P>
<P>
   In the Outback, Purdue's Drew Brees will face off against one of
his probable challengers for the 2000 Heisman Trophy in Quincy
Carter. In the Gator, Joe Hamilton of Georgia Tech, the runner-up
to Dayne in the Heisman voting, might face the heralded freshman
Ken Dorsey, who is 3-0 after replacing the injured Kenny Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In the Citrus Bowl, Florida (9-3) will try to snap a two-game
losing streak and calm its volatile coach, Steve Spurrier, while
Michigan State (9-2) seeks its first victory for a new coach. Bobby
Williams replaced Nick Saban in December after Saban took the head
job at Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in the Cotton Bowl, Texas (9-4) takes on a former
rival from the defunct Southwest Conference, Arkansas (7-4). The
Longhorns had a major disruption in their preparation when Coach
Mack Brown suspended four players for the game late Thursday for
violating team rules, including the senior defensive lineman Aaron
Humphrey and the junior wide receiver Kwame Cavil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just held a team meeting, which was one of the most
emotional that I have experienced,'' said Brown, who was shaken and
tearful at a late-night news conference. ``This was the hardest
thing I have ever had to do.''

   Q-Unique, one of the rappers in the Bushwick-based Arsonists
crew, was home after a European tour, and he wasn't going to suffer
a bland reception. ``You paid some good money to see a show,'' he
urged the crowd Wednesday night at S.O.B.'s. ``Be part of the
show!''
</P>
<P>
   The fans soon complied. Q-Unique's command came in the middle of
the show's ``beat machine'' segment, in which the group's five
rappers create the sound of a percussion section, augmented by the
audience's singing. The first round hardly resonated, but the
second shook the room. The only surprise was that it took taunting
to get the response.
</P>
<P>
   The Arsonists hungrily absorb the energy generated by audience
participation, using banter and improvisation to cultivate the
excitement of a house party. At S.O.B.'s, the rappers were looser
than usual, often stopping in midsong to exchange barbs or rant.
But these pauses were part of the fun in routines that never quite
ended up where they started.
</P>
<P>
   Known for silly skits like ``Rhyme Time Traveler,'' in which
Q-Unique dons different hats and necklaces to enact a history of
rap, and ``Hip Hop Aerobics,'' a fancy term for getting everyone to
jump around, the Arsonists play the most boisterous, popular kids
in school. The crew's rapping style seamlessly connects to this
image; the quintet usually raps its choruses in unison, with
individual members trading verses with sparring grace.
</P>
<P>
   Their styles varied, from the smooth and mellow tone of Swel
Boogie to the freneticism of D-Stroy, whose approach recalled
another comical Latin artist, John Leguizamo. During ``Lunchroom
Take-Out,'' a boasting match between Swel Boogie and the guest
rapper Great Scott, D-Stroy occasionally burst through the banter
with hilarious off-color exclamations.
</P>
<P>
   DJ Daddy Dogg gently worked the turntables during the Arsonists'
set, showing skills but sometimes seeming overwhelmed. It isn't
easy to keep up with so much verbal gunfire. Spinning for the
opening act, Non-Phixion, DJ Eclipse had more room to create
intriguing soundscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Arsonists, Non-Phixion espouses an approach that values
complicated rhyming over easy hooks and live charisma over studio
wizardry. In between those acts, two members of the veteran Cold
Crush Brothers performed a short set, reinforcing another tenet of
underground hip-hop: that the culture's original passions, from
break-dancing to the hearty raps of such early performers, are
still the most potent. The infectious joy of the Arsonists did much
to fortify that message.

   The land that made Carnival and the samba art forms loves
nothing more than a party. So the beginning of the 2000s in Rio de
Janeiro turned into what authorities proudly called the largest
celebration in Brazilian history: an estimated 3.5 million people
lining Copacabana, Ipanema and more than 25 miles of other beaches
in an event that blended the spiritual and the profane.
</P>
<P>
   For believers of Candomble, Brazil's home-grown mixture of
Catholicism and African-derived animist beliefs, New Year's Eve is
traditionally the feast day of Iemanja, the fair-skinned goddess of
the sea who appears in the guise of the Virgin Mary and is
considered the mother of all living things. Beaches are always
packed with worshipers who come to seek her blessing on that night,
but with the celebration of the millennium, everything that has
gone on in the past was multiplied.
</P>
<P>
   The day had been cloudless and sunny; the hottest of the summer
so far. Rio's beaches were crowded with sunbathers, surfers and
volleyball and paddleball players.
</P>
<P>
   But as the sun dipped over Gavea Peak and sank into the sea, the
sportsmen retired, a cooling breeze appeared and individuals,
couples and entire families began emerging from apartments,
restaurants, buses or the subway and streaming to the shore.
</P>
<P>
   To turn away from the sea was to glimpse silhouetted figures
clinking their glasses, dancing and kissing as they watched the
goings-on from the verandas of million-dollar apartments in
Ipanema.
</P>
<P>
   At the water's edge, though, the scene was largely one of piety,
as devotees of Iemanja stood quietly, their heads bowed and arms
outstretched, and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike were dressed entirely in white in deference
to Iemanja. Many of the bouquets of roses, lilies, carnations and
gladioli they carried also were white, and were ceremoniously
thrown into the Atlantic as offerings to the goddess. Other
worshipers tossed wads of money or even pieces of jewelry into the
sea in her honor, or let the waves wash over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new millennium, a new start,'' said Maria Zenaida Rodrigues
Alves as she emerged soaked from the surf. ``I have washed away my
sins and the Lady of the Sea has made me a new person.''
</P>
<P>
   Delia Correia Costa put it another way: ``If we cleanse
ourselves at the start of this new millennium, then maybe the world
can also be cleansed and we can usher in an era of universal peace
and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar celebrations were going on in other cities along
Brazil's 4,000 miles of coastline, but Copacabana was clearly the
focal point of the nation's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen cruise ships and assorted yachts and sailboats
floated just offshore, hundreds of jet-setters and political
dignitaries joined President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in a special
tent set up at Fort Copacabana, and some of Brazil's most renowned
pop music stars performed on stages that had been erected at four
points along the beach. &UR;  &LR; To cap things off, an ornate 20-minute
fireworks display began prompt- ly at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the working poor, though, the night was primarily a
chance to make a little money. They circulated among the revelers,
selling coconuts, ears of corn, beer, soft drinks and even bottles
of Champagne. ``Whether it is 1999 or 2000, I still have to put
food in the mouths of my children,'' said Jose Ovidio Ramos
Mendonca, a vendor of grilled meats. ``I can always rest
tomorrow.''

ANALYSIS: IN ADS, CANDIDATES' GLOVES STAY ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a new commercial running in early primary states this past
week, Gov. George W. Bush comes out squarely in favor of phonics.
``See,'' he explains, ``I believe every child can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's two leading rivals for the Republican presidential
nomination, Sen. John McCain and Steve Forbes, as well as Vice
President Al Gore, unveiled spots this week in which they reaffirm
their vows to continue sending monthly government checks to retired
people.
</P>
<P>
   And in a new infomercial-length advertisement on cable channels
in Iowa, Bill Bradley lays out a major rationale for his challenge
to Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be president of the United States,'' Bradley says,
``in order to use the power of that office to do good.''
</P>
<P>
   Few in the political world can recall a competitive primary
season in which the candidates were so eager to spend so much to
say so little. Fearful, it seems, of being labeled the first to
``go negative'' with advertising, and thus draw the enmity of a
public that is perceived to be fed up with divisive messages, the
candidates are spending millions of dollars on a cautious, fiercely
noncombative television campaign that is relentlessly
uncontroversial and, in the eyes of many who are watching it, more
than a little dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sort of heightened civility this year, not only in
the ads but also in the discourse in general,'' said Lynn Vavreck,
an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, N.H., who worked on the staff of Dan Quayle's
vice-presidential campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Vavreck has noticed, too, that the positions staked out in the
television advertisements in New Hampshire are largely of the
don't-step-on-any-toes variety. ``They talk about things that
nobody can be against,'' she said. ``Even when they do talk about
issues, they say, `I want to improve education.' Well, is that a
position? Who's against teaching kids to read?''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the various candidates point out that the political
season is still young. The tenor of the commercials in the early
primary states, they say, could quickly grow sharper. In fact, as
the campaigns gear up next week with the beginning of the new year
_ one campaign estimates that television spending in Iowa and New
Hampshire by candidates of both parties may total $6 million in
January _ the media strategists are behaving like anxious generals,
wondering whether the sniper fire begins just over the next ridge.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of just how sensitively the campaigns are trying
to read the public mood with regard to drawing distinctions between
candidacies, and how delicately the candidates are tiptoeing around
one another, that their advertising at times seems enveloped in
virtually indecipherable code.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very pinkies up,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of
the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
``The candidates are being offered as separate products; it's not
comparison shopping now. On the Democratic side, there is more
discussion of competing issues, but it's being discussed as genuine
versus inauthentic, inside-the-Beltway versus out. The issues
become surrogates for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for instance, has been running spots that are such heavily
veiled critiques of Bradley's positions on health care and
education that it takes several viewings to fully grasp their
meaning. In his latest advertisement, a disembodied voice promises
that the vice president will ``fight against vouchers that draw
money from public schools,'' an apparent reference to Bradley's
acknowledgment that while in the Senate, he voted for some
experimental school-voucher programs.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, the Bradley campaign's communications director, sees
the Gore advertisements as falling into a rarefied category:
``implicit negative ads.'' They are, she said, a manifestation of
Gore's increasingly antagonistic approach. ``The attacks started in
September and haven't stopped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That type of attack, if that is what it is, hardly seems to have
much growl to it. Still, Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore
campaign, offered an implicit message of his own: that things may
get rougher if circumstances warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get into January, you have a very focused electorate
who are going to be looking at differences in policy and
substance,'' Lehane said. ``We have made it absolutely clear we're
going to fight for the voters in New Hampshire and Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements with a sting are certainly not unknown to the
primary voters of New Hampshire. One of the most famous, in 1988 by
Vice President George Bush, labeled Bob Dole ``Senator Straddle''
for refusing to pledge not to raise taxes; the spot, run in the
closing days of the campaign, is widely thought to have contributed
to Dole's defeat there.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the public's patience with attack ads has worn thin.
Forbes, who ran blistering spots against other Republicans in the
1996 New Hampshire race, is regarded as the recipient of residual
voter resentment this year, even though his commercials this time
have been considerably more restrained.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for voter backlash has made some media advisers
wary, and that may be why the campaigns are more adventurous with
format than with policy issues. A result is that though issues are
what the various camps purport to highlight in their spots, it is
character that seems the predominant theme.
</P>
<P>
   The varied ways in which the commercials accentuate character
range from the eye-catching documentary style of the Bush team's
new ``crash ads'' _ 30-second spots taped at real campaign events,
quickly edited and put on the air the same night or the next day _
to the straightforward evocations of the plain-spoken McCain,
delivering parts of the speech announcing his candidacy, to the
unvarnished 20-minute tape of Bradley mixing with voters at a
town-hall meeting in Sioux City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we filmed Gov. Bush in a free-form style
was we were trying to capture some of the magic when he is out
there with the people,'' said Stuart Stevens, one of Bush's media
advisers. Similarly, Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant (and
no relation to Bush's adviser), says the senator's ability to
``connect to people'' gives his commercials their power.
</P>
<P>
   But how much magic and power get through to the viewers is
unclear. Bruce Gronbeck, a communications professor at the
University of Iowa, said the overall effect this year was a bit of
a blur. Even when a candidate appears to be taking a strong stand,
Gronbeck said, when ``you look at the next guy's, they're pretty
much the same.''

 &HT;    ATTN: recasts lede, 5th graf to show the new millennium
 &HT;    FAR FROM Y2K BUG WORRIES, REVELERS IN CARIBBEAN LAY BACK AND
SOAK IT IN
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Steel drums rattled through
``Auld Lang Syne,'' fireworks lit the blue Caribbean and conch
shells blasted in celebration as the new millennium swept over the
easternmost U.S. territory in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in shorts and sandals, many visitors marveled as much at
the balmy weather as at the dawning of a new age _ and few voiced
concerns about Y2K computer glitches as they slathered on more
suntan lotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't happen again for 1,000 years, so this is the place
to be,'' said Hope Paddock, a transplanted Texan whose daughter
lives in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   While far-away Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean was actually the
first U.S. possession to welcome the new millennium, St. Croix
capitalized on its location to host its own ``millennium-first''
party.
</P>
<P>
   Remote, rocky Point Udall on the island's eastern tip is the
easternmost spot of U.S. soil in the Atlantic basin. Officials
constructed a millennium monument there, a 20-foot-tall stone
affair resembling a sundial that was unveiled at midnight at a
ceremony attended by top government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like this back home in Philadelphia,'' said
Mariellen Heffner, who spent New Years' Eve snorkeling with her
husband and young son, earning rosy sunburns as a keepsake. ``If we
were home, we wouldn't be doing anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix hoteliers were hoping millennium fever would help them
recover some of the business lost in November when late-season
Hurricane Lenny lashed the island. Damage was light, but the storm
hit right at the start of the lucrative winter tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   But the island appeared packed with tourists, sailboats crowding
the harbors and large cruise ships berthed at the pier on St.
Croix's western tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came all the way from Seattle,'' said David Wilhite, who
was visiting friends on the island. ``We're hoping all the Y2K
problems will happen, and then we'll get stuck here. Stranded in
paradise.''

TOUGHER RULES OF THE ROAD 
 BY CAROL SOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC 
(Phoenix) - Teens must have more training before they can get a
driver's license and will face harsher penalties for misbehaving
behind the wheel under a law that goes into effect Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, teen drivers will face mandatory suspensions
after two traffic convictions are on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Passed in the 1999 legislative session, Arizona's Graduated
Driver's License Law is similar to those in 36 other states where
lawmakers phased in teen driv ing privileges in hopes of reduc ing
youths' high accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 in Arizona, drivers under 18 were involved in 47 fatal
crashes, compared with 37 for 19-year-olds and 31 for 20-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't say if the young drivers were at fault, but
without training, ``it is like send ing soldiers into battle
without first going to boot camp,'' said Jeanie La Velle,
Glendale's traffic safety officer.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Goodwin, 18, of Glen dale, one of four students who
produced a brochure on the law for distribution by the Arizona
Motor Vehicle Division, AAA and others, agrees that teen driving
deserves more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on so many other things like gangs and drugs,'' she
said. ``But no one focuses on simple things, like driving cars,
that we do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile As sociation wants to see a version of
the law in every state by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's law says 16- and 17-year-old drivers must pass a road
test and prove that they have had driving instruction to get the
new Class G license.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of that license face tougher penalties, including the
new mandatory license suspen sions after three convictions, for
offenses ranging from speeding to reckless driving. The first
offense would be wiped from the record if the driver attended
defensive driving school, but two more would trigger the suspen
sion.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Butler and his son, Chris, 16, of Phoenix, support the
train ing and tougher penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three convictions, they should lose their licenses,''
Mike Butler said of teens.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Butler, who was waiting to get his license at a state
office, said he isn't worried about the penalties, because ``I'm
not going to get any citations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly Mathers, 16, who was applying for a learner's per mit
at a licensing office, said it isn't fair that young drivers face
stiffer penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Mathers, who will take a commercial driving course be fore
applying for her Class G license, ``Adult drivers make mistakes,
too.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WHAT: New teen driving law takes effect Saturday.
 &UR; HOW IT WORKS: Age 15 years and 7 months _ teens get learner's
permit. &QL; 
Age 16 _ Eligible for new Class G driver's license after passing
road test, taking a driver's education class, or having
parents/guardian certify that teen had 25 hours of supervised
driver training. Harsher penalties apply for driving convictions. &QL; 
 &UR; PENALTIES: First violation _ traffic school, no violation on
record. Second violation _ first conviction, tough traffic survival
school, all violations on record 39 months. Third violation _
second conviction, three-month suspension. Fourth violation _ third
conviction, six-month suspension. &QL;

FROM SIX-GUNS TO CELL PHONES 
 BY DENNIS WAGNER  
  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(Phoenix) - Sometime during the 20th cen tury in Arizona, the
six-gun sur rendered to the cell phone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Old West faded into the sunset, and a remote territory
populated by Indians and pio neers became America's 48th state,
overrun by city slick ers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a young country like the United States, seldom has any
region undergone such a grand metamorphosis in a mere 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   We've changed the food we eat, the work we do, the clothes we
wear _ for many of us, even the air we breathe.
</P>
<P>
   A century that opened under the fist of Anglo males is closing
amid the burgeoning influence of Hispanics and with women occu
pying the state's top political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Many impoverished Native Americans have grown flush with casino
wealth. Schools and neighborhoods were desegre gated, deserts
irrigated into gar dens; family shops were replaced by superstores,
trails by free ways, cowboys by capitalists, tel egraphs by
satellites, ranches by country clubs. Television grew from a
novelty to a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   A region that Edward Abbey once described as ``an appalling,
burned-out wasteland'' is now among the nation's leaders in boats
and swimming pools per capita.
</P>
<P>
   But of all Arizona's 20th-cen tury changes, the most obvious
involves people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, Phoenix counted 5,544 residents. The first automobile
rolled into town that year, spell ing doom for electric trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Phoenix is America's sixth-largest city; plan
ners dream of bringing back the trolleys to combat traffic snarls
and smog.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was among the na tion's fastest-growing states in nine
of the past 10 decades. Its construction explosion now eats an acre
a day _ not just in Peoria and Phoenix, but also in rural burgs
like Payson and Pres cott.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wilder, director of the University of Arizona's South
west Center, says the paradigm shift was swift and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this century, Arizona changed from a place that epito mizes
the old Southwest to a place that epitomizes the Sun Belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's famous ``five C's'' (copper, cotton, cattle, citrus
and climate) no longer control the economy, he says.
</P>
<P>
   They've been supplanted by construction, computers and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Mining has been devalued like a copper penny. Ranching rode to
its last roundup long before Phoenix adopted the slogan ``From
Cowtown to Wowtown.'' Cotton fields and citrus groves have been
overrun by tract hous ing.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area towns that were once distinct have all blurred
together. You can drive from Apache Junc tion to Avondale without
seeing anything like a desert except for the xeriscape medians
installed by state government workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all urbanized into one big megalopolis,'' observes
Jack Pfister, a lifetime resident and an executive with Salt River
Project. &QL; 
CATALYSTS OF CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Historians, always argumenta tive, quibble over Arizona's prin
cipal catalysts of change.
</P>
<P>
   David Tatum, chief curator with the Arizona Historical Soci ety,
believes power tools were instrumental in a 20th-century shift
``from muscle power to mechanization.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robert Woznicki, au thor of The History of Arizona,
says the World War II arrival of military bases and high-tech
companies was crucial. Motorola, he insists, was ``the Padre Kino
of industries here.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Iverson, an Arizona State University history professor,
says federal spending _ on dams, railroads, mining opera tions,
agriculture, forestry and parks _ made Arizona possible. It is no
small irony, he adds, that a state renowned for political
independence was grubstaked by Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Creighton, publisher of Arizona Capitol Times and a 33-year
Phoenix area journalist, says the 1960s adoption of a one-man,
one-vote rule ripped power away from country folks and gave it to
urbanites, especially in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the greatest politi cal change in the history of
Arizona,'' Creighton asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever most prompted Ari zona's evolution, the human out come
is undisputed: A territory born of sweat and blood has been overrun
by city folk with mani cured hands and yards.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1940s, more than half the population lived on
farms or ranches. Today, the number is under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, of the UA's Southwest Center, speaks of a ``monumental
change'' from isolated families who lived off the land and helped
one another to urban transients who squeeze together yet remain
socially alienated and ``largely disinterested in their historical
antecedents.'' &QL; 
WAY BACK WHEN
</P>
<P>
   Real development began with prospectors in the 1800s, digging up
the landscape in search of shiny rocks. They found enough to create
a few gold rushes and leave a few ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1880s, cattle barons had moved in with monster herds,
creating their own rule on the range. But nature's laws proved
stronger: Drought and overgraz ing wiped out the grasses, eroded
the soil and littered the state with bovine skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   As gold and silver veins tapped out, a quest for copper brought
giant corporations with giant ma chines. Labor was imported from
Europe, Mexico and China. Com pany towns arose overnight in
Clifton, Globe and Jerome.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the railroads. Prompted by government contracts that
included millions of acres of free land, they opened Arizona to
more development. Settlers moved in to start tilling soil long
abandoned by the Hohokam.
</P>
<P>
   But nature didn't make it easy. The state's inhospitableness
prompted Gen. William Tecum seh Sherman to remark: ``We went to war
with Mexico to get Arizona, and now we should go to war with her
again to make her take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculators, always a fixture on the Arizona scene, didn't quote
Sherman in their brochures. Nor did they mention scorpions, rat
tlers and dust storms.
</P>
<P>
   Grady Gammage Jr., attorney and author of Phoenix in Per
spective, says land scammers ultimately helped settle this state,
attracting hapless immi grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the children of gener ations of con men,'' Gammage
notes. ``This whole place really is the product of real-estate
specu lation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, notions of manifest des tiny prevailed, thanks to two of
the key developments in Arizona history: dams and air-condition
ing. &QL; 
FLOOD AND DROUGHT
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, the Salt, Verde, Gila and Colorado rivers staged
periodic rebellions, flooding towns and farms, then trickling to
drought levels.
</P>
<P>
   Early settlers were obsessed with harnessing the water for
safety and progress. In 1902, Congress approved construction of
Roosevelt Dam. Nine years later, Arizona had the world's largest
man-made lake _ a mar vel of engineering, a monolithic start on
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing decades saw many more dams go up, along with a
Central Arizona Project that delivers water from the Colorado
River. Dams meant ag riculture and electricity, semi conductor
plants and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of Americans moved into the ``Nile of the West.'' During
the Dust Bowl era, refu gees en route to California stopped and
settled. World War II introduced Air Force personnel and suppliers.
Motorola arrived in 1948, drawing more industry.
</P>
<P>
   But summers remained hellish, until air-conditioning arrived in
the 1950s. First used to cool factories, refrigeration was a
godsend to homeowners and builders. Arizona finally had an answer
to the desert's cruelest element. &QL; 
CULTURAL STEW
</P>
<P>
   Today, Arizona contains 113,596 square miles of people who are
as diverse as their landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mongrel state full of folks who mostly weren't born here
and don't plan on staying. Each year 300,000 new ones ar rive and
100,000 move out.
</P>
<P>
   What some mistake for an Arizona identity crisis is really a
multiple personality. From Navajos to New Agers, the one thing we
have in common is that we don't have much in common.
</P>

   Rootless diversity sometimes means conflict, often alienation.

holiday, adopted an Eng lish-only law and fought over whether this

   Alfredo Gutierrez, a former state senator, says Hispanics

the civil-rights movement.

   ``There was, in the '50s, a kind of hierarchy where Hispanics
and Native Americans were at the bottom of the heap,'' Gutier rez
said. ``That kind of psycho logical state has been demolished,
wonderfully. . . . There's a helluva lot of reason for hope.''

<P>
   As 2000 begins, Arizona's popu lace is more educated, diverse

   Life expectancy here has in creased 80 percent since 1900.
Residents earn about six times more in real dollars _ not count ing
the benefit of indoor plumb ing, modern medicine, phones and other

</P>
<P>
   Those with nostalgic yearnings might recall that a century ago,
folks seldom had time for such luxuries. Instead, Pollack notes
bluntly, ``they were working their (butts) off.'' &QL;

GETTING 2000 OFF AND RUNNING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (rk)

   HAMILTON, New Zealand _ ``Welcome to the first marathon anywhere
in the world this millennium,'' the public-address announcer said
as approximately 2,000 runners applauded the news here on the first
morning of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They had come from 45 countries: from Thailand and Japan; from
France and the Czech Republic; from Canada and the United States.
In most cases, they had made their plans years ago, conserved their
resources and sacrificed a night of carefree revelry for the chance
to get up long before dawn and smile through the pain in the
Millennium Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess that I was in bed before midnight,'' said
Weston Holmes, a 61-year-old from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But there were psychic rewards for those who bid farewell to the
1900s 18 hours ahead of the New Yorkers and Bostonians and
Washingtonians they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't even gathered in Times Square yet, and we already
ran a marathon,'' said Fred Lipsky, a 42-year-old sergeant in the
Suffolk County Police Department on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   What the jet laggers and early risers did not get for their
trouble was a spectacular sunrise. Instead, they got light rain and
mist as they gathered for the 6 a.m. start that had been timed to
coincide with first light.
</P>
<P>
   The early start also deprived the marathoners of a sizable
audience. Only a few hundred spectators lined the streets of
Hamilton, a city of more than 100,000 approximately 80 miles south
of New Zealand's capital, Auckland. But neither the sparse crowd
nor the soggy conditions dampened the enthusiasm of the
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were certainly here in force. A total of 626
competed in either the marathon or the much shorter fun runs that
followed it, and though the fastest men's finisher in the marathon
was an Aucklander and the fastest woman a Briton, the Americans had
the biggest contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been planning this for two years,'' said S. Mark
Courtney, a 43-year-old from Grove City, Pa. ``This is my 100th
career marathon, and I was trying to zero in on which one to pick,
and New Zealand is a place I always wanted to go. That and this
race were the perfect combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The race organizer, Andrew Galloway, dreamed up the Millennium
Marathon in 1995 when he was secretary of the Association of
International Marathons. At a meeting in New York, he suggested to
his organization and UNICEF that they organize a run in every major
city around the world as the year 2000 dawned. The interest was not
there, and so after a meeting with international marathon tour
operators, he settled for Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's not the New York City Marathon,'' Lipsky said after
finishing the 26.2-mile course in 3 hours 32 minutes 10 seconds.
``But for a small town and a small country, it was still a
beautiful race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky is part of Fred's Team, the group of runners carrying on
the fund-raising work begun by New York City Marathon founder Fred
Lebow, who died of brain cancer in 1994. All 30 of the team members
who raced in Hamilton raised at least $9,000 for children's cancer
research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
Lipsky said he had raised $23,000 since his last marathon in an
even more exotic Southern Hemisphere locale: Antarctica's King
George Island.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hamilton had no glaciers or penguins, it did have its own
quirks, including a midrace wedding ceremony between two marathon
competitors. Published reports that several world-class Ethiopian
runners were to compete proved apocryphal, however, and the winner,
Mark Hutchinson, had to settle for a time (2:21.58) that was much
more modest than the race's title.
</P>
<P>
   Kamala Cornman and her husband, Lance, who came from Oklahoma
City to run, chose to push the envelope, joining in the celebration
in the streets of Hamilton and then watching the celebration in
Sydney, Australia, on television before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got two hours of sleep,'' Kamala said. ``But we can sleep
later. How many times do you get to experience something like
this?''

NORTHRIDGE TAUGHT A LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ School has been out at Cal State Northridge since
the week before Christmas, but since you can learn something every
day, Mississippi State's women's basketball team gave a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has talked about taking its game to the next level.
The 21st-ranked Bulldogs _ the first nationally ranked team to play
here in Northridge's Division I era _ gave a glimpse of that level
in a 98-64 nonconference victory before a crowd of 165 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It ended CSUN's 16-game home win streak.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Matadors learned from the Bulldogs (10-0) remains to
be seen. The Big Sky Conference season begins Thursday at Northern
Arizona, but the Matadors don't believe they'll face anyone of this
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference isn't that strong,'' Edneisha Curry admitted,
``so we have to play hard and play with the type of desire and
heart night in and night out, so we can play with Mississippi State
and all the other ranked teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have completed the most difficult portion of the
schedule with two losses to nationally ranked teams in Illinois and
Mississippi State and a win over an NCAA Tournament team in
Dartmouth. It leaves them 6-4, the same record they had at this
time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they weren't talking about elevating their game at
this time last year. Since the Matadors have reached the NCAA
Tournament and are hungry for more, Mississippi State provided
clues to what they need to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's the basics: shoot a high percentage, rebound well and
commit fewer turnovers and fouls. Shooting 36.7 percent, taking
just 28 boards and committing 17 turnovers might be enough to win
the Big Sky, but it won't get you past Mississippi State, which
shot 50.7 percent and took 51 rebounds. Although the Bulldogs
turned over the ball the same number of times, they also committed
six fewer fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to have a player like freshman LaToya Thomas, who
can deliver points in bunches when needed. Thomas scored 33,
including 18 in the first half, but was most valuable in the second
half when she scored eight points in a 10-0 run that ended any hope
of a Northridge comeback. CSUN had cut a 50-25 halftime deficit to
59-45 with 12:21 to play and had some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in the second half was to cut it to 10 by the
10-minute mark,'' CSUN coach Frozena Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Northridge has a Thomas-like player in Curry, who
scored 21 points. But she made 9 of 23 field-goal attempts, far
below Thomas' 11 of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The other time Northridge was close was when it scored eight
straight points and trailed 13-12 with 12:46 to play in the first
half. Mississippi State responded with a 25-7 run in 9:10 to put
the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're getting a lot of experience,'' Bulldogs
coach Sharon Faning said. ``They need to work on footwork, defense,
rebounding _ same as us.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Mississippi State players scored in double figures:
Jennifer Fambrough (22), Cynthia Hall (11) and Meadow Overstreet
(11). Northridge got 14 from Lynda Amari and 13 from LaShaunda
Fowler.

FOR GIULIANI, NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's $13 million crisis center in the World
Trade Center came suddenly to life. Dozens of beefy officials
wearing uniforms or windbreakers or suits _ the mark of real power
_ hustled to their positions. The crowded press room fell into a
hush.
</P>
<P>
   And in walked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with the latest news:
</P>
<P>
   There was no news.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday night, the city's preparations for a New Year's Eve
disaster were beginning to look almost like overkill, at least as
viewed from the inside of Giuliani's hardened command and
communications center, built to withstand bullets, bombs and bugs _
the Year 2000 kind.
</P>
<P>
   With fears of widespread computer power and electrical-system
failures around the world fizzling as fast as the Earth's rotation,
the mayor announced just after 5 p.m. that nothing surprising had
happened so far. ``The only thing we're concerned about is the
unexpected and the unanticipated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said there had been more bomb threats than usual Friday
_ 16 spread throughout the five boroughs, as against nine on an
average day _ but that all had been checked out immediately and
``proved bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   Times Square had filled up much faster than in earlier years,
the mayor said; by 5 p.m. there were already as many people in
Times Square as there had been at midnight a year ago. ``The areas
near the ball drop are already completely full,'' he said. He said
he had spoken with visitors from Germany, Japan and elsewhere, many
of whom had been waiting in the cold ``12, 14, 15, 16 hours,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani would not say how many people had chosen to brave the
weather, fears of a terrorist act and each other's elbows to stake
out a spot in the epicenter of what he likes to call the capital of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the business of crowd estimates,'' he said. ``The
streets are pretty well full.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Police Commissioner Howard Safir, Giuliani
heaped praise on the department, which Safir said was spending
about $6 million for overtime for New Year's security.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 officers were assigned to Times Square and 37,000 of
the department's 40,000 officers were scheduled to work, many of
them in 12-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for the New York Police Department to
demonstrate how to deal with crowds,'' Giuliani said. ``There's
nobody that does it better.''
</P>
<P>
   With no emergencies to manage, officials in the Office of
Emergency Management's celebrated bunker _ including
representatives of local utilities and dozens of city, state,
regional and federal agencies _ infuriated the 75 or so journalists
watching them work through a glass wall Friday by repeatedly
lowering a screen specially installed to block the view. Only when
television reporters went live, and when the mayor appeared, was
the screen raised.
</P>
<P>
   Asked five times why the view could not be kept clear, a mayoral
spokesman, Matt Higgins, said only, ``Because it's not being
done.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his briefing, the mayor suggested a simple explanation.
``It's easier for people to do their work if people aren't staring
at them,'' he said. ``Who knows what they may want to scratch or do
or whatever.''
