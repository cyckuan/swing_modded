<HEADLINE> Tyson's Prosecutor Violated a Plea Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- An attorney for boxer Mike
Tyson claims a prosecutor in Montgomery County violated a plea
agreement stemming from Tyson's assault on two motorists after a
traffic accident in August.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kemp said the agreement specified that Tyson would plead
no contest to two assault charges and prosecutors wouldn't
recommend the manner or length of incarceration that he would
serve.
</P>
<P>
But Kemp said Douglas Gansler has suggested jail time for Tyson
in violation of the deal negotiated by Gansler's predecessor,
Robert Dean.
</P>
<P>
Gansler denied the charge Monday. Tyson will be sentenced
Friday and faces up to 20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> French President Backs Egyptian Proposal on Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
expressed on Tuesday his support for the proposal by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on a delay for the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"Practically, on all the problems, Egypt and France have
exactly the same positions," said Chirac after a meeting with
Mubarak at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed his hope on Sunday in Davos, Switzerland,
that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat delay the eventual
proclamation of an independent Palestinian state, which he plans
to do in early May.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Elysee presidential palace said that France
has not changed its support for the right of the Palestinian
people to claim an independent state at the proper moment.
</P>
<P>
"On this subject, we will continue to act in concert with our
partners in the European Union," Agence France-Presse quoted the
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he talked with Chirac regarding bilateral
relations, Israel, the declaration of a Palestinian state, Libya,
Kosovo and other issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
As for the French-Egyptian joint initiative to re-launch the
Middle East peace process made in May last year, Mubarak said the
initiative is there and it can be used to support initiatives by
the United States.

<P>
French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau
said France hopes the concerned parties in Kosovo attend the talks
scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We should prepare for that, we are organized for hosting the
delegations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was too early to say whether the Western countries
had succeeded in formulating a peace process for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We know naturally that the affair is not won yet and that it
is a challenge," he said, adding that it is in the interests of
all parties to come to Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be co-chaired by French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who are
the sponsors of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that if the KLA refuses to come, the
conference will be held all the same because the KLA does not have
the power to veto the conference.
</P>
<P>
There is no requirement for the level of delegates to attend
the meeting, so long as they have the "necessary political
authority" delegated by their own camps, he added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban, US to Hold Talks in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Taliban official is
arriving in Islamabad Wednesday for talks with U.S. Under
Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth,
diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Jalil Akhund, senior Taliban official responsible for
foreign affairs, will represent the Taliban militia in the talks
with Inderfurth, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott left here for
Washington Tuesday after concluding less than 24-hour visit to
Pakistan while Inderfurth stayed in Islamabad for talks on the
Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz will brief the U.S.
officials on the latest situation in Afghanistan. Inderfurth is
likely to meet other Taliban officials during his stay in
Pakistan, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Although main agenda item during the Pak-U.S. talks was nuclear
non-proliferation, the Afghan issue also prominently figured in
the negotiation held between Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed and
his U.S. counterpart Talbott.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been concerned over the relentless fighting in
Afghanistan especially over the presence of Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden. President Bill Clinton also raised the Osama issue with
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his trip to the U.S. in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani side has expressed its inability to
influence the Taliban to extradite the Saudi millionaire.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched Cruise missile attack on Afghanistan's Khost
province in August last year in a move to eliminate the alleged
terrorist camps run by Osama. However, the Saudi dissident
remained unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Osama has been accused of masterminding bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August last year, in which more
than 200 people were killed.

<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) --- A girl who was brain damaged at
birth was awarded 2.35 million pounds (3.87 million U.S. dollars)
damages in a London High Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Samantha Laws, who will be nine in July, was severely
asphyxiated when she was born at Kingston Hospital, Surrey,
central England.
</P>
<P>
She now suffers from cerebral palsy. Her intellect, however, is
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Her counsel, Stephen Miller QC, told Justice Rougier in London
that Samantha was a child of "obvious intelligence, drive and
personality".
</P>
<P>
The girl, who is cared for at home at Tolworth, Surrey, by her
parents, Diane and Jon, will now be able to have the computers and
other technical assistance she needs to communicate and be
independent.
</P>
<P>
The settlement on the amount of the award came just days after
the judge ruled that Kingston and Richmond Health Authority was
liable for Samantha's injuries.

<HEADLINE> US Aware of Vital Interests of Pakistan: Talbott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott Tuesday said the U.S. "understood and
continues to understand that vital security interests of Pakistan
are protected."
</P>
<P>
Talbott made the remark Tuesday while speaking at the Institute
of Strategic Studies (ISS) of Pakistan before an gathering of
scholars, intellectuals and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The United States earnestly understands Pakistan's concern,
aspirations and perspectives, he said, stressing that U.S.
President Bill Clinton believes in a strong, safe and secure
Pakistan and respects its security.
</P>
<P>
The United States was aware of the centrality of the Kashmir
dispute in the Pak-Indo relations and would use its good office
with India for its settlement, said Talbott.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing talks between the two countries on the issue of
peace, security and non-proliferation, Talbott said, is just the
beginning of this process.
</P>
<P>
He added that the United States supports Pak-India dialogue for
a peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Talbott disclosed that during his talks with Pakistani Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, the two sides focused on the issues of
nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes that Pakistan can still "take
concrete and positive steps" to bring itself back in the
mainstream of international community in its global efforts to
check nuclear weapons proliferation, said Talbott.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would like Pakistan to take steps
like signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) "to help
bring about an end to fissile material worldwide and join export
control and help bring about strategic restraint regime."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, ought to define its own defense posture in
such a way which should avoid "political tension and military
competition in the Sub-continent."
</P>
<P>
Talbott said "the United States is not happy to keep Pakistan
under sanctions" and both sides are trying to figure out if there
is a way out in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides during on-going talks were trying to
narrow down their differences on issues of non-proliferation and
disarmament. They desire to restore their relationship to the "one
of unfettered, unambiguous and mutual respect and benefits."
</P>
<P>
The Pak-U.S. dialogue, he said, was being conducted to develop
a "broad-based, multi-dimensional strategic partnership" as the
two sides share values and common interests.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who arrived here Monday from New Delhi after
concluding talks with Indian officials, held their eighth round of
talks on nuclear non-proliferation and security with Shamshad
Ahmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as well
as held a meeting with Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Momentum Needed for Iraqi Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi oil official said
Tuesday that Iraq has exported 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
so far in the fifth six-month phase of the oil-for-food program
which began November 26.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Zaban al-Hasan, executive director of the Iraqi Company
of Marketing Oil, said Iraq signed 80 contracts for the current
phase and 107 million barrels of crude oil have been transferred to
world markets to date, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, but in 1996, the Security Council approved the
oil-for-food program, allowing Baghdad to export a certain amount
of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Since the program's fourth phase, which started on June 3, the
oil-export ceiling has been raised from 2.6 billion dollars to 5.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq exported only 3 billion dollars worth of oil in the
fourth phase due to the sagging world oil prices and lack of spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was allowed to import 300 million dollars worth of oil
equipment and spare parts in the fourth phase of the oil-for-food
deal. However, Al-Hasan said, very few of the ordered spare parts
had arrived.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the U.S. and British representatives in the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of putting on hold some of the 562
contracts it signed with foreign companies for purchasing
badly-needed spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hasan said Iraq has not signed any contract on buying spare
parts under the fifth phase though 300 million of dollars has been
earmarked for such a purpose.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Foster Technopreneur Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has stressed the importance to foster a technopreneur
class in his country and spelt out plans for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official opening of Creative Resource,
headquarters of the company of Creative Technology, the prime
minister said "To sustain the next stage of Singapore's economic
development, we must have more technology entrepreneurship."
</P>
<P>
He said "it is not easy to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit,
spark brilliant ideas and motivate technological innovations which
can develop into profitable commercial successes."
</P>
<P>
Defining technopreneurial spirit as "to experiment, take risks
and suffer," the prime minister said "that is what entrepreneurs
are all about -- doing what people have told them is impossible."
</P>
<P>
"This is what the government will try to foster -- creating a
technopreneur class," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Describing technopreneurship as a "risky enterprise", Goh said
only those people that have the dare, passion, knowledge and
skills can enjoy the immense personal satisfaction and potentially
lucrative rewards the technopreneurship offers.
</P>
<P>
"There are few undertakings in the world today that can rival
the satisfaction derived from bringing one's own idea to fruition
and seeing how it benefits other people as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said the government could remove the rules and
obstacles that inhibits the blossoming of an entrepreneurial
spirit, adding "the whole exercises to foster technopreneurship is
by itself an enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Promising the government will be more tolerant of those who
tried and failed, the prime minister said the government will look
into proposals to review bankruptcy laws so as to be more
forgiving to those who failed in business and to give them a
second chance, to develop more infrastructure for supporting
knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial start-ups, to provide easier
access to funding knowledge intensive ventures, to lower rental of
office and research space and relax the existing Housing
Development Board's rules which disallow use of flats for
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The government and the private sector have to adopt a
coordinated and concerted approach in fostering an environment
which is conducive for techno-enterprises to sprout and thrive, he
emphasized.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TOWN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China treasures its friendly
cooperative ties with South Africa, and the two nations have no
conflicts of fundamental interests, visiting Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During talks with his South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki, Hu
said the two countries share extensive and common interest while
bilateral economy is supplementary and the cooperation has great
potential.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to join South Africa in making concerted efforts
to establish 21st century-oriented constructive partnership.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that China and South Africa, both as influential
developing nations, share many common grounds in international
affairs while their cooperation in this regard is in the
fundamental interest of the two peoples and conducive to the world
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the two countries forged diplomatic ties
one year ago, their bilateral relations are proceeding in a smooth
way, and exchanges of high-level visits are on rise.
</P>
<P>
Their economic and trade cooperation are also advancing
steadily, and contacts and cooperation in the political,
economical, cultural, scientific and military sectors are
gradually advancing.
</P>
<P>
Understanding and cooperation in international affairs between
the two countries is being furthered, demonstrating that the
normalization of bilateral ties serves to play a positive role in
promoting bilateral friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hu briefed Mbeki on China's reform and opening-up to the
outside world. Both sides had an extensive exchange of views on
bilateral relations and on international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Hu, Mbeki said since the establishment of
the diplomatic ties between the two nations, South Africa is glad
to see the smooth development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
The South African government values China's role in
international affairs and is willing to strengthen consultations
and cooperations with China on international and regional issues,
and to set up a frequent consultations mechanism.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Hu on South African views on relative issues in the
southern African region and its domestic political and economic
situation. He stressed that the main domestic problem is the
sharp gap between the rich and the poor while its main external
issues is how to safeguard peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
On African situation and China's policy, Hu said that seeking
peace, stability and development have become the main stream of
the African situation.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have been making sustained efforts to seek their
own development ways which are appropriate to their countries'
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of African countries who are doing their best
to maintain regional peace and stability, and beefing up
cooperation to solve African problems by themselves, Hu reiterated
China's support for African countries' efforts to safeguard
independence, sovereignty and territory integrity and the fighting
against foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
He said China respects African countries' free choice of their
political systems and development formula, and hopes that the
African countries can solve their differences and disputes through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
China also supports efforts by the Organization of African
Unity and other sub-regional organizations to maintain unity and
stability in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reformation of the United Nations, Hu said that
China advocates making necessary and appropriate reform toward the
U.N. body so as to make the world organization adapt to the new
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that the U.N. reform should be designed to fully
 represent interests of the majority of its member states instead
of serving only the minority.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China, aware of their desires to have more
representatives in the Security Council, attaches importance to
African countries' role in the U.N. affairs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that African countries will play a more
important part in international affairs, stressing that the U.N.
reform must pave the way for the positive process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials of China and South Africa signed in Cape
Town a series of agreements and documents over bilateral air
services, and on political, foreign affairs and economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Drops in December But Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said Tuesday that new home purchases dropped slightly in December
from the month before but set a record for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
New homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
978,000 in December, down 3.6 percent from a record 1.02 million
rate in November.
</P>
<P>
For the entire year, however, people bought 888,000 new homes,
up 10.4 percent from 1997 and the highest annual total since 1963,
the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Existing home sales, tracked by the National Association of
Realtors, also set a record of 4.78 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sales have been supported by low mortgage rates -- averaging
under 7 percent during the last half of 1998, the longest such
stretch since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The stock market also spurred some sales, especially of
vacation homes. With inflation low, wage gains gave many Americans
increased purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home last year was 151,600 U.S.
dollars, up 3.8 percent from 1997.

HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Tuesday said that it is shocked by the announcement
of a new round of price increases which are being effected on all
basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan
Tsvangirai warned that if the current trend was allowed to
continue, it would bring social instability as people would resort
to unilateral action for survival.
</P>
<P>
He said there is urgent need for the government to come with
stop-gap measures which would balance viability and affordability
under the deep economic crisis that the nation is facing.
</P>
<P>
The price of maize-meal, cooking oil, bread and transport
increased sharply recently.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index
has reached an all time high of 46.6 percent for December 1998.

<P>
NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The average daily transaction
volume on the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) has more than doubled in
1998, compared with 1997, CSE Chairman Dinos Papadopoulos said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Papadopoulos said at a press conference that the average daily
turnover reached 1.4 million Cyprus pounds (2.8 million U.S.
dollars) in 1998 from 694,000 pounds (1.388 million dollars) in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Seven new shares were listed in 1998, raising the total number
to 116, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange has strengthened its role as a fundamental
economic institution while the country's trust and interest in it
have risen, Papadopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to foreign investors, he said that the renowned ING
Barings and Nomura, among others, have expressed interest in the
island's stock market.
</P>
<P>
But he urged the government to proceed with economic
liberalization and to abandon restrictions on free movement of
capital in order to attract more foreign investors.

HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development will start building six HIV/AIDS
voluntary testing centers in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zimbabwe's director responsible for
sexually- transmitted diseases, Patrick Osewe in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the director as saying that the
building of the centers would start at the end of this month at
strategic locations such as Harare, Bulawayo, Hwange, Chiredzi and
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying U.S. director responsible for national AIDS
policy, Sandra Thurman, touring of the Matabeleland Aids Council

Thurman said it would be impossible to get rid of AIDS if
people did not come forward for voluntary HIV testing.

<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Mark
Robert Parris said Tuesday that the U.S. surveillance planes will
not attack Iraq any more if Iraq stops targeting them.
</P>
<P>
Parris made the remarks in meeting with Muammer Guler, the
governor of Gaziantep in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Washington has the obligation to protect its
pilots against possible attacks, claiming that Iraq wants to
destroy the U.S. warplanes and kill American pilots.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in south
from alleged Iraqi regime's suppression.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of the allied forces stationed in the
Incirlik Air Base in Turkey as part of the Operation Northern
Watch to patrol the northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Parris said that the Patriot missile air defense system will
deployed at the Incirlik base within a week upon Turkey's request.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided to deploy the missiles in a short time as Turkey
conveyed its rightful concern over the latest developments in this
region, he added.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Slams Colonialists for 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu has lashed out at former colonial masters for having
sown the seeds of divisions when they first arrived in the
country, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Bizimungu made the remarks in Kigali Monday while
addressing the Organization of African Unity (OAU) panel which is
in the country, on a five-day mission to probe the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
According to Bizimungu, the task set for the panel is not a
difficult one, as episodes which led to the 1994 onslaught of
Tutsis are well- documented in historic books by the first
Europeans who set feet in the Kingdom of Rwanda at around 1900.
</P>
<P>
''The task (of investigating the genocide) is not difficult
because since 1900 when the seeds of genocide were sown, until
1994 when the final solution was launched, the various episodes
are documented and the key players are known,'' RNA quoted
Bizimungu as saying.
</P>
<P>
For the Rwandan leader, Europeans aided by the missionaries
spread racist stereotypes and set up a racist administrative
structure in the framework of their divide-and-rule tactics.
</P>
<P>
He accused the international community of having looked on
while one million Tutsis were being butchered by marauding
Interahamwe Hutu militia, the former government troops and Hutu
extremists.
</P>
<P>
''The genocide was carried out in front of international
camera,'' Bizimungu charged, saying that despite the warning about
the eminent genocide, no one heeded the alarm bells by the United
Nations force deployed in Rwanda in the wake of the Arusha peace
agreement signed on August 4,1994.
</P>
<P>
The then rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) which had been
waging a three-year war against the Hutu extremist government in
Kigali, accepted to stop fighting and to share power with the
regime.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace process agreed upon by the belligerents
failed to be implemented as Hutu extremists refused to relinquish
some of their power and privileges, and master-minded the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
For the Rwandan president, the genocide was not a spontaneous
act as series of pogroms of Tutsis had been orchestrated by Hutus
starting in 1959, sometimes with the help of Belgian colonial
masters.
</P>
<P>
According to Bizimungu, when the genocide broke out, Rwandans
have developed a mind to kill, and had been taught that you can
kill a Tutsi and go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
''This is the first time, now, the world has a unique
opportunity through you, you the panel, not only to restore the
sense of humanity, but enable the world to learn what exactly went
wrong in our country, in our society,'' Bizimungu underlined.
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel, which arrived in Kigali Sunday, visited
Ntarama genocide site, 30 kilometers south of the capital where
about 7,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the panel, former president of Botswana,
Ketumile Masire, expressed shock at the sight of the remains
displayed in a memorial built near the local church where the
victims had sought refuge. He compared what the panel saw to the
horrors in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings urges collective African responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry
Rawlings Tuesday appealed to South African President Nelson
Mandela to bring his influence to bear on fostering collective
responsibility toward peace and stability on the continent,
especially in the west Africa sub-region, the Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported, in a dispatch to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
He said although southern Africa also has its own problems,
there is need to tap the experience and goodwill of some leaders
like President Mandela to restore peace.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that President Mandela is a great asset to
the continent. I do not think we should limit our problems to our
individual selves. We must double our efforts, reach out, and get
directly involved in containing the conflicts."
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings was speaking when he received outgoing South
African High Commissioner Mr Timothy Maseko at the Castle, Osu. Mr
Maseko has been recalled after barely three months tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said the time had come for African leaders to
look back and ask themselves what efforts they could do to
contain the increasing violence that had plagued the continent to
enable it to reach out positively to the world.
</P>
<P>
He cited disturbances in Africa, especially in the west Africa
sub- region, and urged Ghana and South Africa to collaborate to
bring their influences to bear on the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
These disturbances and the violence, he said, are retarding
progress in the sub-region, adding that without stability, Africa
would suffer.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said efforts at solving the crises have
suffered a setback due to mistrust between some countries.
</P>
<P>
He, however, expressed the hope that the involvement of South
Africa and other countries would bring about a positive change.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Laryea, Ghana's deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, said
 relations between the two countries occupies a special place in
Ghana's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Mr Laryea commented on reports that Ghanaians constitute the
second largest immigrants in South Africa and that most of them
are claiming refugee status because of alleged unfavorable
conditions at home.
</P>
<P>
He tasked the out-going ambassador to use his objective
assessment of the situation in Ghana to correct this
misperception which might tarnish the image of the country if
not checked.
</P>
<P>
Mr Laryea also charged the relevant agencies, such as the
immigration authorities in South Africa, to critically screen
those immigrants claiming to be Ghanaians to ascertain their true
nationality, saying, most people take advantage of the good image
of Ghana abroad for their selfish gains.
</P>
<P>
Mr Maseko explained that his short stay has nothing to do with
relations between the two countries, saying "I am leaving with
fond memories."
</P>
<P>
"We have to take account of happenings in my country,
particularly the parliamentary elections to be held in three
months' time."
</P>
<P>
He spoke about troubles in southern Africa which, he said, pose
a challenge to South Africa as well as west Africa and expressed
support for President Rawlings' call for collaboration toward the
attainment of peace.

<HEADLINE> Release of Jailed Israelis Not Considered: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides on Tuesday indicated that he is not considering release
of two Israeli agents jailed on Monday for three years.
</P>
<P>
The president also told reporters that there is no agreement
between the two countries so that Igal Damary, 49, and Udi
Hargov, 37, can serve their sentence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were arrested in early November last year at
the small fishing village of Zigi on the Cypriot southern coast
and were found carrying radio scanners, a lat-top computer, cell
phones and eight maps of the island.
</P>
<P>
They had pleaded guilty to charges of approaching a restricted
military zone and possessing banned listening equipment.
</P>
<P>
Spying charges pressed against the two Israelis were dropped by
the prosecution for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that pardon cannot be granted unless some of the
sentence is served, the Prisons Director submits a good report on
their conduct and the Attorney General agrees that reasons for
pardon exist.
</P>
<P>
Clerides dismissed press reports that the spying charges were
dropped because of pressure.

<HEADLINE> Steel Experts Deplore Waste Dumping in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chief Tim Efobi, President of the African Steel and Iron
Associations (AISA), noted that despite efforts by the AISA to
address the steel dumping problems since its last board meeting in
Zimbabwe, ''the practice still prevails and is on a higher scale
in many African countries.''
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the opening of the 6th Board Meeting of the
Association in Accra, Efobi urged African governments to take
measures to stop it.
</P>
<P>
The four-day forum being attended by over 30 experts in the
African steel industry would take stock of the performance of the
industry in the last year and plan for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
It is also to speed up efforts at addressing problems facing
the industry on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Chief Efobi said at the request of the AISA, the Organization
of the African Unity (OAU) has invited the Secretariat of the AISA
to address the Ministers of Industries of AISA member countries
during their summit slated for April/ May this year in Libreville,
Gabon.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria has set up an Anti-Dumping Committee to
seriously address the dumping problems facing that country and
urged other African countries to follow the Nigerian example.
</P>
<P>
Chief Efobi urged African leaders to wake up to the challenges
of the new millennium and support their steel and iron sectors
which, he said, have the potential to bridge the development gap
between Africa and the West.
</P>
<P>
Thomas L. Agawu, Managing Director of Wahome Steel Company
Limited in Ghana, suggested that African governments and the AISA
must make a collaborative effort to arrest the problem.
</P>
<P>
He urged African governments to refuse any compensation from
those countries which dump the waste, saying "the damage usually
caused is far higher than compensation."
</P>
<P>
John Frank Abu, Minister of Trade and Industry, assured the
delegates that the issue would be vigorously addressed during this
year's OAU Ministers of Trade and Industry summit.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to champion the concerns of the AISA but asked the
Secretariat of the AISA to formally present their recommendations
to the OAU Secretariat ahead of the summit for early consideration
and planning.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The 29th annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum (WEF) ended in the eastern Swiss city of
Davos Tuesday after six days of discussions among world business,
government and media leaders on the theme of "responsible
globality - managing the impact of globalization".
</P>
<P>
Participants exchanged ideas about determining global hot spots
in the next century, exploring corporate social responsibilities,
linking business with human rights, debating the potential of
human cloning, enhancing environmental protection through the
private sector and probing the origins of life.
</P>
<P>
Keynote speakers included US Vice-President Al Gore, United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Egyptian President Muhammad
Hosni Mubarak, German Chancellor Gerhard Shroder and German
President Roman Herzog.
</P>
<P>
Particularly poignant was South African President Nelson
Mandela's farewell speech about his country's "unfinished
business". The Annual Meeting has done much in previous years to
give the new South Africa a stage on which to present its policies
of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Leading economists, scientists, artists and other experts also
addressed the sessions, which enabled participants, many of them
chief executives of billion-dollar international corporations, to
discuss informally a broad spectrum of social, development and
creative issues.
</P>
<P>
Participants also explored the future of new technology and how
it would affect business and society in the next century. William
H. Gates III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft
Corporation, said the Internet would enable companies to reduce
overheads as it will no longer be necessary to build big
structures, including major overseas offices.
</P>
<P>
The World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting provided the
opportunity to look at the political and economic situations in
Afghanistan, Canada, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, and elsewhere.
Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economics, Finance, and
Industry, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, maintained that his nation was
back on a democratic track to a viable and competitive economy
despite considerable problems. Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's Minister of
Foreign Affairs, said that since the election of President Khatami
in 1997, Iran has made great efforts in its internal and foreign
policy "to be a responsible partner in global affairs."
</P>
<P>
The WEF is the foremost global partnership of business,
government, intellectual and other leaders of civil society
committed to improving the state of the world. Incorporated since
1971 as a foundation, the WEF is independent, impartial and
not-for-profit, tied to no political, partisan or national
interests.

<P>
SANAA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni police have managed to
free the six westerner kidnaped by tribesmen in northern Yemen, a
Interior Ministry official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official spoke highly of the local people for their
cooperation with the security agencies in obtaining the release of
the British couple and a Dutch family of four.
</P>
<P>
The six westerners were abducted on January 17 by the members of
the northern Bakeel tribe.
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently kidnap
foreigners to gain economic concessions from their government.
Hostages are generally well-treated and released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
But in December, Islamic extremists seized 16 westerners in a
kidnaping that ended with three Britons and an Australian being
killed in a shootout with Yemeni soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed Yemeni security agencies will never
tolerate any one who might think of destabilizing the motherland
or violating the law.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Economic Program on Track: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said that despite the drought related energy crisis in 1998,
Ghana's economic program for the year maintained on track.
</P>
<P>
A report published by IMF said Ghana's gross domestic product
growth for 1998 was expected to be 4.5 percent, below the 5.6
percent target but stronger than it was feared at the onset of the
crisis, according to Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The report said the inflation rate which was 21 percent at the
end of 1997 increased in March and April but later resumed its
declining trend, falling to about 17 percent in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Net domestic financing of the government was kept below ceiling
while Bank of Ghana's external payments position improved, said
the report, adding that during 1998, it was consistently above
it's target.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said the IMF's executive board cautioned in
its assessment that the economic situation still remains fragile.
</P>
<P>
The board stressed the need for sustained efforts to reduce
fiscal imbalances and to accelerate the pace of key structural
reforms to consolidate the progress achieved to further place
Ghana on a sustainable poverty reducing growth path.
</P>
<P>
It commended Ghana for tightening monetary policy to achieve
targets resulting in the decline in the inflation rate and the
lowering of the interest rate.
</P>
<P>
It called for measures to strengthen the banking sector,
including strong banking supervision and the adoption of
transparent entry and exit policy for financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The directors also stressed the need for Ghana to improve it's
competitiveness through education, provision of more health
facilities and basic infrastructure including reforms in the cocoa
and other key sectors.
</P>
<P>
They supported the continuation of the current moratorium on
non- concessional borrowing as an important element in
strengthening Ghana's external position and said continued good
performance could help to attract higher donor financing and
additional resources for key social sectors.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin in Kremlin Briefly, Fires Aides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
spent some 100 minutes in the Kremlin Tuesday, firing four of his
aides before heading back to the Barvikha sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is rehabilitating from gastric ulcer, dismissed
presidential advisors Sergei Krasavchenko, Emil Pain, Viktoria
Mitina and Lyudmila Pikhoi in a major reorganization of the
presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin said Yeltsin met his chief of staff Nikolai
Bordyuzha and the two discussed "current affairs" and arrived at
several decisions on personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Ogaryov was dismissed as a deputy head of the
presidential administration but named as a deputy secretary of the
Russian Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's return to the Kremlin, the first this year, was
planned but the staffers were aware of it, reported the Itar-Tass
news agency, quoting Kremlin sources.
</P>
<P>
Besides shaking up his own administration, Yeltsin also
accepted the resignation of Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Federation Council on the matter,
Yeltsin urged the upper house of parliament to relieve the duties
of Skuratov, who resigned "for health reasons".
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, the prosecutor general is appointed
and dismissed by the Federation Council on the initiative of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov's deputy, Yuri Chaika, told the Interfax news agency
that Skuratov was hospitalized after complaining of pains in the
area of his heart Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, said Skuratov's resignation was related to
the Prosecutor's Office investigation into the murders of
journalists and economic crimes in the oil industry, Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports that Skuratov stepped down for
differences with the presidential administration, but Yevgeny
Lisov, head of the Chief Control Department of the administration,
said his department had a good relationship with the Prosecutor
General's office.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who celebrated his 68th birthday in the Barvikha
sanatorium on Monday, checked out of the Central Clinical Hospital
Sunday after a 15-day treatment for gastric ulcer bleeding.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry said Tuesday that it is encouraged by the latest position
taken by the United Nations Security Council over the
Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that in
giving its support to the framework agreement of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) by calling it "the best hope for peace" and
by calling for its "full implementation without delay", the
Security Council has left no room for prevarication by Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian News Agency quoted the statement as
saying that " Ethiopia has sought to seek a solution to the crisis
through peaceful means in the hope that justice and international
law will prevail."
</P>
<P>
The statement said Ethiopia which recognizes that the OAU peace
 proposals are "fair and balanced" and "notably did not reward
aggression" has accepted in full the proposals.
</P>
<P>
It said the proposals represented the best possibility to
address the fundamental issues at stake in the dispute in a just
manner, adding the proposals are clear and their implementation is
being urgently awaited by Ethiopia and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"But what can be seen from Eritrea's reaction to the resolution
is that its authorities are still far from being prepared to
listen to reason," the statement added and urged the international
community to follow closely what Eritrea might be up to.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution Friday calling on
Eritrea to accept the OAU framework agreement for the peaceful
resolution of the Ethio- Eritrea border dispute. Ethiopia has
accepted the framework agreement which calls for the withdrawal of
Eritrean forces to their positions held before May 6, 1998 and for
the return of the civil administration to Badme, the disputed
border area.

Aoshen, forward Zhang, a rising star emerging this season from the
Sharks, tried a three-pointer attempt and made Ma Jian fouled.
Zhang dunked all the three free throws and leveled the game at 85
for all.
</P>
<P>
Yao Ming, who attracted attention from the National Basketball
Association, appeared first time in the staring line-up, but did
not prove his formidable pain scoring abilities.
</P>
<P>
But he was a steady threat under the basket especially into the
overtime when he pressed opponents' defence and opened chances for
his teammates to score.
</P>
<P>
The Sharks made a spectacular comeback in the fourth section
when they mended up a 15-point deficit to lead at 80-79 in just
eight minutes.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Pinochet Has no Immunity for Crimes Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) - A neutral lawyer suggested to
Britain's highest court on Wednesday that Former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet should not enjoy immunity from prosecution for
alleged crimes which his forces committed outside Chile.
</P>
<P>
David Lloyd Jones, who was invited to address as a "friend of
the court" to Britain's Law Lords, which is currently rehearing on
the case of Pinochet's immunity, argued that there were exceptions
to the immunity doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers repeatedly asserted that as a former head of
state he is immune from prosecution in Britain for the alleged
crimes happened during his 17-year rule in Chile which ended in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Jones said if officials went beyond their borders to commit
alleged crimes, it would be an exception to the immunity doctrine.
</P>
<P>
"Once conduct is outside the proper area of jurisdiction of the
acting state... it ceases to enjoy the protection" of legal
doctrines that generally keep states from judging actions
committed in another state, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in a London hospital on October 16
at the request of a Spanish, who accused the retired general of
responsibility to the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people
under his rule.
</P>
<P>
Documents submitted to the Law Lords by lawyers for Spain say
that under Pinochet "victims were abducted, tortured and murdered
in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia".
</P>
<P>
"Persons were murdered in the United States of America, and
steps were taken to implement the conspiracy in Spain, France,
Portugal and Italy," the documents say.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, the highest court in Britain, ruled last
November by three to two that Pinochet was not immune from
prosecution. That ruling paved a way for Pinochet being extradited
to Spain to face charges of murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
But the House of Lords later set aside the ruling after it
emerged that one of the five judges had very strong links to
Amnesty International, the human rights group which strongly
support Pinochet's extradition.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the rehearing on Pinochet's immunity will
end on Wednesday or Thursday. The new penal formed by seven lords
would make their decision after several days of study.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet currently lives in a mansion in the suburb of London,
waiting for the penal's decision. He will be free to go back to
Chile if the penal rules in favor of him.

<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy recently commented that he has personally
witnessed "China's extensive and ambitious program to build a
legal system from the ground up."
</P>
<P>
Kennedy arrived in China last Saturday to begin his fourth
visit to the country. The visit has included meetings with senior
judiciary officials, faculty members and students from various law
schools and the Chinese media. He told Xinhua News Agency that "
the U.S. media will quite likely be upset" since he usually turns
down their requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
"I'm an outside observer and not an expert capable of assessing
changes in China's legal system," said Kennedy. "I have, however,
noticed that China's current extensive legal reform is proceeding
rapidly and related efforts are generally excellent."
</P>
<P>
He voiced particular appreciation for open trials to public and
the introduction of a legal aid system across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The international judicial community has welcomed open trials
in China, according to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the fact that representatives from a U.S. company
were permitted to witness a recent trial in a Chinese intellectual
property rights court provided him with "additional assurances of
the justice in China's legal process."
</P>
<P>
A just and efficient legal system "is part of the capital
infrastructure of a society and is no less important to a country
than roads and bridges," he stressed.

<P>
BONN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter Has
reaffirmed his support for the 2006 World Cup to be staged in
Africa, but has not ruled out two nations co-hosting the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"If an African bidder has the necessary technical, logistical
and security conditions, it would be Africa's turn to stage the
World Cup" in 2006, Blatter told the German sports news agency SID
in an interview released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Five African countries have officially declared their interest
to stage the 2006 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa, Ghana
and Nigeria. England, Brazil and Germany are also bidding.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA president noted: "As long as a country is able to
stage the World Cup by itself, then it should be staged in one
country.
</P>
<P>
"But we should wait until 2002 has been played," he said. "
Then we'll have the experience and we'll see whether it was good."
</P>
<P>
The 2002 World Cup will be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"First we should wait for the 2002 experience," Blatter added,

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan To Quit CIS Security Treaty, Russia Voices Regret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- In a blow to the integration of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Uzbekistan said
Wednesday that it would terminate its membership in the CIS
Collective Security Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Tashkent does not consider expedient further membership in the
regional security alliance, Interfax quoted a high-ranking source
in the Uzbek Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was signed in Tashkent on May 15, 1992, by
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, is due to expire in
April this year. Belarus, Azerbaijan and Georgia joined the pact
later.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which came into effect in 1994 when it was ratified
by all the signatory countries, stipulates that the member states
may withdraw from it upon the expiration of a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
"The Collective Security Treaty, in its current form, does not
meet present-day requirements, and does not perform its functions,
" the source said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal also represents a setback for Russia's efforts
to strengthen its role in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Tashkent opposes Russia's military activity in individual CIS
countries," Interfax quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Russian Defense Ministry expressed regret for
the move but rejected the assertion that Moscow has stepped up
military activity in CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is pursuing a restrained policy and is curbing military
activity, particularly in CIS countries and in neighboring regions,
" said Leonid Ivashov, head of the ministry's Department for
International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted at the same time that "individual members of the CIS
are increasing the number of military exercises with the
participation of NATO units, particularly near the Russian borders,
" Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov did not say how many countries are expected to renew
the treaty. "The most important thing is that the signatories have
common interests in the sphere of political and military security,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the increased importance of the treaty when the
United States is adopting "an open use-of-force policy, and NATO
is demonstrating aggressiveness and is trying to enlarge the zone
of its influence and change the international legal practices
established between the states."
</P>
<P>
"We therefore need better coordinated moves to deal with the
diktat of strength," Ivashov said.

Throughout the visit, Kennedy often removed a copy of the U.S.
Constitution from his pocket and cited the significance of the
document. Upon learning that China has proposed to amend its
Constitution, Kennedy, a senior professor who has lectured on the
Constitution for 23 years, voiced his belief that judges worldwide
will hail the proposal to include the phrase 'governing the
country by law' in the document.
</P>
<P>
"The change would obviously be progressive, significant and
auspicious," said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court Justice has exhibited great interest in
promoting legal education and one of his primary objectives during
the current trip has been to enhance related cooperation. Kennedy
has not only held discussions with 12 deans of law faculties, but
has also presented a speech to law school students at the Chinese
People's University. He referred to the speech as a "classroom
exercise."
</P>
<P>
He said Temple University, an institute of higher education
located in the State of Pennsylvania, plans to send professors to
teach 50 Chinese law students, who will then be allowed to
complete courses in the United States. "I hope the program spreads
to other institutions," according to the justice.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy will also visit the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region where his packed schedule includes numerous meetings with
judges, lawyers and law students.

"The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court has urged me to
return to work," said Kennedy. "However, I will return to China in

The office did not give the names of the five Jews whose prison
terms will be shortened and when they committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
The office said the president made the decision because he had
ordered one week earlier to reduce the prison term of a
Palestinian who murdered an Israeli.
</P>
<P>
"The president made this decision also for the purpose of
building political confidence between the Israelis and the
Palestinians in order to move the peace process foward," the
office added.
</P>
<P>
But Weizman's decision also drew some criticism within
Israel. The attorney-general's office expressed its reservations
on the president's decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Wednesday criticized the Islamic militant group
Hamas for killing a Palestinian policeman, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, senior aid to PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat, said in a statement that the shooting incident, in
which a Palestinian policeman was killed by Hamas members, was
"a dangerous precedent".
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian security officer was shot to death in the
Gaza Strip on Monday when he tried to arrest three activists
of Hamas military wing, Izzadin Kassam.
</P>
<P>
The three men also ran over and killed a six-year-old
Palestinian girl while evading the arrest.
</P>
<P>
In response, Palestinian security forces have arrested dozens
of Hamas members in the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a Hamas spokesman in the Gaza Strip has
denied giving a green light to attack on policemen.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted the spokesman as saying that Hamas wants
to avoid civil war with the PNA at all costs.

LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Tennis
Federation (ITF), the world tennis governing body, said Wednesday
that it will continue its appeal against Petr Korda's drug case
ruled by a High Court last week in London.
</P>
<P>
A London High Court said the ITF could not appeal a decision by
its Civil Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The ITF said it would challenge last week's decision to go
before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Czech tennis player was found guilty of a doping offense
last December. He was taken off his world ranking points and
prizemoney in the Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
But the panel cited "exceptional circumstances" and said Korda
should not be banned for a year because he did not know he had
taken the banned drug.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from players for not suspending Korda, the ITF
said it planned to appeal the case before CBS, which prompted
Korda to take the case to the High Court.

ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes have taken off
from Incirlik air base in Adana, southern Turkey, on Wednesday for
northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 fighter jets, four tanker aircraft, one AWACS
plane and two commander planes took off from Incirlik between
09:45 and 11:00 a.m. local time (0745 and 0900 GMT) to patrol the

<P>
U.S. bombings of Iraqi sites in the restricted zones have

ABU DHABI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Two cyclists have arrived in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as part of a pan-Arab world tour on
bicycles designed to call for more efforts on environment
conservation, the Khaleej Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Aboudi Mustafa, 40, and Abdul Rahman Al Kisaimi, 28, two

The tour, to cover 11 countries, was sponsored by the Moroccan
Ministry of Environment and the Socialist Shabeeba Party.
</P>
<P>
Setting out from the Moroccan capital of Rabat, they pedaled to
the border town of Tanger and then traveled by sea to
Tunisia. From Tunisia they continued their journey which covered
Libya, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar and the UAE.

They are expected to finish the tour in Cairo and go home by
March.
</P>
<P>
"Ecology conservation is the responsibility of all and we are
out to help spread this message," said Al Aboudi, adding they hope
to spread the message through media and distribution of leaflets.

PHNOM PENH, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk denied Wednesday the allegation that he is considering
his successor, which was disclosed by opposition party leader Sam

Sam Rainsy said he had an audience with the king on Monday at
the royal palace for nearly three hours. They discussed many
topics including a successor to the throne.

Rainsy's allegation was not true. I will not do anything against
the constitution. The king has no right to appoint his successor.
It must be decided by the throne council."

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Li Lanqing Commemorates Lao She </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended
a seminar today and called on Chinese people to learn from late
writer Lao She (1898-1966).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar to mark Lao's 100th birth anniversary, Li
said people should learn from Lao's deep love for the nation and
its people, as well as his deep devotion to literature. The vice-
premier said Chinese people should study and draw from the rich
literary heritage left by the famed author.
</P>
<P>
"Learning from Lao She will be highly significant in our
efforts to further invigorate culture and arts, and build a
socialist culture with Chinese characteristics," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He praised Lao as "one of the highly prestigious trailblazers
in China's new literature in the 20th century," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the immortal spirit and realistic works of the
writer have in the past encouraged and will in the future
encourage people to complete creative works during the monumental
period marking the invigoration of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lao's literary works are deeply rooted in the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Most of his works were based on life and feelings of common
people in Beijing, a familiar city which evoked the author's
compassion. His pure, simple and expressive language came from the
working class and shines with the glory of realism," according to
Li.
</P>
<P>
"Lao lived up to his reputation as an 'artistic master of the
people'," said Li. He also pointed out that people engaged in the
arts and literature should learn from the strong national
characteristics in Lao's works in order to maintain the socialist
and national features of their own works, as well as to improve
national moral and esteem, and to enrich human civilization with
their outstanding achievements.
</P>
<P>
Li praised Lao as a great author, artist and compatriot.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the art and literary community should produce
more and better works to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
founding of new China.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the best way to commemorate Lao She," said Li,
adding that "we will never forget him."

<HEADLINE> Mental Health a Problem for One in Every Five UK Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- One in five children in Britain
suffer from a mental health problem, according to a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mental Health Foundation said in the report that up to 20
percent of children suffer some form of mental health problem,
while 10 percent need professional help.
</P>
<P>
The report called for a wide-ranging debate on society's values
and priorities which it said were increasing pressures on children.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics suggest that between seven and 10 percent
of youngsters suffer from anorexia or depression.
</P>
<P>
June McKerrow, director of the foundation, said that although
some of the illnesses suffered were temporary and mild, they could
develop into something worse if not properly dealt with.
</P>
<P>
She said the results were not surprising given that one in five
adults are thought to suffer from a mental illness at any given
time.
</P>
<P>
"Growing up is difficult and painful and we live in a
pressurized society," she said, adding, "The problems are getting
worse. We are obsessed by material rewards, economic pressures and
physical safety which all influence mental health."
</P>
<P>
The researcher observed that family fragmentation, pressure at
school and a lack of space and time to develop skills and
abilities were partly to be blamed for the problem.
</P>
<P>
Children were having their playtime restricted at schools
because of pressure for academic success, and parents were
concerned about letting their children play outside, she said.
</P>
<P>
Junior Health Minister John Hutton said the government welcomed
the report which highlighted an area neglected in the past.

<HEADLINE> Russian Space Mirror to Illuminate Canadian Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadians will get their first
glimpse this week of a Russian plan to light up the long, dark
winter with giant space-based mirrors, National Post newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To test the controversial plan, cosmonauts aboard the Mir space
station will try bouncing sunlight off a 25-meter-wide reflector
and beam the light down to Earth just after sunset Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The giant beams of reflected sunlight, which will be an
estimated five to seven kilometers wide, are expected to be
visible in several Russian and Canadian cities, including Calgary,
Winnipeg, and Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
The beams of light, which astronomers around the world will be
tracking with a mixture of curiosity and some with horror, are
expected to last up to 10 minutes on each target city. They will
look like brilliant stars and could be five to 10 times brighter

<P>
They also agreed that SAARC member states will "redouble
efforts to coordinate position prior to the third World Trade
Organization Ministerial Conference" later this year, and work out
a common stand for such emerging issues as intellectual property
rights, labor standards, electronic commerce and environment.

<P>
The ministers decided that there will be more exchange of
information on trade among SAARC members, and the meeting of the
Committee on Customs Cooperation will he held before October 1999,
the meeting on avoiding double taxation will be held in Pakistan
by 10th August this year, and the workshop on regional approach to
standardization, measurement and quality control will be held in
Delhi by June 1999.
</P>
<P>

to recognize SAARC as an association for according cumulative rule
of origin for Generalized System of Preferences Treatment.

WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- House minority leader Richard Gephardt has decided not to
challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination in hopes that Democrats will win control of the House
next year and he will become speaker.
</P>
<P>
-- Ethnic Albanian rebels agreed to participate in Western-led,
face-to-face talks with officials of the Yugoslav government in an
effort to end the bitter war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Most Americans now condemn the Senate for its handling of
the impeachment trial as much as they did the House, and
Republicans are taking most of the blame. The party's fortunes
have so sagged that half of even conservative REpublicans say
their party's prospects for the 2000 elections have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
-- Almost daily American air strikes on Iraq have turned into
the equivalent of a low-level war, hitting a wide range of
military targets. While the Pentagon justifies the attacks as
defensive, some of the targets pose little immediate threat to
American or British pilots patrolling much of Iraq's skies.

<HEADLINE> Elated China Claims Three More Golds, Zero Again for Host </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China vaulted to
the leading place in the Winter Asiad Wednesday with ecstasy
gifted from three gold medals, at least a pair never counted into
their medals expectation, overleapt the host South Korea, who
continued their golds drought for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
China, who came into the day's competition with two golds fewer
than South Korea, was crowned with nine golds, seven silvers and
eight bronzes, an important stride towards the final top position
at the Kangwon Winter Asiad to be ended on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was mourning with the second place with eight gold
medals as its egotistic athletes did not have their national
anthem sung by the audience.
</P>
<P>
"It was unexpected for us to win nine golds so earlier at the
Games," said Zhu Chengyi, secretary-general of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Now I think we can defend our top position we won in the
Harbin Winter Asiad in 1996, at least the second place," Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
China won the 15 gold medals in Harbin, followed by Kazakhstan
with 14, and Japan and South Korea with eight golds each.
</P>
<P>
Xue secured the first gold for China on the ice when she led a
China's medals sweep in the women's 500m speed skating with an
accumulated time of one minute 20.13 seconds after the second
round. Her teammates Yuang Chunyuan and Wang Manli got the silver
and the bronze respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great happiness for me to defend the gold medal,"
said Xue, who shared the victory on the same event with Wang Manli
in Harbin, China.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the pair results in the 500m competition
here," said the 31-year-old Xue, fourth at the Lillehammer
Olympics and the overall winner in the World Cup series in the
same event in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the crystal world, Zhang Qing of China even surprised the
Chinese delegation when he took his second gold in the men's
biathlon 10 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"The golds gave me confidence to contend the World Cup and
World Championships in the future as well as the Winter Olympic
Games in the year of 2002," said Zhang, a 20-year-old armyman.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Dmitriy Pozdnyakov and Dmitriy Pantov took the
silver and bronze medals respectively. The results were a repeat
of that of Monday's men's 20km when Zhang also beat the Kazakh duo.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shumei, fifth placer at the Nagano Olympics last February,
won the women's 7.5 kilometers biathlon, the third and edging gold
for China to top the medal tally standings, with a time of 23
minutes 57.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Margarita Dulova of Kazakhstan took the silver and Sun Ribo of
China won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Kazahkstan shared the glory with China on the snow by taking
other two golds in the cross country skiing and Alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
A Kazakhstan quartet, composed of Svetlana Deshevykh, Elena
Kolomina, Olga Selezneva and Sevetlana Shishkina, won the women's
4x5 kilometers relay, while Japan took the silver with defending
champion China third.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan also claimed the women's giant slalom through Olga
Vedyasheva, who outskied her South Korean rival with a total time
of 2:11.27.
</P>
<P>
You Hae-min, who led the first round in 1:04.04 this morning,
finished second in 2:11.42 following a slower time of 1:07.38.
Another Kazakhstan Juliya Krygina was third in 2:14.65.
</P>
<P>
Vedyasheva's victory helped Kazakhstan to reap five gold medals
allover, one gold ahead of Japan, to locate at the third place on
the medal standings.
</P>
<P>
The last gold went to Shoji Kato of Japan who took the speed
skating men's 500 meters race.
</P>
<P>
Kato, third in the first round Tuesday in 37.52 seconds, skated
in the last second of six pairs by clocking 37.450, collecting a
total time of 1 minutes 14.970 seconds for the gold.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Jaegal Sung-yeol took the silver in 1:15.110,
while Kazuya Nishioka of Japan captured the bronze, 0.01 second
behind Jaegal.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tournament favorites Katsuhiro Kato of Japan, first place
in 37.45 seconds in the first round, and Li Yu of China, second in
37.460 Tuesday, were disappointed with their second round results
after a five-minute rewarm-up.
</P>
<P>
The contesting pair was called back after started off as the
referee's hand-time watch was not ready. The skaters restarted
five minutes later but could not set the pace again.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Tracing Culprit in Murder of Int'l </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MORGADISHU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Somali National Front
(SNF) faction Wednesday confirmed the killing of Dr. M.S. Bohgal,
an international aid worker in south Somalia, declaring that they
are tracing the culprit.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SNF faction, Ibrahim Jarna Howleh, said
that the culprit, who killed the Kenyan aid worker serving in the
Italian agency, Terra Nuova, in Gedo region last week, will be
brought before the regional courts of Gedo for justice as soon as
they catch those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Howleh said that the bandits manipulated by "foreigners" have
been behind the killing of the Kenyan aid worker, but he did not
point his finger of blame at any country.
</P>
<P>
He sent his heart-felt condolences on behalf of his faction to
the family, agency and the internal aid agencies at large for the
grievance which resulted from the killing of the veterinarian
doctor in Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
The international aid agencies have evacuated their
international staff from Gedo region in protest against the
killing of the Terra Nuova aid worker.
</P>
<P>
The agencies said that they won't resume their humanitarian
operations in the region unless the culprit is caught and brought
to book.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Gedo region, the aid worker (whom
they said was Indian in color) was killed for wage-related
disputes by gunmen also working for the aid agency.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation of the international aid agencies from the
region has come at a time when famine caused by prolonged drought
and lack of water is seriously worsening the life in Gedo and its
neighboring regions of Bay and Bakol in southern Somalia.

pair of goals for a 5-1 thrash in the eight-nation Dunhill Cup
soccer tournament Wednesday night in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economic Conditions Are Better Than Any Time in 25 Years: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
Wednesday said Australian economy hadn't been in better shape for
a quarter of a century despite the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
While addressing in his electorate of Bennelong, in north
Sydney, Howard said "the general economic conditions are better
than at any time in the 25 years I've been in federal politics",
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed signs of renewed strength in the housing
industry, with a surge in residential building approvals in
December.
</P>
<P>
"We are living in very good economic times, we are living in
times of very low inflation, we are living in times of very low
interest rates, we are living in a time when the Australian
economy has really been able to see off the worst of the Asian
economic downturn."
</P>
<P>
However, Howard warned that there was no room for complacency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said earlier Wednesday that
building work approved in Australia soared in December, with a
total of 13,325 houses, units and other dwellings given the
go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up a seasonally adjusted 6.4 percent from the
previous month but remained slightly lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The rise was the biggest monthly increase in six months and
came in way above market expectations which centered on a monthly
rise of 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Industry Association said high levels of
pre-Olympic building activity contributed to the increase in the
number of approvals, along with buying which had been brought
forward due to the impending introduction of the goods and
services tax package.
</P>
<P>
And Master Builders Australia said last December's interest
rate cut had bolstered home buyers' confidence and should act as a
positive for the industry in the first half of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
issued the call during his recent fact-finding tour in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The leader visited an infantry brigade and a water supply
engineering regiment stationed in the region. Jiang extended best
wishes to all branches of the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
armed police units, militia reserve forces and related military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the army's victorious battle against last summer'
s devastating floods and the military's withdrawal from business
activities. He said that related efforts will have a far-reaching
influence on military modernization.
</P>
<P>
Jiang previously visited PLA units stationed in the region in
1990 and during the recent visit expressed great pleasure at
seeing major improvements of local military modernization. He said
that officers and soldiers stationed in the region have overcome
adverse natural conditions and contributed greatly to the region's
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He called on the PLA to unswervingly adhere to the strategy of
improving the army by means of science and technology. He pointed
to related activities as the key to providing better training and
strengthening combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
Jiang showed great concern with the lodging, and recreational
and educational facilities available for soldiers. The Chinese
president presented 1,000 books and over 3,000 VCDs to local
military units and encouraged soldiers to concentrate on modern
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the water supply engineering regiment to extend
greater efforts to help develop the local economy. He told members
of the military to respect local Party committees and governments
and implement the Party's policies on religion.

<HEADLINE> Australia Dollar Rises to Nearly 64 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar chugged
higher Wednesday but failed to sustain a move through the 64 U.S.
cent level.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and
stronger commodity prices also helped the local currency trade to
a day-time high of 64.03 U.S. cents but it was knocked back by
strong selling interest.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 63.98 U.S. cents from 63.73
cents Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
It also finished at 0.5637 euro from 0.5629 euro Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a slow grind higher today, we did a lot of work
last night and early this morning around the 63.80 U.S. cents
level," IBJ manager of foreign exchange Darrin Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
The stronger Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar was also
supportive for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The absence of an announcement on monetary policy by Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) this morning was supportive for the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Some were expecting RBA to do something today and once that
didn't happen it really gave the Australian dollar the impetus to
push through the 63.80-85 U.S. cents area and up to the highs
around 64.03 U.S. cents," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
RBA last eased official interest rates after its meeting in
December, reducing the cash rate to 4.75 percent from 5.00
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The absence of any move from the RBA today suggests that the
monetary authorities do not see a compelling case for another rate
cut at present," Commonwealth Bank economist Michael Blythe said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Further Tap Domestic Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The key for Guangdong's 8.5
percent economic growth target for 1998 centers on further tapping
the domestic market, according to Lu Ruihua, governor of the south
China province.
</P>
<P>
Lu told a conference today that Guangdong will face the same
economic environment as last year, with continuing difficulties
resulting from the lingering negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Guangdong, an economic powerhouse in China, will expand
rural markets by appropriately raising prices for agricultural
products in order to increase the rural income level, and will at
the same time lower electricity prices to enable farmers to
purchase more electric appliances.

<HEADLINE> Minister Urges Serious Approach to Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Year 2000 problem (Y2K) has
reached a critical point in China, and all industries need to
solve it in the set time frame, Minister of Information Industry
Wu Jichuan warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that his ministry's latest investigation on the Y2K
situation shows inconsistent development in tackling this problem.
</P>
<P>
"Key sectors such as finance, securities and futures have
basically completed the revision (of computer systems), and have
begun testing and started designing back-up plans," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, taxation, customs, civil aviation, statistics,
meteorological, and petrochemical sectors are well into the
revision stage, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
There is only 56 days before the revision completion date
designated by the State Council, and 240 days before the set date
on which all testing on the revised computer systems will be
completed.
</P>
<P>
The tasks are tough and urgent. However, there are still
problems lingering which could affect the realization of the
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that inadequate understanding of Y2K's impact at
certain decision-making levels is a fundamental obstacle to fully
solving the problem. He called for thorough research and
investigation of the non-imbedded computer equipment and systems.
</P>
<P>
Financial problems are impending, too. Wu said some
administrative organs and businesses have not allocated special
funds to help solve the Y2K problem; many enterprises are
complaining about insufficient economic resources to cover the
costs pertaining to fixing their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The minister also pointed to inadequate cooperation and
prohibitive economic demand from some high-tech companies, which
are playing an important role in helping solve the Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Trade Ministers Vow to Boost Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Russian trade
ministers agreed here on Wednesday that both sides should take
concrete measures to boost the declining trade between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), made a number of proposals at the regular
meeting with his Russian counterpart, Georgy Gabunia, who arrived
in China on Tuesday to make preparations for the upcoming summit
between Chinese premier Zhu Rongji and Russian prime minister
Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow later this month.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese trade minister said that both sides should step up
efforts to promote trade in various forms while paying attention
to market developments and promoting investment and border trade
as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has great interest in jointly utilizing the
forest resources of Russia, adding that this could be a new growth
area for bilateral trade as China is short of timber.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shi said that China will soon establish a trade
center and a department store in Moscow to promote the sale of
Chinese goods there.
</P>
<P>
China's trade volume with Russia declined to 5.48 billion U.S.
dollars last year, down 10.5 percent, mainly as a result of the
financial crisis and the devaluation of the ruble, Gabunia said.
</P>
<P>
Russia was China's eighth largest trading partner in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral trade has huge potential, but the current level of
economic cooperation and trade is not in keeping with the
strategic partnership between China and Russia nor with the
economic size of the two nations," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is convinced that trade relations and
economic cooperation between China and Russia will arrive at a new
level under the joint efforts of both governments and
entrepreneurs," he added.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia formed a regular meeting mechanism for their
prime ministers in 1996. An agreement signed in 1997 stipulates
that the heads of government of the two nations should meet at
least once a year, in China and in Russia alternately.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia agreed with Shi that economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries have wide potential, saying experts from
both nations should make further studies of ways to promote trade
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two trade ministers signed a summary of their talks at the
Wednesday meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Illegal Lottery Ticket Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua)-- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
announced today that it will strengthen regulations governing the
sales of lottery tickets in a bid to protect the public's
interests.
</P>
<P>
Illegal sales of lottery tickets include misrepresenting them
in the guise of prize-winning sales, individuals operating without
permission, sales of overseas lottery tickets in the domestic
market, and pyramid sales of lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the PBOC, the country's central bank, said that
China's lottery market has endured problems and illegal practices
in recent years. According to the bank, the illegal sales of
lottery tickets in some coastal regions has had a severe negative
impact on local financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC requires that institutions selling lottery tickets
must give the public all the necessary information concerning the
issuing of tickets and the use of welfare funds raised from the
sales.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the whole process of lottery tickets must be audited
by authorized firms, with the results published in the Financial
News, according to the PBOC.

<HEADLINE> Women's Rights Protected in HKSAR: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is committed to
protecting women's rights, Secretary of Home Affairs David Lan
told the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lan was speaking at a hearing held by the committee in New York
as head of a team of HKSAR Government officials that formed part
of China's delegation.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech at the hearing, Lan said the freedom and
rights of HKSAR residents, be they men and women, are duly
protected by law.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong sustains a good human rights record, and the human
rights protection framework after the reunification is considered
to be even more profound. The Basic Law, our mini-constitution,
stipulates that HKSAR shall safeguard the rights and freedom of
the residents and of other people in the Region in accordance with
the law."
</P>
<P>
On the rights of women, Lan said the HKSAR has already had a
well-established and comprehensive framework in place to handle
matters relating to women and the protection of their rights.
</P>
<P>
According to him, two pieces of specific legislation were
enacted to eliminate discriminatory treatment of women. The Sex
Discrimination Ordinance (SDO) was enacted in 1995. Discrimination
on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in specified
areas of activity is rendered unlawful. Sexual harassment and
discriminatory practices are also outlawed under the SDO.
</P>
<P>
The Family Status Discrimination Ordinance (FSDO) came into
operation in 1997. It outlaws discrimination over a person's
family status in specified areas of activities similar to those
covered under the SDO.
</P>
<P>
The Equal Opportunities Commission is responsible for enforcing
anti-discrimination ordinances, including the SDO and FSDO. The
Commission is an independent statutory organization which is
tasked with the responsibility of eliminating discrimination and
promoting equal opportunities between men and women.
</P>
<P>
In order to eliminate discriminatory or unfair treatment of
women, the HKSAR Government is committed to modifying all
legislation which contain discriminatory provisions against women,
he said. So far, more than 20 amendments to six ordinances were
made in this connection.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Lan also outlined the general situation of
women's welfare in Hong Kong, including the improving status of
women at the workplace and the society at large, equal
opportunities on education for both genders, and the comprehensive
range of health care services available to women.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices kept nose-diving
on Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as the large write-down by a

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Its Overseas Scholars To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
February 3 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese scholars and students
who have returned to the homeland have made great contributions to
the country's development, since the reform and opening up policy
was introduced in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of last year, a total of 320,000 Chinese scholars
and students had pursued their studies in overseas countries, of
which 100,000 have returned and are playing an important role in
many sectors," said Wei Yu, vice-minister of education, today at a
national conference focused on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Wei explained that the Chinese government supports scholars and
students to study overseas and encourages them to return home when
they have completed studying. But it does allow them to choose
whether to stay overseas or return. "But the emphasis is on
encouraging scholars to return," stressed Wei.
</P>
<P>
She also said that more and more overseas scholars and students
are choosing to return, with the rate increasing by 13 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Education showed that over 50
percent of presidents and vice presidents of the 44 colleges under
the ministry's control once studied abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the Ministry of Education has also given financial
support to 1,100 overseas scholars to help them develop their
academic researches in China.
</P>
<P>
This year, about 148 overseas Chinese scholars will take
teaching positions at key universities in the country. They will
receive an annual salary of 100,000 yuan from a special fund by
the Ministry of Education.

<HEADLINE> Piracy in Southeast Asia, Far East Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Pirate attacks in Southeast
Asia and the Far East have decreased in the past three years,
according to data revealed by an ongoing international seminar
held here.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
Regional Seminar and Workshop on Piracy and Armed Robbery Against
Ships shows the number of piracy cases in the region dropped to
110 in 1997 from 141 in 1996 and further contracted to 95 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that there has not been a single pirate attack in
Singapore's water since 1991 thanks to its Coast Guard's
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Seminar participants attributed the positive development to the
joint efforts of countries in the region and took it as an
inspiring result of the cooperative measures taken by concerned
countries in the region to keep ship lane safe.
</P>
<P>
The seminar and workshop, attended by some 70 participants and
observers from 19 maritime administrations, is part of the
on-going efforts by the IMO to improve safety at sea and in port
areas through assisting government officials in the countries
concerned to enhance their capability for preventing and
suppressing piracy and armed robbery against ships in their
coastal waters and ports through measures such as the
implementation of IMO guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The seminar and workshop will cover topics such as
international law, IMO guidelines on prevention and suppression of
piracy and robbery and reports by concerned countries on incidents
in their waters and measures taken to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Participants hold that the need to tackle effectively piracy
and armed robbery against ships has taken on greater urgency in
view of the current economic crisis afflicting the region.

"It has the functions of on-line application, delivery,
cancellation and searching, and can be used in E-business," said
the head of the assessment panel Yang Fuqing, a professor at the
Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
It is the first system of its kind developed in China, she
added, and China owns the copyright.

<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China will sponsor training
courses for managers of enterprises manufacturing low-quality
products, according to the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
One source said that "this effort aims to improve managers'
quality awareness and improve the image of Chinese products."
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that a nationwide selective examination of
over 1,443 products conducted last year showed that the
qualification rate of Chinese products stood at 78.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of qualification rate, the products of state-owned
enterprises proved to be much better than those of private
enterprises, 82.9 percent compared to 71.4 percent, while between
these two were the products of foreign-funded ventures, joint-
stock companies and collectively-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The source said that it is urgent to train managers of private
and small-sized enterprises, as their products are endangering the

<HEADLINE> Liberia Denies Support for S. Leonean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian Embassy in Lagos,
Nigeria, has reaffirmed its country's commitment to the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and denied again
Liberia's support for the rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Charge d'Affaires of the embassy Roland Bedell said in an
interview that "Liberia has no interest in arming any rebel to
attack Sierra Leone" and would never encourage its citizens to
involve in fighting a sister nation, The Guardian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bedell buttressed the Liberian position with a "special
message" from its Foreign Affairs Ministry dated January 20 which
announced that President Charles Taylor has sent a four-member
delegation to seven ECOWAS member countries on the Sierra Leonean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The message from Taylor reaffirmed the Liberian government's
support for ECOWAS effort in Sierra Leone, saying that ECOWAS
framework remained the best approach to lasting peace in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat decried the allegation that Liberia is backing the
 Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone led by Foday Sankoh,
saying "though President Charles Taylor has known Sankho for
sometime, he has not and does not intend to support him with arms
or troops or whatever he (Sankoh) wages war against the legitimate
government in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Bedell described as unfortunate the existence of some Liberian
mercenaries in Sierra Leone but said "they are there of their own
volition", adding that it was difficult for his home government to
stop them since they were recruited by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Pushes Reform Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung vowed Wednesday to eradicate corruption and regional rivalry
and build a knowledge-based country through a "Rebuilding Korea"
reform campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kim urged South Koreans to participate in the reform campaign,
which he first outlined on the August 15 Liberation Day in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We gather here today to cherish the noble resolve and sense of
mission to rebuild the foundation of the nation," Kim told a 10,
000-strong rally at Seoul Chamshil Gymnasium to mark the official
launching of the Rebuilding Korea campaign.
</P>
<P>
The reform campaign will focus on seven major goals --
democracy, market economy, globalization, social justice,
knowledge-based nation, inter-Korean cooperation and exchanges,
and cooperative labor-management relations.
</P>
<P>
The reform agenda will be pushed by the National Commission for
Rebuilding Korea (NCRK) led by economist Byun Hyung-yoon. The NCRK,
which consists of more than 430 representatives from various walks
of life, is aided by local promotion panels set up at the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean opposition Grand National Party said the
Kim Dae-jung government may use the campaign to broaden its
political base in the same manner as the previous governments.
</P>
<P>
"As President, I declare unequivocally once again that the
government does not have the slightest intention to use the
Rebuilding Korea movement politically," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective of the campaign is to wipe out all
wrongs that have accumulated since the nation was founded 50 years
ago and to conduct a comprehensive reform in pursuit of democracy
and a market economy.
</P>
<P>
To that end, Kim said South Korea should eradicate collusion
between politicians and businessmen, end government control of
bank financing and root out corruption and irregularities.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia has the world's
second highest rate of car theft, with about 122,000 vehicles
stolen each year at an annual cost to the community of more than
one billion Australian dollars (630 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Car owners could be forced to install an immobilizer on their
cars before they could be registered or sold under a proposal to
crack down on car theft.
</P>
<P>
National Motor Vehicle Theft Reduction Council chairman Leon
Daphne said Wednesday the council would monitor a Western
Australian scheme under which car immobilizers will be made
compulsory from July this year, according to a report by
Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
And the council would continue talks with the car manufacturing
industry in an effort to ensure all new cars made in Australia
were fitted with immobilizers.
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 million cars on Australian roads and obviously
it's going to take some time through the new vehicle system to
work through the whole car park so we do have to look at those
cars that are more at risk", Daphne said.
</P>
<P>
The new West Australia law requiring immobilizers to be fitted
will apply to all car owners applying to register or transfer the
ownership of vehicles from July 1.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set up Organ Sharing Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will soon set up
a database to keep in record people in dire need of human organs
to ensure just and equitable distribution of the donated organs.
</P>
<P>
The database -- Malaysian Organ Sharing System -- is expected
to come into being next month, according to Secretary of the
Malaysian Society of Transplantation Tan Chwee Choon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Setting up of the database would help to centralize
coordinating process between donors and recipients, he said at a
one-day seminar on organ donation here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 300 to 500 patients on waiting list for
kidney transplant alone at government hospitals nationwide,
according to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
Only two percent of about 2,000 new kidney patients in 1996
underwent transplant after obtaining organs donated by their
relatives, said Tan, a consultant nephrologist, who expressed his
confidence that more people would be aware on the need for organ
donation once the database becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
"We consider human organs as national resources that should be
shared equitably among those in need," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia recently launched a drive for organ donations due to
the rising demand for organs and the expensive cost of dialysis.

JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Ministry plans to boost construction of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank before the general elections
in May, said Eli Cohen, the ministry's adviser on settlements, on
Tuesday. He said the move was made to avoid a similar scenario to
what followed the June 1992 elections, when the Labor Party froze
construction shortly after it came to power.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and Egypt will resume talks on bilateral aviation
issues on Thursday in Cairo after a hiatus of nearly a year. A
delegation from the Palestinian National Authority will also join
the discussion on issues related to the international airport in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Avi Primor, Israeli ambassador to Germany, returned to
Israel Tuesday night after being summoned by Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon. Primor was asked to clarify remarks he made in an
interview with the German daily Die Welt. Primor reportedly
depicted Sharon and other ultra-Orthodox parties in Israel as
undemocratic.

<HEADLINE> More Taxes Raked in Kenya for the Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (XInhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) collected 41.3 billion Shillings (about 689 million U.S.
Dollars) in the second quarter of the 1998-1999 fiscal year, a
rise of 17.5 percent over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The tax revenues swelled six billion Shillings (about 98
million U.S. Dollars ) in the period from October to December last
year compared with the same period in 1997, the Kenya Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
KRA said in a statement that several factors combined had lead
to the impressive performance. The first one was an intensified
crackdown on diversion of transit goods into the local markets.
</P>
<P>
KRA also introduced a new effective system of monitoring the
processing of Customs and Excise refund claims and new measures to
counter the abuse of export bonds in value added tax.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons included increased use of legislative power to
enforce payment of taxes, intensified efforts in collection of
Exercise Duty and crackdown on dumping of petroleum products.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Deliver Upgraded Jets to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
(IAI) is expected to deliver the upgraded F-4 fighter jets to
Turkey about two months ahead of schedule, local daily The
Jerusalem Post reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted IAI spokesman Doron Suslik as saying that the IAI
will conduct the first test flight of an upgraded F-4 fighter jet
around early to mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Turkish pilots and officials are also expected to be present
for the test flight.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey signed a military cooperation agreement in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The project, under which Israel would upgrade 54 Turkish F-4
fighter jets, was at a cost of 632 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's National Security Adviser David Ivry has
flown to Turkey for the bi-annual strategic talks, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Ivry, who was instrumental in forging the defense ties with
Turkey, is expected to stay in Turkey for two days.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Military Working Plan Calls for Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military has adopted
a new working plan which calls for increased readiness for war and
heightened efforts on stockpiling, training and further expending
military forces.
</P>
<P>
The plan, the first in two years, was made public by Deputy
Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Uzi Dayan on Tuesday and published by
local press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To win on the battlefield in the future, the Israel Defense
Force (IDF) has to be built in order to "have more flexibility of
missions and theaters-of-operations," said Dayan.
</P>
<P>
Though he did not mention specifically the possible declaration
of Palestinian independence in May this year, Dayan said that the
IDF was preparing for "any and all possibilities."
</P>
<P>
The IDF spent 625 million U.S. dollars of its 8.15 billion
dollar budget in 1998 on routine security tasks and is expected
to spend the same this year.
</P>
<P>
It is also investing 35 million U.S. dollars on new weapons and
defensive technology in high-tech areas of operations, Dayan said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the IDF will reduce the number of days
reservists serve on active duties such as patrolling the borders,
while increasing the number of days devoted to training.
</P>
<P>
The army is also considering excusing reserve battalions from
routine security service once every three years.
</P>
<P>
Still, the lion's share of IDF investment in the coming years
will go to the Air Force, military intelligence and modern
weaponry for combat troops.
</P>
<P>
The IDF would draw about 1 billion dollars from its own
resources on weapons acquisition over the next five years, Dayan
said, adding that the IDF would also be stocking up on supplies,
spare parts and ammunition in view of uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
While refusing to elaborate on whether Israel was moving toward
war or serious conflicts, Dayan said that surprise call-ups of
reserves would be held in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The IDF also plans to cut down on career personnel and
restrict the number of pension-receivers in a bid to divert some
of the money to highly qualified personnel to stay in uniform.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's military law, male and female citizens up to the
age of 18 must serve in the IDF for three and two years
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some of the young soldiers may choose to become officers or
career personnel, but most prefer further studies in colleges or
universities after they leave the army, thus joining the ranks of
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Open to Indonesia's Mediation in Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Wednesday that he is open to a proposal for
Indonesia to broker the peace talks between the government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in a bid to achieve a lasting
peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, any talks with the MILF leaders should
exclude the issue of territorial integrity and any attempt to hold
the negotiations outside the framework of the Philippine
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We will accept any help they can offer us, because we want
peace in our country, especially in Mindanao," Estrada said when
asked in an interview whether or not he would accept Indonesia as
broker of peace talks between the government and the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said that any talks with the MILF should be
held within the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Wednesday, the presidential palace
said that Indonesia's involvement would be limited to being only
an independent mediator, or similar to the role it had played
during the peace talks between the Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The government and the MNLF forged a peace agreement in 1996,
with Indonesia continuing to monitor implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF rejected the accord and vowed to fight for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between the government and the MILF last week killed
over 30 people and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a ceasefire last Wednesday and agreed to
start formal peace talks next week in southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Hosts SAARC Economic Cooperation Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The third SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Economic Cooperation
Conference started here Wednesday to discuss trade and economic
cooperation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, organized by the Federation of
Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), "provides an
excellent forum for exchanging views and will help to further
strengthen SAARC," FBCCI President Abdul Awal Mintoo told the
inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
More than one-fifth of the world's population live in South
Asia, but the share of the region in the world trade is less than
1 percent and intra-regional trade is only 3 percent of its total
trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total global foreign direct investment of about 300
billion U.S. dollars a year, only about 1 percent comes to South
Asian countries, according to Mintoo.
</P>
<P>
He urged both India and Pakistan to allow zero-tariff entry to
exports from the least developed countries of the region,
including Bangladesh, on non-reciprocal basis. "The least
developed countries should not merely be looked at as a
destination for exports but also as a competitive source of goods
and service," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The conference would discuss "the entire gamut of issues
related to regional cooperation in SAARC," particularly six
subjects - trade, telecommunication and information technology,
investment, energy, infrastructure, and travel and tourism, said
Kantikumar R. Podar, President of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The progress in getting rid of poverty and under-development in
the region is rather slow, he said, compared with the developments
in other economic groupings, such as the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He urged SAARC countries to sign the inter-governmental treaty
on South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangements (SAFTA) by the
year 2000 to achieve SAFTA phase by phase by the year 2005.

South Asia constitutes the world's largest dormant market,

priority to regional cooperation for enhancing both the level and
the quantum of intra-SAARC trade" and "explore the possibility of
intra-regional investment for setting up joint-venture industries
within the region."
</P>
<P>
"The SAARC Chamber and the national governments together should
pursue realistic policies based on the resources and comparative
advantages to transform "our area into a vibrant and effective
market larger in size than the European Union," she said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Capital to Crack Down on Porn Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Tanzanian
capital will step up crackdown on pornographic video films which
are widely viewed by juveniles at home.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred Gewe, has
said he intends to hold a meeting with city commission officials
on how to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming pornographic films in the city are "corrupting
the minds of immature children and are against the norms and
values of our society," Gewe was quoted by Daily Mail Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper revealed that some adults purposely offer their
living rooms to children to watch obscene film shows in order to
make money for meeting family expenses.
</P>
<P>
It also said students at a girl school are talking about the
fantasy of the X-rated films and informing each other where such
films are shown.
</P>
<P>
A resident of Keko Mwanga in the city said that he knows about
seven families in his neighborhood where pornographic films are
illegally shown to teen-agers every evening at an entrance fee of
100 Shillings (one U.S. Dollar equals 685 Shillings).
</P>
<P>
Gewe called on the government and community members to work
together with the police in combating the sickening off-color
films before it is too late.

<HEADLINE> China Pushes Forward Deep Sea Mining For Rare Metals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China has announced it is to
draw up boundaries for its exclusive mineral mining operations in
75,000 square kilometers of the eastern section of the Pacific
Ocean where it intends to intensify its exploration activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China was officially recognized by the United Nations
as one of the pioneering investors in international seabed
exploration and acquired the mining right in an area of 150,000 sq.
km of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
After surveys indicated poor reserves in large tracts of the
original zone, China has given up the right for about half of the
area. It will now concentrate on the new, smaller mining zone
which geologists estimate could have an annual production capacity
of three million tons of rare metals such as manganese, nickel and
cobalt. The reserves are expected to last for at least 20 years,
which will help ease the shortage of such rare metals in China
throughout the early part of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The newly designated area is estimated to contain about 112
million tons of manganese, 4 million tons of copper, 5 million
tons of nickel and 980,000 tons of cobalt.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Xianglong, an academician at the Chinese
Academy of Engineering (CAE), the metals and minerals are
scattered on the sea-bed "like potatoes".
</P>
<P>
He added, "China has now acquired the advanced technology to
pick up these 'potatoes like' lumps of rock and metal from the
deep sea."
</P>
<P>
After much research Chinese engineers have developed a robot
which can operate 6,000 meters underwater and will be used in such
deep-sea mining.
</P>
<P>
However, this type of exploration requires high technology and
a large investment with a concurrent high risk factor, warned Jin
Jiancai, secretary-general of the China Ocean Mineral Resources
Research and Development Association.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the need to find more reserves of rare metals on the
ocean beds, Jin went on to say that because of the pace of
development in technologies, modern instruments and
telecommunications, China's land-based rare metals resources only
have a further 30 to 50 years of life.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the shortage of rare metals would have great
impact on people's lives," said Wang Dianzuo, vice president of
the CAE.
</P>
<P>
He explained, for example, that the batteries used in mobile
phones consume a large amount of nickel every year. "If those
nickel resources are exhausted, people will lose the convenience
brought about by mobile phones," he said, adding the crisis will
also appear in other areas using products needing rare minerals
and metals.

MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Muslim rebels continued
Wednesday their attacks against military installations of the

LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has with
immediate effect suspended the five percent customs duty on all
newsprint.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has slapped 25 percent duty on
all imported newspapers and periodicals in a deliberate move aimed
at boosting the newspaper industry and the manufacturing sector in
the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted Deputy Commissioner of
Customs and Excise, Chriticles Mwansa, as saying that as a further
incentive to the local newspaper industry and publishers, the
government has slapped duty on all imported newspapers and
periodicals "to level the playing field" and promote the local
industry.
</P>
<P>
Local publications which are printed elsewhere other than
Zambia will be affected and will have to be imported back into the
country at the same duty rate.
</P>
<P>
The move is an intended deterrent to publishers who shun the
local industry in preference to South African printers.
</P>
<P>
Previously, publishers never paid any duty on such publications
and the government hopes that the introduction of the 25 percent
duty will work to the advantage of the local industry.

CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia marked its 50th
anniversary of the first citizenship ceremony here Wednesday, with
two of the first seven people to become naturalized Australian
citizens of 50 years attending an official commemorative ceremony
as special guests of honor.
</P>
<P>
Spanish born sugar cane farmer Angel Muguira, 76, former
Frenchman Leon Durand, 86, and five others took part in the first
Australian citizenship ceremony conducted by then prime minister
Ben Chifley in Canberra on February 3, 1949.
</P>
<P>
The seven men, originally from such European countries as
Czechoslovakia, Spain, Denmark, Greece, France, Yugoslavia and
Norway, represented each state and Canberra, known as the
Australian Capital Territory.
</P>
<P>
Before the White Australian Policy was removed in 1973, Asian
people were required to pass a European language test, which
effectively blocked the influx of Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The status of Australian citizen was created on January 26,
1949, when the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 came into
force. Before then, most people living in Australia were British
subjects.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949 more than 3 million people have become Australian
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Australian Immigration Minister
Philip Ruddock said of those seven people, four are deceased and
the fifth could not be located.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's inflation Rate Further Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (xinhua) -- The inflation rate in Kenya
declined further to 5.8 percent in January 1999 from 7.6 percent
registered in December 1998, according to a weekly report of the
Central Bank of Kenyan (CBK) available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CBK attributed the inflation rate slip to the slow
expansion of money supply, stable exchange rate of local currency
and improved supply of staple foods.
</P>
<P>
The overall month-to-month inflation rate fell to negative 1.1
percent from 2.5 percent in December, a clear indication that
CBK's monetary policies have been paying off.
</P>
<P>
On the interest rate, the report said, the liquidity in the
domestic money market eased in the week to January 29 with the
average interbank interest rate declining to 8.51 percent from
9.34 percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The 91-day Treasury bill rate also fell further to 9.99 percent
in auction value on February 1 from 10.59 percent in the previous
auction.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the Kenyan Shilling strengthened against the
major currencies ending Tuesday, with the exchange rate at 61.77
Shillings to the U.S. Dollar, 101.74 Shillings to the Pound
Sterling and 70.74 Shillings to the Euro, the weekly report said.

million U.S. Dollars) worth of hard currency from the export of
agricultural products during the past six months, The Ethiopian

The office said the products were supplied by private exporters
in Dire Dawa and neighboring Harari and Somali regions.
</P>
<P>
The office said the new arrangement made to export chat through

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Export up by 17 percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite a regional financial
crisis, the Philippines' export growth managed to climb by 16.9
percent in 1998, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the office said: "Amidst the
currency turmoil, export growth managed to post a total annual
value of 29.496 billion U.S. dollars which was 16.9 percent higher
than 25.228 billion dollars in 1997."
</P>
<P>
But the office said total receipts for last December increased
only by 13.1 percent to 2.523 billion dollars from 2.231 billion
dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The weak consumption demand in Asia and the rest of the world
could be attributed to the slowdown of export growth in the
Philippines in recent months, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the country's export only grew by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and the Netherlands remain the
Philippines' major export destinations in 1998.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said he backed the construction of hydro-electric
power plant at Bujagali Falls in Jinja, 80 km east of Kampala,
Uganda's capital.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the Energy Minister Richard Kaijuka and MPs
Tuesday to ensure the power deal is concluded quickly, the New
Vision newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his concern over the delayed signing of
the contracts with the independent power producers Norpak Power
Limited and Nile Independent Power (NIP).
</P>
<P>
Museveni asked the minister to go to the Parliamentary
committees on national economy and natural resources and clarify
issues raised by some MPs.
</P>
<P>
The concerns of some MPs are the terms of the contracts,
financing of the deal, the restructuring of Uganda Electricity
Board and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The two committees will reportedly hold a joint meeting over
the matter next week.
</P>
<P>
NIP plans to construct a 250-MW hydro-electric generating plant
at Bujagali, a plan which has received much fire from
environmentalists and traditionalists who prefer the famous
tourist attraction to remain intact.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Parliament Rapped for Being Soft on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Inspector General of
Government (IGG) Jotham Tumwesigye has criticized the Parliament
for being too soft on corruption which has shaken the country.
</P>
<P>
The official made the sharp criticism Tuesday at a regional
seminar on parliamentary affairs, which is being held in the
capital of this east African country.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar attended by parliamentarians from 10 African
countries, he said the Parliament has a lot of power but fears to
exercise it in curbing rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
MPs have much power on paper, but do not dare to use it. They
make a lot of noise but nothing is done, the out-spoken minister
was quoted by the Wednesday's New Vision paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the executives have a strong hold over Parliament and
recommended some reforms in the power relationship.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fight against corruption has not had a big impact
despite the exercise of various institutions.
</P>
<P>
Although some MPs at the seminar came to the Parliament's
defense, the IGG insisted that the legislature does not assert
itself enough to battle corruption effectively because the MPs are
at the forefront of the fight against graft.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China witnessed a decline in
the production of both cigarettes and spirit during the first 11
months last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The output of cigarettes between January and November was 31
million cases, a drop of 1.2 percent on a year-on-year basis,
while that of liquor stood at 4.55 million tons, a fall of six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the output of beer grew 8.1 percent to 18.9 million
tons, and that of soft drink increased 19.6 percent to 8.6 million
tons, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies show that cigarette-related diseases now claim 2,
000 lives in China every day and the number is expected to climb
to 8,000 per day by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
An anti-smoking campaign is going on in China, the world's
largest tobacco producer and home to 320 million smokers, and the
government has been striving to ban smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also reveal that more Chinese, who used to drink
liquor only, are changing their drinking habits.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nagano Splash out in 1998 Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan made a huge spending on
Olympic officials in its successful bid for the 1998 Winter Games
in Nagano, local reports said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Private notes, held by an unidentified senior former bid
committee member, revealed that a combined 240 million yen (2.1
million dollars) had been splashed out by Nagano bidders to
entertain International Olympic Committed (IOC) members, the mass-
selling Mainichi newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A 152 million yen was spent on first-class air fares and a week'
s hotel stay for 190 people attending the 1991 IOC assembly
meeting in Birmingham, which chose the 1998 Winter Games host, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Nagano managed another 12 million yen to rent Highbury House
for five days where kimono-clad women served Japanese cuisine to
IOC members.
</P>
<P>
The house was rented along with a presentation room at the
hotel where the IOC meeting was held, the Mainichi said.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano bidders spent 100 million yen on a computer-graphics
promotion video, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sumikazu Yamaguchi, a former external affairs chief of the
Nagano bid committee, has admitted he ordered the incineration of
account books listing Nagano's bidding activities because "there
was no space for storage."

BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A number of large foreign
enterprises attended a recent fair for job applicants in Beijing,
showing that they are still confident about the future of China's
economy in the face of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoping, assistant general manager of the Beijing service

</P>
<P>
However, no Korean or Southeast Asian companies attended, and
Japanese companies were few in number.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that foreign investment has been comparatively stable
and investors have more choices and now need competent personnel
who speak at least one foreign language.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xixun, of the Human Resources Department at Beijing
Ericsson Mobile Communication Co., said that things have changed

<HEADLINE> China's Internet Fees Expected to Go Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The growing number of
complaints from China's 2.1 million Internet users may quiet down
a bit as the government is considering ways to cut charges.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Beijing Telegraph Bureau, who refused to give
her name, said today that charges will be reduced to some extent
and the cut will be more dramatic for institutional users.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has the biggest number of Internet users in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chang Xiaobin, deputy director of the Telecommunications Bureau
under the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), confirmed that
and said that charges will be cheaper in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry will begin to study data transmission
prices for a more scientific policy for the information industry.
</P>
<P>
But there isn't any specific timetable for the price cut, added
Chang, who was cautious about how much it would be.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of using the information superhighway has become
the biggest headache for most Chinese, according to a recent
survey in Beijing, which is home to a fourth of China's Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
The people of Beijing on average spend 34.8 percent of their
monthly salaries just to get onto the Internet, a sharp comparison
to the one percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The MII, price bureaus and local governments jointly decide how
much Chinese Internet users have to pay, a form of monopolization
that has been cited as a major problem.
</P>
<P>
The high charges have been blamed as one of the factors that
hinder the development of the information industry, and many
Internet providers feel that it's difficult to make money from a
small market, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
In fact a number of local providers have voluntarily introduced
flexible price policies geared to certain time frames and
rewarding frequent use.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that if the new government cuts come true, it
indicates that China will continue to encourage people to use the
Internet and allow it to be used for a wider range of things in
spite of restrictions on pornography and violence.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese had not even heard of the Internet until the mid-
1990s, but it is predicted that there will be 10 million Chinese
Internet users in the next four years.

<HEADLINE> hke020327 - Roundup: S.Lanka to Mark 51st Freedom Day in Low Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- With less than one day to go
for its 51st anniversary of independence from the British colonial
rule, Sri Lanka seems to be poised to mark this occasion in low
key amid tight security.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations, scheduled to be held at the Independence
Square in Colombo on February 4, has been planned on a limited
scale, with most of the pomp and show that usually accompanies
these celebrations being done away with.
</P>
<P>
When Sri Lanka celebrated its golden jubilee last year, the
armed forces presented their biggest ever Independence Day parade
at the parliamentary complex.
</P>
<P>
Tanks, guns and thousands of troops were withdrawn from
operational areas to take part in the drive and march. And all
infantry, armor, artillery, special forces and other support
regiments were represented in the parade.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources said that this year the role of the
forces will be restricted to a tri-services guard of honor and a
21- gun salute by the navy. They attributed the low profile
celebration to the urgency of not withdrawing troops and machinery
from the war front for display in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Home Affairs Ministry has decided that 100
disabled armed forces officers and men will parade for the first
time since the first servicemen died at the hands of Tamil rebels
in October 1981.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the independence celebration, the defense
establishment has become increasingly concerned about the security
in and around Colombo.
</P>
<P>
A posse of policemen in plain clothes have been deployed in and
around the Independence Square and several roads nearby have been
closed since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the city, Operations Command had strengthened
security precautions. All vehicles entering or leaving Colombo
were checked at sporadic military checkpoints in many parts of the
city. Police strength drawn from outlying areas are being brought
to Colombo to bolster the strength of City Police stations.
</P>
<P>
Despite tight security, the jubilant atmosphere still can be
felt all around the city. All government offices have been decked
with national flags and most vehicles are also flying the national
flag to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
Special supplements in the newspapers and special programs on
both government and private radio and television channels are
expected to portray major events in the country during the past 51
years.
</P>
<P>
Special messages from both President Chandrika Kumaratunga and
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike are expected to be
front-paged together with congratulatory messages from leaders
around the world.
</P>
<P>
But if one is to reminisce over last year's Golden Jubilee,
many a promise remains unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
In her speech last year, President Kumaratunga vowed to end the
ethnic strife. But one year later, the president called off
"Operation Jaya Sikurui" (Victory Assured) and took the reins of
the military machine against Tamil rebels. Now the war still drags
on.
</P>
<P>
Local columnists predict that the upcoming independence day
will arrive sans promises and time tables while an anxious nation
will no doubt await what follows in the months thereafter.

<HEADLINE> China's Production of Cigarettes, Spirit Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China witnessed a decline in
the production of both cigarettes and spirit during the first 11
months last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The output of cigarettes between January and November was 31
million cases, a drop of 1.2 percent on a year-on-year basis,
while that of spirit stood at 4.55 million tons, a fall of six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the output of beer grew 8.1 percent to 18.9 million
tons, and that of soft drink increased 19.6 percent to 8.6 million
tons, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies show that cigarette-related diseases now claim 2,
000 lives in China every day and the number is expected to climb
to 8,000 per day by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
An anti-smoking campaign is going on in China, the world's
largest tobacco producer and home to 320 million smokers, and the
government has been striving to ban smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also reveal that more Chinese, who used to drink
liquor only, are changing their drinking habits.

<HEADLINE> Hornet Forward Mason out for Season with Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Anthony Mason, the best all-
around player in Charlotte Hornets, will miss the entire season
with a ruptured bicep.
</P>
<P>
Hornets physician Dr. Glenn Perry has recommended surgery to
repair a rupture in Mason's right distal bicep tendon. Surgery
has not been scheduled and recovery time is four to six months.
</P>
<P>
Mason suffered the injury in Monday morning's practice. He had
missed only 25 games over the last seven seasons and annually is
among the league leaders in minutes played.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Mason is a huge blow to the Hornets, who already
are without injured All-Star forward Glen Rice for up to 20 games.
Charlotte has won 105 games over the last two seasons but is in
danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last season, Mason openly feuded with Hornets coach Dave Cowens
and was arrested in New York during the All-Star Weekend on a
statutory rape charge. He later agreed to a plea bargain in which
the more serious charges were dropped and was sentenced to 200
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
Mason, 32, was a 1988 third-round pick of the Portand Trail
Blazers. He played in Turkey, and for the New Jersey and Denver
Nuggets before being signed by the New York Knicks in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He spent five seasons with the Knicks, leading the NBA in
minutes played in the 1995-96 season. He has career averages of
10.8 points, 8.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Fuels State Enterprise Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market raised 16.
3 billion yuan for 30 major state enterprises last year, pushing
reforms of state-owned enterprises further along, according to
today's Shanghai Securities News.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, half of the large state enterprises and
enterprise groups in China were listed on the stock market, and
eight have restructured assets and issued new shares.
</P>
<P>
Most of the newly-listed companies are in public utilities and
infrastructure, steel, petrochemicals, automobiles, energy, and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The listing of the large state enterprises with good profits
helps the development of China's stock market, while the stock
market plays an important role in helping state firms adjust their
economic structure, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Many listed firms have become stronger by acquiring promising
state firms, fueling development and extricating state firms from
predicaments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Veteran Boxers to Compete at SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will pin its hopes
of winning gold medals in boxing at the upcoming Southeast Asian (
SEA) Games on its Asian Games veterans, the Jakarta Post Wednesday
quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy secretary-general of the Indonesian Amateur Boxing
Association (Pertina) Didiet Soedijoto said five of the six
pugilists who donned the national colors at the Asian Games in
Bangkok last December would resume intensive training for the SEA
Games later this month.
</P>
<P>
The pugilists include light flyweight Damianus Jordan,
flyweight Hermensen Ballo, bantamweight Martin Sihombing, light
welterweight Wellem Papilaya and welterweight Bara Gomies.
Middleweight Albert Papilaya, who lost in the quarterfinals at the
Asian Games, has announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
"They are still the boxers we can rely on at the SEA Games. We
badly need them if we wish to win the most gold medals on offer,"
Didiet said.
</P>
<P>
This year's SEA Games will be held in Brunei Darussalam in
August.
</P>
<P>
Didiet said Pertina was afraid that the boxers would lack a
recovery period and fail to regain their top form for the first of
three Olympic Games qualifying tournaments which will take place
just two months after the SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss further the best training methods that will
ensure the boxers can reach their top form at the SEA Games as
well as in the Olympics qualifiers," Didiet said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pertina had yet to decide whether to re-sign Cuban
coach Julio Lee Hechavarria, whose contract expired last December.
</P>
<P>
Hechavarria missed the target of winning one Asian Games gold
medal at the Asian Games.

WELLINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand received
1,485,000

</P>
<P>
Although the number of visitor arrivals decreased by 12,000 or
1
percent, compared with the figure in 1997, it was still regarded
as a
"fantastic result" in the context of the turmoil in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Statistics New Zealand, there were 195,260 visitor

arrivals during December, up 11,430 or 6 percent on the same month
of
1997. This was the fourth consecutive month for which arrivals
were
greater than the same month of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
There were increases in visitors from Australia, North America
and
Europe, but fewer visitors from Asia.
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders left for 1,167,000 short-term overseas trips in
1998, registering an increase of 35,000 or 3 percent on the
previous
year.
</P>
<P>
For the year, there was a net loss of 6,260 permanent and long-

DHAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
likely to set up two "One Stop Crisis Centers" by next April for
the first time in the country in order to provide medical and
legal support to oppressed women, according a state minister.
</P>
<P>
The centers will be introduced under a two-year multi-sectoral
project to prevent repression of women and provide the victims
with legal and medical aid, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper
Wednesday quoted State Minister for Women Zinnatunnessa Talukder
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The objective of setting up such centers is to give all sorts
of health care and legal help including necessary investigations
into incidents of violence against women, Talukder said.
</P>
<P>
The two proposed centers will be set up in the Dhaka Medical
College Hospital and northwestern district of Rajshahi, where the
incidence of rape, acid throwing and torture against women is
increasing alarmingly.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost 80 million taka (about 1.65
million U.S. dollars), would be implemented by four ministries
concerned and the money will come from the government and donors.
</P>
<P>
The concept of crisis centers has been originally taken from
Malaysia, the report added.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Increase Coal Exports This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China plans to export 38.5
million tons of coal this year, six million tons more than in 1998,
to cut its large coal surplus, a senior industry official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest coal producer, China turned out 1.2
billion tons of coal last year, a third of the world's total, but
its 32 million tons export only accounted for six percent of the
world's total coal trade, according to Zhang Baoming, director of
the State Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
Increasing exports is considered necessary for the sustained
development of the coal industry and a balance between supply and
demand. Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Expanding exports will also open the country's coal sector
wider to the rest of the world and make the sector more intensive
in management and operations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Supplies are in excess both at home and abroad and a dwindling
demand for coal in Southeast Asia has affected China's exports, he
said, emphasizing that China will do whatever is necessary to
increase its share of the world coal market, especially in Asia,
Europe and South America.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Claims 220 Lives Everyday in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 220 people die from
AIDS- related diseases each day as the AIDS scourge continues to
wreak havoc in Zimbabwe, the daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Evaristo Marowa, coordinator of the National AIDS Co-ordination
Program, said Tuesday that by the end of this year, about 80,000
lives would have been lost, bringing the total cumulative number
of AIDS-related deaths to 400,000, while the number of AIDS
orphans would go up to at least 600,000.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The HIV/AIDS crisis continues to deepen with little
or no signs of behavioral changes in the young and economically
active age groups of the country. Zimbabwe is one of the
countries with a high rate of HIV/ AIDS cases and comes second
after Botswana. By the end of the year, a cumulative figure of
more than 400,000 people will have died."
</P>
<P>
The pandemic was claiming about 100 lives a day last year and
the figure will more than double this year. Marowa said more than
100,000 new cases would be projected while the number of people
with full-blown AIDS would rise to about 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1.6 million people of all ages have already been
infected since 1985, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed there was need to support communities in HIV/AIDS
prevention countrywide to reduce the incidence of the scourge.
</P>
<P>
He said the country had to adopt a multi-faceted approach to
deal with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"People should change behavior. The spread of the disease has
something to do with the fertility rate. It is difficult at the
moment to perhaps find ways to influence change of behavior," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to End Maize-Meal Shortage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The critical maize-meal shortage
which has hit some cities in Zimbabwe is expected to end this week
following an urgent distribution of 35,000 tons of maize, the
daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira told the
Herald in Harare Tuesday that he was confident the shortage, which
had largely affected Harare and some cities, would be ameliorated.
</P>
<P>
"The maize should have started flowing into the affected areas
by Monday and we are expecting that by Wednesday the situation
would be back to normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Harare, being the worst affected, has gone for the past three
weeks without sufficient supplies of maize-meal, the country's
staple food.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "The government is taking the necessary
steps to make sure that the situation is back to normal."
</P>
<P>
The country has been experiencing limited supplies of
maize-meal owing to a poor distribution network resulting in
milling companies operating below capacity.
</P>
<P>
While distribution has been erratic, some millers were also
reported to be holding maize stocks to create an artificial
shortage of the commodity to force price increases.
</P>
<P>
However, the government came out strongly against the proposed
price adjustment, saying that it would not entertain any such
hikes in basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Grain Marketing Board has repeatedly assured the nation
that there is enough maize in the country to last until the next
harvest.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Shrimp Export Poised to Exceed Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh earned 9 billion taka
(190 million U.S. dollars) from frozen shrimp export in the first
half of the current fiscal year (July 1998-June 1999), The Daily
Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a meeting between Minister for Fisheries
and Livestock A.S.M. Abdur Rob and executives of the Bangladesh
Frozen Shrimp Exporters Association (BFSEA) held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The target fixed for frozen shrimp export in the fiscal year is
17.5 billion taka (360 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
If the present trend continues, the volume will exceed 20
billion taka (about 412 million dollars), sources of the meeting
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The volume of export to the countries associated with the
European Union (EU), the main importer of Bangladesh's frozen
shrimps, has increased due to effective and appropriate steps
taken by the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has lifted its earlier ban on Bangladeshi shrimp export
following quick steps taken by the country, they stated.
</P>
<P>
The minister called upon all the BFSEA members to ensure the
quality standard of all exportable food items including shrimp.
</P>
<P>
All hindrances in the way of exporting shrimps to the
international markets would be removed and the process of export
of sea food would be made easier soon, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government has already taken a number of measures to
control shrimp diseases and besides, steps have already been taken
to impart training for the shrimp cultivators, he added.
</P>
<P>
The frozen food export sector is an important foreign exchange
earner of this South Asian country, which earned about 300 million
dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Laboratory Fertility Births Increase Sharply in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 babies
were born in the United States with the help of laboratory
fertility techniques in 1996, a 25 percent increase on 1995,
according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, which cited figures from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDCP), said there were about 64,000
attempts at various reproductive techniques, ranging from in-vitro
fertilization or IVF, the well-known "test-tube" technique, to
gamete intrafallopian transfer or GIFT.
</P>
<P>
The report looks at the success rate of infertility treatments
performed in 300 clinics around the country, and is designed to
give infertile couples realistic expectations before they decide
to spend thousands of dollars trying to conceive a child through
assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
Most of the attempts involved the use of a woman's own eggs,
either for IVF or GIFT, the report said. There was a 26 percent
success rate for IVF, a 28 percent success rate for GIFT and a 30
percent success rate for another procedure known as zygote
intrafallopian transfer or ZIFT, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"For many women and couples, the dream of having a child is not
easily realized," said Dr. Lynne Wilcox, director of the CDCP's
Division of Reproductive Health. "Our hope is that this report
will help them make a more informed decision."

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Party Discusses Party Building Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Vietnam
(CPV) called on its members and the Vietnamese people and armed
forces to actively participate in party building activities and
fulfill socioeconomic tasks set for 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of the local press, the CPV ended here
Tuesday the sixth plenary session (phase two) of its central
committee, which focused on discussing party building work.
</P>
<P>
A communique of the plenum said the party's correct and
clear-sighted leadership is a decisive factor for all victories of
the Vietnamese revolution.
</P>
<P>
Achievements gained during the renovation process initiated and
led by the party testify to the development and growth of the
party and to the strengthened position of the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the communique said, in face of new requirements of
the revolution, some weaknesses have been seen within the party.
</P>
<P>
The fight against corruption and bureaucracy failed to meet
people's aspirations and proved that the nature of the regime and
the party and state apparatuses were consolidated and renewed
slowly.
</P>
<P>
The party should take resolute measures to correct the
mistakes, continue to consolidate the party to make it stronger in
all fields, thus meeting the requirements of the period to
industrialize and modernize the country, the communique added.

<HEADLINE> Joint-Venture Cable Factory Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A power cable factory in
Myanmar's Hlinethaya Industrial Zone, jointly set up by Myanmar
and Singapore companies, has gone into production in an effort to
reduce the import of the commodities in heavy demand in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The factory, established and opened by Stellar Myanmar Co. Ltd.
of Myanmar and Sigma Cable Co. Ltd. of Singapore on Tuesday, will
produce 4,560 metric tons of lower voltage power cables and
underground cables yearly.
</P>
<P>
Of its products, 60 percent will be for domestic market and the
remaining 40 percent for export.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 9.058 million U.S. dollars, the factory
occupies 2.56 hectares of land in the Hlinethaya Industrial Zone
in the northwest of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The Hlinethaya zone is one of the six of its kind being
established in the capital. The five others are Shwepyitha, Dagon
Myothit, Shwepaukkan, Mingaladon and Thanlyin-Kyauktan.
</P>
<P>
The 453-hectare Hlinethaya Industrial Zone was initially
developed by local entrepreneurs who set up such industries as
food processing, textiles, engineering, electrical goods,
chemicals, forest products and animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The development of the zone was later joined by multinational
foreign firms including those from Britain, France, Japan,
Singapore and Thailand, as well as Myanmar-foreign joint ventures,
by leasing land and running dairy products, galvanized iron sheet,
and sanitary and garment factories.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Singapore's investment in
Myanmar reached 1.484 billion dollars in 67 permitted projects at
the end of October 1998, ranking first among 23 countries and
regions which have a total of 7.089 billion dollars of investment
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Poland Draws Record-High Foreign Investment in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Poland in 1998 attracted a
record high of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign capital, up
nearly 50 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Poland drew a total of 30 billion dollars from 1990 to 1998,
the highest in central and eastern Europe, reported the Law and
Economy newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the achievement to the country's social
stability and healthy economic development. Foreign capital inflow
slowed down briefly last fall due to the financial crisis in
Russia but picked up soon afterwards, the report quoted an
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that small investors, normally with investment of less
than one million dollars, were more sensitive to the temporary
changes in investment climate. But larger investors, who accounted
for 89 percent of the total capital inflow, were not so responsive.
</P>
<P>
The European Union countries as a whole are the largest
investor, accounting for 54 percent of the total, while the heavy-
weight investors are U.S. companies.

<HEADLINE> Bridge to Be Built Over Mekong River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will have its first
bridge over the Mekong River within three years as a
ground-breaking ceremony was held for the bridge Wednesday at the
construction site in Kompong Cham Province.
</P>
<P>
The 1,360-meter-long and 12.2-meter-wide bridge is being
constructed in Kompong Cham town, 125 kilometers east of here. It
will be the first one connecting the east and west of Cambodia
which is divided by the river.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, to be built with a donation of about 56 million
U.S. dollars from Japan, is scheduled to be completed in July
2002.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen and other senior government officials
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen expressed his thanks in his ceremony speech to those
countries offering aid to Cambodia and called on the international
community to give more help to promote the development of its
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The new bridge will play a key role in Cambodia's economic
development and the regional economy. It will increase the
transportation of goods and the travel of the population in the
east region," Khy Tainglim, minister of public works and
transport, said.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong River divides Cambodia into two parts and as there
is no bridge connecting the two sides, the country's economic and
social development has been hindered.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up Credit Bureau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is planning to set up
a new credit bureau within the next several months, which will
make it more difficult for bank customers to apply for new loans,
The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The major English newspaper said the parliament is expected to
pass an act concerning the establishment of the credit bureau in
March.
</P>
<P>
The new act would waive legal restrictions on the disclosure of
client information by local financial institutions and would
supersede confidentiality rules outlined in the new constitution,
the Civil and Commercial Code and the Commercial Banking Act.
</P>
<P>
A central credit bureau would allow local financial
institutions to access credit histories and payment performance by
loan applicants, assisting firms to reduce their risks.
</P>
<P>
Loan officials now usually rely on informal ties with other
institutions to gain information about a borrower's financial
history and status.
</P>
<P>
But because of confidentiality laws and the fierce competition
within the financial industry, creditors are usually unaware of
liabilities and past history a borrower has with other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Bankers say a credit bureau would help enforce greater
discipline on the part of borrowers, ultimately helping creditors
reduce their non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million baht (2.78 million U.S. dollars) in capital
is needed to set up the credit bureau, computer networks and
necessary technology.
</P>
<P>
Banthoon Lamsam, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association,
said the 13 commercial banks in Thailand would equally hold shares
in the new credit bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the bureau could be expanded to include foreign
banks and local finance companies.

<HEADLINE> Thai Textile Industry Faces Difficulties in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's textile industry
faces a tough year with local sales expected to be reduced by a
severe economic slowdown while exports are hampered by a firmer
baht, a Thai Textile Manufacturing Association official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total sales are set to shrink to 180 billion baht (5 billion
U.S. dollars) this year from a previous projection of 200 billion
baht (5.56 billion dollars), the official said.
</P>
<P>
Any devaluation of the Chinese yuan would also be bearish for
the industry, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry hopes the baht will not strengthen beyond
its current level of 36 baht to the dollar, which is considered to
be competitive.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1998, Thailand earned 179 billion
baht (4.97 billion dollars) from textile products. The industry
expects that total sales could reach 200 billion baht (5.56
billion dollars) for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Textile exports account for about 10 percent of all Thai
exports.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the United States and the European Union, the two
core markets, is stable. But the country has to face stiff
competition from China's mainland, Taiwan and Pakistan, as they
are also eyeing the same markets.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, which consumes 60 percent of textile
production, prospects are bleak as the economic crisis persists.
</P>
<P>
Slack local demand and reduced buying power have cut domestic
consumption by about 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Coastal Waters Being Monitored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The monitoring of six areas in
Sri Lanka's coastal belt has begun under a special coastal waters
monitoring program, the official Daily News said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This World Bank-funded project, being conducted by the Marine
Pollution Prevention Authority (MPPA), will establish a data base
on the state of the country's coastal waters to ascertain changes
in the marine environment, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Selected sites in the coastal towns of Colombo, Negombo,
Kalutara, Hikkaduwa, Galle, Matara, Tangalle and Hambantota will
be monitored on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
MPPA Chairman Dhanapala Weerasekera told the paper that the
data base will be useful for the implementation of remedial action
and enforcement of legislation to prevent rapidly deteriorating
pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
The coastal pollution poses a serious problem in Sri Lanka,
especially in Colombo where about 25 million to 30 million gallons
of sewage flow into the sea every day without any purification
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Senior students will be mobilized for the project to whom a
special tool kit for conducting the necessary tests will be
provided, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Weerasekera said the results of the monthly monitoring process
will then be computerized, enabling the country to have its own
record of coastal waters and the changes that are taking place.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Businessmen Urge Anti-Crisis Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine businessmen on
Tuesday urged the government to solve the burgeoning trade dispute
with Brazil within the framework of the largest regional trading
bloc known as Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Industry Minister Alieto Guadagni, they
complained that Brazil's exports to Argentina increased by as much
as 91.6 percent in January to 23 million U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase of Brazil's exports is regarded as a by-
product of the country's financial crisis and the ensuing
devaluation of the real.
</P>
<P>
Guadagni shared the view that something should be done to "
defend our production...within the Mercosur laws."
</P>
<P>
In January, Brazilian electricity exports to Argentina soared
between 150 and 300 percent, while chocolates exports went up 700
percent and significant increases were registered in food and
steel exports.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Brazil have close trade relations, with one third
of Argentina's exports going to Brazil. Brazil's financial crisis
is taking a heavy toll from Argentina and many analysts forecast a
zero growth for Argentina's economy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Argentina and Brazil have scheduled a meeting
on February 8 in the Brazilian city of Foz de Iguazu to solve the
trade problem between the two largest economies of the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur also groups Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile and
Bolivia as associate members.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China has announced a catalogue
of outdated technology and products that need to be eliminated by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The list, published Tuesday, is a major step in dealing with
the serious stockpile problems, the economic downturn, and the
growing number of unemployed people, according to the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The first list has 114 items in the 10 sectors of coal mining,
metallurgical, nonferrous metals, petrochemicals, textile,
machinery, building materials, construction and electrical power
industries, as well as light industry, an SETC source said.
</P>
<P>
It was made in line with laws and regulations concerning
mining resources, mine security, production quality, and
environmental protection laws, according to Chen Bangzhu, SETC
vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to improve the industrial structure and
product mix by listing production capacity, technology, and
product problems, an SETC official said.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned have got the directive to take steps to
ensure that the outdated production capacities, technology, and
products are terminated within a specified period of time.
</P>
<P>
The SETC also hoped that foreign-backed companies will check
their production against the list and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
It will announce other lists of production problems in
accordance with domestic and international markets and industrial
development, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar to Replace Firewood With Briquette as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is trying to use
briquette as a firewood substitute in its effort to prevent forest
depletion and preserve the natural forests and environment.
</P>
<P>
A factory has been set up recently in Yangon by the Myanmar
Forestry Ministry to produce briquette and its extensive use as a
firewood substitute fuel is being pushed.
</P>
<P>
Such factories are also planned for other divisions like
Sagaing, Mandalay and Magway where arid districts lie.
</P>
<P>
Firewood, along with charcoal, has been mainly used as fuel in
Myanmar with an annual consumption of more 24 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate felling and cutting of trees including firewood
plantations for fuel and burning of charcoal have been known as
the cause of forest depletion in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The country has worked out projects for greening the arid
districts, under which revival of firewood plantations is among
the measures taken.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar designated the year 1995 as the firewood substitute
fuel year, during which efforts were made to green the central
arid zone.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's forest area is reducing year by year, dropping by 7
percent as compared with 36 years ago. The data of 1962 showed
that 57 percent of the country's total area was then covered by
forests. The percentage dropped to 51 in 1989 and then to 50 in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Hugo Chavez Sworn in As Venezuelan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Hugo Chavez, the former army
officer who led an abortive coup in 1992, was sworn in as
Venezuelan president on Tuesday, promising to revamp Venezuela's
political system and boost its lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
"I swear in front of God, my country and my people on this
dying constitution that I will push forward the democratic
revolution so that the republic will have a Magna Carta adequate
for a new day," Chavez said as his supporters burst into cheers.
</P>
<P>
Chavez won a landslide victory on December 6, largely by
capitalizing on Venezuelans' anger over rampant corruption and
decades of declining living standards in the south American nation,
which has the largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Chavez becomes Venezuela's youngest president.
He takes over from 83-year-old Rafael Caldera.
</P>
<P>
In his two-hour inaugural speech, Chavez said that he would
immediately sign an order for a referendum on constitutional
reforms. He is seeking a "constituent assembly" that would
radically amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also declared a "war on misery", saying that a country like
Venezuela with 80 percent of its 23 million population in poverty
was "shameful". In this respect, he said that he would introduce a
bill in Congress asking for special powers to push through
economic reforms, stressing that he was inheriting an economic "
time bomb".
</P>
<P>
Chavez has made the transformation of Venezuela's inefficient
political institutions the core of his ambitious program, pledging
to redistribute oil wealth and root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Attending Tuesday's ceremony were Argentine President Carlos
Menem, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Spain's Prince
Felipe. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was also present at
the inauguration ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Urges Immediate Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister Anna
Lindh on Tuesday called on the conflicting parties in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia, to participate in the peace talks in Rambouillet,
France, to end the province's 11-month-long war.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued late in the evening, Lindh said that she
had earlier sent a message to ethnic Albanian leaders Ibrahim
Rugova, Rexhep Qosja and Adem Demaqi, Lindh, proposing that they
send a delegation to the talks sponsored by the Contact Group on
Former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
She said that Sweden had made use of its ties with the ethnic
Albanian leadership to ensure their presence and also asked
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the conditions put forward by
the Contact Group for the talks had received the approval of the U.
N. Security Council and the support of the international community
as well.
</P>
<P>
The bloody war between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian armed group,
the Kosovo Liberation Army, and the Serbian and Yugoslav forces
has killed around 2,000 people and left many civilians homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo tragedy began as the ethnic Albanians, who
constituted the majority among the 2 million people in Kosovo,
tried to gain independence from Yugoslavia, a country which had
been severely weakened because of separation of Bosnian-
Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization has threatened
to launch air strikes against the Yugoslav targets if Belgrade
turned a so-called deaf ear to the Western countries' call to put
an end to its military offensives in Kosovo.

CARACAS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will back Venezuela's
bid to enter the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), said President
Carlos Menem here Tuesday after attending the swearing-in ceremony
of Venezuela's new president, Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the two leaders discussed the integration
of Venezuela -- Latin America's fourth largest economy -- into
Mercosur, the largest trade bloc in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Menem recalled that an accord had already been signed in Buenos
Aires on the creation of a free trade zone between Mercosur
members and countries from the Andean Community, of which
Venezuela is a member.
</P>
<P>
"Integration is going forward," Menem said, referring to the
possible inclusion of Andean nations into the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
He said he had long supported the idea of a Latin American
monetary union mentioned by Chavez in his inauguration address.
</P>
<P>
"I have proposed it at the level of the Mercosur and I believe
it is one of the great possibilities to avoid imbalance among all
(American) countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, with
Chile and Bolivia as its associate members.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Rebels Refuse to Attend Paris Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army (
KLA) on Tuesday backed out of the proposed Paris peace talks,
saying it has rejected a peace plan worked out earlier by the
international Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
KLA political representative Adem Demaci told reporters in
Pristina, capital of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, that he had
suggested the KLA leadership refuse to attend the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that KLA's participation in the Paris peace conference
would mean its "submission" to the "bad" peace plan adopted by the
six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in London last month, foreign ministers from the
Contact Group passed a resolution demanding warring sides in
Kosovo take part in the Paris peace conference scheduled to open
on Saturday and, at the latest, reach a peace agreement within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group is made up of France, Britain, Germany,
Russia, the United States and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The KLA's refusal to accept the peace plan again exposed the
huge differences between the radical and the moderate among the
Kosovo Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova has expressed
willingness to attend the planned peace meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said earlier that the
Yugoslav government would decide whether to attend the meeting
after carefully studying the peace plan.

</P>
<P>
Ranta said she would directly present the final report to the

Belarussian experts. The Finnish team rechecked the corpses and
all three sides agreed on the results.

Pristina local judge Danica Marinkovic said on January 19 that

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Central Bank Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's central bank Tuesday
named senior adviser Arminio Fraga Neto its new president, the
third nomination in the past month, in a move aimed at boosting
its financial powers under the country's ongoing currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Fraga, who was the bank's advisor on
economic affairs and advisor to international financier George
Soros, was hailed not only by the Brazilian government, but also
domestic and international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio NBR and TVE, Brazil's presidential
spokesman Sergio Amaral described Fraga as an expert in
international finance who is going to help the government restore
investor confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted the need for a more powerful central bank in the wake
of Brazil's adoption of a new economic regime with a free floating
currency.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Industry and Development Minister Celso Lafer said
Fraga's professional expertise would enable him to tackle the
challenges of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Rio de Janeiro, head of the Banks Association Union, Walber
Chavantes, said the change would not upset the markets.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Guaranty Trust director Gabriella Icaza said that Fraga
has the experience Brazil needs and that he enjoys the trust of
the international finance community.
</P>
<P>
Fraga, 41, is a Ph.D. from the U.S. Princeton University and
took part in the negotiations between the Brazilian government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). From 1989 to 1991, he was
the vice-president of the Salomon Brothers Investment Bank.

HANOI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran staged a miraculous comeback
from 9-man disadvantage and two goals down to salvage a 2-2 tie
with Vietnam and advance to the semifinals of the eight-nation

minute and doubled the lead thanks to Nguyen Phi Hung's 79th
minute goal.
</P>

In the intervening period Iran had two men sent off as Ali
Ansarian was ejected in the 72nd minute for his second yellow card
and Mohammad Ali Karimi earned his ouster by shoving the referee
in the face.
</P>
<P>
In the 84th minute, Pejman Jamshidi pulled Iran within a goal
and less than three minutes later Farzad Majidi forced the tie by
adding another.

</P>
<P>
Xu is well-schooled in traditional Chinese painting in water

supports Xu's efforts and said he is doing a significant job in
helping the international community better understand China.

<P>
CARACAS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's new foreign
minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, on Tuesday said his country will
seek closer links with the Caribbean countries while boosting ties
with the Andean Community of which it is a member.
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy of Venezuela's new president Hugo Chavez,
who was sworn in Tuesday, would be based on peace, integration and
the defense of human rights, Rangel said.
</P>

He said the new administration was aiming to trim a bloated
bureaucracy in the foreign ministry, and to revamp and modernize
it.
</P>
<P>
Rangel said that Chavez had a friendly relationship with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, with whom he already met as president-
elect and will again meet at the end of this month during a trip
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cuba, Rangel said that Venezuela wants closer ties
with the island disregarding ideological differences.

<P>
"We call for respect for the Cuban people. We ask for an end to
the embargo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rangel said many Venezuelan businessmen were planning to invest

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Flag-Carrier Garuda to Sell 12 Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The national flag-carrier,
Garuda Indonesia, plans to sell 12 of its aircraft this year to
obtain fresh funds for working capital and payment of its foreign
debts, the company's business communication chief Pudjobroto said.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft the state-owned company plans to sell include four
A B-4s and eight B-747-200s, Pudjobroto was quoted by Antara News
Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Garuda now has a fleet of 52 aircraft, but only 40 will
be operated in 1999. Therefore, Garuda's earnings from its
operations this year will drop to 7 trillion rupiah (about 820
million U.S. dollars) from 10 trillion rupiah in 1998. Its net
income will also decline to 280 billion rupiah (33 million
dollars) in 1999 from 905 billion rupiah in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Pudjobroto firmly denied that Garuda's
domestic cargo market share has dropped to 10 percent, with the
rest taken by foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
"Garuda's domestic cargo load factor is encouraging because
many private airline companies have cut their flight frequencies
as a result of the current economic crisis. Their potential cargo
had been shifted to Garuda," he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Buys Dollars to Keep Peso Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has been buying U.S. dollars from the spot market
since the beginning of this year to keep the peso from getting too
strong.
</P>
<P>
The Business World newspaper reported Wednesday that the
central bank has bought close to 200 million U.S. dollars since
the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the monetary board, the central bank's policy
decision body, gave the go-signal to the bank's foreign exchange
dealers to buy dollars from the Philippine Dealing System, the
country's electronic currencies exchange.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted by the paper
as saying there has been so much excess dollars in the system,
giving the central bank opportunities to build up its reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said that as of Tuesday the country's gross international
reserves stood at about 11.7 billion dollars, equivalent to about
four months' worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, the Philippine peso has been traded at
around 38.50 pesos against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Economists said a stronger peso would affect the country's
exports.

JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia enjoyed a surplus of
20.11 billion U.S. dollars in its foreign trade in the
January-November period last year, up by 96.43 percent from a
corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase was because imports during the period dropped by
35.42 percent while exports only declined by 7.72 percent, head of
the Central Bureau of Statistics Sugito Suwito said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports in the first 11 months of 1998 were

same period in 1997 when the figure was 48.73 billion dollars.

down by 35.42 percent from the same period in 1997 when the figure

The bureau also announced the country booked a trade surplus of
1.61 billion dollars in November, up from 1.37 billion dollars in

<HEADLINE> Internet Appeal In China Gets Sperm Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A recent appeal for sperm
donations on the Internet has drawn responses from more than a
hundred men in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Because of the shortage of sperm, Renji Hospital opened a web
site two months ago and made an emotional appeal for donations. At
least 10 volunteers have come to the hospital, giving hope to
sterile people, Wu Yulun, a professor in charge of its male
sterility lab, told Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred people promised to donate, most of them
young or middle-aged white-collar workers. Renji's sperm bank is
the only one in Shanghai and has had fewer than 100 donors since
it opened eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Artificial fertilization can assist about 30 percent of the
sterile couples conceive, Professor Wu added. Selection procedures
are very strict about the health of donors to check on the
possibility of hereditary or contagious diseases, he said, and the
education background is important. Donors' names are kept strictly
confidential.
</P>
<P>
Many people are hesitant to make a donation because of
misgivings about potential legal, moral, and family problems, Wu
said, and this makes it all the more necessary that all legal
documents be standardized. Also, the larger the sperm bank, the
less the chance will be that there are inbreeding problems.

1998 was supposed to raise the number of foreign tourists coming
to Indonesia, but the unfavorable security situation in the
country has caused many tourists to cancel their visit to
Indonesia," he was quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia may have earned some 3.462 billion U.S.
dollars from the foreign tourists in 1998, but it was a decline
compared with the 4.338 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the occupancy rate of star-rated hotels in the
January-November 1998 period dropped to 39.2 percent. In Bali the
occupancy rate reached 54.3 percent and in Jakarta 42.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Indonesia's third largest foreign exchange earner
after the oil and gas and textile and garments sectors. The
government has expressed hopes that tourism could become the
country's largest foreign exchange earner in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The government projected that overseas tourist arrivals this
year would total between 3.5 million and 4 million.

<P>
BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Brasilian Julio Cesar's second
stint with German Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund proved to be
short lived on Tuesday when the defender transferred to Greek
first division club Panathinaikos Athens, the German club
announced.
</P>
<P>
Cesar, 35, came to Dortmund on November 18 and played five
games this season for the sixth-placed team. Just 75 days after
arriving in Dortmund amid Welcome Back cheers, Cesar has decided
to leave Germany once again.
</P>
<P>
Cesar played four years with Borussia, coming from Juventus in
1994 with current Dortmunder Andreas Moeller, and helped Dortmund
win two Bundesliga championships and the 1997 Champions League.
</P>
<P>
He transferred last summer to Botafogo in the Brazilian league
for one million marks (about 580,000 dollars), but left after
being criticized for unprofessional work.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund officials grew concerned about the Brazilian this
Winter when they could not locate him for days after he left the
team's training facilities in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cesar also received hefty fines during his earlier stint at
Dortmund for arriving late for training.

BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A threatened breakaway of
Germany's leading football clubs over the marketing of television
rights was avoided at crisis talks involving all 36 first and
second division Bundesliga sides in Frankfurt Tuesday, club
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Club officials agreed to form a commission to investigate the
marketing issue after several hours of talks at a special German
Football Federation (DFB) meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called amid demands by leading first division
sides including league leaders Bayern Munich to negotiate their
own television deals, which promise to be far more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
At present the DFB markets the television rights on behalf of
the clubs, giving them an equal share from the pool.
</P>
<P>
"The clubs have shown solidarity. I don't see any danger of a
split," said Eintracht Frankfurt president Rolf Heller.
</P>
<P>
The five-man commission, which includes Bayern Munich vice
president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, will report back to the clubs

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Geneva
Observatory have discovered a new planet outside the solar system
circling a star almost the same as our Sun.
</P>
<P>
The new planet, the smallest yet discovered, is also the
closest in size to Earth ever seen outside our Solar System, the
BBC reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the eighteenth planet known to be orbiting another star
but the discovery is important because the mass of the new planet
is similar to that of Saturn in our solar system.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are not able to obtain a picture of the new planet
because of the glare of the star it is orbiting.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the planet was revealed through its slight
gravitational effect on its parent star's motion. The star, called
HD 75289, is in the southern sky and is 70 light years distant.
</P>
<P>
Though at the moment astronomers haven't detected any
Earth-sized planets around other stars, they argue that if Jupiter
and Saturn-sized planets exist, then it is likely that there are
Earth-sized ones as well.

el-Adli on Tuesday denied reports that his ministry has negotiated
a deal with Islamic extremists.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The budget for Egypt's fiscal year
of 1999-2000 takes into consideration the social dimension and
supports education and health services, Finance Minister Mohieddin
Al-Gharib said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib made the remarks after a meeting on the draft budget
for the new fiscal year, chaired by Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri and also attended by Minister of State for Planning
Zafer el-Beshri and Governor of the Central Bank Ismail Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib said the budget also gives priority to projects
of drinking water, sanitary drainage and roads, particularly in
rural areas and the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The fund for the social services will be no less than 37
percent of the total expenditure of the state budget, or 5 billion
Egyptian pounds (1.47 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib assured that no new taxes or burdens will be imposed on
citizens, national economic stability and development will be
maintained and there will be orientation towards major projects.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to create job opportunities for young people and lure
people to leave the overcrowded Nile valley, the Egyptian
government is implementing giant projects in the south to reclaim
land from desert.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the budget deficit will not exceed 1 percent
of the gross domestic product in an effort to keep the economic
stability.
</P>

The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency INA as saying

</P>
<P>
The spokesman affirmed that Saudi pilots took part in the

</P>
<P>
He said that 20 formations of U.S. warplanes from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace at 11:37
a.m. (0837GMT), and launched three missiles on air defense sites
in the Fao region.
</P>
<P>
At 6:00 p.m. (1500 GMT), 12 formations of U.S. warplanes from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace again,
and launched missiles on some military sites.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 12:34 a.m. (0934GMT), 12 formations
of U.S. warplanes from a Turkish military base violated northern
Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
At 3:19 p.m. (1219GMT), one formation of U.S. warplanes
launched three missiles on an Iraqi surface-to-air missile site,
said the spokesman.

He said Iraqi air defense forces counterattacked these
U.S. warplanes bravely and forced them to flee back to their bases.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman alleged that Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers got
involved the U.S. anti-Iraq schemes and facilitated
U.S. aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes have been attacking Iraqi targets in the no-fly
zones since Iraq declared it will not recognize the restricted
zones following the mid-December U.S.-British air raids on the
country.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies in northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with
a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from Baghdad's suppression.

BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Helmut Schmidt, 80, the former
chancellor of Germany, was in a Hamburg hospital after being
operated on Tuesday for sudden hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Presseagentur(dpa) reported, Hamburg University
Hospital (UKE) disclosed Schmidt had been admitted Friday and
doctors had decided that the sudden hearing loss was not coming
right on its own. The illness is often treated with bed rest.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said it was possible the membrane between the middle
and inner ear may have ruptured and had therefore sealed off the
area under local anaesthetic.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's office at Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper of which he
is co-publisher, said the elder statesman had begun complaining on
Wednesday last week of deafness.

<HEADLINE> CBI Urges Gov't to Reduce Burdens on Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) called on the government to provide stability, cut
red tape and encourage entrepreneurs in its coming budget on 9
March.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said recent measures by the government, including
legislation on minimum wages and working hours, had cost
businesses an extra 5 billion pounds (8 billion U.S. dollars) a
year.
</P>
<P>
Outlining its proposals for the budget, the CBI said Chancellor
Gordon Brown should avoid any major initiatives and instead
provide business with stability and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
A clear declaration that taxes won't be increased and
reductions in administrative burdens are urgently needed signals
in the business community, the CBI said.
</P>
<P>
Clive Thompson, CBI president, said, "This budget comes at a
critical point in the economic cycle with the UK facing a major
slowdown in growth. Amid the turmoil in many world markets,
companies need stability at home."
</P>
<P>
The CBI also wanted to see tax credits offered to companies
investing in research and development and reform of the rules on
share options available to directors to encourage talented
individuals into business.
</P>
<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) backed the CBI's calls.
In its own budget submission the BCC also raises concerns over the
impact of excessive regulation on business productivity.

LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Early Wall Street losses and a
falling dollar dragged most of European share markets into the red
Tuesday amid returning fears of international instability.
</P>
<P>
London blue chips shrugged off a decline on Wall Street to end
flat, as a buoyant engineering sector propped up the market and
fuelled a rally amongst second-line stocks.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE index showed the greatest resilience, clawing its way
back from a session-low 1.3 percent fall to end up just barely - a
0.6, or 0.01 percent, gain to 6013.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the comeback, punctuated by wild
fluctuations throughout the session, to hopes the Bank of England
will cut UK interest rates, perhaps by 25 basis points this month.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of further sector consolidation and positive broker
comment bolstered small and medium engineering shares, while the
broader indices climbed as investors searched for the next
takeover candidate.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Deal with Terrorist Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Habib
el-Adli on Tuesday denied reports that his ministry has negotiated
a deal with Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian opposition newspaper said recently that the
government and terrorist groups have struck a deal to release
members of the groups.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli accused that such reports "implies no sense of
patriotism."
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the Egyptian security agencies' efficiency in
handling terrorism, citing support by the cabinet and the public
for the police.
</P>
<P>
Islamic extremists began an insurgency in 1992 in an attempt to
topple Egypt's secular government and install a strict Islamic
one.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Hosni Mubarak has made it clear
that no negotiations will be conducted with the terrorist groups,
vowing to crush the insurrection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, El-Adli said the Arab interior ministers' meeting
held in Amman, Jordan, on December 29-31 decided to set up a
ministerial committee to outline steps for the implementation of
an Arab anti-terrorism pact.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in Cairo last April, the Arab
countries will cooperate in combating terrorism in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli said the conferees expressed support for Mubarak's call
for an international conference on fighting terrorism under the
auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused a number of countries of harboring
terrorists, calling for joint efforts in the world community to
fight terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief to Visit Sudan, Kuwait, Morocco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid is scheduled to visit Sudan on February 17 for
talks on the latest developments of the situation in the country,
a Sudanese diplomat said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Meguid will hold talks with
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail, Sudan's Permanent Delegate to the league Ahmed Abdel
Halim told reporters after a meeting with the league chief.
</P>
<P>
Meguid's visit is to underline Arab solidarity with Sudan and
keenness on its unity and sovereignty, Halim said, adding that
attacks on any Arab country constitute aggressions on all Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat was referring to an air raid on a Sudanese
pharmaceutical plant near Khartoum last August by the United
States, which claimed that the plant was a base of international
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League strongly condemned the attack on the Sudanese
civil target, which reportedly produced half of the medicine for
the country's domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on contacts between Khartoum and Washington
regarding the issue, Halim revealed that the U.S. has asked for
further dialogue with Sudan in a bid to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, Sudan demanded the U.S. compensate for the
losses and a thorough investigation be carried out by an
international group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday
that Meguid will pay a four-day visit to Kuwait from February 14
for meetings of the Arab-African Coordination Committee on
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He will also travel to Morocco on February 21 for a six-day
visit, during which he is to take part in an international
conference on the future of Jerusalem, organized by the
Arab-European Studies Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The budget for Egypt's fiscal year
of 1999-2000 takes into consideration the social dimension and
supports education and health services, Finance Minister Mohieddin
Al-Gharib said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib made the remarks after a meeting on the draft budget
for the new fiscal year, chaired by Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri and also attended by Minister of State for Planning
Zafer el-Beshri and Governor of the Central Bank Ismail Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib said the budget also gives priority to projects
of drinking water, sanitary drainage and roads, particularly in
rural areas and the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The fund for the social services will be no less than 37
percent of the total expenditure of the state budget, or 5 billion
Egyptian pounds (1.47 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib assured that no new taxes or burdens will be imposed on
citizens, national economic stability and development will be
maintained and there will be orientation towards major projects.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to create job opportunities for young people and lure
people to leave the overcrowded Nile valley, the Egyptian
government is implementing giant projects in the south to reclaim
land from desert.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the budget deficit will not exceed 1 percent
of the gross domestic product in an effort to keep the economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget will be submitted to the Shura (Consultative)
Council at the end of March and the People's Assembly (Parliament)
in May for approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
said that Saudi pilots participated in the U.S. attacks on Iraqi
military and civilian targets on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency INA as saying
that U.S. warplanes bombed a food-supply center in the southern
Iraqi province of Najaf on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman affirmed that Saudi pilots took part in the
U.S. attacks on Iraq, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said that 20 formations of U.S. warplanes from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace at 11:37
a.m. (0837GMT), and launched three missiles on air defense sites
in the Fao region.
</P>
<P>
At 6:00 p.m. (1500 GMT), 12 formations of U.S. warplanes from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace again,
and launched missiles on some military sites.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 12:34 a.m. (0934GMT), 12 formations
of U.S. warplanes from a Turkish military base violated northern
Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
At 3:19 p.m. (1219GMT), one formation of U.S. warplanes
launched three missiles on an Iraqi surface-to-air missile site,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi air defense forces counterattacked these
U.S. warplanes bravely and forced them to flee back to their bases.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman alleged that Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers got
involved the U.S. anti-Iraq schemes and facilitated
U.S. aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes have been attacking Iraqi targets in the no-fly
zones since Iraq declared it will not recognize the restricted
zones following the mid-December U.S.-British air raids on the
country.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies in northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with
a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from Baghdad's suppression.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Calls on Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TOWN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-South African
relations have maintained a good momentum since the establishment
of bilateral diplomatic relations, visiting Chinese Vice-President
Hu Jintao said Tuesday when he called on President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is here on a four-day official visit, conveyed to
Mandela greetings from Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
reiterated Jiang's invitation for Mandela to visit China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the traditional friendship between the two
peoples can long be traced back.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this century when new China came into being,
Hu continued, it started to have contacts with the African
National Congress of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping,
as well as South Africa's national liberation movement leaders
were very concerned about the development of this traditional
friendship, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the two countries smoothly forged diplomatic ties last
year, a sound political basis has been laid for bilateral ties to
advance in a long- term and stable way, thus opening a new page
for the state-to-state relations, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela asked Hu to return his best wishes to Jiang and other
Chinese leaders, saying he is looking forward to his China tour at
an early date and to meeting with Jiang again.
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old statesman said the South African people had, in
their long anti-apartheid fight, been inspired by the
revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Hu on the current circumstances in the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
Hu said seeking peace, stability and development is the
mainstream of the African situation in recent years and the
African nations are continuing their efforts to explore a
development road suitable to their own circumstances, in which
most of the nations have a stable political situation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the African countries value their unity and
self-reliance, coordinated stance, and try to rely on their own
efforts to solve regional issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
But due to historical reasons and complicated internal and
external factors, Hu noted, the momentum of peace and stability is
hindered from time to time.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, partial conflicts constantly occur
and some of them have the tendency of spreading, which brings
about negative impact on the stability, security and development
of related countries and regions, and arouses worries and concerns
of the international community.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the current international economic order is
not conducive to the development of Africa, Hu said, adding peace
and stability is still the main subject of today's Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Hu held talks with his South African
counterpart Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who arrived here from Cote d'Ivoire Sunday for the last leg
of his 13-day four-nation African tour, will end his South African
tour on February 4 and return to China.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Returns from Visit to DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said Tuesday evening upon arrival from his visit to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it is the desire of the
Congolese people to end the conflict and move forward the peace
process at the fastest pace.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Kabila has lifted the ban on political
activities to accelerate the peace process in his country, Chiluba
said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is spearheading a peace initiative to restore
peace in DRC at the mandate of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), flew to Kinshasa Tuesday morning to have talks
with Kabila on how to put an end to the six-month war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the Windhoek meeting on the DRC issue last month is
positive.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Uganda, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda as well as
representative of Angolan president, whose countries have been
involved in the conflict, agreed at the meeting to sign formally a
peace accord in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend Chiluba went to Harare to have similar talks with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
A regional ministerial meeting to make preparations for a
planned summit to seek a peaceful solution to the armed conflict
ended here two weeks ago without achieving its target.
</P>
<P>
A proposed Lusaka regional summit on the Congo have been
postponed repeatedly because of Kabila's refusal to have direct
talks with the rebels. The meeting should have been held on
December 8 of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the rebels while
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent their troops to DRC
to support Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Romania Watches Closely Political Developments in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Foreign Ministry
watches closely the political developments in the Republic of
Moldova, triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc
and implicitly of the whole cabinet, said a release of the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier, Ion Ciubuc tendered his resignation Monday
due to the sweeping economic crisis in the former Soviet Republic.
The resignation was accepted by President Petru Lucinschi late in
the day and the latter started to have consultations with the
parliamentary groups to choose a candidate for the office.
</P>
<P>
According to the Romanian Foreign Ministry, what happened in
Moldova comes in line with the natural evolution of a democratic
society and it shouldn't be interpreted as a symptom of political
instability or a crisis situation.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Foreign Ministry expresses the hope that the
government to be appointed on the basis of the ruling coalition in
the parliament of Chisinau will more firmly embark on the way of
promoting reforms and achieving the European integration.
</P>
<P>
Romania reasserts "the privileged nature" of its relations to
the Republic of Moldova, to which "it is connected through a
common historical past, language and culture" as well as the
further support it is decided to grant, so that the neighboring
country's efforts to consolidate democracy and structural reforms
and draw near the European structures should be fruitful.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says U.S. Jets Hit Iraqi Anti-ship Missile Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. air attack on Tuesday
apparently destroyed an anti-ship missile site on the coast of
southern Iraq, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
"Initial indications are that we hit what we aimed at," said
Army Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to Pentagon officials, what had been hit by U.S.
warplanes was the Iraqi CSSC-3 anti-ship missile battery which
they said could have posed a threat to U.S. naval vessels or
commercial shipping in the oil-rich Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Bridges said the attack was carried out by two F-14 and
two F/A-18 attack jets based on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The defense officials said the anti-ship missile battery had
been set up near the Al Faw peninsula southeast of Basra near the
mouth of the Gulf. The attack jets used laser-guided 500-pound
bombs against the site.
</P>
<P>
In the northern no-fly zone in Iraq, U.S. warplanes based in
Incirlik air base, Turkey, bombed three more Iraqi air defense
sites on Tuesday, bringing the total number of attacks in the
northern no-fly zone to five, according to U.S. military officials
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The first two incidents happened separately at 2:20 p.m. and
2:35 p.m. Iraqi time (1120 and 1135 GMT) with two U.S. F-15E
strike Eagles dropping two precision-guided bombs on two
anti-aircraft artillery batteries.

<HEADLINE> Annual 110,840 Tons of Oil Leakage in Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 110,840 tons of oil
annually leaks in the Black Sea, which means more than that in the
case of an oil tank's most serious navigation accident in the
world, showed a document released Tuesday by Romania's Mare
Nostrum ecological organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the executive manager Lucian Ionescu, the
information on which this report is based, was synthesized within
the Environment Program for the Black Sea, on data furnished by
governmental authorities of the Black Sea rim countries.
</P>
<P>
Lucian Ionescu warns on the oversaturated degree of pollution
with hydrocarbons in the Black Sea, stressing that as much as 50
percent of the whole amount of hydrocarbons leaked in the Black
Sea is brought by the Danube, while about 700 tons of oil and its
derivatives come from the Romanian sea shore.
</P>
<P>
The tests made in the Black Sea offing in the navigation routes
area over 1994-1998 revealed hydrocarbons concentrations of 0.1 mg
per liter, twice higher than in the North Sea, while these values
may reach 5 mg per liter in the gulf of the Sevastopol city in the
Crimea Peninsula and go 100 times above the upper standard.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Discuss Kosovo Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council is expected to take up the issue of the Serbian province
of Kosovo at the request of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Duval, Canada's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters that Vladislav Jovanovic, charge
d'affaire of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, had
delivered Monday night a letter to him from the Yugoslav foreign
minister, asking for an emergency meeting of the Security Council
on NATO threat to the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Yugoslav government, "the letter will be
made an official document of the Security Council according to the
procedure of the council," he said. "As members of the council
received the letter only today, it will be later in this week" the
council will discuss the request.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the council will consider a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Kosovo, in which the U.N. chief
called for peace talks by parties concerned to avoid an all-out
war in the restive province, Duval said.
</P>
<P>
"That's a different issue," the senior Canadian diplomat said,
referring to the difference between Annan's report and the
Yugoslav request to discuss the NATO threat.
</P>
<P>
Robert Fowler, the Canadian permanent representative to the
United Nations, assumed the presidency of the Security Council for
the month of February. But he is recovering from a minor
appendicitis operation performed Saturday, U.N. officials said. In
this case, his deputy is acting in his position.

In the letter, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that NATO has
violated the U.N. Charter by threatening air strikes against
Yugoslavia without Security Council authorization.
</P>
<P>
NATO's Saturday decision to authorize its Secretary-General
Javier Solana to order military actions against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) represented "an open and clear threat
of aggression against the FRY as a sovereign and independent
member of the United Nations," the Yugoslav foreign minister said
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
He said that Article 53 of the U.N. Charter stipulated that no
enforcement action should be undertaken under regional
arrangements by regional agencies without the authorization of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"In this specific case, the U.N. Security Council has not
authorized NATO to take the enforcement action against the FRY.
Therefore, NATO's threat directly undermines the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the FRY and flagrantly violates the
principles enshrined in the U.N. Charter," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians, who make
up some 90 percent of the province's population of 2 million, had
been fighting with Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> AID Provides 3 Bln Dlrs for Family Planning Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agency for
International Development (AID) said Tuesday it has provided more
than 3 billion U.S. dollars over the past five years to family
planning and reproductive health programs in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is part of a 20-year Program of Action agreed to
by 180 nations at the 1994 International Conference on Population
and Development in Cairo, Egypt. The program is designed to
achieve gender equity, improve reproductive health and stabilize
population growth.
</P>
<P>
The AID's report was released in an advance of a follow-up
population conference that will open in the Hague, the
Netherlands, next Monday. The federal agency is the largest
government donor of population and reproductive health assistance.
</P>
<P>
The programs the foreign aid agency supports include expanding
the choice of contraceptive methods, promoting improved quality
care in family planning and reproductive health services,
providing emergency treatment for the complications of unsafe
abortions and developing new approaches to prevent and manage
HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
Duff Gillespie, deputy assistant administrator for population,
health and nutrition at the AID, said that the most important
achievement since the Cairo conference has been a shift in the way
the AID and the international health community view population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Renews Threat of NATO Air Strikes over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Tuesday renewed its warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, saying he must agree to peace talks on Kosovo or face
NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, State Department spokesman James
Rubin said the United States was working with European allies to
force a "credible threat of force" against Milosevic and the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy is premised on the idea that if the Serbs do
not comply with requirements of the international community, if
they do not come to the negotiating table or if they do not
agree with the plan that we are putting forward they could
be subject to air strikes by NATO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Contact Group -- the United States,
Russia, Britain, Germany, France and Italy -- last week agreed to
order warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians to go to France by
February 6 to begin negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said although the talks were meant to include both
parties, the threat of NATO force was aimed mainly at Serbian
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the primary cause of the problems in Kosovo
has been President Milosevic stripping the legitimate rights of
the people of Kosovo over the last decade and now threatening
them and using military force against them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the crisis will continue to fester without a
cessation of hostilities and a willingness by Belgrade to
guarantee the rights of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned for More Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
concerned over more "terrorist" attacks by forces of Osama bin
Laden, the man allegedly linked with last year's U.S. embassy
bombings in Africa, CIA Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted recent activity similar to what occurred prior
to the African embassy bombings... And I must tell you we are
concerned that one or more of bin Laden's attacks could occur at
any time," Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating bombing attempts with conventional
explosives, but his operatives are also capable of kidnappings and
assassinations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi suspect bin Laden is accused of plotting the bomb attacks
on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August that killed
250 people.
</P>
<P>
"There is not the slightest doubt that Osama bin Laden, his
worldwide allies, and his sympathizers are planning further
attacks against us," Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is offering up to 5 million dollars for
information leading to bin Laden's arrest or conviction for his
alleged role in the embassy bombings.

<HEADLINE> Germany Open to Selling IMF Gold for Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder is open to U.S. calls for the International Monetary
Fund to sell gold reserves in order to fund debt relief for
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
A finance ministry spokesman said Tuesday in Bonn,the IMF had
"more than enough" reserves but that Bonn would not formally back
the proposal without support from Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore has called for the IMF to sell some
five million ounces of gold from total reserves of 103 million
ounces to help pay for debt relief of the world's poorest nations,
according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
The last time the IMF sold gold reserves was in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Both the IMF and the former conservative German government
under Helmut Kohl had always opposed selling off gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's government has vowed to make cutting debt of the
poorest states a top issue at the June G8 Cologne summit of
wealthy industrial countries plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The new government, in contrast to the old one, is very
interested in finding ways to forgive debt of the poorest
countries," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> England Football Coach Sacked for Insulting Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Glenn Hoddle was sacked Tuesday
as England manager after his comments about reincarnation and the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
Former Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson will take charge of the
team for next week's game against World Champions France.
</P>
<P>
Football Association (FA) Executive Director David Davies told
a news conference, "The FA and Glenn Hoddle have agreed to
terminate Glenn's contract."
</P>
<P>
"After more than 24 hours of meetings and discussions it became
apparent to all those concerned that this was the right decision
for England football," he said.
</P>
<P>
Davies said, "The position had become increasingly untenable
for both the FA and Glenn Hoddle, who accepts he made a serious
error of judgement and of course he has apologized."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle accepted the sacking and admitted he had made error of
judgement.
</P>
<P>
"I accept I made serious error of judgement in an interview
which caused misunderstanding and pain to a number of people. This
was never my intention and for this I apologize."
</P>
<P>
"My sincere thanks for the support goes to loved ones, family,
friends and media colleagues who have worked with me over the past
few days to try and establish the truth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hoddle had ruled out resigning over his comments in
last Saturday's Times, interpreted as suggesting disabled people
were being made to pay for the sins of past lives.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Women Status Improving: Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Women's position and
status in China's Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong
has been improving, its representative at a U.N. meeting said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, women accounted for 39 percent of the total working
population there and currently two out of the three highest
ranking government officials are women, SAR Secretary for Home
Affairs David Lan said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of women engaged in occupations traditionally
dominated by males has risen gradually, for example in the police
force and the fire department, he told the U.N. Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when introducing the SAR's first report on
the implementation of the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
</P>
<P>
The convention signed by more than 160 countries was adopted by
the U.N. General Assembly in 1979 and the committee established by
the convention reviews country reports periodically. China's
reports, including that of the SAR, are put under review at its
current session.
</P>
<P>
In the Hong Kong SAR, Lan said, males and females have equal
access to education and in 1997, more than half of the university
graduates were female.
</P>
<P>
The infant mortality rate in Hong Kong is among the lowest in
the world and the life expectancy for females has reached an
average of 82.2 years, against 76.8 years for males, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the reunification with mainland China on July 1, 1997,
Hong Kong residents have enjoyed better protection as their rights
are now entrenched in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of China,
Lan said.
