<HEADLINE> Malignant Malaria Cases Appear In Central Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A malignant malaria is
spreading fast in Obayid, capital of the central state of
Kordofan, some 650 kilometers southwest of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Director of the National Department of Malaria Omar Zayid
Baraka was quoted Thursday as saying that the recent fever cases
in Obayid were not unknown, but was a kind of malignant malaria.
</P>
<P>
He said the malaria has various symptoms and is usually coupled
with complications, spasms, coma, fracturing of red corpuscles and
jaundice.
</P>
<P>
Such diverse features of the malignant malaria had given people
the impression of an outbreak of various diseases, he said, but
all the symptoms were mere complications of that kind of malaria.
</P>
<P>
Baraka blamed the acute increase of malaria cases on the
exceptional heavy rainfall of 650 millimeters, not seen in
Kordofan for the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Therapeutic Medicine Department at the Health
Ministry has disclosed that the malignant malaria has spread to
epidemic proportions in east Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts said that malignant malaria is a most serious
kind as it contains chloroquin-resistant parasites. The Department
asked all residents to take a full dose of chloroquin for five
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacists were also called upon to refrain from selling
malaria medicine without doctor's prescription.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Egypt Ready to Host Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is ready to host the
Middle East and North Africa economic conference early next year,
visiting Israeli Minister for Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Peres said they discussed the upcoming conference
aimed at promoting economic cooperation among the Middle East and
North African countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak said he preferred the conference to
take place early next year shortly after the Muslim holy fast
month of Ramadan, which ends around January 8, Peres said.
</P>
<P>
The annual economic gathering, kicked off in 1994 in Morocco,
was last held in Doha, Qatar in 1997 and was boycotted by several
Arab countries, including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They were protesting the hardline policy of the then Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The election of Ehud Barak as
prime minister in May improved relations between Israel and some
Arab countries, such as Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Both sides felt the need to revive the economic cooperation in
the Middle East after a long interruption, said Peres who arrived
in Cairo earlier for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which hosted the conference in 1996, has shown interest
in hosting it again next year.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a former prime minister, told reporters that a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East will only be achieved when
Israel makes peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
This will be "the last ditch" on the way to having a peaceful
Middle East and a new Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are reportedly working to resume their peace
talks suspended in early 1996. Syria insists the talks be resumed
from where they were left off and Israel withdraw from the Golan
Heights it captured in 1967, while Israel rejects any
preconditions for a restart of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Britons Now Spend More on Leisure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) - Britons are spending more on
leisure than food and drink for the first time since records were
kept, according to official figures on family spending released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Office for National Statistics says the
average household spends 59.80 pounds a week on leisure goods and
services, nearly three times more in real terms than they did in
1968.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks has
fallen from 26 percent of family spending in 1968 to 17 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The increase on leisure spending is caused partly by the
technological revolution, which has quadrupled expenditure on
televisions, video, computers and music systems to 8 pounds a week
for the average household.
</P>
<P>
One in three households now have their own computer,
researchers asked people whether they had access to the internet
from home. One in 10 families said they did.
</P>
<P>
Taking a long-term view, spending on computing has risen
dramatically over the past 10 years - from 6 to 30 percent . And
it has risen four-fold in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite nearly one-third of all households owning a computer,
access to technology is highly dependent on income. The figures
show that less than 5 percent of poorer households have the chance
to go on-line.

<HEADLINE> Cut French Power Links Until France Opens Market, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) - As the Anglo-french Summit opens
here Thursday, British Conservative MEPs are accusing France of
breaking yet another EU Single Market rule.
</P>
<P>
With the EU preparing for an electrifying court battle over
French refusal to pass a law to break Electricite de France's near
monopoly at home, Tory energy spokesman Giles Chichester MEP
stated: "This is yet another shocking example of France's refusal
to play by European rules and blatant protection of French markets.
"
</P>
<P>
This latest EU court action to be launched against France
brings the total cases brought against France since 1996 to over
85 cases.
</P>
<P>
"If the French go on refusing to let British firms compete on
an equal basis in France, then we should consider cutting the
links and boycotting Frency power," urged Chichester.
</P>
<P>
As EU Energy Ministers prepare to meet in Brussels next week,
Chichester is calling for strong EU action: "France is always
trying to short-circuit EU law and must not be allowed to go on
dodging the rules."
</P>
<P>
"Electricity consumers across Europe are suffering as France
continues to refuse to open up its market to fair competition and
lower prices," he added.

<HEADLINE> IT Potential to Last 30 to 50 Years: Singapore Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew said here Thursday that it will take 30 to 50 years
to exhaust the potential of the information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
The senior minister noted that IT will be like the discovery of
the steam engine, electricity, telegraph and telephone which took
decades after they were first invented to create today's
industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
He also said the computer, the Internet and other IT-related
advances have opened up an era of great changes as these new
technologies work their way into all activities.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that entrepreneurship, innovation and
management are three attributes for success which are vital in
competition in an era when knowledge and innovation are critical
factors for growth.
</P>
<P>
Lee highlighted these points of view while addressing the 1999
Enterprise 50 Gala Dinner and Award ceremony Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The big prizes will go to the mover which has an advantage over
newcomers and to those who have innovative imagination to capture
ideas and turn them into opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
While elaborating on the three attributes, Lee said the first
is the entrepreneurship to seek new opportunities and to take
calculated risks and standing still is a sure way to extinction.
</P>
<P>
Innovation is what creates new products and processes that add
value and is to think up new ideas backed by the discipline to
develop those ideas into products and services that consumers
want, he said.
</P>
<P>
Company management means to open up new markets and create new
distribution channels for the purpose of growth and companies must
exploit the possibilities opened up by the Internet to re-engineer
their business model.
</P>
<P>
Noting that competition will increasingly be global and
intensifying, Lee stressed that there is great need for top
quality management that can handle complex operations, for talent
that is a key competitive resource and for a reward system that
anchors talent to the companies.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries to Decrease Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Countries in the southern
African region have agreed on a new vision for the Southern
African Power Pool (SAPP) which will see a change from a
cooperative to a competitive pool to lower costs.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) said in a
statement Thursday that this is in the interests of lowering costs
and improving quality service for the end user.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of being a pool that serves utilities, the pool will
be at the service of the end user," the statement said. "The
strategic shift in focus towards the end user will ensure that the
SAPP can achieve its mandate to the people of Southern Africa."
</P>
<P>
The position was agreed at a workshop in Harare attended by
participants from South Africa, Zambia, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia,
Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Angola and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"SAPP aims at promoting regional economic integration through
secure and reliable electricity supply to all end users of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC). This is achieved
by pooling together the region's generation and transmission
facilities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Participating utilities would have equal rights and
obligations, be politically neutral and accept wheeling of power
on behalf of other members when this is technically feasible. A
coordination center for the power pool is being established in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
In the restructured electricity industry, there will be
separate businesses for generation, transmission, distribution and
supply of electricity. The power pool will be managed by the
transmission business in each country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Turkey's European Orientation With Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Deputy Defense
Minister Massimo Bruti said here Thursday that Italy supported
Turkey's accession to the European Union (EU) with conditions.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Greek counterpart, Dimitris Apostolakis,
Bruti said that Turkey's European ambitions went hand-in-hand with
prerequisites such as the respect for human rights and democratic
processes.
</P>
<P>
As for Thursday's decision by a senior Turkish court to uphold
the death penalty passed down on Kurdistan Worker's Party leader
Abdullah Ocalan, he said that acts of humanity and tolerance were
what distinguished democratic governments from others.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo issue, Bruti called for the unchangeableness of
borders, saying that he supported the implementation of the
stability pact, Rambouillet accords and the U.N. decisions.
</P>
<P>
Both he and Apostolakis had agreed on the need for a European
defense and security policy which would not affect the authority
of the Euro-Atlantic alliance.

<HEADLINE> Less Angolan Refugees Entering Zambia Lately: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of Angolan refugees
entering Zambia has reduced somewhat in the past few days, the
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) based in
Lusaka confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR office said that the number of Angolan refugees
coming into Zambia has reduced to around 20 per day in the past
few days, compared to an earlier average of 400 per week.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are reportedly in an acceptable condition though
clearly exhausted from having walked for long distances.
</P>
<P>
Since October 8, Zambia has received more than 3,700 Angolan
refugees through entry points in its Northwestern and Western
provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, the current reduction in the rate of arrivals may
offer only a brief respite since the military confrontation in
Angola is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
"We have received reports that more than 2,000 refugees entered
Namibia during the past week alone, which is a clear indication
that the conflict within the country is moving southward," said
Oluseyi Bajulaiye, UNHCR representative in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"We may therefore witness a renewed upswing of new arrivals in
Zambia as well," he added.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO's New Secretary General Intends to Have U.S. Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The new Secretary General of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (
UNESCO), Koichiro Matsuura, said Thursday that he intended to
persuade the United States to come back to the organization.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the UNESCO headquarters here,
Matsuura, who was elected on November 12, said that a radical
improvement of the management of the organization would be a pre-
condition for a return of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States withdrew from UNESCO in the mid-1980s,
accusing it of being politically biased and wasting money.
</P>
<P>
``I hope personally that the United States will be back. But I
don't think that the road will be easy,'' said Matsuura.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would first establish and implement a plan of
structural reform before making an appeal to the United States, so
that the Americans can seriously study it.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO is criticized by many for being bureaucratic and
lacking vision.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Turkey Not to Carry Out Ocalan's Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday hoped
neighboring Turkey not to carry out the death sentence on the
Kurdistan Worker's Party leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the death penalty on Ocalan should not
be put into force.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Greece always brought issues of human rights to
the European Union (EU) and it had repeatedly brought the issue of
the death penalty to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Deputy Defense Minister Dimitris Apostolakis said that
the Turkish court's decision had a political dimension.
</P>
<P>
He believed there were margins to overcome this sensitive and
crucial phase of human rights in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, George Katiforis, a Greek ruling party European
Parliament Deputy, warned Thursday that any attempt to execute
Ocalan would definitively shut the door on Turkey's European
prospects.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, dozens of members of the Greek
Kurdish community held an overnight sit-in in central Athens to
protest the Turkish court's decision to uphold the death sentence
on Ocalan.

LUANDA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Angolan diplomat Casimiro
Manuel da Silva has been released by the Togolese police, the
Angolan Foreign Ministry said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Joao Pedro said that da Silva, a
second secretary of the Angolan Embassy in Nigeria, left the
police station in Togolese capital Lome without negotiations or
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese police did not explain the reason of da Silva's
release, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Casimiro da Silva was detained in Lome by the Togolese police.
He had been accused of intending to kidnap a son of Jonas Savimbi,
head of Angola' s UNITA (National Union for Total Independence of
Angola) rebels.
</P>
<P>
But Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda denied the accusation
Tuesday, saying that "it can't be true because it is not the
orientation of the Angolan government."
</P>
<P>
An official source said that da Silva went to Togo, which is
under his jurisdiction, for business.

PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- France urged on Thursday the
sending of a delegation by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to the northern Caucasus region,
where Russian troops are fighting a war with Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of the French Foreign Ministry Anne Gazeau-
Secret said that the forthcoming meeting between Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and OSCE president Knut Vollebaek should fix
a date for such a visit by the delegation.
</P>
<P>
``We are following the forthcoming meeting between Mr. Ivanov

decided (by the OSCE summit) in Istanbul,'' said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She did not directly name Chechnya as a specific place for such
a visit.
</P>
<P>
France was criticized by Russia for receiving this month in
Paris the ``foreign minister'' of the separatist government of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin shortened the time of his
meeting with French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor
Gehard Schroeder at the Istanbul summit last week, because of
dispute over Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Colombo on Red Alert Ahead of Rebel Chief's Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's troops have
stepped up already tight security arrangements in the capital,
Colombo, as the Tamil rebels are to mark their leader's birthday
on Friday, government officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They said there is a high state of alert in Colombo and its
suburbs as rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
are to mark their leader Velupillai Prabhakaran's 45th birthday on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Road blocks and checkpoints in the capital have been beefed up,
fearing attacks by the LTTE rebels who are also marking their
heroes' week.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels usually organize religious services to invoke
blessings on their comrades killed in action in the 16-year-old
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio said preparations are
also under way to end the week-long celebrations to honor the dead
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Flags and banners have come up in the northern rebel-controlled
Wanni region for the main celebrations and the rebels have put up
pictures of dead LTTE fighters and lit oil lamps, said the radio
monitored in the northern government-held town of Vavuniya.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations usually end with a speech by Prabhakaran,
outlining the thinking and strategy of the separatist group, which
has been fighting for a state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's
north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran's speech is expected to be noteworthy due to the
presidential polls scheduled for December 21 and the recent
military debacles inflicted on government troops by the LTTE
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in November the rebels captured 10 key towns and a
large chunk of territory in the Wanni region which the military
had taken more than two years to capture.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga charged that the debacles were
caused by her main rival Ranil Wickremesinghe in the presidential
elections who she said was conniving with LTTE rebels to destroy
her hope of reelection.
</P>
<P>
However, Wickremesinghe, leader of the main opposition United
National Party, on Wednesday denied the charge and threatened to
take legal action against the president and the state media.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Work Continues for Shipwreck Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- More than one hundred of the 312
passengers and crew aboard the ship "Dashun" have been found dead.
Another one hundred or so are reported missing near the port city
of Yantai in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers said that a total of 36 passengers have been
rescued. Wu Guanzhong, secretary of the Provincial Communist Party
of China Committee, was on the spot directing the rescue work.
More than 5,000 people have been mobilized.
</P>
<P>
The ship, belonging to a Shandong shipping company, caught fire
and was forced to turn back Wednesday afternoon as it headed for
the port of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province. The
vessel sent out distress signals when flames were discovered at 4:
30 pm.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the temperature is around zero
degree, and the 6-7 degree gale and heavy snow made rescue
operations difficult.
</P>
<P>
The 126-meter-long ship "Dashun" was built in 1983. It has a
sea gauge of 5.48 meters and a total weight of 9,843 tons. Its
navigating speed is about 18.5 knots per hour.

<HEADLINE> EU Presidency Reiterates Opposition to Death Penalty for Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Finnish presidential statement issued here said that the "EU
Presidency notes the decision of the Turkish Appeals Court to
uphold the death sentence passed by the State Security Court of
Ankara on 29 of June on Abdullah Ocalan."
</P>
<P>
"The Presidency reiterates the Union's well-known opposition to
capital punishment as a matter of principle. It has understood
that the case will be considered by European Court of Human Right,
" the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the EU Presidency is fully aware that it is
within the discretion of the Turkish Grand National Assembly to
decide whether or not to confirm any death sentence passed by a
Turkish court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Turkey's Appeals Court upheld Ocalan's
conviction for treason and separatism, which is punishable by
death under Turkish law.
</P>
<P>
However, the Appeals Court's decision does not mean that Ocalan
will be executed immediately as his lawyers can still appeal to
the European Court of Human Rights and the Turkish parliament and
President Suleyman Demirel must approve any execution before it
takes place.
</P>
<P>
Before he was captured by a special task force of Turkey in
Kenya in February, Ocalan had been leading a 15-year separatist
war in southeastern Turkey. Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds,
have died as a result of the campaign led by Ocalan's Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has not carried out a death sentence since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's lawyers said before the ruling that they were
prepared to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, a
process that could take up to two years.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Appeals Court came at a crucial time for
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Turkey successfully hosted a summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
country has been campaigning to become a candidate for European
Union membership.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Turkey's candidacy for EU membership will be
discussed at a meeting in Helsinki in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen has warned Turkey that
it should not carry out the death sentence against Ocalan.
Finland currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
No member of the European Union imposes the death penalty on
convicts.

<P>
DHAKA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Thursday urged the opposition to join the politics
of development, discarding the path of violence and destruction
for the sake of the people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public meeting at Kushtia, 280 kilometers south of
Dhaka, she said those who believe in democracy and democratic
principles could not resort to hartals (strikes) at the cost of
the people's misery.
</P>
<P>
She accused the opposition of not believing in democracy and
thus pushing the country toward destruction.
</P>
<P>
At least one person was killed and 25 others including police
were injured in violence Thursday as the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party and its allies enforced a country-wide hartal demanding the
resignation of the present government.
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses said a truck driver was killed just a few
minutes before the end of the hartal. Hospital sources said more
than 20 people were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital,
mostly with injuries caused by bombs.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 36 activists of the opposition for their
alleged involvement in violence.

BERLIN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish Prime Minister

management force.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit will also discuss the command framework during

Lipponen. Revenue problems between EU members and Turkey's
candidacy to the EU membership may also present some difficult
issues, added Lipponen.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that Finland and Germany have achieved consensus
on almost all the topics to be discussed, adding that the future
crisis management mechanism of EU could be resolved early next
year.

ANKARA -- The Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals on Thursday
upheld the death sentence against imprisoned outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling said that the June trial of Ocalan was fair
and thus rejected his appeal. Ocalan, captured by Turkish
commandos in Kenya in February, was sentenced to death by the
Turkish State Security Court in June for separatism and
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean the Kurdish rebel leader will be hanged,
as called for by the right-wingers in the coalition government.The
verdict must be endorsed by Turkish Parliament and President
Suleyman Demirel before an execution can take place.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's lawyers said before the verdict was upheld that should
that decision be taken they would bring the case to the European
Court of Human Rights. The process is likely to take one to two
years. (Turkey-Ocalan)

JERUSALEM -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators early Thursday

second-stage troops withdrawal from West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
The latest session over the redeployment row was held in a
Jerusalem hotel Wednesday night and ran past midnight, according
to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat said after the

Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed in September. He added that
there is no plan for a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran said he hoped the
two sides will reach an agreement in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, 2 percent of West Bank
land will be turned from Area B (joint Israeli-Palestinian control
with Palestinian civil administration) to Area A (full Palestinian
control) and another 3 percent from Area C (sole Israeli control)
to Area B by November 15. (Israel-Palestine-Withdrawal)

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Expects Resumption of Syrian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) envoy
for the Middle East preace process Michael Angle Mauratinus has
expected the Syrian-Israeli talks to resume within the coming few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
After meeting here with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Shara
Thursday afternoon, Mauratinus said Syria was determined to
establish peace. Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights
which was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, a demand
supported by the EU.
</P>
<P>
"My efforts to push forward the peace process are part of the
EU efforts," he noted
</P>
<P>
He also praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's recent
remarks that Israel is considering withdrawal from south Lebanon,
saying the proposed move would be a good step.
</P>
<P>
Such a step should be supported by the international community
under an accord to be signed by all parties concerned, including
Syria, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north. Since then,
Lebanese resistance forces have been fighting to oust the Israeli
occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Barak has hinted that Israel would
withdraw from south Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, Lebanon's power broker, was worried that a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon would undermine
its bargaining chip in talks with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Reform Electoral System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Home Affairs
Minister Dumsio Dabengwa Thursday announced that some changes
would be made to the country' s electoral system.
</P>
<P>
He said reforms to the electoral process would include the
review of the voters' roll system, establishment of mechanisms to
enhance greater participation and confidence in the electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would be amended to enable citizens to be
automatically added onto the voters' roll on their 18th birthday,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has asked the United Nations to
provide some technical assistance, a move that would make the
forthcoming legislative elections more credible, the minister told
a press conference in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is expected to provide technical support for the
electoral process, to help strengthen the electoral process
credibility and to provide support to the civil society's role as
domestic electoral observer, Dabengwa noted.
</P>
<P>
He said a needs assessment team from the U.N. would arrive in
the country next week to consult with all interested parties on
the political, technical and financial conditions necessary to
lend credibility and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. has been involved in 60 elections around the world
over the last years and has accumulated significant knowledge and
experience in technical assistance to election processes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections next
year.

<P>
MAPUTO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve members of the Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum will come
to Mozambique early next week to observe the country's second
general elections on December 3-4.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here Thursday, the Windhoek-based
forum said the 12 SADC parliamentarians are expected to arrive on
November 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians will visit five provinces, namely Maputo
and Gaza in the south, Sofala and Zambezia in the center, and
Nampula in the north, where they will observe voting in a number
of polling stations.
</P>
<P>
The SADC parliamentarians represent the widest spectrum of
political groupings in each parliament, "namely from the ruling
parties, the opposition and women in parliaments."
</P>
<P>
The exercise is part of a SADC "mandate of enhancing and
strengthening the new wave of constitutional democracy" in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring of elections by neighbors may not only
contribute to transparency in the electoral system but it could
also build confidence and legitimacy in the utilization of
elections as a means of choosing leaders," the SADC parliamentary
forum said.
</P>
<P>
"Free and fair elections are crucial to this process," it
stressed.

In an interview with the radio, Wahid, who is on a visit to
Jordan, said Indonesia can play a role in advancing the Mideast
peace process because it can be accepted by both Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is the reason why Indonesia, the largest
Moslem nation, is opening relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, Wahid also said that he will
support any deal reached by the Palestinians and Israel on
Jerusalem issues.
</P>
<P>
After being sworn in to presidency, Wahid said Indonesia
should be able to establish economic relations with any countries
in the world, including Israel.
</P>
<P>
But some Indonesian Moslem groups have warned that opening ties
with Israel, even economic ones, could jeopardize Indonesia's
relations with other Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
Wahid once visited Israel when he was opposition leader despite
objections from the Indonesian Foreign Ministry. He also joined
the board of the Shimon Peres Peace Institute in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last month's election of Wahid, a reformist Moslem, as the
president, was widely hailed as symbolizing a new era of
Indonesian politics.

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge $1.7Bln for Ghana in Next 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Donors have pledged 1.7
billion U.S. dollars for Ghana in the next two years, the Ghana
News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Harrold, World Bank Country Director, said that the
donors have confirmed the pledges made at the end of the 10th
Consultative Meeting between Ghana and its development partners
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said the shortfall of 80 million dollars from the
commitments at the last consultative meeting is expected in eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
There is an estimated shortfall of some 120 million dollars for
 2000- 2001, the World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Several donors have indicated their willingness to provide
additional program support, but said such assistance would depend
on how fast the Ghanaian government puts in place its response to
the adverse external conditions, as well as the quality of the
measures implemented.
</P>
<P>
However, the donors were impressed about Accra's commitment to
combat corruption. They also supported the Ghanaian government's
plans to intensify efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS.

proposed East African Cooperation (EAC) is to attain political
federation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when briefing the parliamentarians on the

<P>
Kategaya said that the summit meeting will initiate a process
to determine when the EAC should be established.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians advised the three regional governments to act
 cautiously in order to avoid the mistakes which had led to the
collapse of the former East African Community in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new EAC would enable the three
countries to cooperate more closely in politics, economy and

<HEADLINE> Swiss AIDS Federation Provides Online Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss organization fighting
AIDS has used the Internet to provide online counseling service
for gays and lesbians in the country.
</P>
<P>
The www.drgay.ch website, run by the Swiss AIDS Federation,
mainly offers gays and lesbians anonymous individual counseling on
safe sex and AIDS prevention, the organization's manager Ruth
Rutman told a news conference in the Swiss capital of Bern
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to provide an Internet service that allows gays and
bisexuals in the country to ask questions that they would perhaps
not be able to ask someone directly," she said.
</P>
<P>
The website has received more than 100 queries since the online
service became available three months ago, according to the
federation, which is the parent organization of 21 regional AIDS
federations and another 24 AIDS aid groups.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies by the federation have shown that gays and
bisexuals are more likely to follow safe sex practices if they
feel good about themselves and their sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
World AIDS Day falls on December 1. Around the world, new
figures for 1999 reveal that some 33.6 million people are living
with HIV or AIDS, the vast majority in developing countries.

MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Thursday thanked Azerbaijan for its efforts in
preventing mercenaries and weapons from entering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful to the Azeri side for the very strict measures
it has taken to reliably prevent the transport of weapons,
guerrillas and funding intended to help the bandit formations in
Chechnya," Sergeyev said at a meeting with his Azeri counterpart,
Safar Abiyev, the Interfax news agency reported.

</P>
<P>
Abiyev denied as "lies" media reports and statements by certain
military officials that "guerrillas and arms enter Chechnya from
Azerbaijani territory."

"Igor Dmitriyevich (Sergeyev) has flatly denied this. There has
been no such fact, nor can there be one," Abiyev said.
</P>
<P>
The two defense chiefs also signed a military cooperation plan
for the year 2000.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Thursday thanked the United Nations for its readiness to
cooperate with Moscow to provide humanitarian aid to its North
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation, the Russian prime minister
described as positive the work of UN High Commissioner for
Refugees Sadako Ogata, Putin's press secretary Mikhail Kozhukhov
said.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear who initiated the telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
Annan, for his part, confirmed the U.N.'s readiness to raise 16
million U.S. dollars in humanitarian aid for Russia's North
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are in the middle of an offensive
against rebels in Chechnya. The military campaign was launched
following Chechen militants' armed incursions into neighboring
Daghestan and a series of apartment blasts blamed on Chechen
rebels. Over 300 people were killed in the explosions in Moscow
and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 refugees fled the fighting in Chechnya and
streamed into neighboring regions. Some of the refugees have since
returned to areas liberated by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached to purchase the bulk of the U.N. aid
materials in Russia rather than import from abroad, Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Putin reiterated Moscow's
eagerness to see the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya through,
solve Chechen problems by political means, and do everything
possible to keep military and civilian casualties to a minimum,the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Ruling Party Against Threats of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican ruling Frelimo
Party Thursday said those who blackmail voters by threatening to
return to war " are not prepared to govern the country
democratically".
</P>
<P>
Frelimo noted in a press release that the former rebel movement
Renamo was now using "a triumphalist discourse, claiming that it
has already won the elections and all that remains is to put a
stamp on that victory".
</P>
<P>
But it complements these claims "with the threat that if it
does not win, it will be because Frelimo has stolen the votes, and
in that case there will be war".
</P>
<P>
Such a discourse "is part of a strategy to win the elections at
any price", said the Frelimo statement. "But elections are a
democratic exercise, and they should not be won at any price. They
should only be won with the ballots of the voters, cast in a free,
fair and conscious choice".
</P>
<P>
Blackmailing the electorate with threats of war was
"intolerable", it added. Those who made such threats would, if
they ever won, "set up a despotic, anti-democratic regime, with
the suppression of fundamental freedoms".
</P>
<P>
Once it had come to power, it would only take Renamo"six months
or less" to scrap the freedoms currently enshrined in the
Mozambican constitution, warned Frelimo.

<HEADLINE> Greece FM Conditions Rapprochement With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said here Thursday that rapprochement between Greece
and Turkey cannot be achieved unless the Cyprus issue is solved.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "this does not mean the two countries
need not to try to improve their bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Papandreou arrived here Thursday afternoon for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference with his Cypriot counterpart Ioannis
Kasoulides, Papandreou said that whatever stance Greece decides
to take at the European Union (EU) summit regarding Turkey's
candidacy, it will definitely back efforts for a settlement in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The EU will hold a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland on
December 12-13 to discuss, among other things, if to give Turkey
candidacy for the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said the previous EU decisions that its relation
with Turkey is affected by the Cyprus issue still stand.
</P>
<P>
The EU excluded Turkey from its eastward expansion in December
1997, citing concerns over Ankara's poor human rights performance,
disputes with the EU member Greece and its continued occupation of
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insists that its European course should not be connected
to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Minister said Turkey's desire to become part
of Europe "should be shown in practice."
</P>
<P>
He said Greece feels it can have "friendly, cooperative and
peaceful relations (with Turkey) if we build them based on
European principles, respect of international law, international
treaties and solve our problems through peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides underlined that the governments of
Greece and Cyprus "will operate in a spirit of full cooperation
and understanding."

<HEADLINE> Mountain Kilimanjaro Measured 5,892 Meters High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The peak of Mount
Kilimanjaro, the highest in Africa, is newly measured 5,892 meters
above sea level, a Tanzanian official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Principal of the College of Lands and Architectural Studies
in the Dar es Salaam University, Professor Alfeo Nikundiwe, made
the announcement in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Nikundiwe said the new measurement is the result of a latest
expedition by Tanzanian, German and Swiss scientists in September
using the global positioning system (GPS) and other mapping
methods.
</P>
<P>
"This will end controversies and speculations of some
documented observations made 110 years ago about the height of the
mountain," Nikundiwe said.
</P>
<P>
Besides establishing the precise height of the mountain, the
team also monitored volcano and earthquake activities around the
mountain and the neighboring East African Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
Nikundiwe said that the global positioning observation method
was more accurate and that could only give an error of no more
than a meter.
</P>
<P>
Mount Kilimanjaro has been claimed before at different heights
by Hans Meyer in 1889 (6,010 meters), Anglo-German Boundary
Commission in 1904 (5,892 meters) and the Department of Lands and
Surveys of the then Tanganyika in 1952 (5,895m).

<HEADLINE> Anglo-French Summit Backs European Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Thursday that the Anglo-French summit held in London
had opened a "new era" in the two countries' military relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that British and French governments were keen for the
rest of Europe to back their plans for a rapid reaction force,
which could intervene speedily in local conflicts in Europe, such
as that in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The move was an attempt to strengthen what he called "military
effectiveness," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on Thursday, Blair and French President
Jacques Chirac and his Prime Minister Lionel Jospin focused on
closer military coordination, putting aside their long-running row
over British beef exports,
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France strongly denied that strengthening
Europe's defense capabilities will undermine NATO, although there
are quite wide spread fears here that the United Sates would not
be happy to see the creation of a European Force coexistence with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It is not about creating a single European army, it is not
about attempting to supplant or compete with NATO," Blair stressed.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he hoped the rest of the European Union would back
the proposals at next month's summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Speaking ahead of the meeting, British Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon insisted that the United States government supported closer
European integration on defense.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. policy supports the development of a European security
and defense identity," Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are working for is a more effective European
contribution to NATO. We learned in Kosovo of the inability of
European nations to get sufficient forces into the field
sufficiently and quickly," He said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair said the defense negotiations were a"big
step forward, moving from principles to practical steps, and all
done within the context of NATO".
</P>
<P>
Britain, which sees itself as a bridge between Europe and the
United States, has worked hard to play down fears in Washington
that Europe's efforts to produce a more coordinated and efficient
military identity could undermine NATO.

JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- "The Israeli government and
myself attach great importance to the development of Israel's
relationship with China and we will do our best to further this
relationship in the future," Israeli President Ezer Weizman said
here Thursday evening to visiting Chinese top legislator Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
China is a great country with ancient civilization and to
promote the Israeli-Chinese relations is the common desire of the
peoples of the two countries, Weizman said in his meeting with
Li.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with the progress made in cooperation
between our two countries in the fields of agriculture, science
and technology, and we do hope that with joint efforts, the
cooperation in other aspects will also achieve remarkable
results," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to China in April this year, Weizman said
his talks in China with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other
Chinese leaders were very fruitful, which were conducive to
further strengthening the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also briefed Li on the developments of the Middle East
peace process, saying that only peace can bring development and
stability to the whole Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, said that to further strengthen the
Sino-Israeli relations is not only in the interest of the peoples
of the two countries, but also in the interest of the peace and
stability of the whole world.

He said the Chinese government and people are willing, on the
basis of mutual respect and trust, to build a stable, friendly and
lasting cooperative relationship with Israel toward the 21st
century.
</P>

China welcomes the positive developments in the Middle East
peace process and sincerely hopes that the Middle East issue will
be solved through negotiations as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Canada, China See New Era of Relationships at CCBC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian and Chinese business
leaders and officials hailed the coming of a new era for
relationships here Thursday at the opening of the 21st annual
meeting of the Canada China Business Council (CCBC).
</P>
<P>
Senator Jack Austin of the CCBC said in his opening speech that
he sees "a whole new era for relationships" between the two
countries with the upcoming accession of China to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT), told the annual meeting that China
needs Canada's expertise and experience in developing its own
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Canada enjoys a leading position in the fields of agriculture,
transportation, telecommunications, urban construction,
environmental protection and high-tech industry, which are also
taken as priorities by China in its future economic development,
according to the CCPIT chairman.
</P>
<P>
He praised the CCBC's unique role in promoting economic ties
and trade between the two countries, saying without the CCBC there
would have been no steady Sino-Canadian development in trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Ottawa Mei Ping urged better ties and
greater development in the future.
</P>
<P>
Although China has become the fourth biggest trading partner of
Canada, China's total export to Canada only accounts for 2 percent
of Canada's total import, while Canada's export to China takes up
less than 2 percent of China's total import, he told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There are no political barriers for us to do business with
each other," the ambassador said, adding that both Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji are "very
supportive" of the bilateral development of economic and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials believe that the two countries will very
soon sign their historic agreement on China's entry to the WTO
after a similar Sino-U.S. deal signed in Beijing on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Canadian and Chinese business leaders and officials
are gathering at the Metro Toronto Convention Center for the last
CCBC meeting of this century.
</P>
<P>
The CCBC was set up in 1978 with the purpose of promoting trade,
investment and other business operations between Canada and China,
founding corporations including Canada's high-tech giant Northern
Telecom Limited and China International Trust &AMP; Investment
Corporation.

JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- With less than a week to
go before Namibia's presidential and parliamentary elections, the
elections commission says it doesn't have enough cars for the job,
South African Press Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So far it has only 300 vehicles and needs at least another 300
for the smooth running of the elections on November 30 and
December 1.
</P>
<P>
Elections director Joram Rukambe said the government garage has
only been able to cater for 50 percent of the required vehicle
fleet needed for the elections and requests to government
ministries for help were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
The elections are being contested by eight political parties
and four presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Say Defense Links No Threat to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Let me make one thing quite clear. This is not about creating
a single European army under single command. It is not an attempt
in any shape or form to supplant or compete with NATO. We are
quite clear on this," British Prime Minister Tony Blair told a
joint press Conference held after his talks with French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Blair said his "immensely good" talks with French leaders had
set out "ambitious but realistic targets for strengthening
military capabilities" of the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration issued after the talks called for urgent
and substantial strengthening of Europe's airlift capabilities,
noting a need for new transport aircraft and greater sharing of
assets.
</P>
<P>
It also called on European Union states to "take a decisive
step forward" in developing their defense capabilities when they
meet in Helsinki, Finland, next month.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Britain said improvements in Europe's
capabilities were "necessary to give the EU the autonomous
capacity to take decisions and, where the (NATO) alliance as a
whole is not engaged, to launch and then to conduct EU-led
military operations."
</P>
<P>
"If you get a major crisis that comes up, the idea that we're
not going to discuss with our allies what the response would be is
absurd," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
French President Chirac also assured that there was no attempt
to cut out NATO in the formation of a stronger European defense
force.
</P>
<P>
"The provisions... have no negative consequences whatsoever for
NATO," he said.
</P>
<P>
But reports here said the United States had been alarmed by
references to an autonomous European defense capability and wanted
NATO to remain the first point of reference for European military
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the United States should not worry about the
creation of a European force.
</P>
<P>
"This in no way impinges on the strength of NATO. It is
designed to give us a capability in circumstances in which NATO
does not wish to be involved in a traditional way," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
"It is right that Europe shares the responsibility. I think
that emerged very clearly from Kosovo," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the Kosovo conflicts, European nations carried out only
20 percent of air strikes. They send to Kosovo only tens of
thousands of troops -- just 2 percent of Europe's combined armed
forces, and all these were strongly criticized by the media and
the parliament in some of the European nations.
</P>
<P>
After the Kosovo conflicts, French and British leaders said
repeatedly that European nations rallied on the U.S. too much and
should learn a lot from the war.
</P>
<P>
Former British Defense Secretary George Robertson, shortly
before he went to Brussels to take the post of secretary-general
of NATO, told a conference in London that Europe should "try to
settle regional conflicts and humanitarian crisis by themselves."
</P>
<P>
That might be the reason why Britain and France were very
active in recent months in their bid to have a new European force
to deal with regional conflicts in Europe, "without bothering NATO
" or "when it would be inconvenient to ask the United States."

ISLAMABAD -- Formal charges against the seven accused in a

were put off Friday till December 4 as more time was needed to

The ship, Dashun, carrying 262 passengers and 40 crew, sank at
about 11:50 p.m. Wednesday in gale-force winds and huge waves.

Heavy snow and powerful gales have further complicated the
rescue work. According to a meteorological report, the snowfall in
that location reached 15 centimeters between last night and today,
and a snow storm has been forecast.

Eyewitnesses said that three or four life preservers from the

<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji and Philippine President Joseph Estrada agreed here Friday
on strengthening their countries' cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
In their talks on the first day of Zhu's visit, Estrada said
Zhu's trip shows that both countries attach importance to the
bilateral relationship. He expressed satisfaction over the
Philippine-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said both his country and China are Asian countries
sharing a lot of common views and aspirations for peace and
prosperity. He reiterated that the Philippine side wants to
strengthen relations with China in a continuous way and is
determined to increase understanding, friendship and cooperation
with China.
</P>

The Philippines hopes to work out with China a framework

the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries next year as a guideline for the
bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country is willing to expand the common ground
between the two countries while not stressing their differences.
The Philippine side pledges its strict adherence to the existing
bilateral agreement on building mutual trust in the South China
Sea, without taking any action that would make the situation
complicated. The Philippine side is also committed to the solution
of the existing differences through bilateral consultation, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the traditional friendship between the two peoples,
Premier Zhu said remarkable progress has been made in bilateral
cooperation in various fields. He reiterated that China wants to
establish a long-term and stable friendship of good neighborliness
and further extend and deepen the cooperation with the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Zhu put forward a five-point proposal for the development of
Sino-Philippine ties, which includes the promotion of contacts and
exchanges between all sectors and at all levels and the invitation
of Estrada to visit China next year.
</P>
<P>
The premier agreed on the need of a framework document for the
bilateral cooperation in the next century, saying the agricultural
sector is the top priority.
</P>
<P>
On the differences between the two sides on the South China
Sea, Zhu said China's consistent stand is to seek a peaceful
solution through negotiations and not to let the problem have
adverse impact on the overall Sino-Philippine relationship.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he agreed with Zhu's proposal.
</P>
<P>
On intra-East Asia cooperation, Zhu said the upcoming informal
summit between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and China, Japan and South Korea scheduled for Sunday is the only
and very important channel for exchanges of views among East
Asian leaders on regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which was formed in 1967, now groups Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the 10+3 summit will surely be a success marked with
dedication to expanding common ground and strengthening
cooperation among the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Present at the Zhu-Estrada talks were Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and Agriculture Minister Chen Yaobang on the Chinese side
and the Philippine secretaries in charge of labor, science and
technology and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Singapore DPM Urges Bank Self-Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore banks Friday were
urged to give priority to self-renewal of their boards to achieve
the highest standards of corporate governance and introduce
nationwide check truncation to make check processing faster and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in
his keynote speech to the 16th General Meeting of the Asian
Bankers Association (ABA), which opened Friday morning and will
end Saturday with the participation of about 150 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that self-renewal is necessary in every field
including banks, Lee conceded that the boards of Singapore banks
have not given enough attention to self-renewal and have not done
enough to introduce and test out new talent and get people who
have served long and well to make way for a younger team.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that it is very difficult for a director to
give way to a younger replacement, particularly if he has
performed well over many years and still feels able to fulfill his
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"But unless we overcome this psychological hurdle, we will be
unable to sustain the vitality and drive of the organization and
the quality of our banks," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister noted that paperless
payment system has a long way to go to materialize and even the
United States still depends on a large volume of paper checks.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that it is a realistic target to aim for check
truncation by applying technology to the payment system.
</P>
<P>
Lee said check truncation means that the physical check is
scanned at the point of deposit and thereafter the electronic
image of the check, rather than the paper check itself, is
transmitted to the clearing house for sorting and then onward to
the paying banks.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the flow of the physical check is fully
truncated at the point of deposit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said check truncation will mean faster processing
of checks deposited, thereby increasing the customer's liquidity
and reducing settlement risk.
</P>
<P>
Lee told the meeting that the system of check truncation will
be implemented nationwide in Singapore by 2001, making his country
the first one to implement check truncation on such a scale.
</P>
<P>
The ABA was organized on October 29, 1981, as one of the
service councils of the Confederation of Asia Pacific Chambers of
Commerce and Industry. Then called Asian Bankers Council, the ABA
claimed that it aims to provide a forum for advancing the cause of
the banking and finance industry in the region with a view to
promoting regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ABA's membership currently includes 150 of the leading banks in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day general meeting delegates are taking up quite a
number of topics for discussion such as the changing financial
landscape, the euro and its impact on the Asian economy and the
changing capital market environment and management in a changing
environment.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Grows in 1st 3 Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy
experienced moderate recovery from the Asian financial crisis as
gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.6 percent during the first
three quarters of 1999 from zero growth in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
National Economic and Development Authority said Friday in a
report that combined with net factor income from abroad, the
country's gross national product (GNP) rose by 3 percent as
against 0.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that for the third quarter alone, the
domestic economy grew by 3.1 percent on the back of a strong
agricultural growth of 5.6 percent in the third quarter, though
still slower than the 11.1 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
In this quarter, the industry has finally started to grow, by
0.2 percent mainly due to the manufacturing sector. The
construction industry recorded its seventh quarter of decline at
5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports led the growth with a 7-percent expansion in
the third quarter, with semiconductors and electronic
microcircuits and finished electrical machinery the biggest
contributors.
</P>
<P>
The report said that with the higher-than-expected growth for
the third quarter, the government is on track of achieving its
target of a 3-percent increase in GDP and a 3.5-percent rise in
GNP in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Opposes Execution of Death Sentence Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' government Friday
expressed its opposition to Turkey's possible execution of the
death sentence against Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus Republic abolished the death sentence some years
ago. Cyprus opposes the execution of the death sentence in
other countries," Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, the leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), was captured by Turkish commandos in Kenya in February
and was sentenced to death by the Turkish State Security Court
in June for separatism and insurrection.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld the
death sentence against Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan led a separatist Kurdish campaign for at least 15
years. More than 37,000 people have been killed in conflicts.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Belarus is prepared to sign a
union treaty with Russia "as soon as the Russian side is ready for
it," said head of the Belarussian presidential administration
Mikhail Myasnikovich in Minsk Friday.

Myasnikovich wished Russian President Boris Yeltsin's speedy
recovery from his sudden illness.
</P>
<P>
Myasnikovich expressed hope that Yeltsin and Belarussian

the parliamentary) and the Belarussian parliament ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Yeltsin "felt poorly" on Thursday after a session of

Later doctors of the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital diagnosed

bronchitis," said the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
The president instructed Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to call
Lukashenko and inform that a Supreme Council of the Russian-
Belarussian Union session and the signing of a union treaty
scheduled for Friday will be postponed to early December.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Is Bangladeshi Opposition Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Hardly anybody can tell when the
opposition parties in Bangladesh will hold their much-talked-about
summit to give their joint anti-government movement a momentum or
whether they will be able to hold it at all.
</P>
<P>
But one person knows it and that person is none other than
Begum Khaleda Zia, chairperson of the largest opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and leader of the Opposition in
Parliament, political analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance, since it came into
existence late last year, has launched an increasingly-intensified
campaign to oppose the government, but the chiefs of the parties
are yet to sit together to discuss their combined efforts aimed at
forcing the Awami League (AL) government to resign and holding
early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders always said the movement was at the last
stage of demanding the government's immediate resignation, but the
last stage has never come and the government is still in power.
</P>
<P>
In late October this year, a leader of the Jatiya Party (JP,
Ershad) which is the second largest opposition party in the
country, said the opposition parties would hold a summit in early
November, possibly on November 6 and 7, to prepare for a showdown
with the government.
</P>
<P>
But one month has passed and the prospect of a summit remains
elusive. Press reports said the liaison committee of the four
parties was in the process of drafting a joint declaration for the
summit, which is likely to take place within this month.
</P>
<P>
"Though the date for the meeting is yet to be finalized, we are
optimistic that it would take place by November 29," said one
leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, member of the four-party alliance,
on Wednesday night after a meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, doubted that the chiefs of the opposition
would be ever able to sit together to give a boost to their
anti-government movement.
</P>
<P>
The core issues that hinder the four from a face-to-face
meeting include how to compete in future elections, jointly or
separately, and how to share power if and after their movement is
successful, they said. They believed that such a summit would not
be possible until the four parties could agree on a scheme for
these vital issues.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chief, who served as prime minister of the BNP
government from 1991 to 1996, has never been on good terms with JP
President H.E. Ershad since her husband, the late President Ziaur
Rahman, was assassinated in 1981. Ershad came to power after the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to opposition leaders said Ershad has an eye to
the presidency if the alliance succeeds in ousting the AL
government and wins the election.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the BNP does not want to give the prestigious
post to the JP (Ershad), which in 1996 rendered support to the AL
to form the "government of national consensus," according to the
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Whether the opposition alliance will ever be able to get what
they want -- toppling the government ahead of its five-year term
and winning an early general election -- depends on the BNP,
particularly its chief, Khaleda Zia, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Most Tanzanian Urbanites Live in Unplanned Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Though strict land
policies were adopted, about 60 to 70 percent of Tanzanian
residents in urban areas are still living in informal or unplanned
areas, Tanzanian newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye attributed the
problem to massive rural-urban exodus which surpasses the
government's ability to survey plots and build houses for
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
"Serious and uncontrolled rural-urban migration is forcing
urban residents to build houses in unplanned areas disrupting the
town's master plan," Sumaye said here Thursday when opening an
international conference on Interaction Between Formal and
Informal Urban Land Management in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary constraints are also contributing to government's
failure to allocate enough funds to ensure the smooth running of
urban land management in poor countries including Tanzania, the
prime minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that surveyed plots are important for a smooth
availability of necessary utilities such as water, electricity and
passable roads, Sumaye said that repeated budget constraints are
causing another problem of payment of compensation where the land
was previously occupied.
</P>
<P>
"With the on-going liberalization of the economies, the land
sector needs strict regulatory framework and sometimes government
intervention is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has formulated the National Land Policy of 1995, and a
new legislation for Land Act of 1999 has also been enacted to
streamline matters of land ownership and accessibility.
</P>
<P>
The overall goal of the policy is to promote and ensure a
secure land tenure system, promote optional land utilization and
facilitate broad based socio-economic development with top
attention to ecological balance of environment.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Offer $200,000 for Congo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan will contribute 200,000
U.S. dollars to support the implementation of the Lusaka Peace
Accord which seeks to end the war in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), the Japanese Embassy in Harare said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fund would support activities of the Joint Military
Commission (JMC) and help promote national dialog in the third
largest African country, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted an
embassy official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The resources are supposed to be utilized for the
establishment of the offices by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) in the DRC and cater for expenses required for the
activities of those who play the important role of promoting
national dialog," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The JMC is composed of all the belligerents in the DRC and is
aimed at spearheading the implementation of the Lusaka Peace
Accord signed in the Zambian capital in July this year, but its
work had been stalled due to lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
"Japan strongly hopes that this support will help the promotion
of the countries concerned to the implementation of the peace
agreement fully and promptly," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already pledged about one million dollars
to boost the peace process with the OAU and at least three African
countries including Zimbabwe agreeing to contribute 500,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 15-month civil war has sucked in at least six African
armies with Uganda and Rwanda supporting the rebels while Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia defend the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
All the belligerents have since signed the Lusaka Peace Accord,
paving the way for the establishment of the JMC.
</P>
<P>
Already, about 90 military observers called liaison officers
are in the DRC ahead of a U.N. team of surveyors to spearhead the
implementation of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> China Suspends Operation of Shipwreck Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) --The Yanda Shipping Company
which owned the wrecked ship "Dashun", has been forced to suspend
its operations from today by the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Lashing winds and towering waves wrecked the 9000-ton ship "
Dashun" late Wednesday near the port of Yantai, in east China's
Shangdong Province while on its way to the northeastern port city
of Dalian in Liaoning Province. The vessel was carrying 302
passengers and crew. Twelve people were rescued.
</P>
<P>
An official directing rescue operations said that the 22
survivors of the tragic incident are now being taken good care of
at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
It was the second accident involving a vessel operated by Yanda
Shipping Company just one month earlier. The other ship, "Shenglu"
caught flames and sank near the port of Dalian in October, leaving
one man dead and another missing.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Yanda Shipping
Company to conduct a thorough investigation into the safety of its
vessels and improve personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, minister of Communications, said that a second
vessel incident within two months from the same shipping company
is evidence enough of poor safety practices. Huang said "the
company will not be allowed to resume its operations until strict
safety measures are put in place."
</P>
<P>
At a televised conference today, the minister also urged
shipping companies nationwide to improve safety awareness. Routine
check-ups of shipping vessels before the traditional Spring
Festival will start ahead of schedule this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also issued an urgent circular today requesting
shipping companies to give top priority to safety practices. The
circular outlines seven specific requirements, including setting
up responsibility systems and improving the reporting of maritime
disasters.

<HEADLINE> HK SFC Urges Attention to GEM Listing Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong Friday called attention to the
listing rules of the Growth Enterprises Market (GEM) with regard
to the GEM moratorium requirements applicable to management
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The GEM listing rules currently provide that initial management
shareholders are subject to restriction to dispose of their
interest in GEM companies for two years after listing.
</P>
<P>
The GEM, the second stock market of the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong, was opened Thursday for hi-tech and growth enterprises to
raise capital toward their business expansion.
</P>
<P>
In considering whether the GEM moratorium period applicable to
management shareholders ought to be reduced to six months, the
commission takes into account one of the important elements in
analyzing a GEM investment, which is the identity of the key
management and their commitment to the company.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the moratorium period to six months may allow initial
management shareholders to sell out even before the issue of the
first annual report after listing, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
However, public investors would expect the initial management
shareholders to show commitment to the company, it said.
</P>
<P>
The GEM cannot adopt the same rules as those of the NASDAQ,
which do not impose any disposal restrictions on management
shareholders of listed companies, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
There are differences in the two markets, especially taking
into account the prevalence of civil actions taken by investors
against listed companies and their management in the United States,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Since the GEM is still a new market, there will be a period of
adjustment of the regulatory framework before the full rules are
finalized, it said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean AFRC Separated From Former Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council (AFRC) in Sierra Leone has dissociated itself from the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday Sankoh, Nigeria's
The Guardian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The AFRC "has nothing to do with the political organization on
RUF party, " said a press release issued in Sierra Leonean capital
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The RUF registered as a political party Monday, nearly five
months after signing a peace accord in Togolese capital Lome in
July between the Sierra Leonean government and the rebel RUF.
</P>
<P>
After the signing, Paul Koroma and other top leaders of the
AFRC who did not attend the peace negotiations in Lome said that
they had been sidelined in the deal.
</P>
<P>
However, when the leaders of the RUF and AFRC, Sankoh and
Koroma, arrived in Freetown in October to implement the peace
accord, they said their movements were united.
</P>
<P>
The AFRC, comprised of two-thirds of the Sierra Leone Army
(SLA), seized power from the government of President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah in May 1997 and set up a military regime with its RUF
allies.
</P>
<P>
The junta and rebels were jointly ousted in February 1998 by
Nigerian- led west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG, and Kabbah
was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
The former allies of the AFRC and the RUF have clashed in
northern Sierra Leone since the arrival of the leaders of the two
movements in the country, sparking fears that the accord would not
endure.
</P>
<P>
The AFRC said in the press release that it preferred to place
"a premium on the disarmament of SLA soldiers who were involved in
the conflict and not party politics at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Committee for Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration said Thursday that 117 more
combatants had been disarmed, bringing the total figure to 1,063.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that some 45,000 ex-combatants are
to be disarmed in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> West Africa Peace-keeping Force to Disband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG will cease to exist as soon as the United Nations
takes over the peace-keeping operations in Sierra Leone, Nigerian
Defense Minister Theophilus Danjuma has said.
</P>
<P>
This is because there is no resolution on its continuous
existence by the heads of government in Economic Community of West
Africa States (ECOWAS) , the minister said in Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has 15 battalions and support elements in ECOMOG's
operation in Sierra Leone with strength of 9,712 troops from the
Army, Navy and Air Force, Nigerian media Friday quoted Danjuma as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the U.N. would deploy a 6,000 strong
troops to replace the ECOMOG in Sierra Leone. The replacement
will be in form of " formed units" using ECOMOG units and the
equipment already deployed.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that the final arrangements would be made when
the role of the ECOMOG has been re-defined," Danjuma said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Somalis Killed in Clan Clashes for Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were
killed and eight others wounded when an armed confrontation flared
up between rival militiamen in Kabhanley village in central
Somalia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted between Faqi Omar and Faqi Muhumad subclans
of Dir clan living in Hiran region for the control of a water
channel and a farming terrain outside the village, according to
reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
So far, no battle wagons are involved in the confrontation, as
each of the two sides is using light assault rifles and hand
grenades for taking control of the area where the water channel is
situated.
</P>
<P>
The channel drives its water from River Shabelle that comes
from the Shawa Mountains of Ethiopia and passes throughout
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
There are no peace movements over the conflict at this moment
as the two sides are each calling for militia assistance from
their subclan compatriots in Hiran region and even in capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Only three days ago, three people from both sides were killed
in a similar armed confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of families have fled Kabhanley village in fear of the
fighting after the shooting subsided on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Serious shortage of water is badly affecting the subsistence of
farmers and nomads in some parts of southern Somalia.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Growth Viewed as Sign of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce said Friday that the faster pace of Hong Kong'
s positive real growth in the third quarter is a strong sign that
the economy is pulling out of recession.
</P>
<P>
"This should further add to confidence in the local economy in
the near term," said the chamber.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product of Hong Kong grew 4.5 percent in
real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier, said an
economic report published by the Hong Kong government Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is now predicting that deflation, as
measured by the GDP deflator, would be 5 percent for the full 1999
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
This means that nominal or current dollar GDP for the full year
is expected to be in the negative, probably around 3 percent, said
the chamber.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: GCC Summit Faces Common Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 26 (Xinhua) -- As leaders of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states are to arrive in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh Saturday for their last summit in this century,
the question remains open if they are fully prepared to deal with
the challenges facing the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the GCC states - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - are to
meet in Riyadh later Friday to put final touches on the agenda of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Although economic issues have to be the focus of the summit,
those tough and sensitive issues such as the GCC-Iranian
rapprochement and its impact, the Iraqi issue, and a joint GCC
defense pact appear no less important and challenging.
</P>
<P>
It is widely agreed that the economic issues need to be
addressed and resolved as the oil-rich GCC states suffered a
setback because of last year's plunging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The decade-low oil prices throughout 1998 and the first quarter
of this year brought about a loss of some 50 billion U.S. dollars
to the six GCC states, forcing them to tighten belts, and then try
to find a way out.
</P>
<P>
The pressure was only partially relieved after major oil
producers, they included, agreed earlier this year to slash their
production, a measure that lifted the oil prices from abyss.
</P>
<P>
It was not too difficult for GCC officials to find some
remedies to the economic ills. They are now aware of the need to
diversify revenue resources, restructure economy, speed up
privatization, open up to foreign investments and reduce foreign
labors to pave the way for manpower localization.
</P>
<P>
But to translate these into deeds has proved to be a tough
job. What, for example, might be the alternative income resources
for the oil-dependent states? How, again, will they move away the
road blocks before they push forward the privatization of public
sectors, where citizens are accustomed to stay?
</P>
<P>
Local people in the welfare Gulf Arab states apparently prefer
comfortable jobs in government departments to lower-income ones
offered by private employers.
</P>
<P>
As expatriates account for about two-thirds of the whole
population in most of the GCC states, a dramatic manpower
localization is likely to paralyze many parts of the public and
service sectors, economists said.
</P>
<P>
To further strengthen inter-GCC trade ties, a regional tariffs
union is a must. Although negotiations concerning the union have
entered into the final phases, the goal for an official GCC
tariffs integration was only set for the year 2001, although the
European Union (EU) still insists the GCC tariffs union as a
precondition to sign an EU-GCC free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Besides the economic problems, cooperation in the defense and
security fields are also likely to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers of the GCC states met in Dubai, the UAE last
Tuesday in an attempt to forge a collective defense arrangement,
but the meeting ended without a decision.
</P>
<P>
The issue is expected to be added to the summit's agenda by the
foreign ministers during their Friday's session.
</P>
<P>
The rapprochement between some GCC members, particularly the
Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia, and Iran and its impact on UAE's
islands' dispute with Tehran are also believed to be a matter of
contention at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate President Mohmmad Khatami's landmark visit to
Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad's tour of Tehran earlier this year irked Abu
Dhabi, who felt the warming-up of cross-Gulf ties will undermine
the GCC support for its claim in the territorial dispute with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran declared sovereignty over the three
islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, in the mouth
of the strategic strait of Hormuz. The islands are now controlled
by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq issue is believed to be another sticky topic, as the
GCC states are differing on ways to deal with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia insist that Iraq comply with all the
relevant United Nations resolutions, including the elimination of
all weapons of mass destruction, before the U.N. sanctions can be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Other GCC states, however, are maintaining relatively stable
links with Baghdad and hoping to see the devastating sanctions
removed sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been an outspoken advocate of lifting the sanctions
which has been in place since 1990 after Iraq's invasion and
occupation of Kuwait. It argues that the sanctions only added to
the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, on the other hand, has been inquiring the fate of over
600 Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti nationals allegedly held in Iraqi
jails during its occupation and seeking support of the GCC states
to secure a quick release of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But a defiant Iraq denied the Kuwaiti claim, and has so far
made the GCC leaders feel at a loss over how to take a first step
forward to a possible thaw of GCC-Iraqi ties.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said now that the GCC leaders have decided
to sit down together, they are clearly determined to meet their
common challenges and overcome them. But people should refrain
from expecting a panacea from the two-day session.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Case Against Former PM Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Formal charges against the
seven accused in a plane hijacking case, including former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, were put off Friday till December 4 as more
time was needed to prepare the case.
</P>
<P>
Judge of the Special Anti-Terrorist Court in Karachi Rehmat
Hussain Jaffery agreed with the prosecution plea to delay the
formation of a charge list of criminal conspiracy, hijacking,
kidnapping and attempted murder against the ousted prime minister
and six others.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors told the court that the delay was necessary
because three more people had been included in the list of the
accused, sources from Karachi said.
</P>
<P>
Shahbaz Sharif, former Punjab chief minister, was arrested in
the case on Thursday along with Saifur Rehman, head of defunct
Ehtesab (accountability) Bureau, and Saeed Mehdi, principal
secretary to Sharif, was also arrested and presented before the
court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Three international observers, one from the United States and
two from European Union embassies, were also present in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and six others were brought to the court under tight
security in armored vehicles. Police baton-charged a small group
of supporters of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League who chanted
slogans supporting the ousted prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sharif said he had ordered the Pakistan International
Airlines plane carrying General Pervaiz Musharraf to be landed at
Karachi airport at all costs and the case against him was
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
"I did say clearly and categorically that the plane must land
at Karachi. The military coup was already under way before the
plane incidence," Sharif told reporters before going into the
court Friday.
</P>
<P>
He also said the military government was dramatizing the plane
issue to cover up the coup. "Who ordered it (plane) to be diverted
will come out in court," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said, "Musharraf has made me a victim of a personal
vendetta and personal revenge. What he has done is something
totally extra-constitutional."
</P>
<P>
The hijacking charge, carrying death penalty, is connected to
an alleged attempt to divert a Pakistan International Airlines
plane on October 12 bringing General Musharraf from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister said the arrest of his brother showed
that the military government is after his family.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the government has turned all guns on my
family," Sharif added.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government was dismissed on October 12 in a military
coup and Sharif was formally arrested on November 17 along with
three others. Now the list of the accused has increased to seven.

<HEADLINE> First Arab Student Gets Ph.D. in Chinese Literature in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Yousef S. K. Hatabeh, a 36-
year-old Jordanian doctorate student in the Chinese Language
Department at Beijing Teachers' University, has become the first
Arab student to receive a Ph.D. in contemporary Chinese Literature
in China. He successfully defended his dissertation this morning.
</P>
<P>
In his dissertation, Yousef compared the works by Lu Xun (1881-
1926), regarded as the greatest modern Chinese writer to Mahaffudh,
the only Arab Nobel laureate for Literature, examining the authors
' views on revolution, women and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
"I want to introduce the works of Lu Xun and Chinese literature
to the Arab world, rather than making literal comparison of their
ideologies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yousef was among the first group of students sent by the
Jordanian Government to China to learn Chinese in 1984, but he was
the only student among the first group who had the perseverance to
continue.
</P>
<P>
He enrolled to do a Ph.D. at the Beijing Teachers' University
in 1996. Despite the enormous difficulties of writing his
dissertation in Chinese, Yousef said the journey was highly
enjoyable. Yousef said that a good study environment with the help
and guidance of Wang Furen, a Lu Xun expert and his supervisor
were crucial.
</P>
<P>
Yousef plans to go back to Jordan to set up a Chinese language
course at university. He said he is determined to promote cultural
exchanges between China and Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Output Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output grew by 22.6 percent year-on-year in October with
cumulative output increasing by 13.8 percent in the first 10
months of 1999 compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In its data released Friday, Singapore's Economic Development
Board attributed the strong rise in October to higher output in
the three major clusters of electronics, chemicals and
engineering.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster grew by 31.4 percent compared with the
same period of last year while its cumulative growth was 22.7
percent in the first 10 months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The segments of semiconductor, personal computers and printers
expanded while the output of disk drives slowed down.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew by 30.5 percent in October on back
of a hefty 149.5-percent gain by pharmaceuticals and a
61.3-percent rise by the industrial/specialty chemicals segments,
with cumulative output increasing by 20.4 percent for the first 10
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The output of the engineering cluster gained 9.2 percent over
the same month of last year, contributed by a strong growth in
precision engineering and a moderate growth in transport
engineering.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, the output of the engineering cluster for the
first 10 months of 1999 was 0.3 percent less than that produced in
the same period of 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Friday said
high quality manpower will be essential to Hong Kong's economic
development as external conditions are ripe for Hong Kong to take
off again.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum "Re-discovering the Hong Kong Advantage in
Times of Change" at the University of Hong Kong, Joseph W P Wong,
secretary for education and manpower, said Hong Kong is in great
need of professionals in developing tourism and information
technology, which the government pledged to boost.
</P>
<P>
"We have, on the whole, sufficient manpower to support the
development of the industry, but training, especially those on
service and language, has to be strengthened," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As the completion of the Disney Theme Park will benefit many
related industries such as hotels, retail and catering, Wong hoped
that the quality service culture of Disneyland will bring a
positive and far-reaching impact on the development of human
resources in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the training of information technology personnel,
Wong said the government has invested heavily in promoting the
application of information technology in primary and secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, we have an urgent need to train more people
to meet different needs," he said. "In the next few years, we hope
to organize more training courses, including post-secondary
courses at the level of diploma or even degree or above, so as to
provide pre-employment and on-the-job training to a large number
of people to support the rapid development of the industry."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the development of information technology
requires the best talents.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we will train up a large pool of local
talents, and on the other, we will try to attract talents from
around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua)-- Beijing, the national capital,
welcomes foreign investors and will try every means to improve
investment environment, said vice-mayor Zhang Mao.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on policies concerning foreign-funded
enterprises in Beijing, the city will further open up its commerce,
tourism, high technology, and services for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from over 200 foreign-invested companies,
including Motorola, National and the American Chamber of Commerce,
attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said while the city's business community and government
officials hold regular meetings with overseas investors, they also
encourage these investors to air any complaints and suggestions
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the government will provide the same kind of
assistance it gives to its state industries. The Beijing city
government will allow district and county-level governments to
directly handle the approval of foreign-funded enterprises with
investments below 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city's labor, personnel and public security
bureaux answered questions from these foreign company
representatives.
</P>

billion U.S. dollars. There are 43 companies in Beijing which have
investments worth more than 10 million U.S. dollars each.

TOKYO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Yang Yang took a comfortable
victory in the women's 1,500-meter race while no male Chinese
skaters shone on the opening day of the World Cup short track
speed skating on Friday in Nobeyama, Japan.

Yang, known as Yang Yang (A) from Heilongjiang Province
differentiated to another Chinese skater of the same name from
Jilin Province, clocked two minutes and 34.0966 seconds to win the

second place, followed by South Korea's Choi Min-Kyung.
</P>
<P>
With Chinese women's team lived up to its expectation, the

Yulong finished the last one of the six-man race.
</P>
<P>
World overall champion Li Jiajun of China, also the winner of
the 500m, 3,000m and 5,000m relay in Sofia in March, finished a

<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council has expressed confidence that the coming visit
by China's top legislator Li Peng would help promote and enhance
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese journalists in Ramallah on the eve
of Li's visit, Abu Ala hailed the distinguished
Palestinian-Chinese ties as "age-old relations which we highly
esteem and appreciate."
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, is due to visit the Palestinian self-rule areas
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala said that China was the first country to announce its
support of the Palestine cause following the outbreak of the
Palestinian revolution in the early 1960s. "The Palestinian people
are thus grateful to China and its support of the Palestine
cause," he said, adding that "China's stance has remained firm."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese government and people over the past
decades have supported the Palestinian people's struggle for
legitimate national rights, extending valuable material support.
</P>
<P>
"China has never interfered in our affairs, not once, but has
always maintained a firm stance whether in bilateral relations or
at the international level such the United Nations, the
non-aligned movement and all international conferences," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has always supported the Palestinian stance, and we
appreciate that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his last visit to China during which he went to
Beijing and Shanghai, Abu Ala said "the Palestinian people are
delighted at China's great achievements in economic, social,
technological and defense fields, under the banners of reform and
openness."
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that these achievements have placed China among the
first ranking countries of the world, he particularly expressed
his pleasure with China's recent successful launch of a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
He further said that Palestinian people would happily welcome
Li whom he described as a highly placed guest and friend of the
Palestinian leadership and people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the first visit to Palestine by the head of
the Chinese legislative will contribute greatly to the development
and boosting of bilateral relations, adding that he will openly
discuss with the Chinese guests basic issues of bilateral interest
in all fields as well as the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss ways and means of promoting
cooperation between the two parliaments in legislation and relate
fields.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala said the Palestinian side will suggest the formation a
friendship committee of the two parliaments as part of the efforts
to deepen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li is the highest ranking Chinese leader to visit the
Palestinian self-rule territories. During his half-day stay, he
will meet Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian National
Authority in Ramallah and other senior officials. He will also
address the Palestinian Legislative Council.

<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- On-going trial of retired and
some serving military officers according to the law is unlikely to
impact negatively on the morale of the armed forces, Nigeria's

"The on-going trials prove one thing -- nobody is above the law.
The trials are taking place under due process of law," the defense

<HEADLINE> HK's Economic Recovery Gains Further Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The recovery process in the
Hong Kong economy has gathered further momentum in the third
quarter of 1999, a government report said.
</P>
<P>
A crude initial assessment suggests that the Gross Domestic
Product should have attained a growth of around 4.5 percent in
real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier, according to
the government's third quarter economic report of 1999, which was
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, GDP should
have expanded further by around 2 percent in real terms in the
third quarter, after rebounding to 3.1 percent growth in the
second quarter, said the report, which described the economic
situation in the third quarter of 1999 and provided updated GDP
and price forecasts for the year.
</P>
<P>
Externally, exports of goods staged a significant upturn,
driven by the sharp rebound in exports of China's mainland, a
general pick-up in demand in the East Asian economies, as well as
a broad strengthening in import absorption in the United States
and Europe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of services likewise accelerated in growth, along with
the regional economic recovery, it said, adding that the combined
visible and invisible trade balance should have yielded a
considerably larger surplus in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer spending picked up further, in
tandem with the recovery in overall economic activity and with the
employment situation holding generally stable.
</P>
<P>
On investment spending, it said, the decline in expenditure on
machinery and equipment tended to taper, while public sector
building and construction output bounced back to positive growth
thereby providing a partial offset to the continued slack in
private sector building activity.
</P>
<P>
The labor market held generally stable, and the seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate in the third quarter of 1999 stood at 6.
1 percent while the underemployment rate was 3.1 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The stock market also consolidated in the third quarter, but
regained strength in the latter part of October upon improved
market sentiment, and rallied to new post-crisis highs in November
upon China's accord with the United States on its accession to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
For 1999 as a whole, GDP is now forecast at a growth of 1.8
percent in real terms, up from 0.5 percent in the August round,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy should continue to benefit
from the revival of demand in East Asia, better economic
conditions in Europe, and sustained import absorption in the
United States, the report concluded.

While the law-enforcement departments have done much to crack
down on economic crimes and safeguard the legal rights of SOEs,
the enterprises also have upgraded their operations in accordance
with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the laws on SOEs reform should be
further improved and that various types of illegal activities
detrimental to the enterprises still exist. Meanwhile, he said,
some of the enterprises are not skilled at protecting their own
rights and interests by legal means.
</P>
<P>
He criticized a small number of SOE managers for violating the
law, making personal profit by abusing their power, and causing
losses for state-owned properties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged top officials at all levels to take the lead in
studying, utilizing and abiding by the law. This will help them
improve their ability to manage according to law and to learn how
to guarantee the reform of SOEs through legal means, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly higher Friday, its first upward finish in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It was contributed by expectations of a takeover bid for
Pioneer International, the world's third largest concrete plant.
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Thursday requested a two-day trading halt in its
shares, saying it expected discussions with an unnamed party,
which might lead to an offer for the company, to be concluded in
the next few days. Analysts suggest that the suitor is most likely
the Britain-based Hanson or France's Lafarge SA. If the suitor is
an overseas party, it is likely to need to buy Australian dollars,
thus providing a boost to the currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 63.83 U.S. cents from 0.6328
at the close on Thursday, at 0.6269 euro from 0.628 and 66.53

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Treated For Illness at Country Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is now receiving medical treatment at his Gorky-9 country
residence for his sudden sickness, said his press secretary Dmitry
Yakushkin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "felt poorly" on Thursday after a session of the
Security Council that lasted about two hours in the Kremlin. Later
doctors of the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital diagnosed
Yeltsin's condition as a "viral infection accompanied by acute
bronchitis."
</P>
<P>
"No special courses of treatment or medication were prescribed
to the president. Now he continues to work on a number of current
issues despite the bronchitis," said Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin is not expected to have any meetings with
foreign leaders until Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's
scheduled visit to Moscow on December 6, said the Kremlin
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The president instructed Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to call
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and inform him of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Lukashenko agreed that a Supreme Council of the
Russian-Belarussian Union session and the signing of a union
treaty scheduled for Friday will be postponed to December,
Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
While regretting the postponement of the visit, Putin
reaffirmed Russia's adherence to the integration plan with Belarus,
and expressed Moscow's readiness to sign the treaty and a program
for its implementation, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy head of the Belarussian presidential
administration Ivan Pashkevich has confirmed that a planned visit
to Moscow by Lukashenko scheduled for Friday will also be
postponed, most likely to early December, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of General Election Events in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will hold the
general election on Saturday. Following is a chronology of general
election events in the country since 1972.
</P>
<P>
December 1972 -- The Labor Party led by Norman Kirk wins the
election and a Labor government is formed with Kirk as Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
November 1975 -- A general election resulted in victory for the
National Party, which won 55 of the 87 seats in the House of
Representatives, while the Labor Party took the remaining 32
seats.
</P>
<P>
November 1978 -- At the general election, the National Party
retained power, with 50 of the 92 seats in the enlarged House of
Representatives, but its share of the total vote fell from 47.2
percent in 1975 to 39.8 percent. The Labor Party won more votes
(40.4 percent of the total) but fewer seats (41).
</P>
<P>
November 1981 -- the National Party won 47 of the 92 seats in
the House, while Labor, which again received more votes, won 43
seats In the general election.
</P>
<P>
July 1984 -- In June, 1984, faced with dissent within his own
party, Prime Minister Mulddon called an early general election for
July. The Labor Party obtained 43 percent of the total votes and
secured 56 of the 95 seats in an enlarged House of
Representatives, while the National Party, with 36 percent of the
votes, took 37 seats. David Lange, the leader of the Labor Party,
became Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
August 1987 -- In the general election, of the 97 seats in the
enlarged House of Representative, the Labor Party secured 58, and
the National Party 39. Of the votes cast, the Labor Party received
47.4 percent, and the National Party 42.8 percent. The Labor
Government's initial success of economic measures and widespread
popular support for the government's anti-nuclear policy
contributed to the second victory for Labor in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
October 1990 -- The National Party won 47.8 percent of the
votes at the general election, taking 67 of the 97 seats in the
House of Representatives. The Labor Party, with 35.1 percent of
the votes, won 29 seats. Jim Bolger, as leader of the National
Party, became Prime Minister at the head of a Government that
promised to continue Labor's strict budgetary and monetary
controls.
</P>
<P>
September 1992 -- A preliminary referendum on proposed
electoral reform was held. The electorate voted overwhelmingly in
favor of the abolition of the "first-past-the post" system and for
its replacement by a form of proportional representation; of the
four alternatives offered, the mixed member proportional (MMP)
system received the greatest support. A second, binding referendum
was to be arranged to coincide with the next general election,
scheduled for late 1993. The new rules were to be implemented at
the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
November 6, 1993 -- The general election was held. The National
Party, which had campaigned mainly on the government's record of
economic recovery, was narrowly returned to office, receiving 35.2
percent of the total votes cast and securing 50 seats in the House
of Representatives. The Labor Party, with 34.7 percent of the
votes, won 45 seats.
</P>
<P>
October 12 1996 -- The first general election under the MMP
system was held. No party achieved an outright majority. The
National Party, with 34.1 percent of the votes, won 44 of the 120
seats in the expanded House of Representatives, and the Labor
Party, with 28.3 percent, secured 37 seats. A notable development
was the increase in the number of Maori MPs from six to 15, a
figure almost equivalent to the proportion of Maori in the
population as a whole. Jim Bolger thus continued as Prime
Minister.

New Zealand was first discovered and settled some time before
AD 1000 by the ancestors of the present Polynesian inhabitants.
On December 12, l642, Dutch navigator AbeI Tasman landed the west
coastline of the country and called the land "Staten Landt" after
the name of Dutch province of Zealand. From October 1769 to 1777,
British Captain James Cook made four voyages to the Northland. In
1840, New Zealand became part of British New South Wales colony of
Australia from which it separated a year later. The first
permanent British settlement was made at Wellington by a group of
N.Z. Company and led by Edward Gihhou Wakefield. In 1852, the
British Parliament granted self-government. New Zealand became a
dominion, under the British Crown, in 1907 and achieved full
independence by the Statute of Westminster, adopted by the British
Parliament in 1931 and accepted by New Zealand in 1947. From then
on New Zealand has been a member of the Commonwealth.

<HEADLINE> China to Curtail Newspaper Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans a nationwide
cutback in the number of newspaper organizations in the coming
half year and urges those that are left to make their own ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
The State Press and Publication Administration has recently
issued a regulation for reducing the number of newspaper
organizations, with some being merged and some with circulation
under 30,000 being closed down.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that starting January 1, 2000,
newspapers run by central governmental organs must make money for
themselves instead of asking for state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The move is meant to raise the efficiency of newspaper
organizations and make them market-oriented, said Liang Heng,
deputy director of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Government departments that run their own newspapers should not
require their local branches or other bodies to unwillingly
subscribe to these newspapers, the regulation said.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers run by government departments could consider to
join the People's Daily or newspaper groups, said Liu Bo, a senior
official with the administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration will cut the number of local
newspapers run by local governments.
</P>
<P>
The cutback will be completed before the end of June next year,
according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
At present China has a total of 2,160 newspapers, with an
annual publication of 26 billion copies.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Guangzhou-based Nanfang Daily and Yangcheng
Evening News, Shanghai's Wenhui Daily and Xinmin Evening News, and
the Beijing-based national newspapers Guangming Daily and Economic
Daily separately established their own newspaper groups.

New Zealand's legislative power is vested in the unicameral
House of Representatives, elected by universal adult suffrage for
3 years. At the 1996 general elections, when a system of mixed
member proportional (MMP) representation was introduced, the
number of members constituting the House of Representatives was
expanded from 99 to 120 seats: 67 electorate members, including
six seats reserved for Maoris, and 53 members being chosen from
party lists.
</P>
<P>
Everyone over the age of 18 years may vote in the election of
members for the House of Representatives. Since August 1975 any

For a long time, the National Party and the Labor Party have
been the major political parties in the country. The two parties
have dominated national politics in turn during a period of more
than half a century. Other important political parties include ACT
New Zealand (an ally of the National Party), the Alliance (an ally
of the Labor Party), and New Zealand First Party.

1. The New Zealand National Party:
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand National Party, the ruling party in the country
at present, was formed in Wellington in May 1936. It grew out of
the coalition government of the reform party and liberal party
which had formed a wartime national government in 1915. Those two
parties united to form an alternative to the socialist labor
government. The name "national" was chosen as the new party sought
to represent all parts of the community.
</P>
<P>
The National Party ruled the country from 1949 to 1957, from
1960 to 1972, from 1975 to 1984, and from 1990 to this day.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the National Party won an astounding 56 seats of a
possible 97. This was the largest majority in New Zealand's
parliamentary history.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the National Party won 44 out of the 120 seats in
parliament under the New electoral system of the Mixed Member
Proportional.
</P>
<P>
The National Party , which claims to have 100,000 members,
draws its political base from rural areas and major city suburbs.
It has traditionally supported free enterprise, individual
initiative, and limited government intervention in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The first leader of the National Party was Adam Hamilton. The
current leader of the party is prime minister jenny Shipley who
replaced Jim Bolger in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The National Management Board has the following sub-committees:
 strategy, finance and staff, rules, policy, Maori advisory, New
Zealand Young Nationals Executive, information technology and
communications.


2. The New Zealand labor party:
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand labor party is the longest established
political party in the country. It was formed in 1916 on the basis
of broad industrial support and is now the major opposition party
with Helen Clark as its leader.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Labor Party is a member of Socialist
International.
</P>
<P>
The party to power in 1935 for the first time. It ruled the
country from 1935 to 1949, 1957-1960, 1972-1975 and 1984-1990.
</P>
<P>
In December 1993, Helen Clark replaced Mike Moore as leader of
the party.
</P>
<P>
Pursuing a central-left line, the party states that it accepts
the democratic socialist principles and all people should have
equal access to all social, economic, cultural, political and
legal spheres, regardless of wealth or social position, and
advocates an organized economy guaranteeing an adequate standard
of living to every person able and willing to work.
</P>
<P>
The party is divided into six regional areas, which each year
convene a regional conference. Policy and other matters are
debated and passed onto the annual conference (AC) of the party.
The AC is the supreme governing body of the party when it is in
session.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Council is the governing body of the party. It
consists of President, two senior vice-presidents (one Maori),
three vice-presidents (women, affiliates, Pacific islands), seven
regional representatives, one policy council representative, three
caucus representatives and the general secretary.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Electorate Committee is responsible for party
organization in the electorate.
</P>
<P>
The party claims to have more than 100,000 members and it's
leader is Helen Clark.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Factsheet (7) -- Key Political Forces 3. ACT New Zealand: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACT New Zealand, which was founded in 1994, is led by Richard
Prebble. The party claims it is a "liberal progressive
center-right party which believes that New Zealanders can make
better choices for themselves and their families than any
politician can."
</P>
<P>
ACT says it believes the key to New Zealand's success is hard
work, thrift and individual responsibility. Its policies are
designed to reward those values, not punish them.
</P>
<P>
ACT's policy objectives are "a prosperous, well-educated,
healthy, and open society in which individuals are free to achieve
their full potential; a growing, dynamic, and open economy, in
which individual choice is paramount; social policy that promotes
and rewards hard work, enterprise, thrift, and personal
responsibility; and a standard of living, and quality of life,
that is the envy of the world."


4. The Alliance Party
</P>
<P>
The Alliance Party, which was formed in 1991, is led by Jim
Anderton. The party with 25,000 members is a center-left
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The party claims it is working "for a fresh new approach to
political leadership, committed to a fairer society and the
protection of our natural environment."
</P>
<P>
It says it believes governments should be socially responsible.
"We want free health care, free education, affordable housing and
security in retirement, paid from fair, progressive taxes."
</P>
<P>
The Alliance holds that control of New Zealand's strategic
assets and infrastructure should be in the hands of New
Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance is aiming to form a visionary, principled
government that is accountable and representative.

 5. New Zealand First Party
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First Party was formed in 1993 by former National
Party members, with Winston Peters as its leader. The party claims
it represents the views of all New Zealanders concerned about the
economic and social direction of New Zealand, the sale of public
assets to foreign control, and the decline in employment and
social services.
</P>
<P>
The party says it believes that New Zealanders are entitled to
a political system they can feel confident about, and politicians
they can rely on to represent them; New Zealand needs a clear
strategy aimed at boosting export growth and employment and an end
to aimless restructuring of government services; and the principal
aim of a government should be full employment.
</P>
<P>
It says that "Any person capable of work should be given the
opportunity to do so and not relegated to welfare dependency."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's State Press and
Publication Administration will strictly administer publications,
outlawing Sino-overseas jointly-funded or cooperative businesses
to engage in distribution and wholesale trade.
</P>
<P>
In the latest regulation on publications, the administration
stipulates that general distributors, with minimum funds of 10
million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars), must be under
authorization of the state.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned or collective businesses with more than 500,000
yuan worth of funds could conduct wholesale trade.
</P>
<P>
Businesses or individuals having more than 100,000 yuan,
including Sino-overseas jointly-funded or cooperative ones, could
engage in retail transactions and distribution, the regulation
said.
</P>
<P>
Without authorization for publication distribution or wholesale
business, no enterprise may run online bookstores or carry out
other on-line trade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state will severely punish violators who
publish illegal or pirated publications.
</P>
<P>
Except for designated businesses, no one may distribute
textbooks, important political documents or works of state leaders,
the regulation said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 2,000 newspapers and
nearly 8,000 periodicals, as well as 560 publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
In the thriving electronic publication markets, 64 such
publishing houses have generated output valued at several billion
yuan.

<P>
Les Echos:
</P>
<P>
-- Days from the opening of the ministerial conference of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, the French government
is faced with criticism from both the left and right political
parties. The Communist Party, the Greens and Citizen's Movement

globalization," while the right-wing Rally for France, led by
Charles Pasqua, puts the fight against the WTO on top of its
agenda.
</P>
<P>

undeniable. By announcing a 1 percent growth of gross domestic
product (GDP) in the third quarter this year, the official
economics and statistics study institute INSEE estimated on
Thursday the annual GDP growth of the country at 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Corsican separatists committed two bombing attacks on
Thursday in Ajaccio, capital of Corsica, slightly injuring six
people. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin promised to "bring
back to reason" the men held responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish government is hesitating to implement the death
penalty for Kurdish rebel leader Abdallah Ocalan, which was
confirmed on Thursday by the country's supreme court.

<HEADLINE> Few More Survivors Expected from Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Although rescue efforts are
still ongoing to find passengers and crew from Wednesday's
shipwreck near the eastern coastal city of Yantai, medical workers
believe that few more people could survive the icy waters.
</P>
<P>
At present, ten ships and two helicopters are involved in the
rescue work, according to Shao Guangbao, a dispatcher from the
Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Dashun, carrying 262 passengers and 40 crew, sank at
about 11:50 p.m. Wednesday in gale-force winds and huge waves.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow and powerful gales have further complicated the
rescue work. According to a meteorological report, the snowfall in
that location reached 15 centimeters between last night and today,
and a snow storm has been forecast.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that three or four life preservers from the
sunken ship have been salvaged. According to a number of local
farmers who volunteered assistance, the 93 victims they found all
wore life jackets.
</P>
<P>
One local source said that rescue workers might enter the
sunken ship to look for more of the victims.
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that 22 people have been rescued alive,
with 118 reported dead and the rest still missing.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Senior Minister Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Friday appointed former rector Basri Hasanuddin
to replace Hamzah Haz as Coordinating Minister of Social Welfare
and Poverty Eradication.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah Haz, who is also Chairman of the United Development
Party (PPP), had resigned earlier. But so far there were no
details on the reasons behind the resignation available.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made the announcement of the replacement on Friday
afternoon just hours after his return home from the Middle East
tour.
</P>
<P>
The replacement, however, was surprising as Hamzah had just
spent one month in his office.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of The Peoples Consultative Assembly (MPR) said that he
was surprised by the decision.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would meet the president to make clear on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Based on previous rumors, Wahid would replace his three cabinet
members allegedly involved in a corruption case. But the president
gave no names of the cabinet members who might be dismissed.

with the key Nikkei index renewing a closing high for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 192.72 points, or 1.03

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Moves to Reactivate Sleepy Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The new leadership of the
Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE), Lebanon's only stock bourse, is
considering a series of measures to navigate the sleepy market
out of recession.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star Friday quoted Fadi Khalaf, the BSE president, as
saying that the new board would not tolerate insider trading and
would improve the flow of information about listed companies'
financial results, strategies and dividend policies.
</P>
<P>
"The more transparency there is, the more investors in the
stock market will be aware of where they are putting their
money," Khalaf said.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed the BSE president to take the place his
predecessor Gabriel Sehnaoui early this month.
</P>
<P>
Stocks listed in Beirut fell 28 percent in 1998 and have lost
more than 30 percent so far this year, pulling total market
capitalization down to about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Daily trading volume has fallen as low as 5,000 shares in
recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
Khalaf said his board will upgrade technical measures to make
the Beirut exchange more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trading system from a single daily
price-fixing will be changed to multiple daily fixings and then
continuous trading.
</P>
<P>
He also plans to forge closer links with other Arab stock
exchanges, which he said could involve information sharing,
brokers dealing between markets, and perhaps eventually
cross-listings of stocks from one country on the exchange of
another.
</P>
<P>
The BSE reopened in 1996 after the country's 1975-1990 civil
war. A total of 12 companies, mostly banks, are currently listed
on the bourse.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom to Launch Whole-Network On-Line Test for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom, the largest
telecom company in China, plans to carry out a whole-network on-
line test for Y2K glitches from 10 p.m. November 27 to 1 a.m.
November 28.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time China has tried this sort of on-line
troubleshooting.
</P>
<P>
The telephone network, transmission network, data
telecommunication network and business operation system will be
tested, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Though the testing will cover the entire telecom network, the
official promised that the testing will not hinder regular telecom
business, noting not all of the equipment will be tested and
should emergencies arise, back-up equipment will guarantee the
regular operation of telecommunication business.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom also invited some key data users, consumers using
special networks, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and foreign
telecom operators to join the testing, noted the official.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom has paid close attention to the Y2K problem and
set up a special task force for the situation in 1998. It launched
a large-scale check on the whole network in April, 1998, and
system upgrading and modifications were done afterwards.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this June, the equipment modification on the
whole network had been basically completed, said the official.

KAMPALA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, the appointed chairman of all regional summits on
Burundi, has invited nine regional leaders to Arusha, Tanzania, to
discuss the peace process in Burundi on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Those invited are the heads of state or government of Burundi,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main points on the agenda of the summit will be the
 appointment of a new mediator following the death in October of
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere," Presidential Press
Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua Friday morning in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
"The one-day summit will surely push forward the peace process

<P>
Peace talks for Burundi began in Arusha in 1998 under Nyerere's
 mediation, involving negotiations between the Bujumbura
government, dominated by the Tutsi minority, and a variety of Hutu
opposition groups, some of whom took up arms in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 200,000 people have been killed and some
1.1 million displaced as a result of the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Troop Rotation Ends for PLA Hong Kong Garrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A fleet of three military
warships, including a missile escort vessel, a landing ship and a
patrol boat, started the arrival of vessels at the Stonecutters
Island Naval Base, Hong Kong, at 11:10 Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Almost an hour later, three naval vessels that had served in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) since November
25, 1998, headed northward to Shenzhen, China's Guangdong Province,
marking the end of a new military rotation for the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This was the second normal troop rotation of the PLA Hong Kong
Garrison since it assumed Hong Kong's defense responsibility on
July 1, 1997. The first rotation took place on November 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rotation was carried out at the order of the Central
Military Commission and in accordance with the Garrison Law of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which stipulates a
personnel rotation system for garrison troops.
</P>
<P>
"The personnel rotation is to enhance the troops' quality, "
major general Wang Yufa, PLA Hong Kong Garrison's political
commissar, addressed the departing and newly-arriving military
forces.
</P>
<P>
Wang described the Garrison's duty in Hong Kong as a "sacred
mission" and called on officers and soldiers to place their duty
above everything and do their best to maintain Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The rotation, which involves part of the ground, navy and air
forces of the garrison, started from the early morning of November
26 and ended at noon.
</P>
<P>
Escorted by local police on motorcycles, a convoy of military
vehicles rolled across the Lok Ma Chau check point into Hong Kong
at 00:05 Friday, marking the start of ground troop rotation.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of grass-green trucks, jeeps and armored vehicles
carried PLA officers and soldiers to barracks before those who
finished their one-year duty made their farewells to Hong Kong for
destinations in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
At 9:18, six military helicopters landed at the Skek Kong
Barracks before the six stationed in Hong Kong made their way for
Guangzhou 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Officers and soldiers, whether in or out of Hong Kong, were
encouraged to fulfill the defense responsibility for the HKSAR and
make contributions to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Hou Quanlin, a navy lieutenant commander who was to leave Hong
Kong during this year's troop rotation, said he was proud that he
has fully fulfilled his duty in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong people are warm and welcoming to us, and they
are satisfied with our work," Hou said, adding that during his two-
year stay in Hong Kong, he had witnessed the deepening
understanding between the PLA troops and Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"Our successors will also be capable of fulfilling their
mission." he believed.

HELSINKI -- Mindful that Ukraine cannot meet the conditions for

However, Ukraine will seek to become an associate member of the
organization before obtaining a full membership, Tkachenko,
chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, told Finnish reporters

has reached to such a great extent that it is hard for Ukraine to
find a place for itself in the process. With the EU's expansion

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Horticulture in High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's horticultural industry
(flowers, fruits and vegetables) has grown by 80 percent in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released at a seminar held in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi Thursday show that the sector's export earnings in 1994
was 8.3 billion shillings and rose to 14.94 billion
shillings(some 250 million U.S. dollars) ) in 1998, with an
average of 20 percent growth per year.
</P>
<P>
Peter Muthoka, Chief Executive of Kenya's Export Promotion
Council, told the seminar that the improvement could be
maintained by strengthening self- regulation codes of practice
within the industry and the use of up-to-date technologies.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture is among the most important earners of foreign
exchanges for Kenya, along with tea, coffee and tourism, and 92
percent of horticultural products is exported to the European
Community.
</P>
<P>
Mark Okando, operations manager of the Horticultural Crops
Development Authority, said that floriculture had experienced the
highest growth compared with fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
He said the land under flower cultivation in the country had
risen from1, 204 hectares in 1994 to 1,615 in 1998, adding that
Kenya ranks third among the world's flower producers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are over 40 types of flowers under production
with roses being dominant, more than 51 percent of flowers by
volume and value, Okando added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Export Growth Remains Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's export growth remains
robust this year with the total earnings in the first 11 months
rising 20.1 percent year-on-year to 10.23 billion U.S. dollars,
local business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's export performance in November alone showed a
good jump of 28.2 percent to 1 billion U.S. dollars from October,
according to a report of Vietnam's General Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's imports in November also rose 26 percent from the
previous month to 1.07 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statistics body also forecast that Vietnam's export value
for the full year would be around 11.25 billion U.S. dollars, a
rise of some 20 percent from the year earlier, and its trade
deficit is likely to dwindle to a mere 200 million U.S. dollars, a
drop of some 95 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's soaring exports are attributed to higher world prices
of crude oil in the second half of the year coupled with bigger
export volumes for almost all staple products of the country.
</P>
<P>
Exports items that are to see big increases in volumes this
year include rice, with 4.4 million tons expected for the full
year compared to 3.8 million tons last year, coffee with 445,000
tons, an increase of 17.4 percent, and textile and garments with
1.65 billion U.S. dollars worth, up by more than 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import spending for the full year is estimated
at less than 11.5 billion U.S. dollars, a slight drop from the
previous year's figure.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
soon begin a review of the Education Act to make it responsive to
changing demands in education and training, Minister Henry Kosgey
of Science and Technology has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted the minister as saying
that most of the courses offered in technical institutions were
irrelevant and had resulted in low students enrolment, leading to
a waste of funds.
</P>
<P>
He told a graduation ceremony of 515 students at the Kenya
Technical Teachers College here that public training institutions
needed to lay emphasis on efficient and cost effective modes of
operation in both management and training.
</P>
<P>
The traditional roles of institutional managers including the
Board of Governors, principals and teachers will undergo a
drastic transformation to give their institutions a totally new
outlook.
</P>
<P>
Kosgey challenged middle-level colleges to focus on income
generating activities that will involve both students and staff.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that this will generate income for each
college and reduce reliance on student fees or government grants,
and will also give those involved an opportunity to acquire
first-hand experience in market- oriented production and service
delivery.

<HEADLINE> Animated Film Producers Show Interest in China's Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 120 animated film
companies both at home and abroad have attended the ongoing Kids
World '99 Exhibition in Beijing, and nearly 500 cartoon films have
been listed for trade, said organizers.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to introduce European culture into China, with Beijing,
the capital city, as a main focus. We are sure that China is a
market with great potential," said Shi Yansheng, Chinese manager
of the German EM.TV Merchandising AG, creator of Alice, a well-
known cartoon character. This is the second time the company has
participated in an animated film exhibition in China.
</P>
<P>
Cartoon filmmaking is a high-cost industry, yet China will
surely attract more top companies in the field if it can make
substantial progress in the anti-piracy fight, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The popular "Twipsy" is now shown on China Central Television (
CCTV).
</P>
<P>
And Chinese-made feature-length "Lotus Lantern," which
premiered on July 30 this year, has been a great success, with box
office income in the past three months reaching 2.5 million yuan (
300,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"China will have a hard time developing a market-oriented
cartoon film industry. But we are determined to set up China's own
cartoon group and create popular Chinese cartoon characters," said
Shen Qia, head of the development department of the Shanghai
Animation Film Studio, which produced "Lotus Lantern."

<HEADLINE> AIDS Declared National Disaster in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has declared HIV/AIDS a national disaster and announced
emergency measures aimed at controlling the scourge, the state-run
Kenya Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Thursday at the opening of a
legislators symposium in Mombasa, a port city in southeastern
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The measures announced by Moi include the establishment of a
National AIDS Control Council with sufficient emergency powers to
take on leadership in the coordination of a multi-sectoral AIDS
control program in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The council will operate at national, provincial, district and
community levels with the mandate to coordinate and supervise the
implementations of all AIDS activities in the country, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the council will also play a leadership role in the
advocacy and mobilization of resources for AIDS programs to ensure
cost-effectiveness and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Under these powers, Moi said, all chiefs and assistant chiefs
are instructed to mobilize all communities and constitute
committees of elders to discuss and come up with solutions to
cultural practices and beliefs that facilitate the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The president announced that AIDs awareness education will be
taught in all Kenyan schools and colleges from January 2000 in
order to prepare the children to face the challenges posed by the
scourge.
</P>
<P>
To protect young girls from infection by older men, Moi said
the age of consent, marriage and maturity should be harmonized to
18 years with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
It is now illegal for anyone to make any public pronouncements
of a cure or treatment without the formal authority of the
National AIDS Control Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also instructed the Ministry of Health to provide
free HIV tests in all public hospitals and major health centers.
</P>
<P>
Of Kenya's some 30 million population, about two millions of
them are infected with AIDS virus. Although over 700,000 Kenyans
have died of AIDS since its emergence over 14 years ago, the
number is rising quickly as 500 lives are lost every day.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenya's Ministry of Health, the country is losing
225 million shillings ( about three million U.S. dollars) daily
because of the deadly disease.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Moves to Reactivate Sleepy Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The new leadership of the
Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE), Lebanon's only stock bourse, is
considering a series of measures to navigate the sleepy market
out of recession.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star Friday quoted Fadi Khalaf, the BSE president, as
saying that the new board would not tolerate insider trading and
would improve the flow of information about listed companies'
financial results, strategies and dividend policies.
</P>
<P>
"The more transparency there is, the more investors in the
stock market will be aware of where they are putting their
money," Khalaf said.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed the BSE president to take the place his
predecessor Gabriel Sehnaoui early this month.
</P>
<P>
Stocks listed in Beirut fell 28 percent in 1998 and have lost
more than 30 percent so far this year, pulling total market
capitalization down to about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Daily trading volume has fallen as low as 5,000 shares in
recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
Khalaf said his board will upgrade technical measures to make
the Beirut exchange more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trading system from a single daily
price-fixing will be changed to multiple daily fixings and then
continuous trading.
</P>
<P>
He also plans to forge closer links with other Arab stock
exchanges, which he said could involve information sharing,
brokers dealing between markets, and perhaps eventually
cross-listings of stocks from one country on the exchange of
another.
</P>
<P>
The BSE reopened in 1996 after the country's 1975-1990 civil
war. A total of 12 companies, mostly banks, are currently listed
on the bourse.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Detroit Pistons kept
their winning streak to four games by beating the Indiana Pacers
107-99 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Stackhouse scored 26 points, a season-high nine rebounds
and six assists as the Pistons outscored the perennial Eastern
Conference powers by 13 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Detroit (6-6) opened the season with four losses, but has won
six of eight since to reach the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 79-74 entering the fourth quarter, Stackhouse scored
four points for a 7-0 run that gave Detroit an 81-79 lead. After
Austin Croshere forged an 81-81 tie with a 17-footer, the Pistons
controlled the game and never looked behind.
</P>
<P>
"This was a great offensive and defensive effort, especially
late," said Detroit's Grant Hill who scored 22 points.
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits scored 23 points and Dale Davis added 21 for the
Pacers, who slipped to 6-6. Indiana, which has appeared in

<HEADLINE> White Cranes Threatened by Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts say that the
ecological environment around Poyang Lake, the country's largest
freshwater lake, needs to be improved to protect white cranes who
cannot find enough to eat in the area.
</P>
<P>
Heavy floods in 1998 and this year have destroyed much of grass
in the water which is the birds' main source of food.
</P>
<P>
They have called on the local government to take measures to
improve the lake's water quality to provide favorable conditions
for the growth of the grass.
</P>
<P>
There are only over 3,000 white cranes in the world and 98
percent of them migrate to Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province to
spend winter each year.
</P>
<P>
Floating grass in the lake decomposes when the water level
exceeds 9 meters because high water levels prevent the process of
photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the lake was 16 meters high during the 1998
flooding and 14 meters during this summer's floods.
</P>
<P>
An American expert has warned that food shortages will kill the
white cranes and reduce the birds' fertility.

<HEADLINE> Yan'an Helps Poor People Improve Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The living standards of the
people in Yan'an, one of China's revolutionary bases, on the
Loess Plateau in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, are now above
the poverty line, according to a recent government survey.
</P>
<P>
Despite a drought, Yan'an expects to harvest 700 million kg of
grain this year, and per capita grain consumption in the 13
counties in Yan'an will exceed 450 kg.
</P>
<P>
This was brought about by a diversified economy and a lessening
of soil erosion over the past 14 years, said one local agriculture
official.
</P>
<P>
As a State-listed poor area, Yan'an had an impoverished
population of 671,000 in 1985. To help them come out of poverty,
the local government at that time launched a program to develop
and diversify the local economy.
</P>
<P>
While developing grain production, the city also created a high-
grade apple orchard of 100,000 ha, and began growing tobacco on 2,
300 ha and potato on 46,600 ha, along with raising 2 million sheep.
</P>
<P>
The output value of these activities now accounts for two-
thirds of both the city's total agricultural output value and
farmers' annual net income, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The city also has created an industrial system with
petrochemicals as the mainstay, and the local government has
invested 93 million yuan so that all villages now have an access
to highways, electricity, and telephones.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Kills 2, Injures 8 in Southwestern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A bomb blast on Thursday night
killed two people and injured eight others in Ahvaz, Iran's
southwestern Khuzestan province, Tehran radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry said in a statement late
Thursday night that two of the injured were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
It said the bomb was planted by the Iran's outlawed Mujahidden
Khalq Organization (MKO) in front of the Literature Faculty of
Ahvaz's Chamran University.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that two MKO members, named as Akbar
Forouzandeh and Rasoul Musavi, were killed in armed clashes with
Iranian intelligence agents following the bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO was a strong political-military group
fighting against the Iranian shah regime before the Islamic
revolution in 1979, but it was outlawed in 1981 following sharp
political differences with the clergies in power.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, the group launched a series of
attacks, including bombing and assassination, against Iranian
interests inside and outside Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran labeled the MKO as a "terrorist" group and has repeatedly
urged the western countries to drop their assistance and refuge to
the MKO members.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Navy Foils Rebels' Smuggling of Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan navy has foiled
a Tamil rebels' attempt to smuggle in a huge quantity of medicine
and surgical equipment from India, media sources here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the navy Wednesday in the northern coast of
the country seized an Indian trawler carrying a huge quantity of
medicine and surgical equipment to the rebel Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The Indian fishing trawler carrying these items including
special bags used to collect blood and medicine needed to treat
their wounded fighters had been intercepted about three miles west
of Iranathivu Island on Wednesday evening, a navy headquarters
spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The navy patrol fired several warning shots to force the
trawler's crew to stop, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was evidence of the LTTE's continuing operations in
South India and some other countries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan navy has stepped up patrols off northeast coasts
to prevent the LTTE from ferrying wounded cadres to South India
and also to intercept boats carrying supplies, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who are fighting for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of the country, had been engaged in offensive
operations since the beginning of this month in the north of the
country. Several hundred rebels were killed or wounded in ongoing
battles in the Wanni region.

URUMQI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China, will invest 20 billion yuan to build 10
key water conservancy projects over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
They include the Bulunkou Water Control Project at the Gaizi
River, the Xiabandi water works at the Yarkant River, the Dashixia
Water Control Project at the upper reaches of the Aksu River, and
an all-round taming Project of the Tarim River Valley, said Liu
Geli, director of the Autonomous Regional River Valley Planning
Office.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 577 rivers but only 6 percent to 7 percent of the
water flow is now regulated, much lower than the national average
control rate. During the flood season in July and August, these
rivers spill their banks unchecked, and in spring or autumn there
is inadequate water for farm irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has built irrigation canals to a total length of
approximately 100,000 km during the past 15 years, improving the
efficiency of water use, said Zhang Yan, an official with the

<P>
CHENGDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province will create a tree belt along the banks of the Minjiang
River to protect the environment at the river's upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
Minjiang is a major tributary of the Yangtze River, China's
longest, and it now drains an area of 23,000 sq km formerly
covered by dense forest.
</P>
<P>
However, the ecological environment in the region has been
deteriorating as a result of excessive logging over the past
several decades.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government issued a ban on rampant and
indiscriminate logging last September, the region has planted
trees on 533,300 ha of hilly land and converted 1,300 ha of
farmland into forested areas.
</P>
<P>
These measures have helped increase forest cover in the region
by 20 percent, said Wang Shu'en, a local official in charge of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The central government will allocate some 100 million yuan
annually for afforestation at the upper reaches of the Minjiang
River, and trees will be planted on 166,000 ha of land over the
next 10 years. By 2010, all the barren hills along the Minjiang
River will be covered with greenery, Wang said.

saying.
</P>
<P>

YANGON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lt. Gen. Tin Oo
Thursday called for extending production of briquette, a kind of
wood substitute fuel, saying the broader use of such fuel will

<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Efforts are being greatly
stepped up to rescue passengers and crew from Wednesday's
shipwreck near the coastal city of Yantai in east China, as more
than 10,000 soldiers and civilians have been mobilized for rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
An investigation team was formally established by the State
Council, led by Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister in charge of the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders have given
their instructions for the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the investigation team say the ship Dashun,
carrying 262 passengers and 40 crew members, was forced to turn
back due to gale-force winds and huge waves on Wednesday afternoon
as it headed for the port of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The vessel sent out distress signals when flames were
discovered at 4:30 p.m. on the second deck.
</P>
<P>
About 12 fishing boats, rescue ships, and navy vessels were
dispatched for rescue efforts but none were able to approach the
Dashun because of the strong winds and high waves. The vessel sank
at about 11:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that 22 people have been rescued alive so
far, with 118 reported dead and the rest still missing.
</P>
<P>
The temperature is around zero degree in the area of the
disaster, and gales and heavy snow are making rescue operations

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine left parties in Nepal
have decided to start a nationwide agitation from November 30 to
protest price hikes in the country, the Kathmandu Post reported

BUDAPEST, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is largely ready to
face the year 2000 in terms of the Y2K computer bug, Mojzes Imre,
government commissioner responsible for the Y2K bug, said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Prime Minister's office, he
said the World Bank has provided 500,000 U.S. dollars to help
Hungary solve the Y2K bug problem.

<HEADLINE> Most Villages in Ningxia Have Access to Telephones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Most villages in the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China now have access to
telephones thanks to efforts by the local government to develop
the region's telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested some 442 million yuan (53.2
million U.S. dollars) during the past several years to lay optical
fiber cables and install telephone lines and networks in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 2,300 villages now have access to
telephones, with the plains areas equipped 100 percent and
mountain areas 82.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, in the 1960s, there were no more than 100 telephone
lines in the entire region, and the long-distance telephone lines
reached no farther than 100 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, telecommunications had been greatly
improved in these rural areas, but still only 955 out of some 2,
570 villages had access to telephones.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that poor telecommunications was one of the major
factors hindering the area's economic development, the autonomous
regional government has since made every effort to enable all
villages to have telephone access.

HELSINKI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Mindful that Ukraine cannot
meet the conditions for the European Union (EU) membership at the

visiting Ukrainian parliament speaker Alexandr Tkachenko said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Ukraine will seek to become an associate member of the

chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, told Finnish reporters
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the integration process of Western Europe has reached

European market's reshaping, Ukraine has fully recognized the
emergency of the situation.

<P>
On its way to access the European market, he said, Ukraine
faces many obstacles including inferior products and problems in
the industrial and agricultural sectors resulting from the decades-
long close bonds with the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Polls Tip Labor-led Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Labor Party
would end nine years in opposition on Saturday when the general
election is held, but it will need the Alliance and the Green
Party to form a coalition government, according to two public
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Friday quoted the latest and also the last polls
before the election as showing that the result of One Network
News-Colmar Brunton, with a 3.2 percent margin of error, showed
the Labor Party won a support rate of 39 percent, while the ruling
party, the National Party, only 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance, an ally of the Labor Party, got a support rate of
eight percent, while ACT New Zealand, a coalition partner of the
National Party, seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The Green Party, which may cooperate with the Labor Party, had
a support rate of six percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that the Labor Party and the Alliance, with 59
seats between them, would be short of a majority in the 120-seat
Parliament. They would need the eight Green MPs to govern.
</P>
<P>
The National Party, ACT and the United NZ, another ally of the
National Party, together held 49 seats, unable to form a
government even with the unlikely support of NZ First's four MPs.
</P>
<P>
The TV3/CM Research poll, with a 3.1 percent margin of error,
also showed that the Labor Party and the Alliance, with a combined
54 seats, would be reliant on the eight Green MPs. The National
Party, ACT and the United held only 52 seats and NZ First seven.
</P>
<P>
In the preferred prime minister stakes Labor Party Leader Helen
Clark was three percentage points ahead of National Party Leader
Jenny Shipley in both polls.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted Helen Clark as warning
that the election is "not in the bag yet," despite the two polls
putting her Labor Party well ahead of the National Party.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader still focused on the party's key election
promises including industry development, improvement in hospital
waiting lists, cutting student debt, income related rents for
state house tenants and more social spending.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-ROK Technology and
Commodity Exposition is scheduled for December 1-4 in this port
city in north China.
</P>
<P>
The exposition is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of
Science and Technology, the municipal government of Tianjin, the
China Science and Technology Exchange Center, and related
organizations from the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
More than 200 ROK business people from over 80 companies will
attend the exposition, demonstrating their products and technology
ranging from electric appliances, environmental equipment and
automotive devices to light textiles, bio-medicines, and food
processing.
</P>
<P>
The exposition is expected to be the largest of its kind for
ROK entrepreneurs in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 Chinese companies will take part in the show and people
from business and research circles in the cities of Beijing,
Qingdao and Weihai will be organized into groups to attend the

<P>
An official from a ROK association for promoting small business
said they expect the exposition to become an annual event.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Hopes to Reach WTO Agreement With China Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) hopes
to reach a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement with China as
soon as possible, Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Kimmo Sasi said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a delegation of China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, he said China and the United States inking a deal
on November 15 is a major step forward for China's final entry
into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The accord is particularly important for the EU, as the EU has
similar issues to discuss with China like the United States, said
Sasi, whose country currently holds a six-month EU rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Sasi said the EU believes that the Sino-U.S. accord will pave
the way for the EU and China to strike a deal on China's accession
to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The EU has all along supported China's WTO membership, he said,
adding that the WTO cannot exclude China with its 1.2 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
Once the EU gets the details of the Sino-U.S. agreement, it
will promptly send a delegation to Beijing to open talks with
China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Badr Wins Double Golds in Weightlifting Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GREECE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Saelem Nayef Badr won two gold
medals at the World Weightlifting Championships on Thursday,
awarding Qatar its first ever distinction in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Badr, who was born in Bulgaria, lifted 205 kgs in the clean-and-
jerk and totaled 370 kgs for the two gold medals in the men's 77-
kg category.
</P>
<P>
Badr is one of eight Bulgarian weightlifters recently given
Qatari passports and Arabic names, most of them were second-team
athletes, who had trouble earning a place in competition for
Bulgaria, a country which has no shortage of top-level lifters.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal reached earlier this year, those strongmen can no
longer compete for Bulgaria but still train there under their old
coach Ivan Abadjiev with his assistant Zlatan Ivanov appointed as
the Qatari national team coach.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Victor Mitrou won two silver medals in jerk and two-
lift total due to body weight.
</P>
<P>
The snath silver went to Khachatur Kyapakaktsyan of Armenia who
set a new world record by lifting 170.5 kgs, but lost Razvan Ilie
of Romania for the gold medal as Ilie conquered 170 kgs first.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pairs Impressive at Russian Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese skaters Shen Xue
and Zhao Hongbo displayed nearly flawless performance to stand
first after the short programs at the Cup of Russia Grand Prix
event at St.Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
The duo, who finished runners-up at Helsinki World
Championships early this year, landed triples in tandem and then
Shen was perfect in completing a triple from the throw of her
partner.
</P>
<P>
Russian Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov finished second
despite a fall during a tandem triple attempt. Ukraine's s Aljona
Savchenko and Stanislav Morozov placed third.
</P>
<P>
Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, the co-leaders in the
Grand Prix standings, were forced to withdraw after Pelletier came
down with a stomach ailment.
</P>
<P>
Russian dominated the singles as Irina Slutskaya excited the
crowds with her flair and exuberance to lead the women's short
programs competition.
</P>
<P>
Placing second was another Russian, Julia Soldatova, who edged
American Angela Nikodinov into third.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Plushenko made up for his technical faults with high
presentation marks to end up first after the men's short programs.
</P>
<P>
Russian Alexander Abt attempted one fewer triple than Plushenko
and lacked his compatriot's flair, leaving him in second position.
China's Guo Zhengxin was third after his technically sound but
colorless routines.
</P>
<P>
The first day of competition also saw the compulsory dance
segment of the ice dancing event, with all of the duos skating a
basic program with little variance to a Viennese waltz.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy stood first,
followed by Shae-Lynne Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada and
Poland's Silwia Nowak and Sebastian Kolasinski.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A mountain deer raised in the
Jinjiuling Zoo in southernmost China's island province of Hainan
has given birth to a male cub, the first successful breeding of
the endangered species in captive.
</P>
<P>
The animal, unique to this tropical island, has a slim and
graceful figure, and there are only about 800 of the deer left,
with some 500 living in the wild. This is less than the number of
extant giant pandas, said Lu Zejian of the zoo staff.
</P>
<P>
He said that young deer weighed only two kilograms at birth,
but has grow to four kilograms after 24 days of breast breeding by
the mother, and is now healthy.
</P>
<P>
The mountain deer is listed under first-class State protection,
after facing extinction in 1976 when there were only 26 left
because farmers hunted them. and an increasing human population
was taking over the deer's natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
But since a 133-hectare natural reserve was founded here in
1990 and another 22 forest reserves were set up later, the numbers
of many tropical creatures have grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that the mountain deer has now basically
escaped the threat of extinction.

SHENZHEN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen Customs in south
China's Guangdong Province, an important bulwark of the country's
anti-smuggling efforts, has confiscated 200 million yuan worth of
smuggled goods since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the smuggled goods were 14 million tons of refined oil,
10 million pirated compact and pornographic discs, and motor boats.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, is coveted by smugglers from
the inland and abroad as an ideal place for trafficking their
goods.
</P>
<P>
On October 2, customs police foiled a wine smuggling scheme.
There were 25,000 bottles of wine on board a towboat worth 1.9
million yuan, which had been shipped from Hong Kong for sale in
the inland. If the smuggling attempt had been successful, the
culprits would have evaded 1.05 million yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
So far, customs is employing over 200 police utilizing a 400-
ton guard vessel, two 200-ton vessels and 10 motor boats, and they
are stepping up cooperation with police in Hong Kong in their
fight against smugglers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Deploys 11,000 Policemen in Aceh Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- In anticipation of the
anniversary of the independence group Free Aceh Movement (GAM) on
December 4, more than 11,000 policemen has been deployed in
Indonesia's most-western province of Aceh, Antara news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In anticipation of the situation (ahead of the GAM
anniversary) and withdrawal of military (TNI) forces, we have sent
in about 11,000 personnel," National Police Chief General
Roesmanhadi said.
</P>
<P>
What might happen on December 4 was huge mobilization of
masses, the lowering of the national flag, attacks on military and
police posts or dormitories and state-owned company projects, he
was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
Separately, TNI Information Service Chief Maj. Gen. Sudradjat
said the TNI will not tolerate the lowering of the Indonesian
national flag in Aceh on December 4.
</P>
<P>
If the GAM takes down the Red-and-White and raises its own flag
instead, "the TNI will come, lower the GAM flag and raise the
Indonesian flag again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjat stressed that the TNI was ready to defend the
country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The TNI was waiting for a political decision from the national
leader, he said, adding that the country's sovereignty had now
actually already been sullied.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Gen.
Wiranto Thursday said that the government will give preference to
persuasive dialogues in its efforts to solve the Aceh problem
while bringing those guilty of human rights abuses in the province
to justice.
</P>
<P>
The dialogues would involve all layers of society in Aceh as
the government wanted to know aspirations, wishes and expectations
of all Acehnese, he was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
TNI Commander Admiral Widodo said military personnel in Aceh to
help the police protect vital objects only totaled about 814 men,
including one platoon of airforce personnel to guard air bases and
600 marines to guard the coasts.
</P>
<P>
Aceh, with a population of only 4.3 million, most of them
Muslim, has been demanding independence to separate from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In early November, more than one million Acehnese gathered in
Banda Aceh, capital of the province, to demand a referendum on the
rights of the people of that province to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
That was an impressive display of solidarity since the GAM
unilaterally declared independence on December 4, 1976.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Fails to Safeguard Security in Safety Zone: Yugoslav General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The latest attack on Yugoslav
policemen in the safety zone indicated that the international
peacekeeping force (KFOR) has failed to disarm ethnic Albanian
terrorists in Kosovo and guarantee security in the zone, a high-
ranking officer of the Yugoslav army said in Nis Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Serbian state television, General
Nebojssa Pavkovich, commander of the Yugoslav Third Group Army,
noted that under the military agreement signed in June between the
NATO-led international security force and the government of
Yugoslavia, neither Yugoslav nor KFOR troops are allowed to enter
the safety zone, a five-kilometer-wide area straddling the
boundary of the Republic of Serbia and the province of Kosovo.
Only Yugoslav police officers with light weapons are allowed to
patrol the area routinely.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian terrorists recently attacked Yugoslav police
patrols in Prepolac and Bujanovac, both within the safety zone,
killing two policemen and injuring many others. This was the first
such incident in the safety zone since the deployment of the
international force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Pavkovich said the ethnic Albanians' acts were designed to
provoke the police officers to violate the military agreement,
which would in turn lead to the change of the accord and the
enlargement of the KFOR involvement in the area.
</P>
<P>
The commander criticized the U.N. Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for failing to fully implement any
article of the U.N. Security Council's resolution on Kosovo since
it came to the Yugoslav province five months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Yugoslav troops are looking forward to
returning to Kosovo under the auspices of the United Nations,
which is the only fair and reasonable solution.
</P>
<P>
Western media reports said that attacks on Serbs in Kosovo by
ethnic Albanian terrorists take place almost daily in an organized
fashion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hungary Fencing
Association still hoped to reap three fencing medals in the 2000
Olympic Games although scores are expected to be lowered from
previous 30-32 points to 22-24 points.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Gemest Gyorrgy said on Thursday that the decision was
made after Hungary failed to secure its ticket for the men's team
competitions in the Olympics after the conclusion of the 99 World
Fencing Championships in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"It's surely an unpleasant decision," said Gyorrgy, "and we
must pay more attention to the young players in the clubs."
</P>
<P>
The world championships justified that competitions are much
more intense as different teams are narrowing their differences in
a rather quick manner.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Elderly Held in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 scholars and
experts from a dozen countries are here in Shanghai to work out a
better system for looking after the elderly in China.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that the aging population is a
comprehensive issue involving economic and social development and
population policy, and one that will exert an influence on all
aspects of development.
</P>
<P>
The only way to greet an aging society is to build a special
system for caring for seniors, they said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Cangping, honorary president of the China Society on
Geriatrics, proposed the creation of a service system for the aged.
</P>
<P>
R. J. Sluijs, an official of the Social Welfare Bureau of
Holland, related the experience of Holland in this field over the
past 50 years and offered proposals on services for the elderly of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
People at or above the age of 60 in Shanghai now constitute 18
percent of the city's population, and the aging population is
expected to peak by 2030, said Shi Derong, director of the
Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The city has a variety of facilities for seniors, and has
established a community service system over the past 20 years, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Christie Not to Defend his Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Olympic sprint hero Linford
Christie of Britain will not defend himself when the International
Amateur Athletic Federation challenges his acquittal on a doping
charge by UK Athletics.
</P>
<P>
Christie, who has retired from top-line athletics and has gone
on to launch a successful career as a children's TV presenter as
well as coaching aspiring athletes, believes he has nothing
further to prove.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics accepted his defence against a charge that a urine
sample taken from him in Germany last February contained
metabolites of the banned steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
His announcement came on the day when European champion
sprinter Doug Walker took what his lawyer described as the 'first
faltering step' to prevent the world body from over-turning his
acquittal on the same charge.
</P>
<P>
Christie's decision not to offer a defence is motivated as much
by its pointless for a 39-year-old athlete who has retired and has
no plans to compete again.
</P>
<P>
His business manager Sue Barrett told the Daily Mail: "As far
as Linford is concerned it's finished.
</P>
<P>
"If UK Athletics or anyone else doing a study into why these
test results are occurring wants his help or input, he would be
happy to be involved. But legally this is the end of it."
</P>
<P>
But UK Athletics chief executive David Moorcroft has urged
Christie to re-think his position.
</P>
<P>
Moorcroft said: "He has to consider the consequences. We would
urge that on him. OK, if he is finished with the sport it doesn't
matter as much to him but if he wants to continue coaching he may
find it awkward."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the IAAF said on Wednesday that Christie was
irrelevant to its process of arbitration. "This dispute is not
between the IAAF and Christie but between us and UK Athletics
because we believe it reached an erroneous decision," said IAAF
spokesman Giorgio Reineri.

LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- England defender Gareth

London to answer a Football Association misconduct charge.

<P>
Southgate was sent off by referee Jeff Winter for two bookable

made to the official.
</P>
<P>
But a FA spokeswoman revealed that Southgate had been handed a
5,000 pounds fine and warned as to his future conduct.
</P>

The FA disciplinary commission took into account Southgate's "
exceptionally good disciplinary record over the last five seasons"
and an apology from the player.

<HEADLINE>   Rice Turns Down Northern Ireland Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Arsenal assistant manager Pat Rice has turned down the chance
to become Northern Ireland's new coach.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that Rice, deputy to Arsene Wenger at Highbury,
was given the choice between a full-time and part-time role with
the team when he was interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Rice, 50, said: "I could never imagine leaving the fabulous job
that I have at Highbury but I told Arsene I had to speak to
Northern Ireland because it was an honour and a privilege to be
asked."
</P>
<P>
Belfast-born Rice won 49 caps for the Irish but moved to London
to join Arsenal as a teenager and was a member of their 1971
League and FA Cup Double-winning side.
</P>
<P>
He also played in five FA Cup finals and captained the 1979
Wembley winners. After a spell at Watford in Graham Taylor's
successful team of the 80s he returned to Highbury as youth coach
and reserve-team manager before stepping up to second-in-command
when Wenger took over three years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranked Andre Agassi beat
Gustavo Kuerten 6-4, 7-5 on Thursday and became the first player
to reach the seminfinals of the ATP Tour World Championship.
</P>
<P>
Agassi finished up the Red Group play with a perfect 3-0 record
and is yet to drop a set at the 3.6 million U.S. dollars
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Kuerten, ranked No. 3 in the world, was the first
player to break Agassi's serve in the tournament, but it counted
nothing before the American who had too much precision and power
for the former French Open champion.
</P>
<P>
The Red Group will be decided Friday, when Pete Sampras plays
Nicolas Lapentti. Kuerten, 1-2, could theoretically still advance.
Sampras is 1-1 and Lapentti is 0-2.
</P>
<P>
In the White Group, the field remains wide open.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Kiefer, who defeated Todd Martin 6-3, 6-2 Thursday,
chalked up a 1-1 record while Martin fell to 0-2.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 2 in the world, picked up his second
victory by outlasting Thomas Enqvist 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 to raise his
record to 2-0. The fourth-ranked Enqvist dropped to 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Because of the round-robin format, the group will be not
decided until Friday with all four still in the running for the
two semifinals places.
</P>
<P>
The season-ending tournament brings together the top eight
players in the world, who are split into two groups. The top two
from each pool advance to the last four.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Mediation System for Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia have recently
signed an agreement on setting up a mediation system to deal with
problems and disputes arising in border trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, mediation will be carried out when
any disputes occur in border trade, and arbitration will be
resorted to if mediation fails.
</P>
<P>
Border trade is becoming more frequent and trade volume
continues to grow. As a result, disputes have also increased, said
Li Yufang, head of the Harbin branch of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The new system, featuring voluntariness and confidentialness,
is different from law suits, will provide mediation by
professional organizations before arbitration, and will also
provide related legal services, including information and
consultation, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a mediation system in the past affected the growth
of the Sino-Russian border trade.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement in 1990 on this issue between the two
countries, all border trade disputes are to be handled by
arbitration organizations in the defendant's country.

<HEADLINE> Putin Thanks U.N. for Humanitarian Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Thursday thanked the United Nations for its readiness to
cooperate with Moscow to provide humanitarian aid to its North
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, the Russian prime minister described the work of U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata as positive, Putin's press
secretary Mikhail Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, for his part, confirmed the U.N.'s readiness to raise 16
million U.S. dollars in humanitarian aid for Russia's North
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
Agreement has been reached to purchase the bulk of the U.N. aid
materials for Russia rather than to import from abroad, Kozhukhov
said.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Putin reiterated Moscow's
eagerness to see the end of the anti-terrorist operation in
Chechnya, solve the Chechen problem by political means and do
everything possible to keep military and civilian casualties to a
minimum, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are in the thick of an offensive against
rebels in Chechnya. The military campaign was launched following
Chechen militants' armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and
a series of apartment blasts blamed on Chechen rebels. Over 300
people were killed in the explosions in Moscow and two other
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people have fled the fighting in Chechnya and
streamed into neighboring regions. Many of the refugees have
since returned to areas liberated by federal troops.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture: Difficult Part in Mexico-EU Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexican National
Agriculture and Livestock Council President Ramon Iriarte said in
Brussels Thursday that agriculture was the most complicated topic
in his country's negotiations with the European Union (EU) for a
free trade agreement, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the EU, after almost one year of negotiations, on
Wednesday announced the conclusion of an agreement in principle
for the signing of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which may become
effective in July next year.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture chapter has been a difficult part since the
beginning of the negotiations due to some asymmetries between the
two sides caused by EU subsidies to its agricultural exports and
Mexico's protection for its markets, the reports quoted Iriarte as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The FTA with the EU will promote Mexico's agricultural
development, especially for farming produce that can be cultivated
only in Mexico, said the council president.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mexico and EU have already liberalized some trade
areas, involving many agricultural produce, including fruit,
vegetables, coffee and some kinds of grains, said Iriarte.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that in two or three years, meat products, dairy
products and grains will be included in the list of tariff
elimination, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-Crime Campaign in Macao Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-crime campaign
has struck a hard blow to syndicated gang rings in Macao weeks
ahead of its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Since the crackdown began in May, south China's Guangdong
Province which borders Macao has arrested some 2,450 suspected
gang members, helping to infiltrate 83 gang rings in Macao,
according to police sources.
</P>
<P>
Police in Macao and Guangdong coordinated their efforts and
resources in investigating a rash of murder and other violent
crimes tied to inland regions.
</P>
<P>
For example, police in the city of Zhongshan arrested five
people suspected of robbing a major pawnshop in Macao on May 23.
They turned out to be part of a gang headed by Gao Jingguang who
confessed that he and his followers kidnapped a Macao resident on
June 23 and extorted 300,000 yuan in ransom. But after the ransom
was paid, they killed the hostage.
</P>
<P>
Police sent the information to their counterparts in Macao, who
rounded up the rest of the gang and retrieved the ransom money.
</P>
<P>
Police know that some of these underground gangs are well armed
with weapons such as sub-machine guns, posing a threat to Macao's
social stability.

ROME, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy asked Turkish authorities
Thursday not to carry out the death sentence passed against
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued Thursday night, Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini made
it plain that ignoring the pleas on Ocalan's behalf would place
Turkey's future membership of the European Union at risk.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the confirmation of the death penalty by the
Turkish judiciary, we ask, as we have already done repeatedly in
direct contacts, that the sentence not be carried out," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
While making their request, the prime minister and foreign
minister noted that capital punishment had not been applied in
Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Turkish government's decision to ask for
recognition as a full candidate for the Union, is made with the
knowledge that acts contrary to the principles of democracy would
not encourage the rapid achievement of European standards," the
statement added.

<P>
PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- France has refused to comment on
an accusation made Thursday evening by Yugoslavia that its secret
services plotted to kill President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The entourage of French President Jacques Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in London,
where they were attending a British-French summit, that the
government has "no comment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an anonymous French official told AFP that the
accusation was sheer "fantasies."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said that they arrested five agents of
the French secret services who were plotting to kill Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
All the five men were ethnic Serbs living in Yugoslavia and
were arrested in the past 10 days, according to reports from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic said at a press
conference that the assassination squad was code-named "spider"
and had planned four scenarios for killing Milosevic, including
using a sniper or mortar, a car bomb attack on the road which
Milosevic often uses, and storming Milosevic's residence by an
elite commando.
</P>
<P>
Matic said that all the five men were members of the French
secret services and their chief held a French passport.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Pledges to Strengthen Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman pledged Thursday to do all he can to strengthen
Sino-Israeli ties, which he described as "very important."
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to develop Sino-Israeli relations and I
personally guarantee that I'll do more than my best to strengthen
these relations," Weizman said at a welcome dinner at the
presidential residence he hosted in honor of Li Peng, chairman of
the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here earlier Thursday for an official good-will
visit at the invitation of the Israeli government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
Weizman noted that Li is the highest ranking Chinese leader to
visit Israel since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1992, when Li was China's premier. He called Li a
close friend of Israel and himself.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Li praised the Jewish people for the ancient
civilization they created and the outstanding contribution they
have made to the world.
</P>
<P>
He said it is admirable that after suffering almost 2000 years
of expulsion, the Jewish people have achieved prosperity under
miserable natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Although being far apart geographically, the Chinese and the
Jewish people have a long history of friendship, Li said. Some
Jewish people came to do business or stay in China as early as
more than 1300 years ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The long histories, glorious civilizations, similar
experiences and the shared will of strengthening cooperation have
laid a solid foundation for the deepening of mutual understanding
and friendship between our two nations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Practice has demonstrated that the development of Sino-Israeli
relations are not only in the fundamental interest of the two
peoples, but will also be beneficial to the world peace and
development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Both Weizman and Li toasted for the future of the Sino-Israeli
relations and the realization of a lasting peace between Israel
and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the fourth leg of Li's six-nation African-Asian tour,
which has taken him to Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya and will
also bring him to Palestine and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Hands Over Drug Trafficker to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Colombian
authorities extradited Thursday alleged drug trafficker Fernando
Florez Garmendia to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The alleged Venezuelan trafficker, nicknamed "El Gordo" (Fatty),
has been wanted in the United States for the remittance of 3.5
tons of cocaine. He was handed over to United States Drug
Enforcement Administration agents in the Eldorado airport of
Bogota, the Colombian capital.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana and the ministers of
justice and foreign affairs Wednesday night signed the extradition
order toward the United States after completing all the legal
procedures.
</P>
<P>
"El Gordo" is the second alleged drug trafficker extradited to
the United States recently to be tried for several crimes, such as
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Jaime Orlando Lara Nausa, indicted as the top heroin
trafficker, was deported last Sunday to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He appeared in a Manhattan federal court Monday and was ordered
held without bail.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50 others are on a list of relatively low profile drug
smugglers who could be extradited.
</P>
<P>
Colombia exports 80 percent of the world's cocaine and is a
rising heroine supplier to the U.S. market, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Colombia banned extradition in 1991, capitulating to a wave of
bombings and assassinations by the now-defunct Medellin drug
cartel and its notorious leader, Pablo Escobar. But Congress
scrapped the ban in late 1997 under intense U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials argue extradition is the only way to ensure
Colombian drug traffickers to receive stiff punishments for their
crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats here said the United States had its eyes on
the big prize -- Colombia's undisputed cocaine kings, the
Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, jailed heads of the notorious Cali
drug mob.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay National Radio Shot At </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police sources were quoted by reports as saying that the
bullets became embedded in the facade of the building and the
machines room, without causing damage to the personnel.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred one day after the workers of the radio
station started a 48-hour strike in protest against the dismissal
of two officials.
</P>
<P>
The employees labor union asked for the dismissal of the radio
director, and announced another strike for an indefinite period
starting on November 30.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan government denied Thursday rumors that there
could be changes in the Presidential Guard and in the military
cabinet of the Presidency of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
The political situation became tense since last Sunday, when 14
officers of the artillery corps were arrested, which caused the
anger of the military.
</P>
<P>
From that moment on rumors of a possible coup d'etat in that
country started to circulate. The country has been in a state of
turmoil since last March after the assassination of Vice President
Luis Maria Argana.
