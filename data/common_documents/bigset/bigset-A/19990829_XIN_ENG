</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Gail Devers of the Untied States won
the women's 100 meter hurdles gold medal at the 7th World Athletics
Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The American hurdler, winner of the event in 93 and 95 respectively,
was clocked 12.37 seconds to take the title.
</P>
<P>
Glory Alozie of Nigeria was second at 12.44 and defending champion
Ludmila Engquist of Sweden, who was disgnosed with breast cancer less
than six months ago, finished third at 12.47.
</P>
<P>
World indoor champion Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan was fourth at
12.51.
</P>
<P>
For Devers, it was the fifth gold she won at world championships. She
also won two Olympic titles and two world indoor champions in her honour
pocket.
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to attack the hurdles and I didn't want the 1992 to
come back again," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992, Devers stumbled and finished
out of the top three places.
</P>
<P>
"At the last two hurdles, it felt that I was too close to them, so I
had to back off a little bit. But I tried to attack the last hurdle. I
bumped it but I was determined to stay on my feet," she added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Talks Resumed on Prisoner Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators resumed talks Saturday night in an effort to clear
the last hurdle for the implementation of the U.S.-brokered
Wye interim accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad Sher met with
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to discuss the release
of Palestinian prisoners, the main issue preventing a break in
the eight-month-old impasse between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have said that they are hopeful that a deal
could be reached before a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright next week.
</P>
<P>
Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas, deputy to Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, briefed Albright Friday on the
latest progress on the Israeli-Palestinian talks on the
implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides achieved a major breakthrough in their talks
early this week, agreeing on a timetable for the two remaining
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank as stipulated in the
Wye agreement, which was signed and then frozen by Israel's
former hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel would restart the
timetable for the Wye accord in September and complete the two
troop withdrawals by mid-January, turning another 11 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But disputes remain on the issue of Palestinian prisoners,
which Abbas said is a very important issue for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release another 650
security prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activity. But
Israel insists that it would release only 500 prisoners and
would not free those with "blood on their hands."
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Saturday that the Palestinian side had asked
the United States to help resolve the prisoner issue, saying
the request for U.S. intervention was raised during his meeting
with Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright will visit Morocco, Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian
self-ruled areas, Jordan and Syria between September 1 and 5,
her first visit to the region since Barak took office last
month with a pledge to move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials have said that during
Albright's visit to Egypt, the two sides might sign an accord
on the implementation of the Wye accord and the launching of
permanent peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Albright took a cautious note Friday, saying that she could
not be sure that a deal would be ready for a signing ceremony in
Egypt next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Ali Juma said Saturday that money laundering can be effectively
curbed with joint efforts of different countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international meeting in the northern town of
Arusha, Juma said that regional coordination is the most powerful
strategy against the evil.
</P>
<P>
"The evil of money laundering ... is a serious threat to not
only economic reforms carried out by developing countries, but
also to the power of governments," he said in a written speech.
</P>
<P>
The speech was read on Juma's behalf by the Minister of State
in the Vice-President's Office, Edward Lowassa.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that the most compelling reason for
cooperation in fight against the evil is the fact that they share
common economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed to launch the Eastern and Southern
African Anti- Money Laundering Group, to be governed by ministers
of different countries, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which ended Saturday, has brought together justice
and finance ministers, attorney generals from various African
countries, as well as representatives from the Commonwealth
Secretariat and the United Nations.

<P>
Countries attending the meeting include Botswana, Kenya,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambconference of Commonwealth
finance ministers held last year in Ottawa, Canada, where Tanzania
offers to facilitate the establishment of an eastern and southern
group to coordinate anti-money laundering strategies.
</P>
<P>
The countries also agreed to cooperate with relevant
international organizations concerned with combating money
laundering.

<HEADLINE> UK Farming Facing Worst Crisis in Years: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- British agriculture is facing its
worst crisis in many years, a government minister said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
And some Britons say the plight of their farmers, hit by the
"mad cow" crisis, plummeting livestock prices and a high pound
sterling, is the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that we do have the worst crisis in
agriculture for many, many years," Environment Minister Michael
Meacher was quoted as saying. "I would like to see, on the
environmental side, an increase in agri-environment measures. That
will give a great deal of help to some of the farmers who are
worst affected."
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labour government was already pressing the European
Union to put more money into the agri-environment schemes, which
reward farmers for farming in a wildlife-friendly way or aid them
to convert to organic agriculture, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in British farming was highlighted this week when
farmers in north Wales dumped nearly 400 sheep at a Royal Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals centre, saying the collapse
in prices meant the animals were now worthless.
</P>
<P>
Just this month the European Union ended its three-year ban on
exports of beef from Britain over mad cow disease. But there are
still strict regulations on British beef exporters and farmers
worry that it is too late to recapture lost markets, according to
earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party Chairman Michael Ancram poured scorn on the
reaction from Agriculture Minister Nick Brown, who said this week
that the sheep market had been oversupplied for two years but that
farmers had reacted by breeding even more animals.
</P>
<P>
"The sheep industry is going to the wall and all Nick Brown
does yesterday is tell them to get their house in order. It's like
telling someone whose house is burning down to get the furniture
in the road before you call the fire brigade," Ancram told the
BBC.
</P>
<P>
Brown met agriculture officials from Wales on Friday and said
he would seek an increase in his budget. He was open to a proposal
to pay farmers to retire early, but said more subsidies for
farmers would have to be tied to industry restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Britain already spent 500 million pounds (793 million U.S.
dollars) a year on subsidies to the sheep sector alone.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a million British farmers marched on London 18
months ago to protest what they said was neglect of rural
interests. But they say the crisis has worsened since then,
Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
The Independent published on Saturday a survey showing that on
commodities ranging from beef and lamb to chickens, eggs, oilseed
rape, fruit and vegetables British farmers often were getting less
for their products than the cost of production.

</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuban long jumper Ivan Pedroso won the
men's long jump gold medal at the 7th World Athletics Championships here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pedroso, two-time world champion, flied 8.56 meters to take his third
consecutive gold medal at the championships.
</P>
<P>
Computer science student Yago Lamela of Spain had the silver at 8.40
and Gregor Cankar of Slovenia finished third at 8.36.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Pedroso is the first in history of the Championships to
get the title three times, overtaking American runner Carl Lewis ('83 and
'87) and American jumper Mike Powell ('91 and '93).
</P>
<P>
Lamela is on the verge to take his first world champion after he had a
jump of 8.34 meters in the first attempt. However, his leading status
was spoiled in the third round when Pedroso, gold medalist at 95 and 97
world championships, covered 8.56 meters.
</P>
<P>
Lamela, who had no jumps in the second and third round, improved his
mark to 8.40 in the fourth round, the longest distance he had tonight,
but it was still 16 centimeters less than his best performance of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard tried hard in his final attempt, in which he managed 8.39
meters.

<HEADLINE> 5 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Five Iraqi civilians were
injured on Saturday in U.S. and British air raids against some
civilian targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:35 (0635 GMT) nine formations of
U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian facilities in this
region and injured five civilians, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq's anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy
planes and repulsed them to their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes coming from Saudi bases also violated southern
Iraqi airspace in the day, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the
no-fly zones in Iraq have made more than 14,000 sorties over the
restricted zones, he said.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraqi targets, Iraq
began to fire at U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly
zones.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Ensure Economic Security for Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to make new efforts to
create better environment for "economic security" and much-needed
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed to by President Mohammad Khatami and new head
of the Judiciary Ayatollah Seyed Mahmoud Hashemi during their
meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Calling up the president, the Judiciary chief proposed the
formation of a committee comprising elite judges from the
judiciary and veteran experts from the executive to study the
ways and means and prepare the ground for accomplishment of
economic security.
</P>
<P>
Lack of economic security is one of the main reasons for the
decline in foreign investments in Iran, Hashemi pointed
out. Tehran has been striving to attract more foreign capital by
opening its industries and establishing special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Both the Judiciary chief and the president deemed economic
security vital to the country's effort to solve economic problems
and boost its flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The Khatami government, though still popular for its liberal
policies, has been criticized for its poor performance in
reversing the ailing economy, checking inflation and improving
people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
"Economic security and investment security are pre-conditions
for overcoming the economic problems of the country," Khatami
said. "The more transparent investment in the society, the closer
we would get to resolving our economic problems."
</P>
<P>
He said making economic profits should not be a taboo, but
abusing economy is a "counter-value" in the society.
</P>
<P>
Khatami welcomed the new Judiciary chief's proposal and called
for closer cooperation between the two branches in implementing
the country's third development plan, which envisages economic
growth, political, social and cultural developments in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi, believed to be a central, but conservative-prone
figure, has repeatedly promised to be more cooperative with the
government since he was appointed August 14 by the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He replaced Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, a hardliner blamed for
imprisoning liberal-minded reformists, closing down pro-Khatami
newspapers, and abusing judiciary power for factional
interests.

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The international consultative committee secretariat
for cotton has announced that the world stockpiles of cotton have
dropped by 40 percent.

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian exports to Ethiopia in the first six months
of this year have made tangible progress, reaching 7.17 million
dollars or 35.9 percent of a three-year export promotion plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan is carried out by the Egyptian Office in Addis Ababa
for the Promotion of Exports.
</P>
<P>
The Office manager Mohamed Nagi has attributed the tangible
progress to the rise in exports of car tires, lubricating oil for
cars and airplanes, medicine and appliance, foodstuffs, glasswares
and detergents.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The share of non-petroleum sectors in the gross
domestic product has grown by 6.1 percent each year in the
previous development plans, the Saudi Planning Ministry statistics
have showed.
</P>
<P>
The earnings from non-petroleum sectors have increased from
47.8 billion rials (12.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1969 to 211.2
billion rials (56.3 billion dollars) in 1984, and to 244.4 billion
rials (65 billion dollars) in 1997, the Arabic daily Al Hayat
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Canadian, British and Egyptian investors have set up a
425-million-dollar agro-industrial company in southwestern Egypt,
Al Akhbar daily reported on Saturday.

The foreign investors own 80 percent of the company, while the
Egyptian side owns the remaining 20 percent, Ahmed Khafaga,
representative of the Egyptian side, was quoted by Al Akhbar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The company will be based in Al-Owainat in southwestern Egypt,
Khafaga said.
</P>
<P>
The investors plan to reclaim 40,000 hectares of land and grow
cotton which will be processed in the company's mill for export,
he said, adding that the company will also build factories for
producing animal feed, baby food and will build an ostrich farm.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will take part in Lagos international fair
scheduled for November 5-14, the country's Middle East News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is also examining the possibility of organizing an
Egyptian products exhibition in the Nigerian capital, the news
agency quoted Alaa Khalil, chief of the Egyptian Trade
Representation Board as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Egypt's campaign to showcase its products
in Africa, making use of the potentials in the continent, Khalil
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual trade volume stands at about 6 million U.S.
dollars between Egypt and Nigeria, adding that the Egyptian Trade
Bureau in Lagos has drawn up a set of recommendations on
activating the trade exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Expected to Push Settlement of Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government on
Saturday said it is expecting U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to
reach a decision on whether to call for talks on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides Saturday said
President Glafcos Clerides and he will hold a number of meetings
in New York next month while attending the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We expect Annan to reach a decision as to whether he will
call for talks and when these will take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council resolution 1250 has requested the
Secretary-General to invite the leaders of the two sides to
negotiations in the fall.
</P>
<P>
It called upon them to give their "full support to such a
comprehensive negotiation, under the auspices of the Secretary
General" and to commit themselves to unconditional talks, with
all issues on the table and full consideration of relevant
U.N. resolutions and treaties.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to hold separate talks with President
Clerides and Turkish Cypriots leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Before his visit to New York on September 17, Clerides will
receive U.S. State Department Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas
Weston. British envoy for Cyprus, Sir David Hannay, is also
expected in New York to hold talks with Clerides, Kasoulides and
possibly Denktash.

others injured on Saturday in four road accidents in northern
Egypt, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A security source said the first accident took place on a
highway near the city of 10th of Ramadan between two buses
carrying employees of two companies in the city.
</P>

The two speeding buses collided when each of the drivers was
trying to overtake the other, killing one passenger and injuring
44 others. At least two of the injured were hospitalized in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The second accident happened on the Agricultural Road in the
Nile Delta between a car and a truck. A tire of the car blew up

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Agriculture Ministry on
Saturday accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding a
number of its agricultural contracts for the purchases of
requirements for breeding chickens.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said in a statement
carried by the Iraqi News Agency that U.S. and British
representatives in the Sanctions Committee are responsible for
blocking those contracts signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that those contracts include two contracts
for the purchase of veterinary medicine, seven contracts for the
import of cold storage trucks, three contracts for the purchase
of electricity generators and some contracts for the purchase of
chicken feed.
</P>
<P>
He said the impediment of those contracts came at a time
when Iraq's animal wealth is being exposed to the dangers of
shortages of vaccines and other veterinary requirements and hot
weather.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry had received contracted pesticide
and agricultural protection requirements that account for only 10
percent of the actual needs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that while plant diseases and insect
pests are rampant in 50-80 percent of agricultural areas, Iraqi
planes are not allowed to fly over these areas to spray
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S.-led western allies
imposed the no-fly zones over the north and south of Iraq
where Iraqi planes are forbidden to fly over.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones
have been attacking Iraqi military and civil targets since last
December's airstrikes against Iraq, causing severe civilian
casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase, Iraq
is allowed to export limited amount of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the
amount of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to
5.2 billion dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three
phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in
the Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Ministry announced earlier this month that a
total of 457 of its contracts worth 756 million U.S. dollars
signed under the fifth phase of the oil-for-food deal are
still blocked by the Sanctions Committee.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Canada: Best Most Likely to Leave for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's PhD students are eight
times more likely than average graduates to move south to the
United States for better job opportunities, according to the
latest information from Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported a loss of 360 PhDs out of the 2,985
graduated since 1995 to the United States, a proportion of 12
percent, Canadian media quoted the agency as reporting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
That was eight times higher than a brain drain of average
graduates of 1.5 percent, representing 4,600 out of the 300,000
cohort of 1995 moving to the U.S., according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of those who went to the U.S. were either
nurses or doctors, to be followed by engineers and computer
specialists.
</P>
<P>
Of the expatriates, about 44 percent ranked themselves in the
top 10 percent of their class academically.
</P>
<P>
The cause behind the exodus is said to be more linked to good
salaries than lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
On average, the ones with BAs earned the equivalent of 47,400
Canadian dollars (31,839 U.S. dollars) in the U.S., compared with
38,400 Canadian dollars (about 25,793 U.S. dollars), the agency
said, adding many now earn as much as 20,000 Canadian dollars
(13,434 U.S. dollars) more than their Canadian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada also reported the return of 18 percent of the
graduates moving to the U.S. in 1995. Most returned to advance
their career or for personal reasons, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Bans Asylum Marches in Dover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government Saturday
banned all marches relating to asylum seekers in the southeast
port city of Dover following recent violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw approved a three-month ban on marches
imposed by the Dover District Council. The ban also gives police
powers to impose conditions on any form of public assembly.
</P>
<P>
About 800 asylum-seekers are staying in hostels in Dover. Local
authorities say they are mainly Kurds, Afghans and Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
There have been several eruptions of violence between local
residents and asylum seekers in recent weeks. Eleven people were
hurt two weeks ago in clashes between asylum-seekers and residents
in Dover, where hundreds of foreign refugees mingle uneasily with
the conservative town's 41,000 population.
</P>
<P>
Police called for the ban following reports that extreme
right-wing groups could be planning a rally in Dover to exploit
existing tensions.
</P>
<P>
The BBC radio quoted police sources as saying that around 14
National Front protesters had turned up in the town but left
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A National Front spokesman said the group had decided to call
off their march so as not to jeopardize their "partnership" with
the police but there were still plans for a future event on
September 18.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Home Office said a record number of
6,600 people applied for asylum in Britain in July, further
swelling a backlog of applications to over 80,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 1,000 people had been caught trying to sneak
into the country, many in the backs of lorries crossing on ferries
at Dover.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office has held talks with local authorities around
Britain to try to ease the pressure on the south by dispersing
some of the refugees around the country.

<P>
ATHENS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Saturday met briefly with his Macedonian counterpart,
Ljupco Georgievski, in the northern Greek town of Florina to
discuss ways of expanding bilateral economic and trade ties as
well as attaining peace and stability in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers were in Florina to attend an annual arts
festival held in nearby Prespes, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Simitis said that the two countries
were on very good terms, which, as neighbors, they should
maintain.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Macedonia could act as a paradigm
for relations between countries in the Balkans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the talks as "ideal," Georgievski said that recent
problems in the bilateral economic sector would very soon be
overcome, creating a framework for Greek companies to invest in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
For years, relations between Greece and Macedonia have been
strained with Greece objecting to its neighbor's use of the term
"Macedonia" in any form, saying that this implied claims to the
northern Greek province of the same name.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the two countries have tried hard to improve
their ties, especially in the fields of economy and trade.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Railway Department
is investigating Friday's derailment of a tanker car at Cornwall,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Six cars were plowing in chain into a steel stopper just before
11 a.m., when one of the cars rolled about 10 meters past the
stopper, spilling a massive amount of a flammable liquid near the
city's busiest streets, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of nearly 80,000 litres, the car outpoured a
chemical byproduct called recovered alcohol into a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were evacuated from a nearby mall and
businesses in fear of any ignition of the liquid. A blockade was
imposed in the accident area until 8 p.m. the media said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews dumped sand to create a temporary dike to stem
the chemical flow, but some of the non-toxic liquid has got into a
city storm sewer, according to the media.
</P>
<P>
One witness was quoted as saying the derailment was the fourth
in the past seven years in the area. She "called for that part of
the track to be closed down," the media said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Accused of Dragging Feet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union (Zanu) finds itself behind with its own exercise of
collecting views that may be incorporated in the new constitution,
President Robert Mugabe said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this at a special session of the ruling party's
central committee in capital Harare to examine and agree on the
salient points that the party wished to proffer toward the
formulation of a new constitution of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, and in the various provinces and urban areas,
 individuals not representing the party have expressed views that
are being interpreted as representative of the party's views in
those areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the central committee was being called
upon to examine the document that had been prepared for it by the
politburo's legal committee and submitted to the politburo for its
consideration.
</P>
<P>
He said the desired constitution should incorporate the valid
basis of governance, examine the recommendations against the
background of the old constitution and the experience of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The agreed proposals, he said, would be taken to the people in
the 10 provinces so they could be familiar with them before they
could appear before the commission.
</P>
<P>
Contradictory views from supporters should be referred back to
the Central Committee for examination before they could be
presented to the constitution commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sovereign right of the people of Zimbabwe to the ownership
of their land and natural resources must be stated emphatically,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the history of deprivation Zimbabweans suffered as
a result of British colonial and settler occupation entitled the
deprived people to be duly compensated.
</P>
<P>
The president accused several members of the ruling party's
politburo, the central committee and the provincial committees for
negative tendencies that had caused serious divisions and
animosities within the provinces.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth pace of the party's reorganization process has been
 adversely affected as factions and divisive cliques have
emerged," Mugabe pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Abel Anton Retains Men's Marathon Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Abel Anton retained the
men's marathon title with a time of two hours 13 minutes 36 seconds
in the 7th World Athletics Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anton became the first man in the world to get two consective
victories in marathon in the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Vincenzo Modica of Italy finished second in 2:14:03 and Nobuyuki
Sato of Japan won the bronze in four seconds 2:14:03.
</P>
<P>
"For me, winning in Seville is special, in a city where all
people give so much support," said the 37-year-old Anton, who was
also winner of the London marathon on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Anton shook off all the rivals to make a solo run in the final two
kilometers and took the win without any threat behind.
</P>
<P>
He then jogged a victory lap, waving a Spanish flag and greeted
by a sell-out boisterous home crowd of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great moment for me to arrive first in the stadium
in my own country and with my own people supporting me," Anton said.
"I again thank the crowd on the streets for their support."
</P>
<P>
The most grueling race of endurance and stanima, which covers 42
kilometers and 195 meters in Seville's steamy heat, was paced in its
first kilometers by Moroccan El Mostafa Damaoui, who escaped from the
group and took about one minute of advantage.
</P>
<P>
At the midpoint, Gert Thys of South African, the second world
all-time performer, made the definite selection and Anton, Japanese
Sato and Modica kept up with the leader.
</P>
<P>
Sato attacked strongly and took the first place from Damaoui at
26km and went ahead alone, with Kenya's Simon Biwott, Thys, Modica,
Anton and Protuguese Luis Novo forming the following group.
</P>
<P>
The decisive moment of the race arrived around 37km, when Anton
changed his rhythm and chased the Japanese, who was caught two
kilometers away from the stadium.
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult moment of the race was around 37km when I
passed the Italian and the Japanese," Anton said.
</P>
<P>
Modica said: "In the beginning, I was confident that the group
would catch the Moroccan. Kilometer after kilometer, I felt better
and better."
</P>
<P>
Sato's bronze was Japan's first medal in these championships. He
said: "I was in great shape before the race and thought over only of
the gold. I wanted to return to Japan to the top of the marathon
world."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I ran an aggressive race from the start and did
everthing I could to win and so I can only be satisfied with my
bronze here."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Promises Military Role in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Saturday once again committed his country to sending
peace-keeping troops to the Great Lakes region, according to a
report by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting Burundian President Pierre Buyoya, Mbeki
told reporters in Pretoria that he was awaiting recommendations by
the Joint Military Commission (JMC) before acting.
</P>
<P>
The JMC, under the auspices of the Organization of African
Unity, will come into operation once the rebel group in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Congolese Rally for
Democracy, put their signatures on a cease-fire agreement reached
in Zambian capital Lusaka on July 10.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in Burundi is going to be dependent on peace in the
DRC," Buyoya said. "The destabilization of the DRC means the
destabilization of Burundi and the region. That is why we stand
ready to support any efforts that are aimed at seeking a peaceful
settlement for the conflict in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
Burundi is one of the Great Lakes countries directly affected
by the fighting in the region. A Burundian rebel group, the Force
for the Defense of Democracy, was fighting along DRC President
Laurent Kabila's troops to topple Buyoya, the SABC said.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya asked Mbeki to intervene in the six-year-old civil war
in his country, adding that South Africa had the might to bring
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said peace is expected in the region by the end of the
year. "It is clear that progress is being made to find a solution
to a whole variety of matters."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he had been briefed by Buyoya on latest developments
in the broad peace talks underway among Burundian groups in
Arusha, Tanzania. Government, opposition and rebel delegations
began the negotiations in the northern Tanzanian town in June last
year in search for an end to the civil war, which has claimed more
than 200,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said it was important that South Africa increased its
contact "with all the various forces in Burundi... to encourage
them to participate fully, openly and in an honest and frank
manner in finding a solution."
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested that everything should be done to
assist the socio-economic recovery of Burundi," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya welcomed Mbeki's commitment and saluted him for his role
in the DRC peace process.

<HEADLINE> Devers Wins Women's 100m Hurdles Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Gail Devers of the Untied States
won the women's 100 meter hurdles gold medal at the 7th World
Athletics Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The American hurdler, winner of the event in19 93 and 1995
respectively, was clocked 12.37 seconds to take the title.
</P>
<P>
Glory Alozie of Nigeria was second at 12.44 and defending
champion Ludmila Engquist of Sweden, who was diagnosed with breast
cancer less than six months ago, finished third at 12.47.
</P>
<P>
World indoor champion Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan was fourth
at 12.51.
</P>
<P>
For Devers, it was the fifth gold she won at world
championships, putting her first on the all-time list ahead of
Jackie Joyner-Kersee. She also had two Olympic titles and two
world indoor champions in her honour pocket.
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to attack the hurdles and I didn't want the
1992 to come back again," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992, Devers stumbled and
finished out of top three places.
</P>
<P>
"At the last two hurdles, it felt that I was too close to them,
so I had to back off a little bit. But I tried to attack the last
hurdle. I bumped it but I was determined to stay on my feet," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Seconds after finishing the race, Devers hugged with Engquist,
celebrating the Swede's encouragement to take part in the
championships and won a medal.
</P>
<P>
"I was really proud of Ludmila that she came back and
accomplished what she did," Devers said. "Let everybody know if
you are believing in yourself, dreams do come true."
</P>
<P>
Bursting quickly from the blocks, Devers was first over the
first hurdle and pulled away throughout the race. Engquist got off
to a slow start and trailed badly for the first half of the race.
But she came on strongly in the final stages and was just beaten
for the silver by Alozie, who out-leaned her at the line.
</P>
<P>
Enquist's performance capped the most remarkable and
inspirational story of the championships.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-born Swede, 1991 and 1997 world champion and 1996
Olympic gold medalist, was diagnosed with breast cancer in March.
She had her right breast removed on April 21, and returned to
competition July 30, winning a race in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the championships, Engquist had to interrupt
her chemotherapy to get fit for Seville.
</P>
<P>
The Swede has continued to train through four chemotherapy
sessions. She is due to undergo the fifth of sixth rounds of
treatment next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before the championships, Engquist had said she only hoped to
reach the final. But she won all of her qualifying heats, in which
she clocked 12.50 in Friday's semifinals, equaling the second
fastest time of the year and establishing her as a gold contender
in the final.
</P>
<P>
"I am a little bit disappointed because I dreamt that I would
have gold medal. However, a medal is a wonderful thing for me to
have after all that I have been through with my illness," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit slow at the start, but it is still a good
performance. I did the Swedish national record," she added. "The
future is not looking that good for me. In September my medical
treatment will continue, but I'm very optimistic that I have
showed myself that I can run again."

<HEADLINE> Early Peace Impossible, Unionist Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) - A leading Ulster Unionist has
described the prospect of a political deal in Northern Ireland in
the next couple of months as "nil" in the light of recent IRA
actions.
</P>
<P>
John Taylor, deputy leader of the party, said his party should
consider cutting off all contact with Sinn Fein after five youths
were told to leave Northern Ireland or face being shot by IRA.
</P>
<P>
A local priest had passed the warning on to four teenagers and
a 20 year-old-man, all from the Dungannon area, on Friday night,
after he was contacted by two armed, masked men.
</P>
<P>
A review of the Good Friday Agreement, under the chairmanship
of US Senator George Mitchell, is due to begin in nine days, but
Taylor indicated he was against his party taking part.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, speaking on Inside Politics on BBC Radio Ulster, said:
"We must stop talking about an IRA ceasefire, the IRA are killing
people....and they are recommissioning their arms - so to talk
about an IRA ceasefire is a total nonsense."
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe such people have a place in democracy unless
they can say they are totally committed to a complete and
unambiguous ceasefire and that the war is over," he added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Fails to Shrug off FIVB World Grand Prix Curse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUXI, Southwestern Yunnan Province, August 29 (Xinhua) --
Brazil's last effort in this century to defend their title at the
World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix in an odd year failed here on
Sunday after they were whitewashed by Russians in the final.
</P>
<P>
A mysterious spell has haunted the Brazilian women
volleyballers for seven years. No one can explain the lasting
curse which has prevented them from winning the grand prix titles
in odd years since the Federation International De Volleyball (
FIVB) inaugurated the event in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians regularly won in each even year of 1994, 1996
and 1998, but they could never succeed in retaining its honors in
the next odd year. Brazilian head coach Bernardo Rezende and his
players had vowed to shake off the curse no later than the end of
this millennium. But they failed again on Sunday, the last chance
for them in the vanishing 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Fortune seemed take side with the defending champions Brazil in
a light that five persons including starting setter Elena
Vassilevskaia from Russian team were sick caused by a hurricane
which hit south eastern Asia earlier this week. And even more
mystery added to the story was that Cuba, the Olympic, world
championships and world cup title holders, was eliminated
unexpectedly in the early qualifying phrase of the one million U.S.
dollars Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
But the South Americans turned out even sicker then their
frustrated Russian opponents in the final. Brazilian Golden Left-
hand spiker Leila Barros was put on the bench for the rest of the
game by her coach after her poor performance in the first two sets
with reasons totally unknown.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol was delighted after his players
beat Brazil 25:23, 25:22 and 25:20. He told the press conference
after the final that: "First of all we are very happy. Last year,
as you know we lost to Brazil in the final of the grand Prix. This
year, we took a revenge. It conforms the great possibilities of
our team."
</P>
<P>
Neither Brazilian team head Bernardo Rezende nor any players
showed up in front of those journalists waiting for in the press
room.
</P>
<P>
In the match decided the third and fourth places, hosts China
beat Italy, who reached the top four finals for the first time, in
19:25, 25:20, 25:23 and 25:21.

JI'NAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China is investing heavily in the
construction of its rural power grids, with the aim of boosting
economic development in the vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18.1 billion yuan has been injected in the ambitious
program so far this year, said Lu Yanchang, deputy general manager
of the China State Power Corporation, today.
</P>
<P>
He told a national conference in this capital city of east
China's Shandong Province that the rural power projects will also
boost a number of related industries like building materials,
machinery, and telecommunications, since the construction work
means a demand for equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
Equipment orders have totaled 14 billion yuan (1.6 billion US
dollars) this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new power grids will significantly cut power losses and
lower the cost of electricity, which is expected to spur consumer
spending on TVs, washing machines, refrigerators, and other
household electrical appliances.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Domestic, Foreign Wholesale Trade Indices Trend Diametrically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's overall domestic
wholesale trade index in the second quarter fell by 3.4 percent
over the corresponding quarter of 1998 while the index of foreign
wholesale trade in the same quarter grew by 8.1 percent
year-on-year compared to a fall of 13.1 percent in the first
quarter this year, according to the data released Sunday by the
Singapore Department of Statistics (SDS).
</P>
<P>
Excluding petroleum, the domestic wholesale trade index slipped
by 2.5 percent while the index of foreign wholesale trade was
slightly higher by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main contributor to the decline in the domestic wholesale
trade index was the wholesaling of household equipment and
furniture, whose sale fell by 24.5 percent. Wholesale trade of
timber, paints and construction materials and general wholesale
trade moved lower by 7.6 percent and 7.7 percent respectively.
Petroleum and petroleum products recorded a drop of 6.4 percent in
sale.
</P>
<P>
The domestic wholesale categories that registered positive
growths were textiles, wearing apparel and personal effects (13.9
percent higher), electronic and electrical components (6.1 percent
higher), office equipment, computers and accessories (3.6 percent
higher) and food, beverages and tobacco (0.1 percent higher).
</P>
<P>
The foreign wholesale trade index rebounded strongly after
declining over the last six consecutive quarters since the fourth
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign wholesale trade of electronic and electrical
components, and petroleum and petroleum products contributed most
to the rise in the index, registering respective increases of 24.4
percent and 18.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Significant increases in overseas sales were also recorded in
timber, paints and construction materials (37.3 percent higher),
and office equipment, computers and accessories (24.2 percent
higher). However, overseas sales of household equipment and
furniture, food , beverages and tobacco, and textile, wearing
apparel and personal effects were lower by 31.6 percent, 24.5
percent and 17.6 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> SADC Reconstitutes Food Security Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Food Security Sectors in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) became the
development unit with effect from August to supervise the
reconstituted Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources (FANR)
cluster of sectors.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources Development
Unit, formerly Food Security, Technical and Administrative Unit,
said in a statement Sunday that this meant food security ceased to
be a sector and became a policy objective that cut across many
sectors and around which the reconstituted cluster of FANR sectors
would be anchored and developed.
</P>
<P>
For the past 19 years, food security in the SADC countries had
been coordinated by Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The unit said the move, made by the SADC Council of Ministers
in Mozambican capital Maputo in mid-August this year, was in line
with the SADC Food Security Strategy Framework adopted in 1997
which emphasized access and demand aspects of food security.
</P>
<P>
"By emphasizing on food access issues, the strategy broadens
the concept of food security further afield beyond agriculture and
food production. The strategy therefore defines poverty and
under-development as the root causes of food insecurity," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said all sectors of the economy had to play prominent roles
in order to resolve these challenges.
</P>
<P>
This brought to the forefront issues such as employment
generation, industrial growth, general economic growth and rural
development as concerns for food security.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and other sectors merged into one portfolio of
development strategies, taking into account relevant comparative
advantages aimed at elimination of poverty and economic
vulnerability, it said.
</P>
<P>
It was with this in mind that the sector had been elevated to
an FANR Development Unit.
</P>
<P>
The SADC is reported to have a shortfall of some 2.18 million
tons of maize in the 1999/2000 marketing year.

<HEADLINE> EDS-National Day Special Rule of Law: China's Past, Present and Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- While China's legislators have
been busily deliberating the draft proposal concerning revisions
to the personal income tax law, Chinese media have been saturated
with reports, discussions, and opinion polls regarding a
government program to tax interest on bank savings.
</P>
<P>
The general public's active participation together with the
work of the country's lawmakers in the Great Hall of the People
have become an important part of legislative procedure in China.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon indicates that the Chinese people are, unlike
ever before, attaching unprecedented attention to the law and rule
of law -- a concept that has never been important part of the
nation's tradition.
</P>
<P>
"Such an alteration of public attitude results from the country
's steadfast pursuit for democracy and rule of law in the past 50
years, especially after the chaotic 'Cultural Revolution' when the
legal system was totally destroyed," said Xie Zhaohua, a well-
known lawyer in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the Chinese started to build a comprehensive
legal system for the development of a market economy. The national
legislature so far has adopted 343 laws, and the State Council has
promulgated over 700 administrative regulations.
</P>
<P>
"By now, the lawless situation is gone and the legal system
consisting of constitutional, civil, administrative, criminal laws
can basically meet the country's operational needs," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
But during the "Cultural Revolution" (1966--1976), the
judiciary was defunct. Even Liu Shaoqi, then-president of the
state, could not save himself from being illegally persecuted.  (

<TEXT>
<P>
With the beginning of reform and opening up in late 1978, late
leader Deng Xiaoping, who also suffered a great deal during the "
Cultural Revolution", declared that democracy should be guaranteed
by a system and by laws, and that "the system and laws will not be
changed with shifting leaders and shifting viewpoints and the
attention span of the leaders."
</P>
<P>
It was then that China's legal system entered a new era. The
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress was empowered
to enact legislation, and decided to meet bi-monthly instead of
once a year as the NPC plenum does. Thus the legislation process
was dramatically quickened.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates that had been canceled during the "Cultural
Revolution" were rebuilt, and all the judiciary resumed operations.
They reinstated legal authority by re-trying more than 400,000
misjudged cases, and exonerated millions of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Democracy and law became part of people's daily life. With the
promulgation of the 1989 law on administrative procedures,
ordinary people in China were able for the first time to sue the
government and government officials. In the vast rural areas,
villagers now independently choose or dismiss their own village
chief through direct elections. Even a high school student can sue
his or her teacher according to law.

<HEADLINE> EDS-National Day Special China Tuning In Information Age (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
and, over the past 50 years, China's achievements have attracted
worldwide attention, with comprehensive national strength
increasing and earth-shaking changes taking place in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency will release about 20 articles on these
developments and provide the latest information on the nation's
economy. The first of the series was released on August 17. This
is the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Now that an increasing number of Chinese youngsters are sending
their regards to relatives and friends via mobile phones, e-mail,
and pagers, the elderly have learned to accept the new electronic
means of communication, even though they would rather read good
old-fashioned letters from the kids.
</P>
<P>
China's information industry is playing an increasingly
important role in the national economy and social development at a
time when the world has entered an information era.
</P>
<P>
The country's post and telecommunications sector not only makes
life easier for young people, but also is helpful to the old. For
example, Liu Ruixiang from Linhe, a small town in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, feels he may find justice following
the death of his second daughter who died in an unlicensed clinic.
</P>
<P>
After a year of complaining and seeking local help, Liu became
disillusioned with the conventional channels and finally went on-
line, visiting legal and media websites.
</P>
<P>
His plight caught the attention of some net-surfing reporters,
and on April 1999, his story got published by the Procuratorate
Daily under the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, a group of lawyers from Beijing arrived by
train to interview the old man, ready to provide legal help.

Statistics show that China now has about four million Internet
users, and the number is on a rapid rise.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the surge to booming sales of personal
computers and a higher regard for computer skills, viewed as vital
for career success in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
As major links in the information industry, posts and
telecommunications play an important role in all areas of people's
daily life.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the
total business volume of China's posts and telecommunications
amounted to more than 230 billion yuan (about 27.8 billion U.S.
dollars) annually, 940 times the figure in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
And in the 1990s, their business volume grew at an average
annual rate of 41 percent. Accordingly, telephone networks cover
all cities and 67 percent of villages. China now boasts 138
million telephones, ranking the second in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's mobile phone system links 38 countries and regions, and
is connected to more than 90 percent of Chinese cities and
counties with a record 23 million users.
</P>
<P>
The 27,000-kilometer Asia-Europe optical-fiber cable, which was
initiated by China, extends from Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, to Frankfort, Germany, running across 20
countries. It has grown into a major link between China and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"In 10 years' time, China will lead the world in posts and
telecommunications. And the sector will be able to meet various
demands of society," said an official at the Ministry of
Information Industry.

"Law has become an important part of people's life," said
former president of the All-China Association of Lawyers Ren
Jisheng. "People used to seek help from officials when they had
trouble or disputes, but today they come to lawyers."
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reform and opening up and the
establishment of a market economy, the Chinese Communist Party
proposed a goal of "governing the country according to law and
building a socialist country based on the rule of law" in 1997.
And in March of this year, that aspiration was put into the nation
's constitution.
</P>
<P>
With the pledge of the central government, the "rule of law"
campaign has been initiated in every corner of the country by
local governments. Officials from President Jiang Zemin to
township magistrates are attending symposiums and lectures on law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 250,000 government agencies and
large state-owned companies have their own legal counsels. The
lawyer is the most vied-for occupation among young people, with
more than 142,500 taking part in the bar examinations for attorney
's licenses last year.
</P>
<P>
However, 20 years' construction of China's legal system is not
enough to erase the feudal tradition that was in place for
thousands of years, according jurist Wang Jiafu, also a member of
the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of the law and legal supervision are still lax, and
judicial corruption and unfairness as well as the public's lack of
legal awareness are serious problems the country still faces and
is determined to solve, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He painted a picture of the rule of law in China that the world
one day will see, with an enlightened government, orderly and
sustained economic development, a moral and progressive society, a
happy life for the people, and long-term social stability.

<HEADLINE> China Steers Up to Fire at Asian Basketball Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUKUOKA, Japan, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Breaking from lackluster
efforts of the opening game, China found its firing power to crash
western Asian champions Syria 112-61 on Sunday, while defending
champions South Korea was upset by Lebanon 75-65 at the Olympic
qualifying competition.
</P>
<P>
China shrugged off the lethargy of their opening game on
Saturday when it beat Malaysia 54-41, the second lowest scoring
game of its 95 appearances at this championships, and proved its
undoubted domination in Asia with Sunday's easy win.
</P>
<P>
Veteran forward Hu Weidong scored 13 points in a 32-0 brilliant
run at the beginning of the game when China pulled away earlier in
the game.
</P>
<P>
West Asia champions Syria made their first field goal of the
day 11:45 into the game when Ousama Madani chipped in a lay-up to
make the score at 41-6. Syria scored the first four points on the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
"We're just playing the level as we should be," China's head
coach Jiang Xingquan said. "That's the kind of game we should have.
"
</P>
<P>
China had won the game before the half-time as power forward
Liu Yudong's basket extended the lead to 63-17 before the break.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi, who was scoreless in Saturday's game, shot eight
out of 11 to finish 21 points and grabbed rebounds for his first
all-out game.
</P>
<P>
CBA's Most Valuable Player Sun Jun shared the game-high 21
points after shot 4-7 from behind the arch and 4-5 in field.
China was 45% (10-22) in 3-points shooting area and 64% in field.
</P>
<P>
Madani led Syria on scoring with 18 points while Syria was
outrebounded 45-19 against the taller Chinese, who rounded up
group C with two wins.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions South Korea were stole the outside scoring
guns by Lebanese as they shot just 7-35 on the 3-pointer lines.
</P>
<P>
"It'a great victory, and the team work is the key factor (of
our win)," Lebanon's head coach Meneceur Miloud said. "We took
away the 3-pointers power from South Koreans."
</P>
<P>
But South Korea could avoid its arch-rival China in the round-
robin quarter-finals because of the loss as it will be bracketed
in group F with Japan if both Lebanon and South Korea win on
Monday. China is in group E of the second round.
</P>
<P>
Japan topped group B with the second-consecutive victory as it
thrashed Hong Kong of China 88-58, while group D is led by Chinese
Taipei, who edged off Saudi Arabia 92-78 in the day's closing
match.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's other matches: United Arab Emirates defeated
Philippines 95-81, Kuwait routed Thailand 113-80, while Uzbekistan
handed off Bahrain 62-47.

WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Capital flight is one of the most debilitating woes of
Russia's eight-year attempt to transform the centrally-planned
economy of the Soviet Union into a free market. About 100-150
billion U.S. dollars have fled abroad since 1992, according to
Russian and Western estimates.
</P>
<P>
-- The Irish Republican Army is secretly rearming with a deadly
arsenal including high-velocity sniper rifles, an article in the

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- While the United Nations is drafting a treaty that may lead
to a world-wide ban on DDT, public health professionals are
opposing the effort. The officials say DDT is necessary to stop
the spread of malaria, a disease that kills as many as 2.7 million
people each year, mostly children in poor, undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
-- After years of warnings and efforts to correct the problem,
the U.S. Defense Department's computer systems remain disturbingly
open to infiltration, according to a review by the General
Accounting Office.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Strongwoman Claims Three World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, CHINA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese strongwoman Li Zhuo
shattered three world records in the women's 48kg category and her
clean sweep overshadowed the men's 62kg class competition on the
first day at the 12th Asian Weightlifting Championships here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Li snatched 84 kilograms in her third attempt
to better the listed world mark by 0.5kg set by compatriot Liu
Xiuhua at the Asian Games last December 7 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"I came to here with a wish that is to break all the world
records of my category," Li said before the clean and jerk event.
</P>
<P>
The local fans cheered on when the determined Li jerked 113kg
in her second attempt and totaled 195kg which booked two new world
records on her credit.
</P>
<P>
Li, 1.52m, from Liaoning Province, eclipsed the previous jerk
world record 112.5kg and total mark 192.5kg both set by teammate
Li Xuezhao last April.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men's lifter Liao Weixiao, who topped the 56kg division
with a snatch of 122.5kg, failed in the clean and jerk and total
medal chasing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lifters claimed four out of six gold medals on
women's 48kg and men's 62kg class, with two left to the lifters
from Chinese Taipei. However, Chinese Taipei swept all six junior
titles on offer.
</P>
<P>
"My dreams became truth when I broke the world records," said
Li, who turned to weightlifting five years ago from sprint running.
</P>
<P>
"That would be great if I could participate the 2000 Olympics
Games in Sydney and fortunately win the titles," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The women's 53kg and men's 62kg competitions, which are
expected to rewrite several world records, will be staged tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh High Court Stays Central Bank's Directive to Local Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's High Court on Sunday
stayed till Monday the central bank's directive to the board of
directors of the United Commercial Bank Limited (UCBL) to refrain
from participating in the UCBL's management.
</P>
<P>
A High Court division also directed the Bangladesh Bank's
counsel Dr. Zahir to inform it of the bank's latest decision over
the UCBL on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The court's direction came following a prayer of the writ
petition filed by UCBL Chairman Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury and 10
directors, which challenged the Bangladesh Bank's letter in which
they were refrained from performing their functions in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank issued a letter upon the board of directors
of the UCBL, directing them to refrain from participating in the
management of the UCBL directly or indirectly until further orders
and appointing Mohiuddin Zahur Amin, a Bangladesh Bank executive
director, to perform all the powers and duties of the board of
directors of the UCBL.
</P>
<P>
The head office of the UCBL in the city's Motijheel commercial
area was sealed by police and put under police custody on Friday
as directed by Home Minister Mohammad Nasim following violence in
the bank's board of directors' meeting on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the home minister on Sunday instructed the Criminal
Investigation Department of police to investigate Thursday's
incident at the head office of the UCBL.
</P>
<P>
Panicked depositors reportedly have withdrawn heavily from UCBL
branches in the capital city and in southeastern Chittagong city,
the country's largest seaport.
</P>
<P>
The UCBL, a private bank, has 79 branches throughout the
country with a deposit of 11 billion taka (about 220 million U.S.
dollars) employing more than 2,500 people, according to UCBL
Chairman Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong urged Singaporeans to give up Singlish and speak
standard English as a way to attain his country's new goal to
become a first-world economy and a world-class home.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Marine Parade National Day Dinner this evening,
Goh proposed for an annual Speak Good English Campaign and
affirmed he has instructed the Ministry of Information and Arts to
launch the campaign next year.
</P>
<P>
He said it may take 10 to 15 years to raise the level of
English in Singapore, adding that at that time Singapore will be a
first-world economy and a world home and Singaporeans will speak a
world language in addition to their own mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that English is the lingua franca in such
developed countries as the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia, the
prime minister stressed that "English is important because it is
the language of commerce, science and technology and it enables us
to break out of our small geographical confines and reach out to
the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is a big advantage for us if we speak standard English and
can communicate and do business with millions of people around the
world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Goh called upon Singaporeans to improve the standard of their
spoken and written English and not go in the reverse direction
with Singlish or to use Singlish.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called for efforts to be made to create
an environment conducive for expanding the use of standard English
and decreasing the use of Singlish.

Since 1995, the government has bolstered its financial support
to the regions and has created favorable policies for some sectors,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the ministry allocated a total of 440
million yuan to 25 autonomous prefectures and 84 autonomous
counties, and provided 779 million yuan in loans for rural

regions for farm and pasture improvements and tree planting,
according to the ministry.

of 16.95 billion yuan into 257 ethnic counties to speed up their
poverty-relief efforts, it was revealed.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture ministry will continue to follow the central
government's policies to give additional aid to ethnic regions so
as to further promote the sound development of ethnic agriculture
and economy, Lu noted.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Investigates Arson Attempt Against Holy Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' police were fully
mobilized here Sunday at the order of President Glafcos Clerides
following an arson attempt at Hala Sultan Tekke in Cyprus' Larnaca
town.
</P>
<P>
Hala Sultan Tekke was built in memory of Umm Haram, an aunt of
the Prophet Mohammed, who is said to be buried in the shrine,
which is considered to be one of the most holiest Moslem sites.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported that the culprits
tried to set fire in four different places in the shrine.
Slight damage was reported mainly on the shrine's tapestry.
</P>
<P>
Justice and Public Order Minister Nicos Koshis and senior
police officials have visited the shrine to assess the damages
inflicted by the criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said the government
strongly condemns the act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides immediately ordered the full mobilization
of the Police to investigate the crime and to bring to justice
the culprits," Papapetrou said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Koshis said that "the government will not show any mercy"
against the culprits who left behind a leaflet with the printed
inscription "Pancyprian Organization of Cypriot Fighters".
</P>
<P>
The arson attempt was also condemned by political parties.
</P>
<P>
Parliament President Spyros Kyprianou said if it is
proved that the attempted arson was carried out by Greek
Cypriots, then it will be the "most treasonous act" against
Cyprus since the 1974 coup, engineered by the Greek junta.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Sarvodaya Movement
or All People's Prosperous Movement Sunday organized a massive
peace march and rally here to focus national attention on ending
the long ethnic war in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people from 10,000 villages from all parts of the
country participated in the peace march as part of a new
initiative to establish peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The marchers clad in white converged in the Colombo national
park after a two-kilometer meditational peace walk starting from
four locations in the city.
</P>
<P>
The walk was joined by religious dignitaries, political
leaders, representatives of peace organizations and voluntary
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old civil war between
the Sinhalese majority controlled government and Tamil minority
rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who demand a
separate homeland in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Several political and civil initiatives have been launched
recently to expedite the peace process. National Alliance for
Peace on Friday held a peace conference. About 500,000 signatures
for peace campaign were launched by the Center of Society and
Religion on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local business leaders have urged the government and the
opposition to reach consensus on a political solution by September
30. Then they can take the consensus to the LTTE leaders in
October to persuade the rebels back to the negotiation table.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said on Sunday that he supports a "great scientific and
democratic debate" on the government's nuclear power policy, after
the Greens have threatened to quit the left-wing majority over its
nuclear policy.
</P>
<P>
"As for the place of nuclear energy in the future, as for the
major question of renewing the park of nuclear centers, no
decision of this scale should be made without a great scientific
and democratic debate which will examine all the consequences,''
said Jospin during a meeting of the Socialist Party in La Rochelle
in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the French Greens, Minister of Management of
Territory and Environment Dominique Voynet, has called for a great
debate on the country's nuclear policy, after the Socialist
government has planned to renew a nuclear park near the France-
Germany border.

<HEADLINE> Nicol Wins Hong Kong Squash Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Peter Nicol of
Scotland made an easy work of world champion and beat top seed
Jonathon Power of Canada by winning the title in straight games in
the Hong Kong squash open final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Nicol, who finished runner-up to Power last
year in the event, beat injured defending champion 15-10,15-8, 15-
8 in 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"We know each other very well, and today I am in form and
controlled the game so well that always kept Power back in the
court," said Nicol, who surrendered the world top ranking to Power
in May.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was determined to get his world number one
ranking back from Power.
</P>
<P>
The match between the game's great two recorded two wins and
two loses this year.
</P>
<P>
Power was crowned by smashing Nicol to win the tournament last
year and went on to beat him in the final of the World Open in
Qatar last December.
</P>
<P>
Asked the reason of his defeat, the world top player Power said:
"My back is sore the whole week and I couldn't move freely and
quickly."
</P>
<P>
Nicol, though met strong resistance from Power at the beginning
of the three games, totally dominated the whole match with his
accuracy and power smashes and never gave his arch-rival any
chance to fight back.
</P>
<P>
Apart from world seven Derek Ryan of Ireland, all world top 16
sixteen seeds participate in the tournament, which is part of the
Professional Squash Association Tour.

ISLAMABAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Renewing call for stopping all
military assistance to Afghan factions, Pakistan Sunday again
denied its alleged involvement in the recent Afghan war, terming
it "baseless allegation."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, when talking to newsmen
here, asked the Afghan opposition to produce the "arrested
Pakistani soldiers" to back its claims, according to News Network
International, an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody knows that this is a baseless allegation. We
have no troops there," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister admitted that some Pakistani
volunteers stayed on in Afghanistan even after the Soviet troops
pulled out. "That one cannot deny. But of course their number is
relatively small."

<HEADLINE> Afghan Supreme Court Closes Osama Chapter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban's Chief Justice
Maulvi Noor Saqib said Sunday that the Taliban's Supreme Court has
closed the chapter of Osama bin Laden after no evidence had been
produced against the alleged terrorist.
</P>
<P>
"When Osama's issue emerged, we asked the world community to
provide evidence against him to the Supreme Court. We waited for a
long time, but no one could produce any evidence," Saqib was
quoted by the News Network International of Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We had extended the last date for more 10 days. Again no
person or country succeeded to provide any proof against Osama,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Later the Supreme Court decided to clear Osama of charges and
closed his chapter, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We would have to act under Islamic laws had we received any
complaint. It is a fact that there is no evidence against Osama,"
Saqib insisted.
</P>
<P>
Osama is accused by the United States of masterminding the
bombing on the U.S. embassies in eastern Africa last August and
tops the "most wanted ten" of FBI.
</P>
<P>
"In fact the United States is afraid of Osama. If any incident
happens in the world, the United States blames Osama for it. It is
the false notion of Americans to accuse Osama in every case," said
Saqib.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that when the Taliban announced that it would try
Osama and asked the world community for evidence, Washington told
the Taliban that they do not want trial of Osama in Afghanistan's
court and that he should be tried in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said Afghanistan is an independent country and it has the
right to implement its own laws.

<HEADLINE> Work to Recover Aircraft Wreckage Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Work is still going on Sunday
to remove the wreckage of the China-Airlines MD-11 aircraft at the
Hong Kong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The nose of the aircraft was separated from the main fuselage
in the morning, said Howard Eng, acting airport management
director of the Airport Authority (AA).
</P>
<P>
A further and much larger cut will be required through the main
fuselage behind the wing area, and work will continue until this
is completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The work of cutting a large passenger aircraft into three
pieces is extremely complex, difficult and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
Eng said that it is still not possible to give an accurate
prediction of when the south runway will re-open for normal flight
operations, as this is subject to the weather and completion of
the work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eng said workers were removing debris and other
detached parts of the aircraft in preparation for the actual
removal of the fuselage. Runway restoration work has been
completed, he said, noting that while the AA intended to re-open
the south runway as soon as possible, the airport was operating
smoothly with the use of the north runway.
</P>
<P>
The China-Airlines MD-11 aircraft crashed while landing last
Sunday, causing three deaths and many injuries.

<HEADLINE> Four Airlines Plan to Buy British Midland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Four of Europe's leading airlines
have expressed an interest in buying short-haul carrier British
Midland in a deal considered to value the company at up to one
billion pounds (1.6 billion U.S. dollars), according to the Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Lufthansa, Virgin, Air France and KLM had all
approached British Midland, the second biggest user of slots at
London's Heathrow airport and 40 percent owned by Scandinavian
Airline System SASD. CO.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited executives at British Midland as saying the
airline was not up for sale. It added that an attractive offer
from one of the suitors could prove tempting for part owner
Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a senior British Midland executive as confirming the
interest being shown in the company, the paper said Bishop was "
adamant that he will not sell his controlling stake."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic confirmed the airline was
interested in a link up with British Midland, saying Virgin tycoon
Richard Branson had yet to convince Bishop of the merits of such a
deal.
</P>
<P>
"It's something Richard approaches British Midland about from
time to time. They would complement each other well. A combined
Virgin and British Midland would have the scale to take on BA,"
Reuters quoted him as saying.

<HEADLINE> Australian Troops May Be Sent to East Timor: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Sunday told Indonesian President B.J. Habibie that
Australian troops were on standby for East Timor to "evacuate
Australian observers and journalists."
</P>
<P>
According to AAP, Howard sounded the warning in a lengthy
personal phone call to President Habibie.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a U.N.-run ballot will be held in East Timor to
decide whether the province will separate from Indonesia.
Fragmentary violent incidents were reported in the past days.
</P>
<P>
AAP said in its report that Australian observers and
journalists in East Timor have increasingly become the target of
death threats and attacks by pro-Indonesia militia and Prime
Minister Howard left no doubt that Australian armed forces would
be sent in if the lives of Australians came under threat after the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Australian newspapers suggested that if independence vote
failed, a civil war would break out in East Timor and Australia
would face a refugee flood.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Saturday
ruled out any possibility of refugee flood saying that "the fact
of the matter is we have no indication there will be refugees."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Australian troops have built up in the
northern city of Darwin.

<HEADLINE> Stone Museum Opens in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A museum featuring a rich
collection of efflorescent stones opened recently to visitors in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The museum displays efflorescent stones with various shapes
which are formed after about 100 million years' geological changes
and weather influence, and most of these stones are collected from
the Langshan Mountain located at the edge of the Ulan Buh Desert.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as a natural art museum of aeolian rocks, Langshan
Mountain formed its unique aeolian feature due to the strong wind
and sandstorms there.
</P>
<P>
Also on show at the museum are some valuable stones including
agate and jasper.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia is renowned for its abundant ornamental stones,
and more than 100 kinds of stones have been discovered in the
region so far.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Ex-speaker to Seek Study Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's disgraced ex-speaker of
the House of Representatives, Alhaji Buhari, flew out of the
country Thursday to realize his planned return to school, the
Vanguard newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Buhari who resigned from his position and was subsequently
convicted of perjury and forgery by an Abuja Chief Magistrate
Court last month left the capital's international airport for
London on one of the Dutch KLM airlines flight, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The former speaker, who was unaccompanied, according to one of
his close confidants, would spend two weeks in London before
proceeding to the United States to explore the possibility of
getting admission into a university abroad.
</P>
<P>
The confidant who was in the forefront of mobilizing support
for the former speaker when allegations of his forgery became
public said that Buhari was determined to ensure that when he
bounces back to public life, there would be grey areas in academic
qualification.
</P>
<P>
He said: "After the incident, Imam (as Alhaji Buhari is fondly
called by his friends) thought of going to a university in
Nigeria. But even if he concentrates, reads and come out with a
good result, people will say he bought his way through.
</P>
<P>
"That is why he has gone to London to test the waters and see
if he can get admission into any of the outstanding universities
there.
</P>
<P>
"If he gains admission into any university in the U.S. or
Britain, I can assure you that he would come back as Dr. Buhari
since he would read up to doctorate degree level."
</P>
<P>
Buhari is expected to leave London for the U.S. in the second
week of September where he would stay till the end of the month
before returning to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
To maintain his political relevance while studying, the former
speaker sponsored a candidate for the constituency he vacated in
the forthcoming by-election.
</P>
<P>
His candidate reportedly defeated the candidate allegedly
sponsored by the strong man of Kano politics, Alhaji Abubakar Rimi
during the primary election to pick the ticket of the People's
Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
Buhari was fined 2,000 naira (some 20 U.S. dollars) after
having been convicted of falsification of age and forgery of
degree certificate from the University of Toronto, as well as
National Youth Service Corps discharge certificate.

<HEADLINE> Barak Expects to Reach Agreement With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said on Sunday that an agreement on the implementation of
the United States-brokered Wye interim accord could be signed next
week with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting, Barak said that a signing
ceremony might take place in Cairo on Thursday in the presence of
the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to visit Morocco, Egypt, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and Syria between September 1
and 5, her first visit to the region since Barak took office last
month with a pledge to move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the new deal would include the completion of
further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank under the Wye
accord by the beginning of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Barak noted that until now the deal has not been reached with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will continue
their talks on Sunday in an effort to clear the last hurdle for
the implementation of the Wye accord -- the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides achieved a major breakthrough in their talks
early this week, agreeing on a timetable for the two remaining
phases of Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank as
stipulated in the Wye agreement, which was frozen by Israel's
former hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu late last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable, Israel would restart the
implementation of the Wye accord in September and complete the two
troop withdrawals by mid-January, 2000, turning another 11 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But disputes remain on the issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release another 650
security prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. But
Israel insists that it would free only 500 prisoners and would not
release those with "blood on their hands."

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Try to Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will continue their talks on Sunday in an effort to
clear the last hurdle for the implementation of the United
States-brokered Wye interim accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad Sher met with
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in Jerusalem on Saturday
night to discuss the release of Palestinian prisoners, the
remaining obstacle to a break in the eight-month-old impasse
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
No breakthrough was reported following the meeting, but local
daily The Jerusalem Post quoted an Israeli official as saying
that the meeting was a crucial one.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving down to the wire," the official said.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, there was also an expectation that the
present round of talks would produce a memorandum of understanding
to be signed in a festive ceremony in Egypt next week, local daily
Haaretz said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to report to
his cabinet on Sunday on the progress achieved in talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The two sides achieved a major breakthrough in their talks
early this week, agreeing on a timetable for the two remaining
phases of Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank as
stipulated in the Wye agreement, which was frozen by Israel's
former hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu late last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable, Israel would restart the
implementation of the Wye accord in September and complete the two
troop withdrawals by mid-January, 2000, turning another 11 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But disputes remain on the issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release another 650
security prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. But
Israel insists that it would free only 500 prisoners and would not
release those with "blood on their hands."

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Former ROK PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said today that China is highly concerned with
the situation in the Korean Peninsula, as both sides of the
Peninsula are good neighbors of China.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
said this while meeting with Lee Soo-Sung, former prime minister
of the Republic of Korea (ROK), today.
</P>
<P>
The north and the south are parties directly concerned with the
Peninsula issue, and the issue should be settled independently
without interference from outside, through such political means as
peaceful dialogue, added Li.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China hopes to see an improved relationship
between both sides, that both could get along with each other
peacefully and have exchange of visits, and finally realize
independent peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
During the seven years of diplomatic ties between China and ROK,
bilateral cooperation in various fields are being carried out
comprehensively and exchanges on both the governmental and non-
governmental level have been growing, said Li, adding that the two
countries should further enhance exchange and cooperation to
substantiate bilateral ties, so as to contribute to regional and
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Lee Soo-Sung responded that friendly ties between ROK and
China benefits both peoples, as well as peace and stability in
Northeast Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
ROK appreciates China's decision not to devaluate the RMB,
which helps ROK through the economic crisis, said Lee, adding
that bilateral economic cooperation between ROK and China will
make new progress now that the ROK economy has turned for better.

<HEADLINE> HK to Mark Teachers' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Education Department of
Hong Kong issued an open letter Sunday, encouraging all parents
and students to organize various activities to salute teachers on
the upcoming Teachers' Day.
</P>
<P>
Teachers are not only conscientious in teaching and
transmitting knowledge, but are also devoted to the nurturing of
students' moral character, said Director of Education Fanny Law in
the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Our teachers dedicate themselves to educating the younger
generation, trying their best to promote their moral, intellectual,
physical, social and aesthetic development in a balanced manner so
as to prepare them for future challenges," Law said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope every student would treasure the devoted efforts made
by their teachers and every parent would value our teachers'
contribution," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, in his Policy Address 1997,
declared September 10 each year as "Teachers' Day."
</P>
<P>
The education director's letter to all parents and students is
the prelude to this year's Teachers' Day.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department and the Committee on Respect our
Teachers Campaign have jointly organized a series of programs,
including a reception, the "Teachers' Day Card Design Competition"
and the publication of a CD with songs to show respect to teachers.

<HEADLINE> SADC's Bid to Curb Use of Firearms by Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) is carrying out an elimination program aimed at
curbing the proliferation of weapons of war and small arms in
private hands throughout the region, Zimbabwean Minister of State
Security Sydney Sekeramayi has said.
</P>
<P>
The program follows a series of SADC meetings on defense and
security in Zimbabwe and Swaziland, which came up with a unanimous
decision to create a network of intelligence services to stem the
upsurge in organized crime involving use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
Political parties opposed to the ruling governments were also
taking advantage of the laxity in security to import weapons.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Sunday Mail newspaper quoted Sekeramayi as saying
that the decision to come up with an intricate security network
was taken against a background of various conflicts currently
manifesting within the region.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is now roped together with problems of organized
crime, migration, poverty, economic deprivation and inequity as
essential components of the threat perception," Sekeramayi said.
"The threat demands both a domestic and a regional project to
address its impact and consequences."
</P>
<P>
The minister added that it was fundamental to carry out the
program because the increase in the rate of organized crime and
the number of small arms in private hands negatively affected the
investment climate and created an environment of fear and
insecurity at both personal and societal level.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Zimbabwe, a large number of people possessed
small arms illegally, adding that some of the arms were in the
hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
The major source of small arms was South Africa while the other
regional countries currently engulfed in civil conflicts also
provided arms of war, he said.
</P>
<P>
The elimination program would therefore help to identify the
modes of transit, origin and purchase of the arms so that various
control measures could be put in place, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The other measures that were currently being taken by the SADC
countries include increasing institutional capacity and data banks
on crime intelligence and the creation of public awareness about
the problem of organized crime and small arms proliferation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This involves coordinating with other regional security organs
and structures, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Researches on Treatment Strategies for Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Action Committee Against
Narcotics (ACAN) Research Sub-committee of the Hong Kong
government has decided to commission two major research projects
on treatment and rehabilitation for drug abusers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the research is to assist the government and
ACAN in studying various aspects relating to drug abuse for the
formulation of anti-drug policies and programs, the government
said in a press release Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first research project, commissioned to the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, is an in-depth study on chronic drug
abusers and methadone patients in particular.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are expected to find out the underlying causes for
the chronic abuse of illicit drugs and the relapse into drug
addiction after detoxification and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The research costs about 1 million HK dollars (128,000 U.S.
dollars) and is expected to take three years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The second research project, commissioned to the Kwai Chung
Hospital and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, is a study on
the motivational strategy for engaging early drug abusers for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The study aims to assess the current methods of persuading drug
abusers, especially early drug abusers, to seek treatment and to
evaluate the effectiveness of the motivational strategy.
</P>
<P>
The project costs about 300,000 HK dollars (38,000 U.S. dollars)
and will take one year to complete.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the sub-committee commissioned 10 studies, of which
two have been completed and eight are still in progress.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998/99 financial year, the government devoted a total
of 8.3 million HK dollars (1.06 million U.S. dollars) to drug
research-related work.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Factions to Lay Down Arms for Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's rival factions have
 agreed to lay down their arms so as to create a peaceful
atmosphere conducive to conducting the U.N.-sponsored direct
ballot scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, leading figures of both
camps stated at a press conference in Dili, capital of East Timor
on Sunday that as of August 28, 1999, both the pro-integration and
pro-independence forces would order their forces not to carry or
use weapons outside each party's designated cantonment site.
</P>
<P>
The parties called upon the Indonesian Police to arrest under
existing Indonesian law any of their members carrying weapons
outside the designated cantonment sites in contravention of these
orders.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed to conduct a mutual visit to the designated
cantonment site as quickly as possible after the ballot on August
30.
</P>
<P>
They agreed in principle to discuss the formation of a
verification committee to oversee cantonments and the laying down
of arms.
</P>
<P>
The parties requested the commission on peace and stability,
the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) and the Indonesian Police,
to dispatch personnel to the cantonment sites to observe the
cantonments and the laying down of weapons.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, UNAMET also announced that it would leave
security matters to the Indonesian Defense Forces and National
Police during the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot on August 30. The ballot will allow the
East Timorese to choose whether their homeland should become an
autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is trying to
offer permanent residency to some 300,000 Mozambican war refugees
living in the country, Sunday World newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees have lived in South Africa for more than
20 years and have raised their children as South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The registration drive is being conducted by the Home Affairs
Department and the Association of Western European
Parliamentarians for Africa, according to the Sunday paper.
</P>
<P>
Mobile units are being used to target rural areas in
Mpumalanga, Northern Province, KwaZulu-Natal and the North West
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Refugees were often dumped in these areas or have found
sanctuary with traditional leaders there.
</P>
<P>
Those who qualify for permanent residency by proving they came
to South Africa between 1985 and 1992 will be registered as South
African citizens, ending their fear of being deported to
Mozambique, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are easy prey to corrupt police officers and many
are being abused in farms, according to the paper.

ABU DHABI, Augutst 29 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East, particularly
the Gulf region, could be an easy target of Internet crimes, said

Financial and other crimes perpetrated through the Web could
affect the Middle East more than other regions due to the relative
inexperience of Internet end-users in the region, experts warned.
</P>

They added that the perceived threats posed by the Net,
including fears of lower company productivity due to staff surfing
the Net during office hours, or fears of credit card fraud, has
partially slowed the move toward e-commerce.

<HEADLINE> 4 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Four Lebanese civilians were
injured Sunday morning during Israeli shelling on a village in
south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Zin and his wife, two children were wounded when the
Israeli shells hit the residential district of the Mansuri
village, just outside the Israeli-occupying border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the injured were sent to a hospital in
the nearby port city of Tyre, the sources said, adding the
shelling also damaged several houses in the village.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment followed a series of offensives
launched by Lebanon's Muslim Shiite group Amal on the Israeli
outposts inside the occupied zone. There has been no immediate
reports about casualties from the attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 18 Lebanese civilians
have been killed and more than 100 others wounded in clashes
between Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Offer Oil Assistance to Quake-hit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government has decided
to offer 10 million U.S. dollars worth of oil as assistance to
victims of the earthquake that recently hit Turkey, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
INA said the decision was made in a meeting chaired by
President Saddam Hussein Saturday evening, in which the Iraqi
cabinet discussed the implementation of the decision adopted in
its previous session on offering aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck northwestern Turkey on August
17, leaving some 14,000 people killed and 40,000 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi cabinet decided on August 20 to pump oil to Turkey as
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Red Crescent and its Turkish counterpart will
establish a committee to draw up the distribution plan of the
assistance, said INA.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iraq and Turkey have remained
cold since the 1991 Gulf War in which Turkey supported the allied
forces in driving Iraq out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long urged Turkey to stop allowing United States and
British warplanes to use its bases to patrol the no-fly zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The northern no-fly zone was imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Iraqi Kurds there against possible attacks by Iraqi
government troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has also demanded an end to Turkish troops' frequent
incursions into northern Iraq to chase the Kurdish rebels who have
been fighting for an independent state in southeast of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> 61 Pct of Urban Bangladeshis Fall Below Poverty Level: WB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- About 61 percent of the urban
people in Bangladesh fall below the poverty level and 40 percent
of them are poor, the Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper reported
Sunday, quoting a World Bank (WB) report.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, Dhaka, 55 percent of the people are poor and of
them 32 percent are hard-core poor, said the WB report entitled
"Toward an Urban Strategy for Bangladesh," which was presented at
a workshop held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"While the country's population doubled from 55 million in 1961
to 124 million (the latest official figure is 128 million) in
1998, its urban population grew almost nine-fold from 2.6 million
to around 24 million," the report stated, adding, "This trend is
expected to continue in the immediate future."
</P>
<P>
The urban population of this South Asian country will reach 80
million in 2020 and the share of the urban population is expected
to grow from the current 20 percent to around 36 percent by the
same period, according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
Owing to rapid urbanization, the deficiencies in urban
infrastructure and basic services, including safe water,
sanitation, sewerage and traffic facilities are severe, the report
observed.
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of a limited water-borne sewerage system in
Dhaka, which serves only about 15 percent of the dwellers, no
other urban center has any form of sewerage systems," the report
continued.
</P>
<P>
The housing problem is particularly intense in Dhaka, which has
the largest share of urban poor among all the urban centers, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,007 slums and squatter settlements in Dhaka
city with a population of around 1.3 million, which is 24 percent
of the total population of the city and 43 percent of the total
urban poor, it stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, landlessness has become a major problem in larger
cities, particularly in Dhaka and Chittagong, and in Dhaka, only
3.2 percent of the poor households own land while the percentage
is 18 for the rest of the urban areas, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate in urban areas is not satisfactory, the
report said, adding that 43 percent of the urban population is
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
The WB report emphasizes the need for developing an integrated
policy framework and approach to better address the most pressing
issues in many urban service sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
Long-term goals of such strategy should include expanding
service coverage, reducing inefficiencies and wastes, expansion of
private sector participation, improving the existing legal
framework for service provision and unifying the various elements
of service provision, the report stressed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Proposes Setup of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union (Zanu) has proposed the abolishment of the office
of two vice-presidents and replace it with that of prime minister
while retaining the Executive Presidency in the new constitution,
the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
This emerged at a special meeting of Zanu's central committee
held in Harare Saturday to debate proposals drafted by the party's
legal committee and adopted by the politburo recently to be
submitted to the Constitutional Commission next month.
</P>
<P>
The marathon meeting, which started in the morning until well
into the evening, debated the issue of the Executive Presidency
with the general consensus being that the Executive President
should be restricted to two consecutive terms of six years each.
</P>
<P>
Although Zanu Secretary for Information and Publicity Nathan
Shamuyarira Saturday night could not elaborate on the resolutions
made by the central committee, he confirmed that issues which had
dominated the debate included the bill of rights, citizenship, the
Executive Presidency and the separation of powers between the
executive, the judiciary and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said the party's final draft paper on the constitution would
be ready next week after which it would be dispatched to all party
members for comments and contributions. The paper would then be
presented to the Constitutional Commission on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Delegates who attended the meeting said it was proposed that
the Executive President would have the right to dissolve
Parliament but would not have the right to invoke that power once
impeachment proceedings against him have started.
</P>
<P>
The party also proposed that for one to qualify for election as
a President one should be a Zimbabwean citizen by birth, aged 40
years or above and be a registered and eligible voter.
</P>
<P>
Under these proposals, the Executive President would have the
power to appoint a cabinet, decide on a referendum, make
appointments to key positions in ministries and diplomatic service
as well as declare a state of emergency and war but with the
concurrence of cabinet and the approval of Parliament to be sought
within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency should, however, not last for more than
three months except with the approval of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The party delegates also proposed that there should be a prime
minister appointed by the Executive President to head the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Simon Muzenda has
castigated some senior officials in the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union (Zanu- PF) for fuelling divisions and using
improper ways to gain leadership positions, the Sunday Mail
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"I see nothing wrong with following proper party procedures to
get into the party's leadership structure. It is disturbing to
hear that some senior leaders in the party are fighting among
themselves to get support from the people," Muzenda said in Gutu
of south Zimbabwe Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He added that leaders promoting factionalism should be
disciplined if the party was to remain vibrant and united.
</P>
<P>
"Unless disciplinary measures are taken against some wayward
leaders, who engage in these nefarious acts, the party risks being
infiltrated by undesirable elements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said there was an urgent need to stop
factionalism, which he said, was increasingly becoming the order
of the day in most of the country's provinces, with Mutare,
Masvingo and Mashonaland West topping the list.
</P>
<P>
He added that specific instructions should be given to the
ruling party's commissariat to give people enough time to prepare
for elections.
</P>
<P>
On Zanu's chances of winning next year's Parliamentary
elections in the face of increasing opposition parties, Muzenda
said: "We are going to win the elections with a landslide victory
because there is no viable opposition which can dare challenge
Zanu (PF)."

<HEADLINE> Poll: BJP-Led Alliance to Return to Power in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The BJP-led coalition, the
National Democratic Alliance (NDA), is set to sweep back to power
in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, an opinion poll said.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll, conducted by the Center for Media Studies
(CMS) for the weekly magazine "Outlook" and released Sunday,
covered 14,220 respondents between August 17 and 22.
</P>
<P>
The poll said the main opposition Congress party "is looking at
worst-ever performance."
</P>
<P>
The survey said the 24-party NDA is expected to win some 320 of
the 543 seats at stake in the Lok Sabha while the Congress was
forecast to take only 122 seats.
</P>
<P>
The poll also predicted that the BJP alone would win 216 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the second and final Outlook-CMS
pre-poll survey, the BJP-led alliance is cruising to victory with
an expected tally of 319 to 329 seats in the 13th Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is a spectacular turnaround in the fortunes of
the Congress and its allies, they are expected to end up with
between 135 and 145 seats," survey said.
</P>
<P>
It also indicated that 51 percent of respondents preferred A.B.
Vajpayee as the next prime minister compared with 35 percent
backing Sonia Gandhi.

But today there's a tourist boom in the northwestern part of
China and overseas tourists can be seen everywhere. Every year 40,
000 people on average from various countries visit the Pamirs and
they outnumber local people.
</P>
<P>
To better understand foreigners, Dorban began studying English,
Urdu, and several other languages on his own. Tourists bring in a
considerable amount of money, he says, and they opened a window to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Mahirexang, a Tajik merchant, wisely opened his eyes to the
outside world 13 years ago when a Sino-Pakistan highway opened to
traffic and borrowed money from relatives and friends to start
selling Chinese goods to Pakistan and other neighboring countries.
The opening policy provided a chance for the plateau town and many
people like Mahirexang became successful international traders.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Tajik used animals to transport goods to
market, but a 20,000-sq.m. border trade market in the county now
provides Tajik merchants and overseas traders with a place to
trade freely.

URUMQI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- In the Tajik Autonomous County on
the Pamir plateau in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
more and more foreign tourists have come to enjoy the cool autumn
air, pure sunshine, and a colorful scene of local people in
traditional ethnic dress.
</P>
<P>
Dorban, a receptionist at the Pamirs Hotel, is helping some of
them check in and giving a brief introduction to the Pamirs in
English.
</P>
<P>
He told them that the Pamirs have many icy peaks and deep
canyons and some 10,000-year-old remains of human activity. The
Silk Road, the ancient trade route linking East and West, ran
through the Pamirs. Around the Tenth Century B.C., the Pamirs had
a prosperous period with booming trade and commerce and history
reports that Marco Polo started his China tour from the plateau.
</P>
<P>
But, the decline of the Silk Road lead to quiet on the Pamirs
and as late as the 1950s, the unsophisticated Tajik people were
still living a simple life of herding. At that time, the county
had no more than 9,000 people, who used animals to carry goods.
There was no school for the children and no hospital providing
health care.

and more people began to eat green vegetables.

The county has also built many highways going in all directions

Cable television and telephones have also shortened distances and
a number of Tajik students have gone to cities like Beijing,

<HEADLINE> Depositors Withdraw Heavily From Bangladeshi Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Panicked depositors in Bangladesh
have withdrawn heavily from the United Commercial Bank Limited
(UCBL) following Thursday's violence in the bank's head office in
Dhaka, The Daily Star newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, helped with huge amounts of
cash to meet demands from clients who took advantage of the
two-hour banking time on Saturday. The central bank gave about 50
million taka in cash to meet the demand, sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The UCBL's Elephant Road branch ran short of cash soon after
transaction began and long queues were seen at other local offices
of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Similar panic withdrawal was also reported from UCBL's branches
in southeastern Chittagong city, where the country's largest
seaport is located.
</P>
<P>
But Bangladesh Bank Governor M. Farashuddin said that he saw no
reason to panic and that the central bank would stand by the UCBL.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the directors of the UCBL, who were "forced to
resign" on Thursday, have condemned the Bangladesh Bank's order
barring them from taking part in any activity of the bank, saying
they may go to court over the order.
</P>
<P>
They also resented the "government's inaction" following
Thursday's violence at the bank's head office in which a former
director forced the directors to resign and declared himself
chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked by the Bangladesh Bank show cause notice on
us, which is illegal and appointment of administrator," they said.
</P>
<P>
The head office of the UCBL was sealed by police and put under
police custody on Friday as directed by Home Minister Mohammad
Nasim following violence in the bank's board of directors' meeting
on Thursday afternoon and an executive director of the Bangladesh
Bank was appointed as the temporary administrator of the UCBL.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also served a show-cause notice upon the
UCBL's board of directors as to why the board of directors will
not be dissolved and the reply has to be submitted on or before
Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down to 1.56 percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate fell by
0.14 percentage points to 1.56 percent for the week ended on
August 14, despite a continued rise in prices of major food
articles.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the inflation rate,
based on Wholesale Price Index, had fallen to a two-decade low of
1.19 percent (provisional) for the week ended July 24, but had
been rising since then.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation witnessed during the current year
is mainly due to the comparison with a higher base last year when
prices of food articles, especially vegetables, had shown an
abnormal surge.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation was much higher at 8.34 percent
during the corresponding week last year mainly on account of
skyrocketting vegetable prices following lower agricultural
production.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Trees Attract 10,000 Sparrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Every evening, some 10,000
chirping sparrows fly to the top of two phoenix trees in a
courtyard in Xi'an to spend the night. The next morning they fly
away, creating a shadow in the sky which attracts many spectators.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shengti, a retired worker and the owner of the courtyard,
said the huge flock has been coming to the trees since 1997. At
first he was so pleased that he generously spread millet and maize
on the ground to feed them, but none partook.
</P>
<P>
When he realized that the birds weren't looking for a meal, he
began to nurture the trees more carefully. With so many sparrows
as overnight guests, Wang now has to clean the courtyard twice a
day.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the boarding birds is notable after decades of
sparrow slaughter. Sparrows used to rank among China's traditional
"four evils" for farmers, along with mosquitoes, flies and mice,
because they disturb crops and steal grain. However, agriculture
researchers now say that sparrows eat more worms than grain.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Reclaim More Land in Bago Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 50,633 hectares more
fallow and virgin lands in Myanmar's Bago Division will be
reclaimed for cultivation to boost the country's agricultural
production, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These lands to be reclaimed were granted on Saturday by the
Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to 20 groups of
national entrepreneurs, it said.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, 29,970 hectares of such lands in the
division were granted to private entrepreneurs for reclamation.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, since the beginning of this
year, a total of 467,370 hectares of vacant, virgin, fallow and
wet lands have been reclaimed in Myanmar's six divisions and
states -- Ayeyawaddy, Yangon, Bago, Magway, Tanintharyi and Shan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is also planning to reclaim a total
of 291,600 hectares of such lands in the country's Mon and Kayin
states.

<P>
Statistics also show that Myanmar's rice export picked up
slightly from 93,000 tons in fiscal 1996-97 and 28,300 tons in
1997-98 to 123,000 tons in 1998-99 which ended in March following
three consecutive years' drop in the export since 1994-95 when it
was 1.04 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the export value.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investment in Shenzhen Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen in
Guangdong Province, one of China's first four special economic
zones (SEZ), had approved 2,773 Taiwan-financed businesses by June
this year, since the first Taiwan-backed business appeared in this
south Chinese city in 1982.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Taiwan investors pumped 3.07
billion U.S. dollars into their businesses, which export about
five billion U.S. dollars worth of commodities annually.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investment has become Shenzhen's second-largest source
of outside capital after Hong Kong. Most Taiwan investors say
they are confident of Shenzhen's future development because the
city has an advantageous investment and social environment.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-backed businesses are mainly engaged in manufacturing,
agriculture, tourism, entertainment, commerce, catering services,
and consultancies. A growing number of Taiwan-invested companies
are shifting to capital-intensive or technology-intensive areas.
</P>
<P>
Their primary products include computers and components, home
appliances, refined chemicals, precision molds, medical equipment,
timepieces, bikes, and plastics.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that 90 percent of the Taiwan-financed
businesses now operating are profitable, and some are now major
taxpayers in Shenzhen.

<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th founding anniversary of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Xinhua News Agency is
releasing a series of stories about 50 Chinese men and women,
young and old, to present a picture of the changes that have taken
place in China over the past 50 years. These people will describe
their own experiences and how they fit into the changes in the
motherland. The following is the eighth article.
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- One of Chinese film director
Xie Jin's biggest dreams has always been to challenge Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
"I always imagined that I could establish a film company of my
own and make films that could rival Warner Brothers productions,"
the 77-year-old director says.
</P>
<P>
Xie has witnessed the ups and downs of China's film industry
and people still respect him, even after the emergence of new star
directors like Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige and Jia Zhangke, and their
trendy techniques.
</P>
<P>
Unlike younger directors, Xie mostly concentrates on the
disastrous developments of China over the past century in a
realistic and acute way. One of his better known movies is "A
legendary Story of the Tianyuan Mountains" about the anti-rightest
movement in 1957. Millions of intellectuals were persecuted at
that time and were labeled "enemies of the people".
</P>
<P>
That movie, along with "Horse Wrangler", about the disaster of
the Cultural Revolution, appeared at the beginning of the reforms
and opening up and caused great repercussions. Critics say that
Xie used his films to depict his worries about the future of China
and that he did a right thing in stressing a patriotic theme.
</P>
<P>
Xie's most eye-catching and most expensive movie ever made in
China is the "Opium War", which describes how China was bullied by
the Western allies in the mid-19th century. Xie says that that war
of 1840 signaled the collapse of a splendid civilization.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Xie, like other old intellectuals, harbors great
care about the destiny of the motherland. He is preparing a new
movie, "Diary of John Rabe", based on the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
Rabe was a German social activist who witnessed the Japanese
atrocities and recorded them in his diary and helped save a
greater number of people in the city. The film has been called "
China's Schindler's List".
</P>
<P>
Many of his movies paint a rosy picture of New China. The most
unforgettable is "Woman Basketballer No.5", which was made in the
1950s during the rise of Chinese sports. Xie says that it hints
that after the People's Republic was founded in 1949 it is
becoming stronger and healthier.
</P>
<P>
Another movie he is preparing, something like a sequel to the
basketball movie, is "Woman Footballer No.9", a story of a dream
to win to enter the World Cup and Olympic Games in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Xie says that to challenge Hollywood and make movies that are
respected in the rest of the world, a director has to touch the
deepest sorrows, happiness, and ambitions of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Although he has won almost every top Chinese film award and
many honors abroad, Xie says that, as a witness to fate, he
believes that a film should be tested by history, time, and the
people.

widening gap between high- and low-income groups in the country.
The Ministry of Finance is now busily engaged in the law-drafting
work, but insiders say the law is unlikely to come out this year

is concentrating on bank interest taxes and issues concerning the
conversion of various fees into standard taxes.

<HEADLINE> Colombia, Chile Rejects Extraterritoriality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana and Chilean President Eduardo Fei on Saturday
rejected extraterritoriality, a practice by some countries of
applying their national laws extraterritorially.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Fei, who was on a visit to Colombia, and Pastrana
expressed made the rejection in a joint communique signed after
their talks here.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said that extraterritoriality is "a violation
of the judicial equality of the states, the principle of respect
and sovereignty of the other countries and no intervention in
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Pastrana asked the international community to keep
neutral toward his country's domestic peace process.
</P>
<P>
Chile, in the meanwhile, views former ruler Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's case as interference in its internal affairs,
attempting to stop the aging general from standing trial abroad.
</P>
<P>
Frei ended his three-day visit to Colombia after signing a
series of accords aimed to strengthen bilateral political and
economic ties.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's International Reserves Fall Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international
reserves shrank by 118 million U.S. dollars to 14.12 billion
dollars as of August 26, the Venezuelan Central Bank reported
Saturday in its web page.
</P>
<P>
The reserves had recovered to 14.59 billion dollars in July,
but fell to the lowest level so far.
</P>
<P>
The fall was caused by Venezuela's oil price slump of 0.17
dollars per barrel at the end of this week. Oil income represents
50 percent of the national earnings and 70 percent of total
exports.

<HEADLINE> Women's 100 Hurdles Highlights Penultimate Day's Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The day's women's 100 meters
hurdles was in every aspect a historical event on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Not only because the pariticipants consisted such big names
Gail Devers, Ludmila Engquist and Olga Shishigina, but because it
was a symbol of encourage, strength and optimistism.
</P>
<P>
Devers, world champion in the event in 1993 and 1995 and 100
meters Olympic champion in 1992 and 1996, found her fame after
overcoming a serious thyroid disorder in the 1989-1990.
</P>
<P>
And it's the Engquist's turn to face such misfortune. The Swede,
defending Olympic and world hurdles champion was diagnosed with
breast cancer less than six months ago and just returned to the
track one month ago by ending her chemotheraphy.
</P>
<P>
Devers finally took the win by clocking 12.37 seconds, with
Engquist winning the bronze in 12.47.
</P>
<P>
However, the medal and the clocking were not so important.
Devers gave a warm hug to Engquist after crossing the finish line.
Engquist was apparently content with her medal finish, waving to
the spectators with tears shining in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
Glory Alozie of Nigeria was second at 12.44. World indoor
champion Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan was fourth at 12.51.
</P>
<P>
For Devers, it was the fifth gold she won at world
championships, putting her first on the all-time list ahead of
Jackie Joyner-Kersee.She also had two Olympic titles and two world
indoor champions in her honour pocket.
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to attack the hurdles and I didn't want the
1992 to come back again," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992, Devers stumbled and
finished out of top three places.
</P>
<P>
"At the last two hurdles, it felt that I was too close to them,
so I had to back off a little bit. But I tried to attack the last
hurdle. I bumped it but I was determined to stay on my feet," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Seconds after finishing the race, Devers embraced with Engquist,
celebrating the Swede's encouragement to take part in the
championships and won a medal.
</P>
<P>
"I was really proud of Ludmila that she came back and
accomplished what she did," Devers said. "Let everybody know if
you are believing in yourself, dreams do come true."
</P>
<P>
Bursting quickly from the blocks, Devers was first over the
first hurdle and pulled away throughout the race. Engquist got off
to a slow start and trailed badly for the first half of the race.
But she came on strongly in the final stages and was just beaten
for the silver by Alozie, who out-leaned her at the line.
</P>
<P>
Enquist's performance capped the most remarkable and
inspirational story of the championships.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-born Swede, the 1991 and 1997 world champion and
1996 Olympic gold medalist, was diagnosed with breast cancer in
March. She had her right breast removed on April 21, and returned
to competition July 30, winning a race in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the championships, Engquist had to interrupt
her chemotherapy to get fit for Seville.
</P>
<P>
The Swede has continued to train through four chemotherapy
sessions. She is due to undergo the fifth of sixth rounds of
treatment next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before the championships, Engquist had said she only hoped to
reach the final. But she won all of her qualifying heats, in which
she clocked 12.50 in Friday's semifinals, equaling the second
fastest time of the year and estalishing her as a gold contender
in the final.
</P>
<P>
"I am a little bit disappointed because I dreamt that I would
have gold medal. However, a medal is a wonderful thing for me to
have after all that I have been through with my illness," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit slow at the start, but it is still a good
performance. I did the Swedish national record," she added. "The
future is not looking that good for me. In September my medical
treatment will continue, but I'm very optimistic that I have
showed myself that I can run again."
</P>
<P>
In the other finals of the penultimate day's competition, Spain
's Abel Anton retained the men's marathon title with a time of two
hours 13 minutes 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Anton became the first man in the world to get two consective
victories in the marathon race at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Vincenzo Modica of Italy finished second in 2:14:03 and
Nobuyuki Sato of Japan won the bronze 2:14:07.
</P>
<P>
"For me, winning in Seville is special, in a city where all
people give so much support," said the 37-year-old, who was also
winner of the London marathon on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Anton shook off all the rivals to make a solo run in the final
two kilometers and took the win without any threat behind.
</P>
<P>
He then jogged a victory lap, waving a Spanish flag and greeted
by a sell-out boisterous home crowd of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great moment for me to arrive first in the
stadium in my own country and with my own people supporting me,"
Anton said. "I again thank the crowd on the streets for their
support."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 5,000 meters final, Moroccan Salah Hissou won the
gold and broke the championships record with 12:58.13. This was
his first gold medal after achieving bronze in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The silver medal went to Benjamin Limo of Kenya, who performed
a spectacular home straight and marked 12:58.72. Monhammed Mourhit
of Belgium finished third with further eight seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ivan Pedroso of Cuba retained his long jump
with a leap of 8.56 meters. This was also his third world title.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Yago Lamela won the silver with 8.40 meters and
Slovenia's Gregor Cankar took the bronze in 8.36.
</P>
<P>
"This is my third world title and to secure this gold was the
most important thing for me," Pedroso said. "The distance did not
matter to me. I felt some pressure from Lamela but after I jumped
over 8.50 I was certain that it would be enough for gold."
</P>
<P>
Lamela said: "To get the silver in the best competition of the
year is special. Maybe in the future i will be in even better
condition and win the gold."
</P>
<P>
Mirela Manjani-Tzelili of Greece won the women's javelin throw
gold medal at 67.09 meters.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Shikolenko of Russia had the silver at 66.37 and
Norwegian Trine Solberg-Hattestad, 1993 and 1997 world champion,
had to settle down with the bronze at 66.06 meters.
