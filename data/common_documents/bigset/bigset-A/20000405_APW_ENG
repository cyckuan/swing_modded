Nasdaq, Dow Bruised but Recover
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index and Dow Jones industrials on
Tuesday each dropped more than 500 points before recovering in what was Wall
Street's most volatile day. Analysts said they couldn't point to any one factor
in today's massive selling, but most said the purge was long overdue. The Nasdaq
was down 574.57 points at midday, then clawed back to finish down 74.79 at
4,148.89. The Dow rose 196.31 points this morning before diving to a loss of
504.15 early Tuesday afternoon. It finished down 57.09 at 11,164.84.

Mori Elected Japan Ruling Party Head
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Yoshiro Mori was elected president of Japan's ruling party
Wednesday, replacing Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was on life support after
suffering a massive stroke. The full Parliament was to meet later Wednesday to
approve Mori as prime minister. Obuchi held both posts, but has been in a coma
since his sudden collapse on Sunday. The entire Cabinet resigned Tuesday, paving
the way for the quick selection of a new prime minister. Mori is expected to be
named to that spot later Wednesday and a Cabinet could be installed shortly
after that.

Japan, N. Korea Start Normalization Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- North Korean and Japanese negotiators on
Wednesday began their first talks in eight years on establishing diplomatic
relations. Both sides said they would try to bridge their many differences,
including Tokyo's concerns over a North Korean ballistic missile that was fired
over Japan in 1998. The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.
Similar normalization talks between Japan and North Korea broke down in 1992,
and swift progress now is not expected. Pyongyang needs help from richer
countries to feed its impoverished people and modernize its decaying
infrastructure.

Anti-Castro Demonstrators Get Rough

   MIAMI (AP) -- Anti-Castro demonstrators surged through a police barricade and
formed a human chain around Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez's house on Tuesday as
rumors swept the crowd that the U.S. government was coming to take the boy away.
Miami police stood by and watched. The protesters broke through after Elian's
father was issued a U.S. visa to come to the United States and be reunited with
his son. They vowed to resist any attempt by the U.S. government to take the
6-year-old boy away from Miami relatives.

Genetic Approach To Cancer Promising
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For the first time, scientists have reported success
against cancer using an intriguing technique called antisense technology, which
zeros in on a cancer gene to halt malignancy at its roots. Researchers have been
experimenting with this approach for more than a decade, but on Tuesday they
described the first cases in which the technique actually seemed to slow a
deadly malignancy. Testing is still early, and doctors do not know whether the
treatment will pan out. But a large international study is starting to settle
this.

Ross strutted into a news conference on Tuesday at Grand Central Terminal where
she and two new backup singers announced plans for a U.S. tour featuring the

Magic Zap Spurs 107-97
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- John Amaechi scored 24 points and Darrell Armstrong had
23 Tuesday night as the Orlando Magic beat the San Antonio Spurs 107-97 for
their season-high seventh straight victory. Chucky Atkins, who had 16 points,
led a fourth-quarter surge by reserves who helped Orlando pull away for good.
The rookie had five points and three assists in the 13-4 run that put the Magic
up 93-78 with just under six minutes to go. The Spurs, who got 30 points from
David Robinson, cut their deficit to 97-91 with 1:44 left. But Amaechi made a
one-hand runner on the baseline and Atkins followed with a clutch jumper to put
the Magic back in control.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Hears Sex Slaves Tales  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, the story was told in Russian by two
women who were tricked into lives of forced sexual slavery. Then, a
Mexican woman described how her search for a better life
unwittingly led her into a life in a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   In two languages, a Senate panel crafting legislation to curb
the growing problem of sexual slavery heard from victims, through
interpreters, stories of rape, drug addictions, forced abortions
and beatings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was given tight clothes to wear and told what to do,'' said
''Maria,'' a former sex slaves who wore a disguise before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Near Eastern and Southern
Asian affairs subcommittee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would be armed men selling tickets to customers in the
trailer. Tickets were condoms,'' Maria said. ''Each ticket would be
sold for $22 to $25 each.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Maria, ''Olga,'' a native of Siberia, said she was told she
could make a lot of money if she left home to work in another
country as a maid. Olga was led to Israel, where she was told she
had been sold to a man for $10,000 and had to ''work off the
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Olga said she resisted at first, only to be beaten in her kidney
area to create maximum pain but minimum abuse to her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw 15 to 20 customers a day and the brothel owners gave me
drugs so that I would work,'' Olga said. ''I felt as though I was
losing my mind, so they gave me drugs they said were for
headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Olga said she later discovered the drug was Ecstasy, ''a drug
that makes you relax and more willing to be intimate,'' she said.
''After three weeks, I was dependent on the pills and asked for it
everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Though figures are sketchy, it is believed that between 50,000
and 100,000 women and children are trafficked into the United
States, said William Yeomans of the Justice Department's Civil
Rights Division.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee approved by a voice
vote a bill, sponsored by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., that
would create a new class of visas for victims of sex trafficking or
slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Visas would be extended to those victims and their families who
cooperate with law enforcement and who would face persecution or
extreme hardship if repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Those admitted under the program, which would be capped at 5,000
a year, would be able to apply for permanent residence after three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Yeomans called on Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the chairman of
the hearing, to persuade lawmakers to enact legislation that would
criminalize a wider range of activities beyond the sex trade
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yeomans said others cases could include women coerced into
domestic servitude, migrant labor or sweatshop work. He also called
for penalties for violations of involuntary servitude to be
increased from 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gaps in coverage currently exist which make it impossible to
prosecute certain reprehensible forms of abuse,'' Yeoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers for both Brownback and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
said they had hoped to have crafted legislation by now but have run
into difficulties over the question of whether countries that
encourage trafficking should be hit with economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to employ
sanctions, fearing they would limit the ability of U.S. authorities
to work with law enforcement agencies in those countries.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Kills Power Plant Worker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPENCER, N.C. (AP) -- A worker at a Duke Energy Corp. plant died
Tuesday, hours after being severely burned when an electric
transformer exploded, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion happened shortly after 11 a.m. at Buck Steam
Station, one of Duke Power's eight steam plants.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers said the employee suffered chemical burns on
the hands and face. Utility spokeswoman Guynn Savage said the
employee died later at a Winston-Salem hospital. The name was not
released.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred as the employee performed routine
maintenance on a transformer near the plant's main building, Duke
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no interruption of electric power and no damage to the
plant itself, Savage said. She said the cause of the explosion was
not immediately evident.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party takes over third place in enrollment  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Ross Perot-inspired Independence Party
of New York, on the strength of a 17 percent increase in voter
enrollment over the past year, has become the third-largest
political party in the state, surpassing the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feat was accomplished in just six years,'' an Independence
Party statement noted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   March enrollment figures from the state Board of Elections show
the Independence Party -- the New York wing of the national Reform
Party -- had 172,471 members, up from 147,545 members a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party had 171,496 members, up from 169,900 a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party continued to lead the way in New York with
4.96 million members with the Republican Party in second spot with
3.09 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing further back in the latest figures were the Liberal
Party (92,074 members), the anti-abortion Right to Life Party
(51,392), the labor-union backed Working Families Party (4,611) and
the environmentally-oriented Green Party (3,611). There are 2.15
million voters not enrolled in any political party, so-called
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, chairman of the state Conservative Party, said he
wasn't concerned about the growth of the Independence Party and
being shoved into fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   Long said many of those enrolling in the Independence Party
believe they are registering as independents, not joining a
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the Independence Party competition? Yes,'' Long said. ''Do
I feel we have a solid base? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they last another four or five years, I guess they would
start developing a solid base,'' Long added. ''They also have to
get lucky enough to have another Tom Golisano run again -- someone
with a $12 million checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   B. Thomas Golisano, a millionaire Rochester businessman close to
Perot, put the Independence Party on the map in 1994 when he
bankrolled his own run for governor and collected more than 217,000
votes, well over the 50,000 votes needed to win the party an
automatic ballot spot for the next four years in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Golisano collected more than 364,000 votes in the
governor's race to retain the Independence Party's automatic ballot
status and move it ahead of the Conservative Party on the ballot.
Ballot placement for parties in New York is based on votes
delivered for candidates running for governor. The Conservative
Party produced 348,727 votes for Republican Gov. George Pataki in
1998, or about 16,000 less than Golisano received.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also collected more than 2.2 million votes on the GOP
ballot line to win re-election in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Last Love Canal-era building being demolished  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- For 20 years, the 93rd Street School
stood vacant at Love Canal, a concrete reminder of the crisis that
turned the neighborhood it served into a national symbol of
environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a backhoe was reducing the brick walls to rubble,
making way for park space for the new wave of residents who have
moved into the cleaned-up and revitalized neighborhood over the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   The school was on the outermost cusp of a danger zone created by
seeping toxic waste from a canal-turned-chemical dumpsite. The
school closed in 1980 as panicked parents moved the children it
served out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in the third ring, this was the end of it, right
here,'' said 93rd Street resident Andrew Tomascik, referring to the
way the area was divided and evacuated after the state declared
Love Canal a threat to human health in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Whole streets of homes and a school nearest the dump site, in
the first ring, were demolished. That area remains uninhabitable.
Other areas, however, including near the school, were declared
habitable again in 1988 and homes that sat vacant for years were
refurbished and sold.
</P>
<P>
   The school is the last Love Canal-era building that will come
down.
</P>
<P>
   Tomascik, unconvinced of any danger, never left 93rd Street, a
quiet dead-end lined with maple trees and bordered by a creek. He
was not sorry to see the decaying, graffiti-marked school across
from his house, or the seven-foot fence that has surrounded it, go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fence had three strands of barbed wire,'' he said. ''That
bothered me more than the school being empty. It looked like a
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The school was one of several constructed in the area to
accommodate the predicted increase in enrollment due to the
post-World War II baby boom. The two-story 93rd Street School was
considered the jewel, featuring more than 53,000 square feet of
space, modern classrooms and gymnasium and a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   As the revitalization of Love Canal, now called Black Creek
Village, began, there was talk of refurbishing the school and using
it for offices or housing, but the asbestos-laden building remained
vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition is expected to be completed in the next several
weeks.

<HEADLINE> GOP boss says no support for Lazio run; Congressman disagrees  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of New York's Republican Party says
he has talked to GOP leaders from across the state and found no
support for a possible run for the Senate by U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio
as an alternative to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've taken the pulse of the party and there is nothing there
for Rick Lazio,'' state GOP Chairman William Powers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would urge him to support Mayor Giuliani,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lazio said that ''a handful'' of local county
chairmen ''have called and pledged their support.'' But the Long
Island congressman said he would not identify the county chairmen
who are supporting him without checking with them first.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Republican congressman from Long Island said the
party might be ''blowing'' the Senate race against Hillary Rodham
Clinton by lining up behind Giuliani. Lazio said he was ready to
run, if the party wanted him to.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's slight lead in the polls over Clinton has evaporated
in recent days amid criticism of his handling of the shooting last
month of the unarmed Patrick Dorismond by New York City police. In
defending the police, Giuliani made public Dorismond's criminal
record, including juvenile records that had been sealed by a court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to force this issue,'' Lazio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, if it is the will of the governor and state
chairman and the majority of the county chairmen and the (state)
Senate majority leader, Joe Bruno, that they feel like their man
is, come hell or high water, Rudy Giuliani, then I will accept
that,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said that should he not get enough support at
the state GOP's convention at the end of May to have a primary
against Giuliani, he would not try to force the issue by
circulating petitions statewide to force a September primary. But
Lazio said he felt the issue would be decided even before the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he was concerned that he was being portrayed by some
as a disloyal Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating to be held to a higher standard than Rudy
Giuliani. There are some people supportive of Rudy Giuliani who are
critical of me raising the issue of whether or not we have the
right candidate,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But somehow, they seem to have forgotten that Rudy Giuliani
was the fellow who put a knife in the back of George Pataki and not
just endorsed but stumped for (Democrat) Mario Cuomo'' in the 1994
governor's race won by Pataki, the congressman said. ''That is the
moral equivalent of me going out and endorsing and stumping for
Hillary Clinton in the last few weeks of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio put his Senate campaign on hold in August at the request
of Pataki. At the time, the governor called for Republicans to
support the mayor as the strongest GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Lazio's comments Sunday, the governor through
aides reaffirmed his support for the mayor's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani was campaigning across Long Island with
Sen. John McCain. McCain said that while he didn't know Lazio very
well, ''I do know that Mayor Giuliani has the support of the entire
Republican establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wants to run, he should run and we'll have a primary,''
Giuliani said. ''But it's up to him.''

<HEADLINE> High court says state properly rescinded NYC commuter tax  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A court ruling that effectively killed New
York City's commuter tax could mean the 300,000 out-of-state
residents who travel to work there will be eligible to receive
around $105 million in tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals' ruling will also cost the city an
estimated $360 million a year in taxes it wanted to collect -- $210
million from in-state residents and $150 million from out-of-state
residents. About 500,000 New Yorkers commute to jobs in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court ruled unanimously Tuesday that the
commuter tax, rescinded by the state for New York residents last
year, cannot be imposed on residents of other states, either.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that the state Legislature and governor
properly rescinded the tax on in-state commuters in May 1999,
despite arguments to the contrary by New York City officials.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means the tax is most likely permanently gone, since
when lawmakers approved it, they included a ''poison pill''
provision that said that if part of the law was found
unconstitutional, the entire tax would be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is possible because the
Court of Appeals made an interpretation of rights under the U.S.
Constitution in its ruling, but lawyers for the city and state said
that would be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The state stopped collecting the commuter tax from in-state
residents when the rescinder went into effect July 1, 1999, said
Marc Carey, a spokesman for the state Department of Taxation and
Finance, which collects and distributes the tax for New York City.
But the state continued to tax out-of-state residents throughout
the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Those commuters can get their money back, but the state won't be
hunting them down. The $105 million -- about $75 million collected
from July 1 to Dec. 31 and about $30 million collected during the
first three months this year -- will be available to residents who
claim the refund on their tax forms, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a concerted effort to inform people (of the
changes),'' Carey said. But, he said, it will mostly be up to
commuters to make sure they correctly fill out their tax forms if
they want to receive refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Most officials, including New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
said the decision did not shock them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected that we would lose the case so it doesn't come as
a surprise to me,'' he said during a Senate campaign appearance
Tuesday with John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman, a spokeswoman for New York City's corporation
counsel, said city officials were ''extremely disappointed'' by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the Legislature acted in a very punitive way toward
New York City,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city argued that the state Legislature and
governor illegally rescinded the tax without the New York City
Council asking Albany to do so in a ''home rule'' message, but the
Court of Appeals said no such message was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The court also agreed with lawyers for Connecticut and New
Jersey residents, as well as the state of Connecticut, that the tax
was discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The language of the statute plainly and frankly discriminates
against nonresidents,'' Wesley wrote. ''There is little doubt but
that the discrimination is so great that both its purpose and
effect are exclusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled on the various challenges concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely delighted that this tax now is finally dead,''
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an absolutely historic ringing endorsement of basic
fairness and constitutional principle that forbids unfair,
discriminatory taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City also argued the rescinder was improper because its
passage was designed to win votes in a hotly-contested special
election for a state Senate seat in New York's northern suburbs.
The election was won by Thomas Morahan, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals said it would be put on a ''slippery and
dangerous slope'' by making judgments about the legality of laws
based on the political motivation of Legislatures and governors.
</P>
<P>
   Carey lauded the timing of the decision and emphasized that even
if the court takes several days to file its decision, taxpayers
still have time to file their amended taxes or ask for an extension
before this year's tax deadline.

<HEADLINE> More special education students taking Regents curriculum  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A higher percentage of special education
students failed the high school Regents exams in 1998-99 than in
the previous year, but top education officials expect performance
to improve as students adjust to the tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these children had never had the opportunity to be in
this curriculum and take these tests,'' Deputy Education
Commissioner Larry Gloeckler said Tuesday. ''In the past, the only
ones taking the exams were probably the ones capable of passing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloeckler said special education students -- previously not
required to take Regents tests or classes -- have a ''safety net''
in the form of the easier competency tests, which they can take if
they fail the Regents. And when competency test results are
factored in, Gloeckler said ''a vast majority'' of students are
showing improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Richard Mills said during a news
conference that tougher education standards are also enabling more
special education students to seek higher education. The latest
data showed 41 percent of students who completed high school
pursued postsecondary education.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a dramatic breakthrough not only in the level of
achievement but also in the level of aspiration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to data released by the Regents, the number of special
education students taking the English Regents exams increased from
5,731 in the 1997-98 school year to 12,516 in 1998-99. Special
education students taking the Math exams went up 52 percent, from
8,265 to 12,543.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of those students passing the English exams fell
from 74 percent to 60 percent while only 52 percent passed the math
exams last year, compared to 60 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Regents' figures released Tuesday also showed that special
education students' achievement was not high in middle and
elementary school levels.
</P>
<P>
   Among fourth graders, only 1 in 5 students who took the fourth
grade English language arts test met or exceeded performance
standards. Students did somewhat better on math tests, with 36
percent passing.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth graders fared worse, with only about 1 in 10 students
meeting or exceeding standards on the English test and nearly 66
percent placing at Level 1 -- the lowest a student can score.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the department is working to strengthen curricula and
improve training for both regular and special education teachers to
address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents data also showed that the rate at which students are
classified in the special education category is slowing and more
special education students are now in regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 percent of students with disabilities spent 80 percent
or more of a school day in a regular classroom setting in 1998-99.
During the 1997-98 school year, it was 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said when the New York data is compared with the national
data -- 45.7 percent of special education students nationwide are
now integrated -- the state is ''showing progress.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue that remains unchanged is what education officials
called an ''overrepresentation'' of black and Hispanic students in
special education. The Regents data showed that in 1998, 25 percent
of students with disabilities were black and 19 percent were
Hispanic. That's greater than their representation in the general
student population, which is 19 percent black and 17 percent
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Gloekler said the Education Department will be sending out
letters to schools with overrepresentation and examine their
practices before recommending corrective measures.
</P>
<P>
   There are 420,000 special education students, ages 3 to 21, in
New York. Students have to meet one of 11 disability categories --
which include both physical and mental disabilities -- set by the
Education Department to be classified in special education.

<HEADLINE> Deal reached in Albany on parameters of new state budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators will meet today in
conference committees to begin discussing spending not agreed to in
a ''framework'' budget agreement reached by legislative leaders and
Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers will decide specifics about a $1.2 billion, five-year
tax cut plan, how to spend $1.4 billion the Legislature will add to
Pataki's proposed budget for 2000-01 and several other loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are a lot of important things to put out on the
table,'' state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   But the parameters of an agreement were reached Tuesday by
Pataki, Silver and state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno after
weeks of private discussions, mostly by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The three men agreed that the new state budget would total about
$78.3 billion; that $900 million of the $1.4 billion in additional
spending would be on recurring programs and $500 million on
one-time expenses; that a record $3.8 billion transportation bond
act will be placed before voters in November and that reserve funds
in the budget will be maintained at more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000-01 state fiscal year began on April 1 and this is the
16th straight year that a state budget will be adopted late in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he hoped that the Legislature could discuss, draft
and pass a new budget by Passover, the Jewish holiday that begins
this year at sunset April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said the deal struck Tuesday by the state leaders bodes
well for a reasonably timely budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage of the budget, we are probably four months ahead
of where we were last year in making this agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was no agreement in 1999 on how much more money
to spend over Pataki's proposal until July 16, and it took the
Legislature until Aug. 4 to finish adopting a budget. That missed
breaking by a matter of hours the record for latest budget passage
in New York, set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has agreed to monitor the work of the conference
committees and to warn legislators when they are discussing
spending that risks being vetoed, Bruno and Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor indicated that if we stay within these (spending)
parameters ... he'd be comfortable with that,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver insisted on Pataki's participation so he could avoid a
repeat of 1998, when the Legislature developed a budget without the
governor's input and he vetoed hundreds of millions of spending
adds.
</P>
<P>
   The state spent about $73.3 billion in the just-concluded
1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno defended the expected spending increase of more than 6
percent by saying the state has extraordinary needs to meet and had
a $1.5 billion budget surplus from the past fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-tax group Change-New York said the increase would
be more like 7.5 percent, or a ''fiscally irresponsible'' three
times the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Pataki started out as a fiscal conservative, and now
risks becoming a bigger spender and bigger borrower than Mario
Cuomo,'' Change-New York president Tom Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by voters, the $3.8 billion bond act will help fund
a five-year, $34.2 billion capital plan for transportation with
half the money going to mass transit and the other half for road-
and bridge-building or repairs. Basically, that means New York City
and the rest of the state will be treated equally given that the
vast bulk of the mass transit money goes to the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority that runs the subways, buses and commuter
rail service in the New York City region.
</P>
<P>
   Such a division of transportation money had been demanded by
Bruno, who comes from upstate Rensselaer County.
</P>
<P>
   The individual projects to be funded by the $3.8 billion bond
act will be worked out later by legislative leaders and Pataki.
Silver and Bruno both pledged to make funding for the conversion of
Route 17 into Interstate 86 in eastern New York and across the
Southern Tier one of the bond act's highest priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The bond act would be the largest in New York state history. The
previous high was a $3.5 billion mass transit bond proposal which
was voted down in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Senate wanted the proposed bond act.
Democrats who rule the state Assembly said the budget will also
include a commitment to extend the Second Avenue subway along the
East Side of Manhattan, a project championed by Silver, a Manhattan
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   While conference committees will work out the details of the tax
cuts, legislative sources said reductions will probably be made in
the state's gross receipts tax and that the state's Earned Income
Tax Credit that helps the working poor will be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Silver and Bruno did agree that Pataki's proposal to have New
York participate in the multistate Powerball lottery game was not
likely to be included in the budget.

<HEADLINE> Financial, legal troubles leave children's TV show in the dark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Once upon a time,''Pappyland'' was a
cheerful place where children learned to draw.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's trouble in Pappyland.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of public television's most promising children's shows
when it was broadcast on The Learning Channel and more than 140
public television stations, ''Pappyland'' has faded from the
screen, mired in a tangle of disputes, failed deals and legal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, even the show's flagship station, WCNY in
Syracuse, stopped airing it -- although station officials said it
was because children were tiring of the repeat broadcasts. However,
on Wednesday, lawyers for WCNY will be in state Supreme Court for a
hearing on their lawsuit that the show's producers owe the station
$118,000 in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of revenue is at the root of the problems, say the
show's creators. It created a trail of bad debts, legal troubles
and accusations of poor management that have strained ties between
production partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is, if we had knowledge of what the industry's
standards are as far as dollars, we probably wouldn't have tried
it,'' said Executive Producer Eric J. Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pappyland'' grew out of a character created in 1985 by
free-lance artist Michael Cariglio called Pappy Drewitt, who taught
children ages 3-8 how to draw. In 1993, Craftsman &AMP; Scribe's
Creative Workshop, a Liverpool company, produced the first 26
episodes. The half-hour show used colorful characters and songs
with its drawing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The program became an instant hit with children and began
national distribution after one year. At the peak of its
popularity, producers said they were receiving 2,000 drawings from
children each week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, ''Pappyland'' was picked up by The Learning Channel and
named one of the top 10 new children's shows by TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Like many companies that produce children's shows, Craftsman &AMP;
Scribe's gave away its programming to public television in hopes
that kids would fall in love with the show and demand Pappy
products.
</P>
<P>
   Good ratings and critical acclaim drew interest from several
companies about ''Pappyland'' art supplies, books, dolls and other
products.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised $8 million from private investors but it
wasn't enough to convince manufacturers that the company had the
financial muscle to properly promote ''Pappyland'' merchandise.
Most of that money was spent for production costs and other
expenses to get the show off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   So six years after its premier, ''Pappyland'' has yet to make a
profit, which company executives blame on the inability of
Craftsman &AMP; Scribe's to sign a single merchandise deal, except for
home videos.
</P>
<P>
   And even that deal has gone sour. Hallmark Entertainment, which
bought the home-video rights for 15 years, says it has no immediate
plans to put ''Pappyland'' tapes in stores, despite paying the
company a $1 million advance two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have other products in the pipeline we have to get out
first,'' said Marty DeGrazia, senior vice president for
distribution for Hallmark Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Only three stations -- WLIW in New York City, WMTP in San
Francisco and WLVT in Allentown, Pa. -- continue to show
''Pappyland.'' No new shows have been made since 1997 and Cariglio
has vowed not to tape any more shows under current management.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Craftsman &AMP; Scribe's thought it had a buyer but the
deal collapsed. Then, the company had to pay out $200,000 to
co-creator Jon Nappa, who threatened to auction off his copyrights
and trademarks to the show unless he received his promised share of
the royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Roberts said there are those at Craftsman
&AMP; Scribe's who remain optimistic that they can turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to produce fresh episodes of ''Pappyland,'' as
well as a spinoff series, ''Pappy's Pad,'' that would teach drawing
to older children. It is pursuing investors, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   To help steer Craftsman &AMP; Scribe's down the right path, the
company in late 1998 hired Nyhl Henson, the first general manager
of the Nickelodeon children's television network. Henson has spent
the past year cutting costs and restructuring the company in
preparation for raising additional money through a public stock
sale or attracting a major investor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a story that ultimately will have a happy
ending,'' Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> Klink Wins Pa. Senate Primary  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rep. Ron Klink won a six-way race Tuesday
for the Democratic nomination to challenge freshman Republican Sen.
Rick Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   With 84 percent of the precincts reporting, Klink had 42
percent, or 264,243 votes, while state Sen. Allyson Y. Schwartz had
26 percent, or 160,628 votes, and former state Labor Secretary
Thomas P. Foley had 24 percent, or 149,432 votes. Three
lesser-known candidates split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, 48, is well known in the western part of the state
because of his four terms in Congress and his years as a news
anchor on a Pittsburgh TV station.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum had no competition for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, Foley and Schwartz largely refrained from attacking each
other, choosing instead to take shots at Santorum, a key player on
welfare reform and the effort to ban what abortion foes call
''partial birth abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the final week of the primary campaign, the candidates
went after each another more sharply, with Schwartz criticizing
Klink's opposition to abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum has moderated his views since arriving in the Senate in
1995 as a conservative rebel after beating Democratic Sen. Harris
Wofford, who won a special election to succeed the late Republican
Sen. John Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   The last Democrat elected to a full term in the Senate was
Joseph Clark in 1962.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Johnson is back at it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cy Young winner struck out 10 in 8 2-3 innings Tuesday night
and the Arizona Diamondbacks opened defense of their NL West title
with a 6-4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (1-0) gave up four hits, including home runs by Scott
Rolen and Desi Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who led the majors in complete games last season with
12, was pulled after 133 pitches with a 6-2 lead. But with closer
Matt Mantei on the disabled list because of a sore shoulder, the
Arizona bullpen struggled to get the last out.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer relieved with a runner on first and gave up a walk
and an RBI single to Relaford. Dan Plesac took over and allowed an
RBI single to pinch-hitter Bobby Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes then relieved and retired Doug Glanville on a line
drive for a save.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley, Luis Gonzalez and Damian Miller hit home runs off
Andy Ashby (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Miller's three-run homer gave Arizona the lead in the second
against Ashby, acquired in the offseason from San Diego. Miller
later doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit a two-run, 426-foot blast in the sixth. One out
later, Finley hit a solo homer high off the left-field foul pole to
make it 6-1. Finley finished 4-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, Philadelphia's opening-night pitcher because Curt
Schilling is still rehabilitating from shoulder surgery, allowed
six runs and eight hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 3-0 in eight opening-day starts, didn't allow a hit
until Mike Lieberthal's one-out double in the fourth. Philadelphia
cut the lead to 3-1 on Rolen's home run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who walked two, benefited from some slick fielding.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, second baseman Jay Bell made a diving stop to his
right and threw out Rico Brogna from his knees. Kevin Sefcik
followed with a liner off Johnson's glove and Bell grabbed it on a
short hop, then threw to first in time for the out.
Notes: Abreu did not start because of a sore right elbow. Manager
Terry Francona said Abreu would have been out of the lineup against
Johnson anyway. ... Arizona left-handed reliever Greg Swindell will
leave Wednesday to attend the funeral of his father, who lost a
long battle with cancer. ... After going through a 2-for-44 slump
last season and losing his job at first base, the Diamondbacks'
Travis Lee started in right field and had an opposite-field single
in his first at-bat. ... Arizona had six left-handed batters in the
starting lineup. ... Paid attendance was 44,298 and total
attendance was 46,438, some 2,500 short of capacity, in part
because the Lakers were playing the Suns a block away.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Parliament elected Yoshiro Mori as the new prime

over Japan in 1998. The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.
Similar normalization talks between Japan and North Korea broke down in 1992,

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- John Amaechi scored 24 points and Darrell Armstrong had

their season-high seventh straight victory. Chucky Atkins, who had 16 points,
led a fourth-quarter surge by reserves who helped Orlando pull away for good.
The rookie had five points and three assists in the 13-4 run that put the Magic
up 93-78 with just under six minutes to go. The Spurs, who got 30 points from
David Robinson, cut their deficit to 97-91 with 1:44 left. But Amaechi made a
one-hand runner on the baseline and Atkins followed with a clutch jumper to put
the Magic back in control.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty years after Diana Ross left the Supremes, the sexy
diva of '60s pop is back with her girls. In pink leather and lipstick to match,
Ross strutted into a news conference on Tuesday at Grand Central Terminal where
she and two new backup singers announced plans for a U.S. tour featuring the
group's timeless Motown hits. They're all Supremes -- Ross, Lynda Laurence and
Scherrie Payne -- but it's far from a reunion. The trio has never performed on
stage together.

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- John Amaechi scored 24 points and Darrell Armstrong had
23 Tuesday night as the Orlando Magic beat the San Antonio Spurs 107-97 for
their season-high seventh straight victory. Chucky Atkins, who had 16 points,
led a fourth-quarter surge by reserves who helped Orlando pull away for good.
The rookie had five points and three assists in the 13-4 run that put the Magic
up 93-78 with just under six minutes to go. The Spurs, who got 30 points from
David Robinson, cut their deficit to 97-91 with 1:44 left. But Amaechi made a
one-hand runner on the baseline and Atkins followed with a clutch jumper to put
the Magic back in control.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 3, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Forget the sophomore jinx for Tim Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's rookie pitching sensation opened his second season
by holding Detroit hitless for 6 1-3 innings en route to Oakland's
3-1 victory over the Tigers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson allowed only one hit -- Tony Clark cleanly doubled to the
left-center field gap on the right-hander's 100th pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (1-0), who went 11-2 last year to finish with the highest
winning percentage ever by an Oakland rookie, struck out eight and
walked three in the A's first win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He left after seven scoreless innings and T.J. Mathews worked
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Clark had Detroit's only two hits. He singled in the ninth to
set up a run that scored on a wild pitch by Jason Isringhausen, who
got a save.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 10,188 watched the A's win a day after a record
53,498 fans attended the opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were without power-hitting Juan Gonzalez, who is
expected to miss at least two games in hopes the rest will allow a
nagging right hamstring injury to heal. He could be back in the
lineup as early as Friday, when the Tigers play at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Nitkowski (0-1) allowed three runs -- only one earned -- in
six innings. He struck out seven and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Hudson's third against the Tigers. He has an
0.78 ERA in those victories.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was overpowering at the outset, setting down the first 10
batters he faced and fanning five of them.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the fourth, he fought to maintain his control. Brad
Ausmus drew a one-out walk and Bobby Higginson followed with a
sinking line drive that center fielder Ryan Christenson snagged
with a sliding catch. Dean Palmer drew the second walk of the
inning before Clark flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson got more defensive help in the fifth. First baseman Jason
Giambi robbed Rob Fick, ranging to his right and making a diving
stop of a sharply hit grounder. Shortstop Miguel Tejada's throw
from deep in the hole beat Deivi Cruz to first by a step to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland gave Hudson all the offense he needed in the fourth.
John Jaha drew a walk and Matt Stairs and Ben Grieve hit successive
singles for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The A's added a pair of unearned runs in the fifth, an inning
that began with Eric Chavez reaching on Clark's error at first
base. Nitkowski issued two walks to load the bases with one out and
two runs scored when Giambi beat out Detroit's attempt to double
him at first on an infield grounder.
Notes: Grieve collected his 200th career RBI with his
fourth-inning run-scoring single. ... The Tigers were denied in a
bid for their first 2-0 start since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 103, Clippers 93  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Karl Malone scored nine of his 34 points
during a 3:24 span of the fourth quarter as the Utah Jazz dealt the
Los Angeles Clippers their 10th consecutive defeat with a 103-93
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, in search of their sixth Midwest Division title and
third in four seasons, maintained their 2 1-2 game edge over
Minnesota despite blowing a 15-point lead in the second quarter.
They are 23-5 since a season-worst six-game losing streak, and have
won 10 of their last 12 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell had 18 points and 10 rebounds as Utah became the
third team this season to reach the 50-win mark, joining the Lakers
and Portland. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan joined Pat Riley, Phil Jackson
and Lenny Wilkens as the only coaches to win 50 games in a season
at least nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson scored 20 points for the Clippers, whose latest
double-digit losing streak is their 15th in Donald Sterling's 18
seasons as owner and their third this season. The only other time
the franchise has lost 10 or more games three different times in
the same season was 1986-87, when they had skids of 12, 16 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   After Tyrone Nesby's 3-pointer gave Los Angeles its biggest
lead, 82-76, with 33 seconds left in the third quarter, the Jazz
tied it at 84 on two free throws by Howard Eisley and a layup by
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby's dunk regained the lead for the Clippers, but Malone
triggered an 18-4 run with a three-point play, then added a couple
of perimeter jumpers and two free throws before Russell's 3-pointer
and John Stockton's two free throws gave the Jazz a 102-90 cushion
with 1:43 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' top two scorers, Maurice Taylor and rookie Lamar
Odom, returned to the lineup from ankle and calf injuries,
respectively. But they couldn't prevent the team's fifth straight
loss to Utah and 14th in their last 16 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz opened the game with an 11-0 run and increased the
margin to 29-14 before Los Angeles tied the score at 49 with a 19-9
spurt .
</P>
<P>
   Malone, last season's most valuable player, had two of his shots
blocked 38 seconds apart during the Clippers' comeback by Odom and
Olowokandi. The Clippers took their first lead, 54-53, on Taylor's
18-footer from the top of the key with 10:48 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Los Angeles avoided a fourth double-digit losing streak on
Dec. 13 by beating Vancouver 102-90 at Staples Center. That victory
triggered a season-best 5-2 stretch by the Clippers, who then lost
27 of their next 29. ... The Jazz has made only one roster move
since Nov. 11, requesting waivers on Pete Chilcutt on Jan. 7.
Chilcutt signed with the Clippers 11 days later. ... Russell is
three 3-pointers away from becoming the first player in Jazz
history to get 100 or more in two different seasons. ... Utah's
next loss will be Sloan's 295th as Jazz coach, which will edge him
past Frank Layden into first place on the team's all-time list. But
Sloan's 632 wins with Utah are 355 ahead of the second-place
Layden. ... The Clippers have a rematch with Utah on Apr. 12 at the
Delta Center, where they will try to end a 21-game road losing
streak against the Jazz.

<HEADLINE> Watchdog says HUD report violated the law, calls for probe  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's chief watchdog said a report issued by Secretary
Andrew Cuomo broke the law by detailing how proposed Republican
budget cuts would hurt communities.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General Susan Gaffney said the report, issued last
year and titled ''Losing Ground,'' violated a law barring federal
agencies from using taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''HUD's publication of 'Losing Ground' is only a small part of
the publicity and propaganda capability that the department has
built in the last two years,'' Gaffney wrote in a March 27 letter
to the U.S. Comptroller General obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, Congress's nonpartisan
investigative arm, reviewed the report late last year and found no
violation. Gaffney asked the GAO to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman David Eggner said Tuesday that Gaffney was making
a ''wild political accusation'' on an issue already resolved by the
GAO.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with the inspector general's claim that the GAO is
wrong on the law,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eggner questioned Gaffney's impartiality, saying, ''it is a
well-known fact that the inspector general is a tool of Republicans
in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney has been sharply critical of various Cuomo initiatives
at HUD. Her office penned a scathing audit of the Community
Builders program, created by Cuomo as a customer service and
outreach arm for the agency. Republicans say the program is a waste
of money and should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing Ground'' was distributed to Community Builders in
August 1999 with instructions to spread the word about the planned
cuts for fiscal year 2000. It also was mailed to the press, HUD
grantees, public interest groups and historically black colleges,
Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials told Gaffney they ordered more than 32,000 copies
and spent about $20,600 on printing and mailing.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time of unexpected national prosperity, Congress should
not rob the poorest Americans to provide reckless tax cuts and
create a new deficit,'' Cuomo wrote in the report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials said the proposed GOP cuts, most of which were not
enacted, would have meant 156,000 fewer housing units for
low-income families and homeless families and would have cut
housing and other services for people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report never specifically asked members to lobby Congress,
but Gaffney said ''the message was understood by its recipients.''
</P>
<P>
   She included an e-mail from one of the report's recipients, the
director of a HUD-funded community program, encouraging members of
her group to write to their members of Congress and urge them to
oppose the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a report in the over 20 years I've been
in Congress that has raised a red flag the way that this one did,''
said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who asked for the GAO
investigation last November. ''This is something that's unique to
Cuomo's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said he may ask the House Appropriations Committee
to cut Cuomo's next budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to send a clear message to any Cabinet secretary ...
that if you use taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress in a way that
violates the law, your personal empire is going to get cut,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, whose father was former Gov. Mario Cuomo, has said he may
be interested in running for his father's old job.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies 102, Rockets 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Mike Bibby made a layup at
the buzzer and scored 15 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter as
the Vancouver Grizzlies erased an 18-point second-half deficit to
beat the Houston Rockets 102-100 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim added 21 for Vancouver, which won only its
second game since Feb. 26 -- a span of 18 contests.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Steve Francis scored 30 for Houston, including a driving
layup with 5.9 seconds left to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   The only excitement in the first three quarters for the 12,474
fans came in the form of booing Francis, whose second game in
Vancouver since forcing the Grizzlies into making a three-team,
10-player trade last summer was no less hospitable than his first
outing Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies were forced to go to a smaller lineup earlier than
usual when forward Othella Harrington was ejected by referee Bob
Delaney at 7:45 of the first period. Harrington was given a delay
of game warning for failing to leave the court quickly during a
substitution, which was followed by the quick ejection.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were constantly left open in the post, making 10 of
13 shots to end the second period. Houston had an 8-0 run to open
the third, followed later by a dunk by Francis over Vancouver
7-footer Bryant Reeves, to open a 71-53 lead midway through the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver responded with an 12-4 spurt to start the fourth and
eventually took the lead at 89-87 with 5:43 left.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby shot 5-of-8 in the final period to key the Vancouver
comeback. The Vancouver point guard also had 10 assists, his fourth
straight game in double digits, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Harrington's ejection resulted in the first minutes since
Mar. 21 for Cherokee Parks of Vancouver. ...Francis started play
leading the Rockets in scoring, assists and steals. If he finishes
the season in the same position, he will become only the fourth
Houston player in franchise history to do so, following Calvin
Murphy (1975), Allen Leavell (1983) and Clyde Drexler (1998). ...
The Grizzlies wrap up a franchise-high nine-game homestand Thursday
with the start of a home-and-home series with Portland.

<HEADLINE> Another day, another uphill battle to ban soft money  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's leading opponent of campaign
finance reform has finally met a bill on the subject he is willing
to consider -- if not necessarily vote for.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes Rep. Marty Meehan nervous.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the bill Senate Rules and Administration
Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is holding hearings on
doesn't address the real issue, according to Meehan, D-Mass., who
is set to testify before McConnell's committee today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of anything that would make the American people
more cynical about Congress and politicians than if we were to pass
a so-called reform bill that actually did little or nothing to
reduce the role of money in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   There's good news too, said Rep. Christopher Shays, a Republican
who with Meehan is the lead sponsors of a bill banning ''soft
money'' -- unlimited donations by corporations and unions to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason Mitch McConnell is having this hearing is he
knows the American people want the system to be reformed. It's an
affirmation of what he basically has denied. He has always said the
public doesn't care,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill mirrors a measure introduced by Sens.
Russell Feingold, D-Wisc., and John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell has engineered filibusters to keep that bill from
getting a hearing on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell contends banning soft money contributions would
violate constitutional free speech protections and give Democrats
and unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But he has suggested he may be slightly flexible if a measure
crosses his path that would also raise individual campaign
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, is pushing a bill that
would limit to $60,000 per contributor soft money donations to
national political. The measure would also raise from $1,000 to
$3,000 the current ceiling on donations by individuals to
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In late March McConnell launched a series of hearings on
campaign finance reform which he promises to end with a May 17 vote
on the Hagel bill -- though a Hagel spokesperson said McConnell
won't vote for it in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with Hagel's bill is that it doesn't cap
soft money donations to state political parties, Shays and Meehan
said. Combined with the increase in allowable individual donates,
it would end up adding money to the political process, not taking
it away, Meehan complained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hard money is the most accountable way to contribute to
campaigns,'' said Hagel spokesman Deb Fiddelke, who also pointed
out that the $1,000 figure was set in 1974 and the $3,000 is less
than consumer price increases between then and now.
</P>
<P>
   As for concerns about the state party loophole, ''we really just
wanted to get the ball rolling, to get discussion going on the
Senate floor,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Saints Sign Cowboys Punter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints signed Dallas
Cowboys restricted free-agent punter Toby Gowin to a three-year
offer sheet Tuesday. Terms weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who tendered Gowin a one-year offer worth $472,000,
have seven days to match the Saints' contract or let him go. Dallas
wouldn't receive compensation if Gowin leaves because he signed as
an undrafted free agent out of North Texas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas appear unwilling to match the offer, having signed two
punters within the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas signed free agent Cory Collins and agreed to terms with
punter Barry Cantrell, who went to training camp with the Cowboys
last season. Both signed deals for the first-year minimum of
$178,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gowin averaged 43.2 yards per punt last season, finishing second
in the NFC and seventh in the NFL. He also handled kickoffs for the
Cowboys, finishing fifth in the NFC and seventh in the NFL with 12
touchbacks.

<HEADLINE> New York City's murder rate up 12 percent this year  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The murder rate in New York City, which plunged
in recent years to levels not seen since the 1960s, rose 12.4
percent in the first three months of this year, according to
statistics released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall violent crime, however, was down 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday, there were 190 murders in the city this year,
compared with 169 during the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were worst in the Bronx, where 61 people were killed
this year, compared with 38 in the same period last year. Murders
were down in Manhattan and up only slightly in the other boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Garry McCarthy, who oversees the NYPD's crime control
strategies, disputed some published reports speculating that the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo last year by four police officers
had contributed to the murder increase. Diallo was shot 19 times as
he stood unarmed in his Bronx apartment vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   It had been reported that some officers had been reluctant to
make arrests for fear of being publicly criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enforcement numbers don't bear that out,'' McCarthy said.
''Arrests are up.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that last month more police were ordered to patrol
the Bronx, and in the last two weeks, there have been three murders
in the that borough -- the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in overall violent crime -- which includes murders,
rapes, robberies, burglaries, assaults, grand larcenies and auto
thefts -- mirrors a dramatic drop in violent crime since 1990, when
murders were at an all-time high of 2,290.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal experts have attributed that decrease to the aging of
baby boomers, a keener sense of community, pride in good
citizenship and the decreasing use of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the number of murders in New York City was down to 629,
but it rose last year to 667.

<HEADLINE> Changes Shake Funeral Industry  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGAWAM, Mass. (AP) -- The ad looks like plenty of others: a list
of products, prices and a promise to nip off an extra 5 percent if
you find a better deal anywhere in town. Major credit cards
accepted, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But this ad isn't selling televisions or love seats. It's a
funeral home peddling caskets and services.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sales pitch rattled some competitors, it reflects
deep changes reshaping the funeral home trade, which was long
handed down largely from father to son as a business and way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Large corporate ownership, more aggressive sales and marketing,
new lines of business, and consumer demands for more choice are
finally chipping away at the accepted dictates of social taste and
religious orthodoxy that ruled the industry for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Years ago, people would purchase a funeral like it was their
last gift to the deceased. Today, people purchase funerals for the
benefit they receive,'' said Frank Forestiere, president of both
the Massachusetts Funeral Directors Association and Forestiere
Family Funeral Homes.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, family funeral homes nearly all relied on
familiarity and word-of-mouth for business in more stable towns and
city neighborhoods. But the growth of suburbs, a faster and more
mobile way of life, and a more culturally diverse and secular
society all combined to shake the roots of the staid industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, funeral directors didn't have to advertise,''
said Kelly Smith, a spokesman for the National Funeral Directors
Association.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Forestiere decided to take a new approach. He placed
a full-page newspaper ad that took the unusual step of including a
list of prices and a discount offer for a funeral home in
Northampton. He claimed the ''lowest priced funeral and cremation
services'' in town, ranging from $1,095 to $1,995. The ad showed
six caskets and cremation boxes ranging from $60 to $1,395.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crass ad,'' sniffed Robert Czelusniak, the president of
a Northampton competitor, Czelusniak Funeral Home.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources say such aggressive advertising has made
inroads in places like Florida and California with large
populations and many senior citizens. But in the more genteel
climate of western Massachusetts, such a discount offer was
virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Blanchard, an activist who helps protect the funeral
buyer's interests at the Boston-based Memorial Society, praised the
ad for including prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people haven't the slightest idea what is a fair price,
so they are in no position to bargain or walk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Forestiere ran his ad, Czelusniak fired off letters to
dozens of independent funeral homes, hoping to seize on the ad to
spur opposition to big corporate ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Wall Street firms control too much, then I see service
disappearing too much and greed and money being the crux,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The concern over corporate control of the industry comes as
consoldiation creeps into an industry that not too long ago was
almost exclusively family-run, with the business handed down from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   Forestiere's grandfather opened the family's first funeral home
in 1905 as an independent business and the Forestieres expanded to
six homes. The company, however, has merged with Carriage Services,
which owns about 180 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Four big, publicly held companies now control 13 percent of the
country's roughly 22,000 funeral homes -- an $11 billion annual
business, according to the National Funeral Directors Association.
Though most other companies are small and often family-owned, many
own multiple sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some predict more consolidation because group owners can buy
more cheaply, give more benefits to workers and better handle the
heavier regulatory burden now imposed by government.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes have refashioned the funeral ceremony itself.
</P>
<P>
   Strains of Elton John and Celine Dion have taken a place beside
Bach in the repertory of funeral music. One trucker's family found
comfort in seeing his rig and dog stationed in the parking lot at a
Forestiere funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Many funerals are planned and even paid for long before the
death, making arrangements easier for families often separated by
thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   To adapt, Forestiere is building a Web site where customers will
be able to order flowers and sign condolence books. He hopes
eventually to join in the industry's latest technological
innovation: virtual funerals Web cast for far-flung relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when we were married 31 years ago,'' said
Forestiere's wife, Lila. ''Every funeral was the same; only the
name was different. Now, no two funerals are the same.''

<HEADLINE> Coke: Fewer Job Cuts Are Expected  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co.'s restructuring program will
result in 800 fewer job cuts than initially forecast but officials
expect it will still help the soft drink giant achieve long-term
annual growth of 15 percent in earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reaffirmed Tuesday it expects to sell 7 percent
to 8 percent more cases of soft drinks and other beverages globally
each year over the long term despite slower growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   The volume and earnings projections surprised some analysts who
had expected Coca-Cola would revise expectations slightly lower
growth because of competition at home from bottled tea, water and
fruit juices and overseas economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think these are ambitious growth goals for the company and
challenging ones to meet,'' said Marc Cohen, beverage analyst for
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., who attended a nearly five-hour presentation
by Coke officials at a New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But chairman and chief executive Douglas Daft told the analysts
''we couldn't in all honesty'' project lower volume growth given
the confidence he has in recent changes in the company's approach
and its ambitious marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as chairman and CEO in February, Daft has
decentralized control of the company's soft drink operations,
giving local executives more authority to develop products and
packages and marketing programs that fit their markets. He said
that should spur growth.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola had estimated in January that its restructuring
program would result in the elimination of 6,000 of the company's
29,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Chief financial officer Gary Fayard said the program should be
completed by the end of April and that it is now expected only
5,200 jobs will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company still expects cost savings of $150
million to $200 million from the restructuring this year and $300
million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share growth of 15 percent is at the lower end of
the company's recent long-range targets while the 7 percent to 8
percent volume increase forecast is in line with what the company
had been forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, executives of Coke operations around the
world described what they are doing to appeal to local tastes and
boost growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, for example, Coca-Cola sells more than 60 different
varieties of its canned Georgia Coffee beverage, which is a top
seller, while fruit-flavored drinks have been developed that are
popular in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Coke's long-term volume targets were announced,
president Jack Stahl conceded that growth will only be 3 percent in
the first quarter and 5 percent to 6 percent this year, partly as
the result of recent price increases.
</P>
<P>
   But Fayard said sales momentum has been increasing each month so
far this year and that he is confident sales volume will accelerate
enough in the last three quarters to provide 5 percent to 6 percent
growth for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Stahl said will continue to back its flagship
Coca-Cola and other core carbonated brands with aggressive
marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said Coke will look for incremental growth by
backing more non-carbonated drinks such as bottled water, tea and
fruit drinks in various markets. And he said the company also plans
an Internet marketing program aimed at teens but declined to give
more details.

<HEADLINE> Butler Coach Ready for Nebraska  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF TUCKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Butler coach Barry Collier is set to become
the new coach at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Collier met with his players late Tuesday after returning from
Lincoln, Neb., and it appears the official announcement will come
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Players leaving the 90-minute meeting at Hinkle Fieldhouse would
not say what Collier told them, but junior guard LaVall Jordan
said, ''We can't dwell on the fact. We're not mad at him for
leaving, but we have to move on as a team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler athletic director John Parry would not confirm Collier's
departure, but said, ''I think Barry did a great job and we're
poised to keep on going. It's really a Nebraska announcement. It's
really their announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers fired Danny Nee last month after an 11-19
season, but athletic director Bill Byrne would say only: ''I'm not
talking about the coach. ''You guys know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry said he knows it's difficult for Butler, an Indianapolis
school with an enrollment of 3,800, to compete with larger schools
to keep quality coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about judging if it's the right job,'' Parry said.
</P>
<P>
   Collier guided Butler to 20 wins in each of the last four
seasons. This past season the Bulldogs went 23-8 and advanced to
the NCAA tournament for the third time in four years, only to lose
in the first round to Florida on a last-second shot in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators went on to the championship game, losing to Michigan
State on Monday night.

<HEADLINE> New York City Murder Rate Increases  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The murder rate in New York City, which plunged
in recent years to levels not seen since the 1960s, rose 12.4
percent in the first three months of this year, according to
statistics released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall violent crime, however, was down 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday, there were 190 murders in the city this year,
compared with 169 during the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were worst in the Bronx, where 61 people were killed
this year, compared with 38 in the same period last year. Murders
were down in Manhattan and up only slightly in the other boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Garry McCarthy, who oversees the NYPD's crime control
strategies, disputed some published reports speculating that the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo last year by four police officers
had contributed to the murder increase. Diallo was shot 19 times as
he stood unarmed in his Bronx apartment vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   It had been reported that some officers had been reluctant to
make arrests for fear of being publicly criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enforcement numbers don't bear that out,'' McCarthy said.
''Arrests are up.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that last month more police were ordered to patrol
the Bronx, and in the last two weeks, there have been three murders
in the that borough -- the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in overall violent crime -- which includes murders,
rapes, robberies, burglaries, assaults, grand larcenies and auto
thefts -- mirrors a dramatic drop in violent crime since 1990, when
murders were at an all-time high of 2,290.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal experts have attributed that decrease to the aging of
baby boomers, a keener sense of community, pride in good
citizenship and the decreasing use of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the number of murders in New York City was down to 629,
but it rose last year to 667.

<HEADLINE> Mori Elected Japan's Prime Minister  </HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Parliament elected ruling party chief
Yoshiro Mori as the new prime minister Wednesday, ending a
political crisis created by the sudden collapse of Keizo Obuchi,
who was on life support after suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The former trade minister was elected in a binding lower house
vote following his installment earlier in the day as president of
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The upper house later
voted its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi held both posts, but has been in a coma since his
collapse on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The changeover was not expected to significantly effect Japan's
national policies. Mori vowed to stick with Obuchi's reforms,
noting that his greatest task would be to continue efforts to bring
Japan's economy out of its decade-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had prayed for the prime minister's recovery,'' Mori said
earlier in accepting the party presidency. ''I will do my best to
live up to the nation's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers had promised to move swiftly to avoid a
political vacuum after Obuchi's collapse. The entire Cabinet
resigned Tuesday, paving the way for the quick selection of the new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mori needed 245 votes for a majority in the lower house, and
received 335 votes. A total of 488 votes were cast. That vote was
binding so even if the upper house had gone against him, Mori would
have become prime minister. But he won 137 votes, a solid majority
of the 244 cast in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Mori and his new Cabinet were expected to be sworn in by Emperor
Akihito later in the day. Officials said his new Cabinet would be
the same as the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Mori was assured approval as prime minister because of the LDP's
majority in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of a slight improvement in Obuchi's condition
Wednesday, said an aide to Tamisuke Watanuki, one of Obuchi's
closest allies. Details were not clear, but the aide said movement
had been detected in Obuchi's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki, who had been acting prime
minister since Monday, said the reports of improvement had not been
confirmed, and hospital officials said Obuchi remained in intensive
care. He was joined by his wife, Chizuko, his three children and
his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mori emerged as the most viable replacement as soon as it became
clear Obuchi's condition was grave. As LDP secretary-general, Mori
was the party's second-in-command after Obuchi and has a solid
power base.
</P>
<P>
   A former journalist and trade minister, Mori, 62, is considered
a conservative with considerable political savvy. But he has a
tainted past -- he was one of many politicians linked to the an
influence-peddling scandal in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He is also not known for being strong on international affairs,
but that could be tested soon. He will also have a full plate of
domestic issues to deal with as well.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis comes as a continuing volcanic eruption in northern
Japan has left 13,000 people in emergency shelters. Concerns were
also being raised about the LDP's ruling alliance, which began to
unravel just before Obuchi's stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after his election, Mori began discussions with
coalition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller of two parties with the LDP in a ruling coalition
has split off. That loss does not seriously threaten the Liberal
Democrats' power, but could make it more difficult for them to pass
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Though unable to block it, opposition lawmakers were expected to
resist the appointment of a prime minister from the ruling
coalition's ranks. They were expected to demand an early election,
raising the possibility of a national parliamentary vote sometime
in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for Parliament's lower house must be held by October.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will also be getting under way amid criticism
of its failure to disclose Obuchi's collapse for nearly a day.
Officials initially provided false information indicating Obuchi
was fine, then only grudgingly announced that he was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of Obuchi's main concerns before his collapse
was a reform of the national police force prompted by a scandal
over how police had lied to the media about their handling of a
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998 and proved an
effective leader, helping stimulate the economy, boosting his
party's dominant position in parliament and championing legislation
that strengthened Japan's security role in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Japan, North Korea Begin Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- As North Korea and Japan began
talks Wednesday aimed at establishing diplomatic relations, the
North demanded compensation for Japan's previous colonial rule over
the Korean Peninsula, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had expressed optimism early Wednesday before the
start of their first such talks in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But during the opening two-hour session, the North repeated its
long-standing demand regarding the widespread suffering caused by
Japan during its brutal 1910-1945 colonial rule over Korea, the
Japanese official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who asked not to be named, said Japan's chief
negotiator, Kojiro Takano, responded by repeating Japan's 1995
apology, but again rejected any compensation.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's top negotiator, Jong Thae-kwa, did not appear to
be angered by the response, and the talks continued in a serious,
businesslike manner, the Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other obstacles also remain, including Tokyo's concerns
over a North Korean ballistic missile that was fired over Japan in
1998, creating an outcry across the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar normalization talks between Japan and North Korea broke
down in 1992, and swift progress now is not expected.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of negotiations is to be held in Tokyo and a
third in Beijing or another country.
</P>
<P>
   In reviving the talks, Tokyo hopes that engaging the North will
help draw the Stalinist state out of its isolation and boost
stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang needs help to feed its impoverished people and
modernize its decaying infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo has promised to resume food aid frozen since the North
stunned the region by launching a ballistic missile that flew over
Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pyongyang denies kidnapping Japanese, it has promised
to investigate whether there are any ''missing'' Japanese citizens
within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it intends to raise the question of kidnapped
citizens in this round of talks. It is reportedly refusing further
food aid to the North unless progress is made on the issue. Tokyo
also plans to pressure Pyongyang to halt its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, North Korea's economy shrank by one-half or
more during the 1990s, after the collapse of trading partners in
the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. A deadly famine also has
forced it to appeal for outside food aid.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Dow Plunge 500, but Recover  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- While Wall Street's most volatile session in
history left traders reeling, market analysts were holding out hope
that the purge of the swollen technology sector had restored a
sense of balance to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by an exodus from all things technological, the stock
market went into a stomach-churning rout Tuesday, with the Nasdaq
composite index and Dow Jones industrials each dropping more than
500 points. But the stampede reversed as buyers returned in search
of bargains, and most stocks ended the chaotic session with only
moderate losses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best-known technology stocks are still up for the
year, but out of the stratospheric territory that had distressed
investment analysts. Smaller companies with little or no earnings
have been knocked down to prices that are more justifiable to
investors still eager to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, when the market stopped swooning, the Nasdaq and
the Dow had obliterated much of the divergence that had perplexed
market analysts since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of trading, the Nasdaq was up just 2 percent in the
year to date. The Dow was down less than 3 percent for the year. At
the height of the market's divergence in early March, the Nasdaq
had risen 24 percent for the year and the Dow had sunk nearly 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it is to believe, this is a good thing,'' said Pete
Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ''One sector of the market was insanely
overvalued. The rest was deeply undervalued. Now we are reversing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq and the Dow each recorded their widest point swings
in history Tuesday on record volume. The Nasdaq was down 574.57
points at midday, then clawed back to finish down 74.79 at
4,148.89. From its high to its low, the Nasdaq moved more than 634
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 196.31 points Tuesday morning before careening to a
loss of 504.15 in early afternoon. It finished down 57.09 at
11,164.84, having made its way back to positive territory briefly
before turning lower once again. It swung more than 700 points
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The swoon contributed to a second straight decline in Japan's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average. In selling led by
technology shares, the Nikkei shed 213.36 points, or 1.04 percent,
to 20,381.57 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the
average closed down 132.96 points, or 0.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple, rational thing to say is that that the technology
sector is coming back to Earth,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''We've gone through a
period of dramatic speculation, and historically, every period of
speculation has been followed by a period of distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors in Tuesday's selling were what's known in the
market as margin calls. When investors buy stock using borrowed
money, known as margin, they are forced to sell if prices drop
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ''That substantially exaggerated the downturn,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, sell orders stacked
up at trading posts and drove traders outside the building in
search of a brief respite.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so busy, honest to God, I didn't know how bad we were
down,'' said Terrence O'Donnell, trading clerk with Salomon Smith
Barney. ''I was literally buried in paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the swiftness of the selloff evoked memories of
October 1997, when the Dow fell 554 points in a single session as
financial crises in Asia and Russia gripped world markets. But
market watchers noted one crucial, though perplexing, difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen a bout of panic selling like today's since
then, but there was a clear catalyst then, and there isn't one
now,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, investor Michael Miglini made no secret of his
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost more money in this week than I made in the previous two
years,'' said Miglini, 31, who recently sold his construction
company and invested in the stock market. Most of his holdings are
in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the absolute worst timing possible,'' he said. ''It's a
painful lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, the pain was short-lived. Computer programs
that triggered selling on the way down eventually sparked buying.
Investors resumed their recent shift to blue-chip stocks, which are
seen as more stable and less speculative than their high-tech
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Dow components Procter &AMP; Gamble and Merck rose Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the technology stocks recovered, too. Computer
network maker Cisco Systems ended with a slight increase. Analysts
pointed out that even with the wide swings of many stocks,
investors in most technology names are still posting dramatic gains
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also found refuge in the bond market. Prices soared,
bringing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 5.77
percent from 5.81 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the session, Wall Street analysts were looking
cautiously to a handful of factors that could halt the decline of
technology stocks and lift the market anew. Corporate earnings
reports, which will flood the market in the next few weeks, are
expected to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some market watchers said the market's implosion may
convince the Federal Reserve that it won't need to intervene
further to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the market does the Fed's job, and forces a slowdown, I
think the Fed could take their feet off the brakes,'' First
Albany's Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Old Umbrella Shop Closing  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Since it opened 134 years ago, a tiny shop
facing Carnegie Hall has kept many people from getting all wet --
from U.S. presidents to Charlie Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam Umbrellas and Canes, believed to be New York's last
umbrella speciality shop, was slowly folding on this humid,
overcast Manhattan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to be the last village blacksmith,'' said Henry
Schwartz as he helped his wife sell the remaining inventory.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to lock the door as shoppers swept into the long,
tiny shop on West 57th Street, unfurling umbrellas that have made
America's heads turn from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   At $10 to $350 -- with up to 60 percent off in these last days
before the store closes April 11 -- there seemed to be an umbrella
for every type of cloud: Polka dots. Stripes. Paisley. Speckled.
Floral. Some sporting world maps and others cartoon characters. And
plain old black -- New York's favorite color.
</P>
<P>
   Sam has sold bright red umbrellas built for two, ones that
looked like pointy-topped pagodas and the GustBuster -- vented to
keep it from turning inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so sad to hear Uncle Sam was closing,'' said Irene
Kelvasa, a regular since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   She came for the service no other New York store offered: a man
who made and repaired umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your umbrella is ready!'' repairman Gilbert Center announced
as he appeared from the workshop with her beige Isotoner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's like a doctor. He takes one look and knows what's
wrong,'' said Kelvasa, a nurse. ''Mine wouldn't stay open. And when
it comes to umbrellas -- that's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tastes run simple: only solid beige or green above her head
when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers reached for a $350 English model, with a
cigarette lighter concealed in its polished malacca wood handle. It
was made by Brigg, the official umbrella maker to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The shop harbored as many stories as there were rainfalls during
its 13 decades of existence. Franklin D. Roosevelt used a cane
bought here, after his mother haggled over its price. John
Steinbeck would stop by just to chat, and in recent years, Harrison
Ford was a regular.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam was started in 1866 by a German immigrant, Adolph
Simon, who named it after his son Sam, the grandfather of the
current owner, Sandra Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is closing because the building that houses it has
changed hands, and she can't afford to move.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ''people don't seem to care about umbrellas anymore,''
Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Tuesday in the spring of 2000, they dug into the
stockpiles of umbrellas strewn everywhere as if mining gold. This
was the last of a more genteel era.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Uncle Sam put soul into its parasols, and theater
into umbrellas used on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And on a workbench in the back was a machine used to carve
canes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam canes have propped up some fancy walkers, including
Sammy Davis Jr., and presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman
and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin bought his bamboo ones here.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy purchased the fine wooden sticks he used
behind-the-scenes to prop up his ailing back. ''But he never let
himself be photographed with it,'' said Henry Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Black, a market researcher, walked his walk with a German
ebony stick, then a pure silver-handled one.
</P>
<P>
   ''The silver one is for the evening. We'll go to the opera with
it,'' said his wife, Paula Black, as the Brooklyn couple headed for
the cashier.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much left on the nicked beige shelves that lined
the shop except memories.
</P>
<P>
   And there was an especially delicious one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jack Benny had a tiny cane made that he kept in his mouth -- to
keep himself from smoking,'' said Schwartz. ''He sucked on it.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Confused by Markets  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At the most sickening moments of this week's
stock plunge, the Nasdaq composite index was down nearly 30 percent
from the record levels reached just three weeks ago -- and still
showing a gain of 65 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   These are confusing times for investors, even the ones who've
been around awhile.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, they've grappled with real concerns like
a global financial crisis, potential computer disruptions from the
Year 2000 date change, and the persistent threat of domestic
inflation and rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with economists forecasting continued prosperity at
home and continued recovery abroad, investors are facing a new
challenge in trying to assign specific values to a technological
revolution with few obvious limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Most market observers agreed that Tuesday's slide of more than
500 points by both the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average
was a textbook case of panic selling, the type of market spasm that
usually prompts a sharp rebound, much like the one that repaired
most of Tuesday's damage by the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a fairly classic capitulation day,'' said Richard A.
Dickson, a market analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond,
Va., noting how investors even began abandoning cherished names
such as Intel or Cisco Systems, blue-chip companies with real
profits and real growth prospects in the Internet revolution. ''The
psychology was, 'Let me out at any price. It's never going up
again, let me out before I lose all my money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Based on past market behavior, Dickson and other analysts expect
the rebound to continue over the near-term as investors scope out
the sudden discounts on both the blue chips and the more
speculative names that have led the Nasdaq moonshot of the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, they find few historic comparisons to
predict what will come next as investors try to determine an
appropriate value for the technology companies that are forging a
new Internet-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''A serious investor looking at this environment would say that
this blowoff is a chance to buy quality stocks,'' said Joe
Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co., arguing
that the underlying fundamentals of the new economy and the old are
far superior to the backdrop behind steep market declines of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ''This particular correction has the same feel as the one in the
summer and fall of 1998, which was the bottom of the Asian
financial crisis,'' said Battipaglia. ''But that was more
potentially dangerous than this today, because at that time the
world economic model was under great strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he said, while this week's decline was ''not much
different from the big one in 1987 -- sharp, steep, quick,''
interest rates are not soaring like they were before the infamous
market crash that year. ''Nowadays, the economy's growing, company
profits are soaring and inflation is invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the economic backdrop is more sound these days,
this week's sudden decline may make some investors hesitant about
plowing back into the market, especially those who've been wooed
into the market by its stunning gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of people who have been in the market for a year
or two years who have never experienced this kind of wrenching
loss,'' said Dickson. ''People who saw their portfolio values melt
away much faster than they ever seriously considered are going to
be a little more reluctant to chase these stocks higher.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers 84, Suns 83  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Robert Horry made four big plays in the final
1:30, sending the Los Angeles Lakers to a 84-83 win over Phoenix
and into the history books with their 10th victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers became the third team in NBA history to have three
winning streaks in a season of 10 games or more. Los Angeles had
16- and 19-game streaks earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee did it (20, 16, 10) in 1970-71, and Philadelphia had
streaks of 12, 10 and 10 wins in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had a chance to win it, but Cliff Robinson missed a
3-pointer with 4.5 seconds left. The rebound was batted around,
bounced high in the air and wound up in the hands of Shaquille
O'Neal as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 32 points, but only one in the fourth quarter when he
sat out 5{ minutes with five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   A free throw by O'Neal tied the game at 80 with 1:32 to play. He
missed the second shot, but Horry tipped it back out to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two seconds later, Horry was fouled and made both free
throws for an 82-80 lead. He also hit a 20-footer with 33 seconds
to play, giving the Lakers the points they needed to survive a
3-pointer by Robinson with 22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Horry had 11 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns,
Robinson scored 20 and Kevin Johnson, making his home debut after
two years away from his former team, scored 14 points on 6-of-7
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led 72-71 after a basket by Robinson 2:37 into the
fourth quarter, but Rick Fox brought the Lakers from behind with
two baskets and two free throws, and the Lakers led 77-72 with 5:36
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix regained the lead for the last time, 80-79, on two free
throws by Hardaway with 1:49 to play.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal carried the Lakers through a sluggish first half, scoring
23 points on a variety of jump hooks and turnarounds to lift them
to a 40-39 halftime lead after Phoenix led most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then Los Angeles switched tactics. Ron Harper had three baskets
in the first 4:36 of the third quarter as the Lakers opened a
12-point lead, 57-45.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns answered with a 13-0 run to regain the lead at 58-57,
with Hardaway scoring seven points and Johnson four.
</P>
<P>
   But Derek Fisher hit a 3-pointer with 3:21 to go, O'Neal scored
four points and Harper hit a baseline jumper for a 66-58 Los
Angeles lead with 1:56 to play in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers have a four-game win streak in Phoenix and have
won 16 of the last 19 meetings in the series. ... Kobe Bryant of
the Lakers and the Suns' Jason Kidd, the West's starting backcourt
at the 2000 All-Star Game, could not suit up. Kidd broke his ankle
March 22, and Bryant was suspended for fighting with Chris Childs
of New York on Sunday. ... Johnson, who played 18 minutes against
Minnesota in his first game back, entered the game with 3:05 left
in the first quarter and received a standing ovation. He played 26
minutes.

<HEADLINE> McCain returns to campaign -- for 'soul mate' Giuliani  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani didn't support him
for his party's presidential nomination, but, nevertheless, Sen.
John McCain visited the politically crucial New York City suburbs
to give the mayor a boost in his tight U.S. Senate race with
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more mild-mannered, even-tempered individuals like
Rudy and myself who will never rock the boat or say anything that's
controversial in nature,'' the Arizona senator cracked during a
town hall meeting in Northport, Long Island, on Tuesday. ''I look
forward to having a soul mate in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In shirt sleeves, Giuliani took a page from McCain's book when
he was told by an audience member that Clinton alleges that the
Republican mayor lacks the proper temperament to do his job in the
scholarly Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did she say that? Shut up! Sit down!'' Giuliani roared at his
questioner, a twinkle in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   When the laughter died down, he acknowledged being ''very
forceful in my advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe Washington needs a little of that,'' he added, calling
McCain his hero.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he predicted Giuliani would be an ''instant star
in many respects'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in McCain's glow, Giuliani used Tuesday's event to
criticize Clinton for spending unregulated, or soft, contributions
on her campaign against him -- even though the mayor is raising soft
money as well.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he can support campaign finance reform and at the same
time raise unregulated campaign funds, Giuliani replied: ''I have
to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Giuliani has raised $19 million while Clinton has
collected about $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain, a soft-money opponent, said last month that he
planned to raise objections to Giuliani's use of soft money, he
blessed Giuliani's stance on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can give up a financial disadvantage to the
tune of millions and millions of dollars, plus the independent
campaigns that are coming on,'' McCain said. ''We know already that
the trial lawyers are going to spend millions of dollars in, quote,
'independent campaigns.' So I can't expect Rudy Giuliani to give up
this enormous disadvantage, but I know he's committed to campaign
finance reform and I don't see that kind of commitment in a number
of my colleagues who presently serve in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, questioned whether Giuliani truly supports
reform, pointing out that the mayor vetoed the city's campaign
finance law in 1998 and raised illegal contributions during his
1997 re-election campaign, for which he was fined $240,000 by the
city's Campaign Finance Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again New Yorkers are getting double talk instead of
straight talk from Rudy Giuliani,'' Clinton campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said in a statement. ''Does John McCain know that
the mayor broke campaign finance laws and vetoed campaign finance
reform?''
</P>
<P>
   The city's law, which capped spending by mayoral candidates to
$10 million and increased the amount of public matching funds for
candidates, was enacted only after the City Council overrode
Giuliani's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, has a substantial campaign finance law of his
own on the books: In 1998, voters approved a Giuliani-sponsored
campaign finance referendum that banned corporate contributions
from city elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is scheduled to make similar campaign appearances for
candidates including Mark Nielsen, who is challenging Rep. Jim
Maloney in Connecticut, in an effort to entice the moderate,
independent-minded voters who formed the core of McCain's support
during his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''McCain can get women to vote for him, which a lot of
Republicans can't,'' said event organizer Ray Maloney, a veteran
who voted for Texas Gov. George W. Bush only because he thought
McCain couldn't win the primary. ''That means a lot to this
party.''
</P>
<P>
   But not on McCain's schedule is a similar show of support for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's name came up only in passing during the
hour-long town hall meeting -- and then, only in response to
questions.
</P>
<P>
   When one man asked how the GOP could hope to win the White House
''without supporting Governor Bush,'' McCain replied: ''I support
the nominee of my party; I've had conversations with Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani mentioned Bush's campaign in answer to a question about
whether Republicans can hope to win New York state in the
presidential contest. The mayor said he tells the Bush campaign
that Ronald Reagan won the state in 1980 and 1984 and Bush can,
too, if he can attract moderate Republicans and Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Town Want Guerrilla Back  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VITINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Huddled beneath a mural of Kosovo's
war heroes, Xhavit Hasani's friends talked about nothing else
besides getting him home.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani is a war hero himself in this little town tucked into the
southeast corner of Kosovo, known for smuggling weapons and medical
supplies to the Kosovo Liberation Army during its war against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   So people in the area were furious when Hasani was deported to
face felony charges in his native Macedonia late last month without
so much as a chance to defend himself -- a move that has also been
criticized by human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Skenderbe Hebibi, a former KLA guerrilla who describes himself
as Hasani's best friend, stared through the smoke in the Drenica
cafe, the gathering spot that Hasani owns. He promised there would
be consequences for the U.N. action -- and it seems he was right.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, militants kidnapped four Macedonian soldiers,
offering to release them in exchange for Hasani. Officials close to
the Macedonian government told The Associated Press the soldiers
were released after Hasani was allowed out of prison on $100,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Hebibi had predicted the move days before the soldiers were
detained.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would the Americans have done if we arrested an American
soldier and then released him to a hostile country?'' he asked.
''We will do the same for the release of our soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasani's detention and deportation might have been just another
event in the odd world that is justice in Kosovo, except for one
thing: The top U.N. representative in the province, Bernard
Kouchner, personally intervened in the case, signing the order that
sent Hasani to Macedonia to face charges of shooting at 11 people,
including two policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani was deported because he posed a threat to public safety,
Kouchner said in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats described the action as legally questionable --
signing Hasani away without giving him any legal forum to argue
against it. Kouchner's office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International accused the United Nations of taking an
action that many of its members -- including the United States --
would not be permitted to do under international law.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can the representative of the secretary-general not act in
conformity with U.N. human rights standards?'' said Shelley Inglis,
a researcher for Amnesty International in Pristina, Kosovo's
capital. ''This is clearly what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Though even U.N. administrators use the word ''disaster'' to
describe the overwhelmed local court system, Inglis suggested that
Kouchner could have -- at the very least -- rustled up the one
international judge working in Kosovo to hold a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the responsibility to protect human rights,'' Inglis
said. ''They can't come into a place where the government has
violated human rights and continue to violate human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner would have much to gain by cutting a deal with
Macedonia, the country that borders Kosovo. A shaky Western ally
with a restive ethnic Albanian minority, Macedonia's government has
been under pressure to show it is tough on maintaining public order
after recent killings of policemen in ethnic Albanian enclaves
inflamed ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   What Kouchner apparently didn't count on was that ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo would object, protesting at three spots along
the road to Macedonia after the deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leaders, too, were furious that a former
guerrilla would be spirited away by U.N. helicopter to an uncertain
fate across the border. Western officials said Hashim Thaci, the
former KLA leader, threatened unspecified consequences unless
Kouchner acted immediately to bring Hasani back to Vitina.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and NATO peacekeepers, meanwhile, closed ranks,
attempting to say as little about the case as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, it is unclear on what legal grounds U.S. soldiers
detained Hasani, given that he was wanted in Macedonia, not Kosovo.
He was held for three months at the U.S. Army's Camp Bondsteel.
</P>
<P>
   The order itself also has raised questions. Though Kouchner is
given wide latitude under the U.N. Security Council resolution
governing Kosovo, it is the NATO-led peacekeeping force -- and not
the United Nations -- that is responsible for security in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Kouchner noted that Hasani was a wanted man in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider in view of the above that Mr. Hasani poses a
significant danger to public order and safety and have decided that
he be deported from Kosovo,'' the order said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani received a joyous welcome by ethnic Albanians in Vitina
late Monday after he was released from detention in Macedonia, the
Kosova Press news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cars draped in red and black Albanian flags drove
through the town, 40 miles southeast of Pristina, to celebrate his
return.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani's friends were always confident he would come back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right is on our side,'' Hebibi said.

<HEADLINE> Financial adviser to the stars informs court he now wants to be anagent  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A financial adviser charged with ripping off his
clients has been freed on $1 million bail to begin what his lawyer
said was a new career as an entertainment agent.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lewis said the government strongly
opposed Dana Giacchetto's new career choice. He said it was an
''alarming proposition'' that Giacchetto could make his living by
charging substantial fees, after he allegedly swindled millions of
dollars from a world of celebrities which included Leonardo
DiCaprio, Ben Stiller and Courtney Cox Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Levander, Giacchetto's lawyer, said his client was trying
''to put his life back together'' by using his contacts in the
entertainment business to help actors and actresses get movie deals
or other business.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck that
Giacchetto should be limited to local travel and discouraged from
his new profession. Lewis said it was likely Giacchetto would
continue to steal from clients as an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Giacchetto's assets have been frozen, the judge was
reluctant to interfere, saying: ''Assuming Mr. Giacchetto can get
on a Greyhound bus, stay in a Motel 6 with the last suit he owns on
his back, go schmooze with someone in California in the business,
why should we all care?''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the judge even suggested that nobody ''in their
right mind will make a deal with him with the current charges.''
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges Giacchetto, 37, stole as much as $5
million from the band Phish and its members and a million dollars
more from others while misappropriating as much as $20 million
entrusted to him.
</P>
<P>
   He also was accused of issuing fake portfolio statements and
other false documents to clients who wanted proof of their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto is charged with securities fraud and with making
false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If
convicted, he could face a decade in prison and $12 million in
fines.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly committed the crimes while serving celebrities
including Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz and singer Alanis Morrisette
with an investment business, The Cassandra Group, run from a SoHo
loft.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money allegedly went to support a lavish lifestyle
that Lewis said demonstrated ''a pattern of extraordinary
brazenness by Mr. Giacchetto with other people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed to let Giacchetto travel around the country if
he first obtains permission from the government, observing that ''a
lot of the business is based on the schmooze factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The schmooze factor is that business,'' agreed Levander, who
said it was critical that Giacchetto be permitted to go to dinners
where he could broker deals.
</P>
<P>
   Peck set bail at $1 million for Giacchetto, who surrendered to
the FBI Tuesday morning in Manhattan, just hours after returning
from a trip abroad. His passport was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Giacchetto nodded his head frequently as his lawyer
spoke and his parents watched from the gallery, agreeing to put up
a Medford, Mass., home valued at $500,000 to secure bail.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Giacchetto refused to comment to reporters.

<HEADLINE> Canada Proposes Angola Resolution  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Canada has proposed a Security Council
resolution calling on members to consider in six months whether to
impose sanctions against countries that have helped Angola's UNITA
rebels evade a U.N. ban on arms and diamond exports.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's U.N. Ambassador Robert Fowler, the current Security
Council president, acknowledged Tuesday that the issue of whether
to ''sanction the sanctions-busters'' is likely to generate heated
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a U.N. report by an independent panel detailed how
rebels bought weapons from Eastern Europe, primarily Bulgaria, and
had them shipped via African countries in exchange for gems -- in
violation of U.N. sanctions imposed in 1993 and expanded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which visited 30 countries over six months, accuses
the presidents of Burkina Faso and Togo and the late Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of receiving diamonds for helping UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi with arms and fuel shipments in violation of
the sanctions. It also accuses Rwanda of allowing UNITA to conduct
guns-for-gems transactions and Belgium of allowing rogue dealers to
trade UNITA gems with virtually no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   African governments vehemently denied the allegations, demanded
evidence to substantiate them and questioned the report's reliance
on testimony from rebel defectors. France also demanded answers
about the panel's sources, and the lack of specific dates when
alleged violations occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Canada's call to impose sanctions on violators
would likely elicit opposition from these countries. Even a vague
reference to consider sanctions at a future date would be a
significant leap for the council, regardless of whether measures
were ever imposed, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the draft resolution, Fowler said the Security Council's
decision on whether to impose sanctions would be based on three
considerations -- the independent panel's report, information
provided by the alleged violators, and establishment of an
inspection mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the basis of those three things, the council would decide
whether or not to proceed against sanctions-busters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler chairs the U.N. sanctions committee on Angola, and with
Canada holding the rotating Security Council presidency in April,
he is pushing for agreement on a resolution to implement the nearly
40 recommendation made by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said the bulk of the Canadian draft merely
puts into resolution form the panel's recommendation on better
implementing sanctions, such as calls for governments to register
and monitor the activities of arms brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most significant elements of the draft are its calls for
the council to consider sanctioning the violators and a proposed
monitoring mechanism to keep watch over implementation of
sanctions, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said they did not anticipate major opposition to a
long-term monitoring system, although financing would be an issue
that had to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said Canada envisions using inspectors to carry on the
panel's investigative work and ''to make sure that people indeed do
the things that they say they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal that Angola sanctions busters be sanctioned has
major implications for other U.N. sanctions, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it makes sense to sanction sanctions-busters with respect
to Angola, why not with respect to Iraq or anywhere else?'' he
asked.

<HEADLINE> Solo Rower Rescued in Pacific  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- For 61 grueling days, Jo Le Guen
rowed and rowed in a daring bid to cross the Pacific under oar
power. By this week, his dream was shattered and his boat abandoned
to the waves.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Frenchman set off on his solo trans-Pacific
voyage to help save the oceans by raising awareness of their
pollution. On Monday, close to physical collapse, he had to be
saved from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted and suffering ischemia, or lack of blood flow, in the
toes, Le Guen was picked up by the P&AMP;O Nedlloyd-owned Palliser Bay,
which had been sent to one of the world's most remote spots to
deliver medical supplies to him.
</P>
<P>
   As Le Guen waited on board, being treated with antibiotics and
morphine, authorities in New Zealand and Chile were drawing up a
rescue plan that will likely involve a Chilean navy helicopter
flying out to evacuate him once the Palliser Bay gets into range
for the return flight -- most likely early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Le Guen was not available for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not able to speak to anybody, he has not spoken to
anybody since he has been on the (container) boat,'' Clare Pinder,
one of his New Zealand-based support staff, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;O Nedlloyd spokesman Andrew Taylor said the ship's crew made
brief contact with New Zealand early today and did not indicate Le
Guen's condition had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is fairly nerve-racking for all concerned in terms of the
stability of his health,'' Taylor said. ''But there was nothing
from the ship this morning to indicate any change in his health.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been feared that Le Guen was suffering blood poisoning or
even gangrene.
</P>
<P>
   Le Guen, a father of five, had hoped to row from Wellington to
Cape Horn in Chile. He abandoned the effort 61 days and one-third
of the distance into his 5,580 mile trip.
</P>
<P>
   Le Guen's toes were damaged by rubbing from foot straps he used
while rowing. He tried to soothe his feet in the glacial salt
water, aggravating his condition.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, Dr. Rene Paule, his doctor, urged him to abandon his
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was suffering like a martyr. He left the decision to
withdraw until the last moment,'' Le Guen's wife, Marie-Claire,
told the French daily Liberation. ''But for a while, he'd been
thinking that it would be difficult to make it to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of deep sea fishermen, Le Guen rowed eight
hours a day and slept in his so-called ''coffin-bed,'' a 24-inch
wide frame in the center of the boat. His kitchen was a small gas
heater, on which he prepared tea, coffee, soup and freeze-dried
meals.
</P>
<P>
   His 30-foot boat ''Keepitblue'' boasted electric equipment
powered by batteries charged by solar panels and two windmills. He
propelled himself with 9-foot oars.

<HEADLINE> Vargas Llosa Novel Causes Stir  </HEADLINE>
By RAMON ALMANZAR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- A new novel by Mario
Vargas Llosa is stirring controversy with its portrayal of the
personal and political excesses of a slain Dominican dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ''La Fiesta del Chivo'' (''The Goat's Party'') tells of
Dominican parents offering their daughters to the feared dictator
Rafael Trujillo in return for promotions and choice jobs. It also
portrays Trujillo's son Ramfis seducing a high school student and
sharing her with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   The book's local publisher, Editora Taller, has defended the
novel, published last month in Spain, as a work of historical
fiction. But many historians say it twists too many facts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes personal references to situations that have yet to be
proved,'' Dominican historian Ramon Font Bernad said in a
television interview this week. He said Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian
writer who is one of Latin America's most respected authors, had
''offended'' the Dominican people.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo remains a controversial figure in the Dominican
Republic long after the 1961 assassination that ended his 31-year
rule. Ramfis Trujillo held power for a few months after his
father's death before being forced into exile with the rest of the
Trujillo family.
</P>
<P>
   In Vargas Llosa's book, Urania Cabral, the daughter of a
Dominican senator, relives events of Trujillo's rule during a visit
to Santo Domingo in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas Llosa has admitted the book is mostly fictional, saying
his aim was ''to tell well-founded lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What appealed to me was not the phenomenon of the dictatorship
itself, but some of its characteristics,'' the Spanish news agency
EFE reported him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Euclides Gutierrez Felix, the son of one of Trujillo's closest
allies, Capt. Euclides Gutierrez Abreu, has said there is no truth
to the stories of sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   Among Vargas Llosa's defenders is Dominican writer Andres Mateo,
who said elements of the novel should be seen as symbolic, not
factual.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an extremely severe portrait of a very difficult time,''
Mateo said. ''There was no cranny of social existence where the
oppressive symbols of (Trujillo's) power were not present, and the
novel reflects that with much rawness.''
</P>
<P>
   Editora Taller said Vargas Llosa -- who spent months in Santo
Domingo researching the work -- will visit the Dominican Republic on
April 26 to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   A former journalist with Peruvian and French newspapers and
television, Vargas Llosa is best known for his novels ''The Green
House,'' ''The War of the End of the World'' and ''Conversation in
the Cathedral.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Keeps Democrats Off-Balance  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the two most emotional foreign policy
issues now before Congress, the China trade deal and the fate of
6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez, Democrats are torn.
</P>
<P>
   And in both cases, the party's presumptive standard bearer, Vice
President Al Gore, isn't making life any easier for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Elian, Gore broke with the Clinton administration -- and
congressional Democratic leaders -- in voicing support for a bill to
block the boy's deportation by granting him permanent U.S.
residency status.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Gore gave off mixed signals until he and the
administration insisted they were both on the same page behind
legislation to grant China permanent normal trading privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill is being strongly opposed by organized
labor, a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Gore has pledged to work alongside President
Clinton for the package, what many see as his lukewarm support --
based on meetings earlier this year with labor leaders -- has given
a degree of political cover to fence-sitting Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., plans to schedule a House
vote on the China trade deal the week of May 22-27, sponsors of the
legislation said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That heartened backers of the bill, who fear that delaying the
vote into the summer could make it harder to win passage, with
election campaigns heating up.
</P>
<P>
   In both the China trade and Elian Gonzalez matter, vote counting
has been difficult, sponsors of both bills suggest.
</P>
<P>
   On highly charged measures on which it isn't even clear there'll
be a vote, ''It is always difficult to get your colleagues to tell
you where they stand,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., a major
sponsor of both citizenship and residency bills for the Gonzalez
boy. He suggested Gore's support would help -- but it was difficult
to assess how much.
</P>
<P>
   By anyone's tally, there are a lot of undecided House Democrats
on China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Their ranks include Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
and Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a whole slew of undecideds. A lot of them still don't
think there's really going to be a vote -- so why commit?'' said
Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., a leading advocate for more trade
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore later reaffirmed his support for action this year
on the accord the administration negotiated with China, some labor
leaders suggested he had hinted he could negotiate a better
agreement as president with stronger worker and environmental
protections.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to throw some uncertainty into the House
equation. Opponents welcomed Gore's apparent ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend to China the same low-tariff trading
privileges now granted to other major U.S. trade partners. The
''permanent normal trade relations'' would end annual votes on
China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a package the Clinton administration negotiated
in November to help ease Beijing's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based organization that settles global
trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will not vote directly on China's WTO membership. In
fact, trade-bill supporters argue that its rejection could lead to
a situation in which American firms are shut out of Chinese
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade package has ''become a lightning rod for
everybody's dissatisfaction with everything,'' Clinton suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the second ranking House Democrat
and a leading opponent of the China trade package, predicts that as
many as 150 of the House's 211 Democrats will vote against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   That includes 98 who voted ''no'' last year to granting China
annual trade benefits. However, Bonior has only been able to
identify 19 Democrats who voted for annual renewal before who say
they'll vote ''no'' to permanent benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to suggest we're 100 percent going to beat this
thing,'' Bonior said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a difficult one for many Democrats -- in a year in
which Democrats hope to retain the White House and recapture the
House.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is going to swing any votes in favor of the China trade
bill, he may have to work harder than he has on the Elian Gonzalez
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said last Friday it
was too early to say what impact Gore's support might have. But
asked on Tuesday if Gore's stance had changed any Democratic votes,
Daschle responded, ''Not that I know of.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Remains Ratings Leader  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ABC is looking like a million bucks in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The network has been the most-watched for 14 consecutive weeks --
its longest winning streak in 21 years -- and ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' is fueling the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The three editions of Regis Philbin's quiz show ranked No. 1,
No. 2 and No. 3 last week and helped draw viewers to other ABC
series, including the new ''Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatric hospital drama, which followed Thursday night's
installment of ''Millionaire,'' drew an average 13.2 million
viewers to rank 25th among programs for the week of March 27 to
April 2.
</P>
<P>
   That's less than half the number of viewers that watched
''Millionaire'' that night -- about 29 million -- but ''Wonderland''
still managed to boost ABC's showing in the time period by 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The network also fared well with ''The Audrey Hepburn Story,''
starring Jennifer Love Hewitt as the actress. The TV movie ranked
12th among programs and won Monday night for ABC, according to
Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina State-Florida NCAA game gave CBS its
highest-rated Saturday since the Final Four game of a year ago.
This year's contest was watched by more than 15 million viewers and
ranked 14th among all programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the men's basketball tournament, which saw a number of
powerhouse teams quickly eliminated, ended lamely. There were
record low ratings for Monday night's concluding contest in which
Michigan State defeated Florida.
</P>
<P>
   NBC enjoyed success with the second outing of the Thursday night
sitcom ''Daddio,'' which ranked ninth for the week, drew 15.2
million viewers and retained most of its lead-in audience from
''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had an average rating of 9.3 and a 16 share,
followed by CBS with an 8.3 rating and 14 share. NBC's 7.5 rating
and 13 share put it third, with Fox posting a 5.6 rating, 9 share.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newer networks, UPN had a 2.6 rating, 4 share, WB
earned a 2.1 rating, 3 share, and Pax had a 0.8 rating and 1 share.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' had a slight lead in viewers, drawing
10.1 million compared to 9.95 million for ABC's ''World News
Tonight,'' while the two broadcasts had a matching 7.4 rating and
16 share. The ''CBS Evening News'' had 8.4 million viewers, with a
6.3 rating and 13 share.
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 shows, their networks and ratings for the week were:
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 19.4; ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 18.8; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 16.6; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 13.9;
''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.8; ''Touched by an Angel,'' CBS, 11.9;
''Friends,'' NBC, 11.3; ''Law &AMP; Order,'' NBC, 10.7; ''Daddio,''
NBC, 10.6; ''Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ABC, 10.5.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ponders High-Tech Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With advice from billionaire Bill Gates and
Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, President Clinton is
exploring the idea that computers and the Internet are the best
tools ever available to combat world poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology can be the greatest equalizing force our society or
any other has ever known,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Clinton was hosting a White House conference of two dozen
Wall Street gurus, economists, thinkers and high-tech entrepreneurs
about how to keep America's economy strong and spread prosperity to
neglected poverty pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose was to demonstrate ''that we're all continuing to
focus like a laser beam on the economy, as the president promised
to do when he came into office,'' said Gene Sperling, director of
the president's National Economic Council. ''And that means not
sitting around and patting yourself on the back because of the
unemployment and inflation rates being low.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, the founder of Microsoft, sits down at the White House
two days after a federal judge ruled that the software giant
violated antitrust laws by stifling competition. He was meeting
with members of Congress before seeing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the White House supports the Justice Department's
suit against Microsoft but that Gates ''has much to offer in terms
of his point of view. We aren't endorsing or necessarily
disagreeing with all sorts of things people are going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates was to speak at a panel called, ''Closing the global
divide: strategies for health, education and technology.'' Gates
and his wife Melinda have donated $750 million to help protect poor
children around the world against disease.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to the White House, Gates was expected to attend
closed meetings on Capitol Hill with House Republicans, Senate
Republican leaders, Senate Democrats and Washington state House
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill meetings were set up to discuss education,
trade and other high-tech issues, not the antitrust case, although
the antitrust issue is certain to come up in lawmakers' questions,
said Tovah Ravitz, spokeswoman for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Greenspan was to lead a discussion on
technology's impact on the economy. Clinton addressed the same
subject Tuesday when he talked about the ''digital divide'' between
computer haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the computer and the Internet give us a chance
to move more people out of poverty more quickly than at any time in
all of human history,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He announced he would spend two days traveling from Palo Alto,
Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley, to Chicago, site of a computer
conference. The trip, scheduled for April 17-18, would focus
attention on efforts to help poor people gain computer skills and
access to high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would make the case that new technologies ''can
be an incredible tool of empowerment in schools, homes, businesses,
community centers and every other part of our civic life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's White House conference comes on the heels of two days of
turbulence in the stock market. But the administration professed no
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we have about the lowest unemployment rate we've had
in 30 years,'' Sperling said. ''We've seen remarkable productivity
growth, we've seen very high levels of business investment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ''the new economy is doing quite well. And I do not
think that one should judge the strength of the fundamentals of our
economy based on the movement of the market over a one-day or even
a one-month period.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues addressed at the White House conference were
raised by protesters last December in Seattle, where they disrupted
meetings of the World Trade Organization to highlight their
complaints that the poor in many nations were being left behind in
the current global economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Today's conference occurs a week before many of the Seattle
protest groups are scheduled to stage demonstrations in conjunction
with the spring meetings in Washington of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Audit: Schools Lose Millions in Aid  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicaid payments meant for schools that
provide counseling, hearing tests and other health care for poor
children are being siphoned off by states and consultants, leaving
some schools with a small fraction of their share, congressional
auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said it found schools in one state
ended up with less than a dime for every dollar spent on health
care services for poor students.
</P>
<P>
   Because states are retaining a portion of Medicaid
reimbursements, they may be ignoring questionable billing practices
at consulting firms, which commonly charge commissions of between 9
percent and 12 percent of what they bill, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Embedded in ... these practices are incentives for states and
private firms to experiment with 'creative' billing practices, some
of which we have found to be improper,'' the GAO auditors said in a
report being released today at Senate Finance Committee hearing.
The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, under the advice of private billing companies, charged
Medicaid for groups of services, not all of which actually were
provided to students, auditors said. Schools also billed for
activities that are not covered by Medicaid and didn't provide
adequate documentation to justify other billings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials acknowledged that there have been problems
with the Medicaid reimbursements and said new policies have been
initiated to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 million school-aged children are eligible for Medicaid,
the federal health program for low-income Americans that is funded
with state and federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are entitled to federal reimbursements to recover their
costs of providing health care for these children. Expenses
incurred while enrolling kids in the program and arranging their
appointments are also reimbursable. States spent $2.3 billion for
school-based health care in the latest years for which data were
available, 1998 and 1999, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Many have hired billing firms that promise big returns. The GAO
said the arrangements with consultants, made both by states and
school districts, are creating ''an environment for opportunism
that drains funds away from their intended purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen states kept part of the reimbursements, including seven
that kept between 50 percent and 85 percent of the federal money,
the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials told GAO auditors that states are entitled to
some of the reimbursements because state funds support local school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors said the practices resulted in schools getting back
less than what they spent on care for Medicaid eligible children.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a school district may receive as little as $7.50
in federal reimbursement for every $100 spent, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors also found $28 million in improper payments in Michigan
and questioned an additional $33 million in reimbursements.
Michigan school districts hired consultants at accounting firm
Deloitte Touche for billing, according to state officials. A
message left with the company's public affairs office was not
returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, consultants arranged for school districts to submit
$16.6 million in claims that inadequately documented why schools
used skilled medical people to perform administrative activities.
The GAO report did not specify which consultants were used. State
officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Westmoreland, director at the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicaid, said the agency has taken
steps to prevent improper claims and asked some states to pay back
inappropriate payments.
</P>
<P>
   The states the GAO said had retained some portion of federal
reimbursements for schools included New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware,
Vermont, Alaska, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Connecticut,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, New Mexico, Ohio, Utah, Colorado,
Massachusetts and Minnesota.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Promising early results from a new
treatment for skin cancer are raising hopes that a clever approach
called antisense therapy may pay off in fighting the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been talking about antisense technology -- which
zeros in on a cancer gene to halt malignancy at its roots -- for
more than a decade. But on Tuesday, they described the first cases
in which the technique actually seemed to slow a deadly malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Testing is still early, and doctors do not know whether the
treatment will pan out. But a large international study is starting
to settle this.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all been waiting for something like this. It's very
exciting,'' commented Peter Jones, director of the USC/Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, code-named G3139, was developed by Genta Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., which financed the research. The preliminary
results were released in San Francisco at a meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   All cancers spring from genetic errors. Often, ordinary genes
turn into killers when they develop glitches in their code that
make them churn out dangerously mutant proteins. Others simply get
stuck in the ''on'' position, producing large amounts of normal
proteins that help cancers grow.
</P>
<P>
   One of these overproducing genes is called bcl-2. Its protein
protects cancer cells from apoptosis, the normal process that
triggers the death of defective and worn-out cells. Many
chemotherapy drugs attack cancer by making them launch this dying
process.
</P>
<P>
   The bcl-2 gene runs in overdrive in 90 percent of all cases of
melanoma, the deadly form of skin cancer that strikes about 26,000
Americans annually. As a result, the cancer is shielded from the
killing power of chemotherapy as well as from the body's own
surveillance system against tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The Genta drug slows the production of bcl-2 protein.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a novel concept designed to make melanoma respond better
to chemotherapy,'' said Dr. Burkhard Jansen of the University of
Vienna in Austria, who directed a study on 16 patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is called an antisense oligonucleotide. All genes
convert their information into RNA, which carries the blueprint for
constructing proteins. The drug is a short stretch of genetic
material that is a mirror image of the RNA. This reverse image has
a natural attraction to the RNA. It latches onto it and disables
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jansen's team tested the treatment on patients with
advance-stage melanoma who had failed to respond to other
treatments. Doctors gave them G3139 followed by dacarbazine, a
standard chemotherapy medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the patients, a 90-year-old woman, responded about three
months ago with complete disappearance of her spreading cancer. In
two others, more than half of the cancer went away, and three
others have had lesser responses.
</P>
<P>
   The patients have survived an average of more than nine months
so far. Their expected survival is four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''These cells are very resistant to chemotherapy,'' noted Dr.
John Mendelsohn of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Dallas. ''If you can potentiate chemotherapy in melanoma,
you've done something very important. The fact that this happened
is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   A new study involving about 300 melanoma patients is expected to
begin this month in the United States, Canada, Europe and
Australia. Patients will be randomly assigned to get either G3139
plus dacarbazine or dacarbazine alone.
</P>
<P>
   Antisense was once considered to be a hot area of cancer
research. However, it fell from favor after scientists were unable
to duplicate promising test tube results in people.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach appears to work because the synthetic genetic
material is able to penetrate cells but is not immediately broken
down by the body.
</P>
<P>
   Overproduction of the bcl-2 protein is involved in a variety of
cancers. Researchers say the same antisense medicine might also be
useful against other malignancies, including lymphoma and prostate,
breast and small-cell lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say this is just one of many new approaches that are
precisely tailored to exploit weaknesses in cancer cells. Unlike
ordinary chemotherapy, which broadly attacks all fast-growing
cells, these treatments often have few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   These treatments result from a basic understanding of how tumors
evade the normal body controls that prevent unwanted growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the beginning of an enormous payoff in the nation's
investment in cancer research,'' said Dr. William N. Hait, director
of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Aids Diabetes Medicine  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Some diabetics can make significant improvement
by taking a drug combination that includes a chemical cousin of
Rezulin, which was recently linked to 61 deaths, researchers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, rosiglitazone, is believed to be safer than Rezulin,
which was withdrawn from the market last month after it was linked
to liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   The new study of 348 people with adult-onset diabetes found no
liver problems among patients who took rosiglitazone along with the
standard drug metformin hydrochloride for six months.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 million Americans have adult-onset, or type 2,
diabetes. It impedes the body's ability to produce and use insulin,
a hormone that processes blood sugar. Diabetes can lead to kidney
failure, blindness and nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, found that three times more patients taking 8 mg of
rosiglitazone in addition to metformin reached desirable
blood-sugar levels than those taking only metformin.
</P>
<P>
   Metformin, sold as Glucophage, reduces sugar produced by the
liver. Rosiglitazone, sold as Avandia, makes the body more
sensitive to insulin.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals,
which makes Avandia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Nathan, a diabetes expert at Harvard Medical School,
said the combination studied appears to be a good substitute
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He said the benefits noted in the study were ''modest, not
huge'' and not surprising given that previous research showed
Rezulin and metformin worked better together than alone.

<HEADLINE> Study Furthers Diet Drug-Heart Link  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have again linked the diet drugs
Redux and fen-phen to heart-valve problems but also reported today
that the problems are rarely serious.
</P>
<P>
   Dieters who took the drugs for more than three months were more
than twice as likely to have developed mild heart-valve
abnormalities than a control group who took no diet drugs, the
authors reported in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association. The results were first reported in November 1998 at a
meeting of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Redux and fenfluramine were removed from the market in 1997
because of concern over possible heart-valve problems. Phentermine,
the other half of the fen-phen combination, hasn't been linked to
such problems when taken alone and remains available.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen studies on the drugs' effects have generally
found serious heart problems are rare, especially with short-term
use. Three studies published last fall, including a Mayo Clinic
report, suggested that in some cases the valve problems disappeared
after patients stopped taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Dr. Julius Gardin, a University of California-Irvine
cardiologist, the authors of the latest study looked at 1,473
patients nationwide who had taken the drugs for an average of six
months or more.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of fen-phen users and 11 percent of Redux users
who took the drugs for more than three months had mildly leaky
heart valves, compared with 4 percent of nonusers.
</P>
<P>
   The study was sponsored by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the maker
of Redux and Pondimin -- the trade name for fenfluramine. Wyeth says
that when the drugs were on the market, most users took them for
three months or less.
</P>
<P>
   A journal editorial suggests that the study may underestimate
the initial prevalence of heart-valve problems, since many patients
weren't assessed until several months after using the drugs and the
problems may improve over time.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- New York Yankees third baseman Scott
Brosius strained a rib cage muscle taking batting practice Tuesday
night and will be placed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   After a 5-3 win over Anaheim, manager Joe Torre said Brosius
will go on the disabled list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius was scratched from the starting lineup after hurting

<HEADLINE> Study May Link Milk, Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Consuming lots of milk and other dairy
products may modestly raise the risk of prostate cancer,
researchers suggest in a large study.
</P>
<P>
   While the case is far from settled, researchers say the study at
least raises questions about the usual assumption that getting
plenty of calcium from supplements and food is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not, based on this study, recommend that men drastically
change their intake of dairy foods,'' said June Chan, an
epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, researchers note that a few other studies have
found similar results, and together they suggest a need for more
rigorous examination of calcium's effects on health.
</P>
<P>
   Chan presented the results Tuesday in San Francisco at a meeting
of the American Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on the Physicians' Health Study, a
landmark study that proved that aspirin prevents heart attacks.
Between 1982 and 1984, 20,885 male doctors were questioned about
their eating habits, including their consumption of skim milk,
whole milk, cheese and ice cream. During the next 10 years, 904 of
them developed prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that men who consumed at least 2{ servings
of dairy food daily were about 30 percent more likely to develop
prostate cancer than were those who averaged less than half a
serving a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a weak correlation, but there is some scientific reason
to believe it,'' said biologist Donald Coffey of Johns Hopkins
University, a prostate cancer expert.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have shown that calcium can lower the body's
levels of the most active form of vitamin D, known as 1,25
dihydroxyvitamin D, and this vitamin in turn may help protect
against prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, of course, is a rich source of calcium. And even though it
is fortified with vitamin D, the calcium in milk might actually
lower the body's supply of the active form of the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study found that men who consumed more than six
glasses of milk a week had lower levels of this form of vitamin D
in their bloodstreams than those who drank less than two.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research from the same team found an even stronger link.
That work, called the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, found
that men who consumed high amounts of dairy products had a 70
percent increased risk of prostate cancer. Those who also took
calcium supplements had about a threefold increase.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the reports ''add a little caution about
increasing consumption of milk and calcium supplements,'' Dr.
Edward Giovannucci, a co-author of the studies. ''We ought to
understand the potential downside.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Owner Standing Trial in Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A man accused of carelessly storing the
handgun that authorities say a 6-year-old boy used to kill a
classmate will stand trial on an involuntary manslaughter charge.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge John Conover made the ruling Tuesday, calling the
living arrangements for the boy and his brother a ''time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was living with his 8-year-old brother, his 22-year-old
uncle and defendant Jamelle James, 19, when he found James' gun and
took it to Buell Elementary School, prosecutors said. The boy used
it Feb. 29 to fatally shoot first-grade classmate Kayla Rolland,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's absolutely as negligent as you get,'' the judge said in
court. ''What in the world did the defendant expect to happen''
with a loaded gun in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who feeds them? Who clothes them? Who disciplines them? Who
nurtures them? Who says 'I love you' before they go to bed and when
they get up? No one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who has not been charged, testified in the preliminary
hearing last week that he had seen James playing with the gun, a
.32-caliber semiautomatic pistol, and demonstrated how James
twirled it in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he had seen the gun and some quarters in a shoebox
in James' room.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he remembered Kayla being shot, but when asked if
he shot her, he shook his head ''no,'' and blamed another boy to
whom he said he had given the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't playing with the gun, I wasn't,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge bound James over for trial at the conclusion of the
preliminary hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers pointed to James' roommate and the boy's uncle,
Sir Marcus Winfrey, as the owner of the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''So Marcus Winfrey was buying the bullet, buying the holster.
Whose gun do you think it was?'' attorney Bob Polasek said. ''I
think it's clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal grand jurors last month indicted James; Winfrey, 22; and
Robert Lee Morris III, 19, all of nearby Mount Morris Township, on
charges that they possessed stolen firearms and unlawfully used
marijuana while possessing the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' mother faces child neglect charges. She had left her
sons at the house because she was evicted from her home about nine
days before the shooting.

Post Office Halts Holiday Stamps   
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If this year's Christmas stamps seem a lot
like those from last year, don't blame your memory -- the post
office has decided to use up its leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with stocks of more than 100 million 20-stamp holiday
booklets, the Postal Service announced Tuesday that it has decided
to postpone the new Christmas stamps planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than printing new holiday designs for 2000, we believe
it is a good business decision to exhaust our current inventories
of 1999 holiday stamps and supplement them with a small reprint of
one design,'' said James Tolbert, executive director of stamp
services.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled Thanksgiving stamp is also being delayed. With a
1-cent rate increase likely next year, the agency decided it was
better to postpone the Thanksgiving stamp rather than have it
become outdated in a new months. Thanksgiving is to be part of a
series of holiday stamps that also includes the previously issued
Kwanzaa and Hanukkah stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas stamps being postponed are traditional design
depicting Jan Gossaert's painting ''Madonna and Child,'' and the
contemporary version featuring four images of Santa.
</P>
<P>
   There are still supplies of Christmas stamps left from last
year, he said, including a design featuring Bartolomeo Vivarini's
''Madonna and Child.'' The contemporary design with a stylized
antique-gold deer set against one of four different colored
backgrounds will be reprinted, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Postal spokesman Don Smeraldi said the agency has 53 million
20-stamp booklets of each design leftover. Because the deer stamps
were popular last year and are expected to again do well, he said
another 75 million booklets of that issue will be printed for use
this holiday season.

<HEADLINE> Auditors Fault Pentagon Labs  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon research labs disclosed technical
data of potential military value to Chinese, Russian and other
foreign visitors in recent years without determining first whether
export licenses were required, an internal audit by the Defense
Department inspector general says.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of a series of reports required by Congress, the
inspector general's office said it reviewed cases in which foreign
visitors had seen or been briefed about computer software or
technology. Under U.S. export administration rules, any such
provision of information is deemed to be an export to the home
country of the visitor.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that Defense Department laboratories and other
research facilities did not have in place procedures for
determining whether export licenses were required. In fact, the
auditors found that the Army, Navy and Air Force were not even
aware of the concept of deemed exports.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional concern about the unauthorized or unintended
spread of militarily useful U.S. technology came to a head last
year when Wen Ho Lee, a former scientist at the Energy Department's
Los Alamos National Laboratory, was fired after being investigated
for possible espionage. He was not charged with espionage but was
charged with 59 counts of mishandling classified material.
</P>
<P>
   Among facilities that the Pentagon inspector general audited was
the Army Communications-Electronics Command at Fort Monmouth, N.J.
It had more than 4,300 foreign visitors in 1998-99, including seven
people from China. Auditors found no export license or other
documents there that would describe the specifics of the Chinese
visit or technical information released to them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, for a November 1999 visit by two Russians to the
aircraft division of the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake,
Calif., no export license or other documentation could be found by
the auditors. The Russians were there to discuss issues regarding
aeronautics systems, which the Defense Security Service identified
in 1999 as one of the four technology areas most sought by foreign
entities. The others were lasers and sensors, information systems
and explosives and detonators.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general asked the Defense Department to comment on
the findings by May 15.

<HEADLINE> President Johnson Pressured Israel  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Johnson administration opposed Israeli
reprisals against Syria-backed terrorist attacks in the mid-1960s,
advising Israel to take its complaints to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Golda Meir complained, newly declassified U.S.
documents say, and was told Israel could not be considered an
injured party if it were to retaliate. Meir responded she was not
interested in Israel being considered an injured party; she did not
want Israel to be injured at all.
</P>
<P>
   This account appeared in a summary of the documents released
Monday by the office of the State Department historian.
</P>
<P>
   According to the account, terrorism on Israel's borders with
Lebanon and Jordan was the work of independent Palestinian
terrorist groups, chiefly Yasser Arafat's Fatah, which had Syria's
support.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1966, Israel retaliated with a large-scale raid into
Jordan, angering U.S. policy-makers, who said Israel knew Jordan
had tried to prevent such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The United States voted for a U.N. Security Council resolution
that censured Israel, and President Johnson authorized a warning to
Israel that U.S. military shipments would be suspended if Israel
carried out another raid.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
worried about a threat of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East,
pressured Israel to promise not to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy failed. A White House emissary sent to Tel Aviv
reported back to Washington that Israel was a tougher bargainer
even then the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Israel refused to make a commitment it considered dangerous to
its national security, the declassified documents said.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was a drive by Israel to acquire U.S. weapons. It had
received surface-to-air Hawk missiles from the Kennedy
administration in 1962 in a sale that was a departure from U.S.
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was worried about ''the likely Arab reaction
and the impact of a sale on U.S. interests in the Near East and
influence in the Arab world,'' according to a summary of the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his advisers had agreed to sell U.S. tanks to Jordan
while advising Israel that it should buy tanks it wanted from
Germany or Britain. The United States, Israel was told, would not
even consider a weapons sale unless Israel accepted four
conditions:
</P>
<P>
   --Tell its supporters in the United States that it accepted sale
of tanks to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   --Promise not to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   --Agree to Atomic Energy Agency inspection of its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   --Agree not to take pre-emptive action against Arab projects to
divert Jordan River water.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Rusk cabled the chief U.S. emissary,
Undersecretary of State W. Averill Harriman, that Rusk and Johnson
thought it was time for Israel to make hard decisions, the newly
published documents said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are limits beyond which we cannot go in support of
Israel,'' Rusk told Harriman, while informing him the cable
reflected Johnson's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel would not budge, despite what Harriman described as
a Rusk presentation that was ''to the point of rudeness,'' Johnson
decided to sell Israel military equipment comparable to what the
United States was providing Jordan.

<HEADLINE> 'Partial Birth' Abortions Considered  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Courting a third presidential veto on the
subject, the Republican-controlled House is ready to pass
politically-charged legislation banning ''partial birth''
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep hoping the president will see the light on this,''
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said Tuesday, on the eve of a vote on
the measure, expected to gain more than the two-thirds majority
needed to overturn a promised veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have this debate is pure politics,'' countered Rep. Nita
Lowey, a New York Democrat and supporter of abortion rights. The
Republican leadership, she added, is ''just taking a political
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors say the measure, similar to a bill passed last fall in
the Senate, is designed to abolish a certain type of late-term
procedure in which a fetus is partially delivered, then aborted.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents counter that, as written, the bill would apply far
more broadly, thus undermining a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that
granted women the right to abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is voting on the measure at the same time the Supreme
Court is prepared to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a
''partial birth'' ban enacted in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no direct connection between the court case and
the pending legislation, sponsors say the measure before the House
was crafted to meet objections of federal appeals court judges who
said the Nebraska statute failed to meet constitutional standards.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the House bill seeks to ban abortions in which a
doctor ''vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living fetus
until the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother'' and
''kills the fetus while the intact living fetus is partially
outside the body of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions would be in cases in which the life of the
mother was threatened, and Democrats were discussing Tuesday night
whether to seek to a broader exceptions to include women whose
physical health were jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining their majority in the House and Senate in 1994,
Republicans have twice pushed ''partial birth'' measures to Clinton
desk, causing political anguish in the process for many Democrats
who favor abortion rights but found the bills impossible to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has voted for similar
bills in the past, for example, and will do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vetoed two ''partial birth'' bills in the past and
has served notice he will do so again, calling on Congress to
provide for exceptions in the case of potential harm to a woman's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Both previous vetoes were overridden in the House before being
narrowly sustained in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome this time, Canady offered one prediction:
''I can't say that we're going to hear any new arguments.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos-Rams Opens Monday Night FB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL is again opening the season with the
last two Super Bowl winners playing on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos and St. Louis Rams will cap the opening week
of the 2000 season in St. Louis on Monday night Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams will start the defense of their title, while the
Broncos will try to rebound from an injury-plagued 6-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   That game and a Sunday night meeting in Buffalo between the
Bills and the Tennessee Titans highlight the first weekend of the
NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills-Titans game is a reprise of the ''Music City Miracle''
in the first round of last season's playoffs, won by the Titans on
a last play lateral on a kickoff return. Tennessee later beat
Indianapolis and Jacksonville and went on to the Super Bowl, where
they lost to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' opening game will be their first Monday night
appearance since 1991, the beginning of a decade of futility that
ended when they turned a 4-12 record in 1998 into an NFL title last
season. It will be the third straight season Denver, the 1998 Super
Bowl champs, has opened on a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, which because of the demise of several traditional
powers was hurt last year by poor prime-time matchups late in the
season, is trying to ensure that won't happen again. Next year, the
league is considering leaving some Monday nights open to switch the
games with the most interest.
</P>
<P>
   The next-to-last Monday night game features St. Louis at Tampa
Bay, a rematch of last season's NFC title game, which was played in
St. Louis. The final game, on Christmas night, pits Dallas at
Tennessee -- the Cowboys always get an audience even if they are
mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Another note of the volatility of the schedule: San Francisco,
which fell to 4-12 last season after nearly two decades of
dominance, does not have a prime-time game for the first time since
1981, the year they won the first of five Super Bowls.

Anti-Confederate Flag March Resumes   
By PETE IACOBELLI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLS, S.C. (AP) -- Normally they are rivals. On Tuesday,
however, South Carolina coaches Eddie Fogler and Lou Holtz marched
with Clemson's Larry Shyatt and Tommy Bowden, united to say the
Confederate flag should be lowered from atop the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt it was important to be here. It's just one person
expressing one opinion that the flag needs to come down,'' said
Fogler, the school's basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   The 120-mile march that began in Charleston on Sunday is
scheduled to end Thursday in Columbia at the Statehouse, where
pro-flag groups also plan a midday demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want the flag lowered say it represents hate and
slavery. Those who want to keep it flying say it stands for
heritage and honors Confederate war dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, which raised the flag in 1962 to commemorate
the Civil War centennial, then in 1995 gave itself the sole power
to lower it, has not been able to compromise on what to do with the
banner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to do our part to get their attention,'' said
Fogler, who was one of the first coaches to speak out against the
flag in January.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People started a tourism boycott of South Carolina that month, it
hoped to affect sports in the state. Some felt that because the
state had so few marquee events, the effects would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been wrong about that,'' said James Gallman,
president of the state NAACP chapter. ''We have been very
successful in the sports field.''
</P>
<P>
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., who organized the ''Get in
Step'' march, walked with Holtz, South Carolina's football coach
and one-time national championship winner at Notre Dame, and said
''I had goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they discussed Charleston, the Gamecocks football team
and whether the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a thoughtful man,'' Riley said. ''He told me, it's
important to do what's right and this is what's right for South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz marched for about a half-hour as the group made its way up
U.S. 176 through Orangeburg County. The other coaches marched for
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sporting events touched by the flag in South Carolina
this year:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Southern Conference held its basketball tournaments in
Greenville's Bi-Lo Center, but agreed to look elsewhere next year
should the flag remain above the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   -- The New York Knicks pulled out of a pre-playoff training camp
in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   -- USA Track &AMP; Field denounced the flag before the women's
Olympic marathon trials in February and several competitors wore
ribbons of support.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Atlantic Coast Conference asked its nine schools to stay
in North Carolina hotels for the league's baseball tournament,
scheduled just over the South Carolina border in Fort Mill.
</P>
<P>
   -- Richard Williams, the father of tennis star Serena, said his
daughter was not likely to play in the Family Circle Cup in Hilton
Head.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, back at Clemson by midday preparing for a spring
football practice, said he enjoyed the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The university has come out real strong against the flag,'' he
said. ''We're just here to show that support.''

<HEADLINE> Farmers Get 70 Percent of Losses  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are getting 70 cents for every dollar
in claims they made for losses from drought and other crop
disasters last year because the Agriculture Department doesn't have
enough money to go around.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials said Tuesday that they received $1.85 billion in
claims, and had $1.3 billion appropriated by Congress to cover
them.
</P>
<P>
   The department covered 85 cents of every dollar in claims on
1998 crop disasters.
</P>
<P>
   About 260,000 producers are receiving payments for last year's
losses of as much as $55,680 per farmer.
</P>
<P>
   USDA decided to distribute the disaster aid in two installments,
knowing that the claims would have to be prorated. Payments
totaling $500 million were made earlier, while checks for the
remaining $800 million are going out this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite a vibrant national economy, these are difficult times
for America's farmers and ranchers,'' said Keith Kelly,
administrator of USDA's Farm Service Agency. ''This assistance
should provide additional, needed relief to farmers still reeling
from recent costly natural disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas received the most in total payments, $196.8 million,
followed by North Dakota, $143.6 million; Georgia, $73.5 million;
California, $68.7 million; and North Carolina, $64.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the Northeast, hard hit by last summer's drought,
have been working to get Congress to approve additional aid to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has been very generous in providing emergency aid to
farmers in the Midwest and the South when their crops are
devastated. We need to have some equal treatment for farmers in the
Northeast,'' said Wendy Darwell, a spokeswoman for Rep. Maurice
Hinchey, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchey has sought an additional $150 million in aid. The House
Rules Committee refused to allow him to offer an amendment to a
supplemental appropriations bill, so he hopes to add the money to
the Agriculture Department's 2001 budget, Darwell said. Hinchey is
a member of the House agricultural appropriations subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Transplant Measure  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the House came down squarely
against the Clinton administration's effort to assure that more
donated organs go to the sickest transplant patients, the fight is
shifting to the Senate, where a compromise is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sign of how difficult it will be to change the
current organ distribution system, a pair of senators who have been
working for months to find a solution remained unable reach
agreement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who was a heart transplant surgeon
before he entered politics, planned to introduce legislation today
that tries to balance the interests of the private company that
runs the transplant system under a government contract and the
Department of Health and Human Services, which wants to make
changes.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is which side should have the power to write rules
governing the distribution of scarce organs, and what those rules
should be.
</P>
<P>
   HHS and its allies argue that this is an issue of public policy
that should be decided by federal officials who are accountable to
taxpayers, and it has proposed replacing the current geographically
based distribution system with one that would get organs to the
neediest patients first, no matter where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The United Network for Organ Sharing and its supporters argue
that this is a medical question that should be decided by the
transplant professionals who make up the network. The network's
distribution system is designed so that local patients get first
crack at donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the House backed the network in a 275-147 vote that
would strip HHS of its authority to set policy and overturn its
proposed new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government is simply not equipped to make these
decisions,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the House Commerce
Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration promised a veto should his bill reach
the president's desk. The House bill did not attract the 290 votes
that would be needed to overturn a veto.
</P>
<P>
   HHS Secretary Donna Shalala accused the House of ignoring the
findings of a congressionally ordered study of the organ transplant
system. But she predicted that a better bill would emerge
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the months ahead, this vote will be seen for what it is --
an unfortunate footnote to larger good-faith efforts that are under
way to achieve the best organ transplant system possible,'' she
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala and others are now looking to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Frist bill would allow the transplant network to write
allocation policy. But if HHS objected to the network's actions and
the two sides could not find a compromise, the matter would be
settled by an independent commission. The commission would comprise
people appointed by both sides, plus experts picked by the
Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Frist had hoped to co-sponsor the bill with Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., a leader among Senate Democrats on health care issues. But
as of late Tuesday, Kennedy had not agreed to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   The two offices were still talking, but Frist planned to move
forward without Kennedy if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is supply and demand. Only about half of
families asked to donate organs say yes, and many families are
never asked. Meanwhile, nearly 5,000 people die each year waiting
for organ transplants; 68,530 people are waiting for transplants
today.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed by the House encourages organ donation,
something all sides support. It calls for financial assistance for
living donors who give away a kidney or part of a liver, and offers
grants for states to encourage donation.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, it gives the transplant network complete
control over the rules governing how to distribute more than 20,000
organs that are donated each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the network's system, patients who live in the same area
as donors have first chance at organs, even if a sicker patient
lives just outside the border. The Clinton administration wants to
eliminate those geographic barriers, saying someone's chance at
life should not be dictated by where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ''Healthy people are getting organs before they need them and
the very sick are not getting organs before they die,'' said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant network and many transplant centers --
particularly smaller hospitals -- fear that change would siphon away
locally donated organs to other centers, jeopardizing their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the current system also argue that states would
have little incentive to encourage organ donation if the organs
were being shipped elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Jonestown Survivors Remember  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- As Jynona Norwood listens to the details
of the Uganda cult deaths -- the megalomaniac leader, the
apocalyptic teachings, the small bodies curled up in unnatural
death -- she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   She flashes back 22 years to another utopia gone hellishly
wrong, to Jonestown, where her mother and 26 other family members
died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it does jerk me back and it does bring back emotional
pain which you never really get over,'' she says. ''It just makes
my journey a little more urgent. How many more children have to
die?''
</P>
<P>
   For Deborah Layton, who fled Jonestown just before the killings,
the mysterious Movement for Restoration of the Ten Commandments in
Uganda is also stirring up memories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody joins a cult. You join a self-help group, a religious
movement, a political organization,'' Layton says. ''They change so
gradually, by the time you realize you're entrapped -- and almost
everybody does -- you can't figure a safe way back out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the deaths in Uganda refocus the spotlight on the shadowy
world of cults, the images of death and innocence betrayed have a
special resonance with those who lived through the madness of
Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are striking: Both happened in remote tropical
locations. Both were led by charismatic leaders who offered a
better way. Both took so many lives, the toll lurches into the
surreal.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, disaster apparently was triggered after cult leaders'
predictions that the world would end Dec. 31, 1999, failed to
materialize. On March 17, 530 members were burned alive in a
chapel, consumed by gasoline-fueled flames and trapped behind doors
and windows bolted from the outside. An additional 394 bodies have
been found in compounds connected to the cult, many stabbed and
strangled and buried in mass graves. The toll could rise.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jones was driven to his South American refuge, along with
1,000 of his followers, amid questions about the darker side of
Peoples Temple, the beatings of recalcitrant members, the faked
healings.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had charmed the masses with his interracial congregation
bent on building a better world, and politicians with his ability
to deliver votes.
</P>
<P>
   The end came in November 1978, when Congressman Leo Ryan visited
Guyana to investigate reports that the Peoples Temple was abusing
its members and holding some against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's delegation was met with smiles. But as they prepared to
leave, cult members killed him and four other Americans. That
night, Jones gave his final orders.
</P>
<P>
   Children died first; babies were killed by poison squirted into
their mouths with a syringe. Then the adults. Most were poisoned by
cyanide-laced punch, some forcibly. Others were shot by security
guards. Jones was found with a bullet wound in his head, whether
suicide or murder is unknown. At least 913 of his followers died.
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir, ''Seductive Poison,'' Layton describes how she
fell for the answers Jones seemed to offer, eventually becoming a
trusted deputy. But by May 1978, she was ready to make her escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happens and it will continue to happen because in so many
peoples' lives, even in America where we have so much, there is a
loss of identity, a loneliness, and people are looking for
community,'' Layton says.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jones Jr., the adopted son of the Jonestown leader who
escaped as part of a camp basketball team, says there isn't a pat
explanation for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there is a canned answer. I just think tragedies
like this have happened. They've happened in the past. I don't
think they're really preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood was giving a dinner party in a San Francisco suburb when
her uncle called and told her to turn on the news.
</P>
<P>
   She had never joined the Peoples Temple, but her grandmother,
mother and a host of other relatives had.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, now pastor of a South Central Los Angeles church, has
organized annual memorial services at the Evergreen Cemetery in
Oakland, where more than 400 Jonestown victims, mostly children,
are buried in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think about my mother and I think about what happened in
Jonestown every day,'' she says. ''I drive down the street in my
car and I think about our family.''
</P>
<P>
   She has tried to get a commemorative wall erected for the
Jonestown victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite traumatic to see the number 900,'' she says of the
Uganda tragedy. ''Almost 22 years and we're not really learning the
lessons of Jonestown.''
</P>
<P>
   Her view echoes a sign that hung in the pavilion in Guyana:
''Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Tests Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The fate of Turkey's government could rest
on Parliament's decision on whether to allow President Suleyman
Demirel to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the proposal might lead to the collapse of the
10-month old government, hailed as the most stable in years. Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit insists that the re-election of Demirel,
Turkey's most enduring politician, is crucial for stability.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition leaders pledged to support the bill in a second
round of voting today. The government needs the approval of at
least 367 deputies in the 550-member chamber to enact the bill
without going to an unwanted and risky referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional reform would reduce the president's term from
seven to five years, but would allow for a second term. A new
president must be elected by May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents are elected by parliament and in theory fill a
largely symbolic post, however the presidency has been the power
broker in several government crises.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel, 76, has been active in Turkish politics for almost 40
years. Many see him as the symbol of immobility in Turkish
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 100 deputies of the governing parties voted against the
amendment last week, causing serious strains in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit said as many as 406 deputies, including members of the
center-right opposition True Path Party, had initially backed the
proposal. The government alone has 352 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister wants to prevent political bickering among
his coalition partners over Demirel's successor, which could hamper
the government's economic reform package and much-needed political
stability on the road toward membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to lure the support of the opposition, the government
has attached two other constitutional amendments, which offer a
lucrative pension plan to deputies and would make it more difficult
for courts to shut down political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the latter failed to satisfy the Islamic Virtue Party, which
faces closure for activities deemed anti-secular. The party is
pushing for an additional amendment that would lift a political ban
on the leader of the Islamic movement, Necmettin Erbakan.

<HEADLINE> Martin Luther King Jr. Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Warning that Georgia could face an economic
boycott similar to one being waged in South Carolina, the son of
Martin Luther King Jr. urged lawmakers to remove the Confederate
battle emblem from the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not saying that we're going to boycott. What we're
saying is that we're poised to, if righteousness and justice do not
occur and the flag does not come down,'' Martin Luther King III
said Tuesday during a rally to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of
his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Tuesday, the life of the slain civil right's leader
was remembered with rallies and marches, including one in Chicago
led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. In Memphis, Tenn., garbage
collectors had the day off in recognition of the sanitation
workers' strike that prompted King's fateful trip to that city.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia marked the day by establishing a King holiday, with
Gov. Jim Gilmore signing the legislation. The observation of his
birthday had shared the same day in January with those of
Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. ''Stonewall''
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, family members laid a wreath at King's tomb, then
gathered at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King, the slain leader's widow, also pledged to
fight the Georgia flag, which was changed in 1956, some believe in
defiance of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to keep marching and protesting until Georgia and
every state has a flag that respects and unifies people of all
races,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A boycott by black activists in South Carolina, which flies the
Confederate flag over its Capitol, has cost the state millions of
tourism dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the flag say it honors their Southern heritage.
Opponents call it a symbol of racism. While the issue has sparked a
major debate in South Carolina, Georgia lawmakers virtually ignored
the flag during the 40-day session that ended last month.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to change the Georgia flag have fizzled since former
Gov. Zell Miller pushed for a new banner in 1993. The controversy
nearly cost Miller re-election, and lawmakers have been hesitant to
touch the issue ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by Georgia State University showed fewer than a
third of Georgians support changing the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, King family members announced they have posted on
the Internet the full transcript of a trial in which a Memphis jury
concluded last year that government agents and others conspired to
murder King.
</P>
<P>
   They said the transcripts were important because the mainstream
media ignored or distorted details of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now people who want to learn what really happened in Memphis
can easily read the testimony firsthand and without any
interpretation,'' King's widow said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have long concluded that Ray acted as a lone gunman
and the Justice Department has refused to reopen the investigation,
despite the King family's insistence that a far-reaching conspiracy
was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   James Earl Ray confessed to King's murder soon after the
shooting, but spent the rest of his life in prison claiming
innocence. He died of liver failure in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Memphis jury sided with the Kings in their
wrongful death lawsuit against Loyd Jowers, a former restaurant
owner who said he paid someone other than Ray to kill King in 1968.
The family's lawyer claimed the FBI, CIA, the Mafia and the
military were involved.

<HEADLINE> Census Targets South For Responses  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not desperation time, but the Census
Bureau says it is concerned enough about participation rates in the
South that it is increasing publicity efforts in states that lag
behind the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's convincing illegal aliens in Texas that their
citizenship status doesn't matter when it comes to filling out a
form, or organizing a 12-hour radiothon at a post office in
Jackson, Miss., the goal is the same, Census officials say: Mail
back your forms.
</P>
<P>
   Also starting today, new radio ads will be heard in those
states, plus nine others and the District of Columbia, to increase
mail response rates that trail the national rate, which was 55
percent as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The states that lag behind the general response rate are
generally clustered in the South and Southwest,'' Census director
Kenneth Prewitt said at a news conference Tuesday. ''It suggests
the very same sort of demographic and attitudinal characteristics
that led to lower response rates in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine other states where new ads are running are: Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana,
Oklahoma, New Mexico and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the states, Census officials say part of the problem
is visiting hard-to-reach rural communities. Other rural households
get sporadic mail delivery, or only receive mail through a post
office box. Census forms are only mailed out or dropped off at
homes with street addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised to see more rural counties lagging behind
bigger cities and urban areas for two reasons -- the way we deliver
the questionnaires, and it's sometimes harder to reach the rural
areas,'' said Betty Hardy, regional Census director in Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Hardy said they are trying to locate families
displaced by flooding from Hurricane Floyd. Census spokesman Frank
Newton in Dallas said they were busy working with immigrant
populations in Texas, and held a ''census radiothon'' at a Jackson,
Miss., post office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have many communities in eastern Kentucky whereas much as a
third of the households in the same communities do not have
telephones,'' said Ron Eller, director of the Appalachian Center at
the University of Kentucky. ''Unless you have individuals that
literally go from household to household up a creek and down
another gathering the data from families, many of the families are
simply not likely to get counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything will be done to get everyone counted, if not through
the mail, then by visits to households by enumerators, Prewitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said it was still unclear whether recent criticism from
citizens and several congressional Republicans about the
intrusiveness of Census questions had any effect on response rates.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials hope to reach a national response rate of 70
percent by mid-April, but would like to get at least 61 percent by
then. The response rate in 1990 was 65 percent, and has declined
every census since 1970.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Sheppard Case  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A surgeon who examined the medical records of
Sam Sheppard from 46 years ago says there is reason to doubt the
doctor's claim that he was knocked unconscious by an intruder the
night his wife was beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert White's testimony came Tuesday as the defense began
to wrap up their case in a wrongful imprisonment lawsuit brought by
the doctor's son, Sam Reese Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   The son contends a handyman named Richard Eberling killed his
mother. Eberling died in 1998 while serving life in prison for
another murder.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Sheppard's partly nude body was found on her
blood-soaked bed early on July 4, 1954, at the couple's home on
Lake Erie. The case helped inspire the TV series and film ''The
Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard maintained that a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife
and knocked him unconscious during a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of murder and spent almost a decade in prison
before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict in a
groundbreaking ruling on the negative effects of pretrial
publicity. He was acquitted at a retrial and died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the case are expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   White's testimony contradicted that of Dr. William Fallon, who
has said Sheppard suffered serious injuries the morning his wife
died that could not have been self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Following the murder, Sheppard was taken to a nearby hospital
run by his family, where he stayed for four days. The right side of
his face was swollen and he complained of pain in his neck.
Sheppard's brother, Steve, diagnosed him as being in shock and
having a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   But White, who reviewed Sheppard's medical chart, said he had
normal responses to neurological tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evidence to support either a brain or a spinal cord
injury,'' said White, who has acted as a medical consultant to Pope
John Paul II and is the retired head of neurosurgery at MetroHealth
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of Sheppard's other purported injuries, such as
numbness in his left arm, could have been fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard attorney Terry Gilbert accused White of constructing a
conspiracy theory that everyone in the Sheppard family was involved
in concocting his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   White responded: ''In practicing for 40-plus years, I've never
seen a case like this, where an individual is taken off to a
hospital that is owned by a family and literally treated, examined
and buttressed by the family.''
</P>
<P>
   White conceded that he could not rule out the possibility that
Sheppard suffered a neck injury from a blow that left no mark and
could have been in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have portrayed Dr. Sheppard as an adulterous husband
who bludgeoned his wife because he felt trapped in his marriage and
exploded with rage.

<HEADLINE> Standardized Tests Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Susan Senator of Brookline, Mass., worries
about the day when her son, a 10-year-old fourth-grader diagnosed
with autism, will have to take the state's high school exit exam.
</P>
<P>
   He could fail despite gaining basic reading and math skills
needed to get a job, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not having a diploma will really be a mark against him,'' said
Senator, who has organized Brookline parents against the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Now lawmakers are taking aim at the tests, arguing that they
deny disabled, poor and minority children an equal chance to earn
diplomas. Such students, they say, have the most crowded
classrooms, the least experienced teachers and the least
challenging courses, which makes them less likely to pass rigorous
tests.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed legislation that would keep states from relying
solely on test scores to award diplomas or make children repeat a
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are holding our children responsible for own failure to
invest in their future,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. He
hopes to win over his colleagues as they decide in the next few
weeks how to spend federal education money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, introduced in the House by Rep. Bobby Scott,
D-Va., states that receive money from Washington would have to use,
in addition to test results, teacher reviews, class attendance and
letter grades in course work to make such decisions. They would
have to provide extra help to children with learning disabilities
and language needs.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where the presumed GOP presidential nominee, Gov.
George W. Bush, has trumpeted the academic gains of poor children,
Hispanic children are not given high school exit exams in Spanish,
said Marisa J. Demeo, a lawyer with the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund. The group unsuccessfully tried to sue
the state, which maintained students are improving.
</P>
<P>
   National concern over public education has fueled the state
testing movement. Currently, 29 states require or plan to require
every high school student to pass a single test to earn a diploma.
The most that pupils who don't pass can earn is a certificate of
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   All states but Iowa and Montana test younger children in various
subjects but do not automatically deny promotions to those who fail
the tests. Many districts, such as New York and Chicago, have held
children back en masse based on test scores. Sometimes, scores are
used to grade schools themselves and shut down those with deficient
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of tests say accommodations or exclusions could cheat
disadvantaged students out of fair assessments of their abilities.
And many states do combine tests with other measures, said Michael
Kean, a vice president with CTBMcGraw-Hill, which develops tests
for 23 states.

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek To Stop Farm Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the timing couldn't be worse, senators
moved to counter a court ruling that the Internal Revenue Service
can collect additional taxes on farmland in the federal
Conservation Reserve Program.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a federal appeals court ruling last month that an
Ohio farm couple must pay self-employment taxes on income from the
federal program, which pays farmers to take environmentally
sensitive acreage out of production.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. producers are reeling from low prices, bad weather and
rising fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could not come at a worse time,'' said Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., the measure's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling ignores the intentions of Congress in creating
the conservation program and will discourage farmers from
participating, Brownback said. Federal law exempts real estate
rental income from the 15 percent Social Security self-employment
tax, and until now CRP land has fallen under those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., another sponsor of the bill, said the
program has had enormous conservation and wildlife benefits. ''The
decision threatens to penalize producers who are trying to do the
right thing by protecting fragile land that is sensitive to erosion
and provides vital wildlife habitat,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than dozen co-sponsors are Democratic Sens. Tom
Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota, and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska. GOP backers include Sens. John Ashcroft and Christopher
Bond of Missouri, as well as Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, the
Agriculture Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas alone, farmers could pay $16 million more, said Kansas
GOP Rep. Jerry Moran, who has introduced a similar House bill,
''and the IRS in their usual fashion would like to collect it for
the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming just before tax day, the March 3 ruling by the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals rocked farmers who have been filing tax
returns based on a 1998 U.S. Tax Court ruling in favor of the Ohio
couple, Frederick and Ruth Wuebker.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 270,000 farm families with CRP-enrolled land pay
income taxes on the payments from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture -- but not self-employment Social Security taxes -- much
as a landlord pays taxes on rental income. USDA makes about $1.3
billion in CRP payments, an average of $5,000 per farm and $45.15
per acre.
</P>
<P>
   State farm bureaus in Ohio, Texas, New York, Iowa, Kansas and
other states have helped the Wuebkers fight the IRS, which says
they owe additional taxes of $1,685 for 1992 and $1,640 for 1993.
The couple enrolled 215 acres in CRP in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applied only to those who are actively farming, and
not to retired farmers or absentee farmland owners.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he will try to attach his bill to some other
legislation already nearing consideration.

<HEADLINE> Democrats forge campaign finance bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- House and Senate Democratic leaders have
agreed on a compromise bill that would allow millions in taxpayer
money to be spent on statewide campaigns and establish voluntary
election spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Tuesday were calling the proposal a landmark
reform. However, Republicans were said they were leery of a bill
shaped without their input.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which incorporates elements of competing plans being
pushed by Democrats in each chamber, would add Connecticut to a
growing number of states to adopt so-called public financing of
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the House, where the bill was expected to be debated
today said they are confident they have enough votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's historic,'' said House Majority Leader David
Pudlin, D-New Britain, who led negotiations on the compromise bill
with Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin B. Sullivan, D-West
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland was far less enthusiastic
about what he called an agreement among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''This comes as news to the governor's office,'' spokesman Dean
Pagani said late Tuesday. ''The governor's office has not been
involved in the discussions at all. The Democrats appear to have
left the Republican Party out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagani reiterated Rowland's long-standing conditions on campaign
finance reform: that the final bill should have bipartisan support
and that any restrictions imposed on statewide races should also be
extended to legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Brian Flaherty of Watertown, a deputy Republican
leader, complained that Republicans not only were left out of the
negotiations on the House and Senate compromise but also s did not
even receive a copy of the bill until nearly 5 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From a preliminary reading, ''it does not look like it's a
compromise that meets any of the things Republicans are talking
about,'' Flaherty said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have discussed issues such as limiting contributions
from political action committees and increasing disclosure on the
Internet of campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats say the bill addresses one of Rowland's key
objections to their earlier proposals by including House and Senate
races in a system of voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats claim that Republicans do not want a comprehensive
campaign finance bill to reach Rowland's desk and say it is their
job to put one there.
</P>
<P>
   The bill negotiated by House and Senate leaders would create a
Citizens Elections Fund that would immediately begin collecting tax
money to pay for statewide campaigns. The money would not be spent
until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the bill would set up a voluntary system,
starting in 2002, in which candidates for statewide office would be
urged to agree to spending limits of $4 million per candidate in
the governor's race, and $750,000 per candidate in elections for
other statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   If only one candidate in a race agrees to spending limits, he or
she would receive taxpayer money matching every dollar over the
limit spent by their opponent, Democrats said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Adapts Tougher Loan Safeguards  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund says it will
strengthen the safeguards on loans to borrowing countries in
response to allegations central banks in Russia and Ukraine
deceived the IMF to obtain new finance.
</P>
<P>
   Acting IMF Managing Director Stanley Fishcer told reporters
Tuesday that new auditing requirements for borrowing countries'
central banks were intended to make sure that IMF loans in the
future were properly used.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cases that have hit the headlines are cause for grave
concern,'' Fischer said. ''It is critical that when the IMF makes
loans they are used for the intended purpose. There can be no abuse
of IMF trust, which is a public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress have criticized the IMF for not
immediately uncovering the true state of finances in Russia and
Ukraine when it was negotiating loans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the IMF discovered that the Russian central bank had
lied about the size of its foreign exchange reserves, some of which
had been moved offshore through a subsidiary company.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reported
to a congressional committee on similar activities by the National
Bank of Ukraine that led the IMF to make three loan payments it
would have held back on had accurate information on reserves been
provided.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's 24-member executive board approved new requirements
effective in July that countries seeking loans will have to agree
to publish annual financial statements of their central banks that
have been reviewed by outside auditors.
</P>
<P>
   When the IMF loans money to a country in financial distress, the
money usually is deposited in that country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has never before required all countries to agree to
independent audits of its central bank as a condition for getting
loans although it has required occasional spot audits if there were
allegations of improper use of the funds, as in the case of Russia
and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide ranging news conference , Fischer told reporters that
the IMF had a full agenda of reform proposals to address at its
annual spring meetings with the World Bank on April 16-17.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the groups that disrupted the meetings of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle in December are making plans to have
thousands of demonstrators on the streets of Washington to express
their unhappiness with the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   These activists maintain that loan policies of the fund and the
bank impose harsh conditions on poor countries and favor
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer acknowledged the potential for disruptions in Washington
in light of the vandalism that occurred in Seattle, but he said he
believed Washington authorities would be properly prepared to make
sure the demonstrations remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''The local police forces and those responsible for security are
taking this very seriously -- the possibility of disruptions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fischer declined to say what contingency measures might be
taken when asked if the time or place of meetings would be changed
or how limousines the central bankers and finance ministers
routinely use to attend these meetings would reach their
destinations if protesters were blocking the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a naturalized American, is currently heading the IMF
following the resignation in February of France's Michel Camdessus,
who stepped down after 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   After an intense global power struggle, Germany's Horst Koehler
was selected as Camdessus' replacement but duties at the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will
keep him from taking office until after the spring meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said he planned to hold a get-acquainted meeting in
Moscow later this week with Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin
but no talks on resuming loans would take place until a new Russian
government took office in early May.

<HEADLINE> Senate Begins Budget Debate  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats have a raft of amendments
ready for the Republican-written $1.83 trillion budget for 2001
that are aimed at forcing GOP lawmakers to take potentially
embarrassing election-year votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate planned to vote today on one of them, language aimed
at forcing legislators to create a new prescription drug benefit
for Medicare recipients before cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., who is up
for re-election this year, seemed certain to be rejected. But
Democrats were hoping to cast Republicans as more eager to cut
taxes for the rich than to help the elderly pay for their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's put our priorities in order and put seniors before tax
cuts,'' Robb said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said
that under the GOP budget, it ''will be permissible'' for lawmakers
to vote on prescription drugs this fall, even without Robb's
language.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was likely to debate the budget all week and approve
it by Friday. That would set up negotiations with the House, which
adopted a similar plan two weeks ago. Congress' budget, which is
not signed by the president, sets overall tax and spending limits
but saves specific decisions for later bills.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget includes up to $40 billion over five years for a
prescription drug plan, but it omits details and does not require
any action. Such a benefit has been a top priority for President
Clinton the past two years, and Republicans have talked about
writing a similar but scaled-down package.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democratic amendment designed to embarrass Republicans
would oppose rolling back the 18.4-cent per gallon federal tax on
gasoline. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., proposed the
rollback, but it has been criticized by some for jeopardizing money
for popular highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another would force a vote on including George W. Bush's
larger tax cut in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP lawmakers would rather avoid that because it would
probably erode Social Security surpluses both parties want to leave
alone. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, would cut
taxes by $483 billion from 2002 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In ways subtle and explicit, the budget debate underlines how
Republicans have sought to de-emphasize the size of their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, cutting taxes remains a signature issue for GOP
lawmakers, who have spent much of the year trying to do just that.
Their budget envisions at least $150 billion in tax cuts through
2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''That money ought to be looked at very carefully,'' Domenici
said regarding the budget surpluses that would pay for the tax
cuts. ''Because it's the American people who are overpaying their
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders also plan a Senate vote next week on reducing taxes
by $248 billion over 10 years for married couples, including
millions who face the so-called marriage penalty because they owe
higher levies than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, much of the GOP's budget rhetoric emphasizes cutting
taxes less than other priorities like protecting Social Security
surpluses, debt reduction and financing defense and education. That
could reflect polls showing that most voters enjoying today's
healthy economy prefer bolstering Social Security, Medicare and
education to a dramatic effort to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Domenici said the spending plan he wrote has a
''modest tax reduction'' and contains $13 in debt reduction for
every $1 in tax cuts. And the Republican report accompanying the
budget describing the plan's ''general principles'' lists tax cuts
ninth -- right behind emergency aid for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this year's GOP budget covers five years instead of
the 10 years their plan covered last year, partly to show a smaller
total tax-cut figure. Many of them believe Clinton won last year's
tax battle when he vetoed their 10-year, $792 billion reduction
because he focused the debate on the dollar amount, not the types
of taxes to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plan translated to at least $750 billion
over the next decade, similar to last year's vetoed package.
Republicans said it would be $450 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget called for $99 billion in tax reductions
through 2005, nearly offset by $96 billion in increased taxes on
cigarettes and some businesses.

Bush, Gore Win Pa., Wis. Primaries
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having secured their party nominations last month, Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush easily won presidential
primaries Tuesday in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Both candidates had earned more
than enough delegates from primaries and caucuses in other states to lock up the
presidential nominations last month. But the Democratic vice president and
Republican governor weren't the only presidential candidates on the ballots in
both states.

Mori Elected Japan's Prime Minister
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Parliament elected Yoshiro Mori as the new prime
minister Wednesday, ending a political crisis created by the sudden collapse of
Keizo Obuchi, who was on life support after suffering a stroke. The former trade
minister was elected in a binding lower house vote following his installment
earlier in the day as president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Obuchi held both posts, but has been in a coma since his collapse on Sunday.

Nasdaq, Dow Bruised but Recover
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index and Dow Jones industrials on
Tuesday each dropped more than 500 points before recovering in what was Wall
Street's most volatile day. Analysts said they couldn't point to any one factor
in today's massive selling, but most said the purge was long overdue. The Nasdaq
was down 574.57 points at midday, then clawed back to finish down 74.79 at
4,148.89. The Dow rose 196.31 points this morning before diving to a loss of
504.15 early Tuesday afternoon. It finished down 57.09 at 11,164.84.

Japan, N. Korea Start Normalization Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- North Korean and Japanese negotiators on
Wednesday began their first talks in eight years on establishing diplomatic
relations. Both sides said they would try to bridge their many differences,
including Tokyo's concerns over a North Korean ballistic missile that was fired
over Japan in 1998. The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.
Similar normalization talks between Japan and North Korea broke down in 1992,
and swift progress now is not expected. Pyongyang needs help from richer
countries to feed its impoverished people and modernize its decaying
infrastructure.

Anti-Castro Demonstrators Get Rough
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Anti-Castro demonstrators surged through a police barricade
and formed a human chain around Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez's house on Tuesday
as rumors swept the crowd that the U.S. government was coming to take the boy
away. Miami police stood by and watched. The protesters broke through after
Elian's father was issued a U.S. visa to come to the United States and be
reunited with his son. They vowed to resist any attempt by the U.S. government
to take the 6-year-old boy away from Miami relatives.

Genetic Approach To Cancer Promising
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For the first time, scientists have reported success
against cancer using an intriguing technique called antisense technology, which
zeros in on a cancer gene to halt malignancy at its roots. Researchers have been
experimenting with this approach for more than a decade, but on Tuesday they
described the first cases in which the technique actually seemed to slow a
deadly malignancy. Testing is still early, and doctors do not know whether the
treatment will pan out. But a large international study is starting to settle
this.

Diana Ross, New Supremes to Tour

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty years after Diana Ross left the Supremes, the sexy
diva of '60s pop is back with her girls. In pink leather and lipstick to match,
Ross strutted into a news conference on Tuesday at Grand Central Terminal where
she and two new backup singers announced plans for a U.S. tour featuring the
group's timeless Motown hits. They're all Supremes -- Ross, Lynda Laurence and
Scherrie Payne -- but it's far from a reunion. The trio has never performed on
stage together.

Lakers Defeat Suns 84-83
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Robert Horry made four big plays in the final 1:30, sending
the Los Angeles Lakers to a 84-83 win over Phoenix and into the history books
with their 10th victory in a row. The Lakers became the third team in NBA
history to have three winning streaks in a season of 10 games or more. Los
Angeles had 16- and 19-game streaks earlier in the season. The Suns had a chance
to win it, but Cliff Robinson missed a 3-pointer with 4.5 seconds left. The
rebound was batted around, bounced high in the air and wound up in the hands of
Shaquille O'Neal as the buzzer sounded.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Win Pa., Wis. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
coasted to
two more victories in presidential primaries in Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin, adding to delegate tallies that were already large
enough to clinch the nominations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the Democratic vice president and Republican governor
weren't the only presidential candidates on Tuesday's ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, Bush
won the Republican primary with 73 percent, or 470,637 votes,
according to unofficial returns.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining votes were shared by his former rivals. Sen. John
McCain of Arizona had 23 percent, or 144,628 votes; publisher Steve
Forbes had 3 percent, or 16,291 votes, and conservative activist
Gary Bauer had 1 percent, or 8,983 votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, with 99 percent of precincts reporting,
Gore won with 74 percent, or 517,901 votes, according to unofficial
results. Former rival Bill Bradley had 21 percent, or 145,481
votes, and perennial candidate Lyndon H. LaRouche 5 percent, or
32,191 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin's Republican primary, with 96 percent of precincts
reporting, Bush won with 69 percent, or 324,796 votes, according to
unofficial returns. McCain had 18 percent, or 85,160 votes, and
Alan Keyes, who is still running, pulled 10 percent, or 46,673
votes. Forbes had 1 percent, or 5,236 vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, with 96 percent of precincts
reporting, Gore won with 89 percent, or 313,357 votes. Bradley had
9 percent, or 31,083 votes and LaRouche had 1 percent, or 3,580
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results were important despite the lack of drama.
Pennsylvania, with 23 Electoral College votes, could be a critical
swing state in November. Wisconsin has 11 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the two states also were electing delegates to the
national Democratic and Republican party conventions this summer in
Los Angeles and Philadelphia, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Watchdog Says HUD Report Broke Law  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's chief watchdog said a report issued by Secretary
Andrew Cuomo broke the law by detailing how proposed Republican
budget cuts would hurt communities.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General Susan Gaffney said the report, issued last
year and titled ''Losing Ground,'' violated a law barring federal
agencies from using taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''HUD's publication of 'Losing Ground' is only a small part of
the publicity and propaganda capability that the department has
built in the last two years,'' Gaffney wrote in a March 27 letter
to the U.S. Comptroller General obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, Congress's nonpartisan
investigative arm, reviewed the report late last year and found no
violation. Gaffney asked the GAO to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman David Egner said Tuesday that Gaffney was making a
''wild political accusation'' on an issue already resolved by the
GAO.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with the inspector general's claim that the GAO is
wrong on the law,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Egner questioned Gaffney's impartiality, saying, ''it is a
well-known fact that the inspector general is a tool of Republicans
in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney has been sharply critical of various Cuomo initiatives
at HUD. Her office penned a scathing audit of the Community
Builders program, created by Cuomo as a customer service and
outreach arm for the agency. Republicans say the program is a waste
of money and should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing Ground'' was distributed to Community Builders in
August 1999 with instructions to spread the word about the planned
cuts for fiscal year 2000. It also was mailed to the press, HUD
grantees, public interest groups and historically black colleges,
Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials told Gaffney they ordered more than 32,000 copies
and spent about $20,600 on printing and mailing.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time of unexpected national prosperity, Congress should
not rob the poorest Americans to provide reckless tax cuts and
create a new deficit,'' Cuomo wrote in the report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials said the proposed GOP cuts, most of which were not
enacted, would have meant 156,000 fewer housing units for
low-income families and homeless families and would have cut
housing and other services for people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report never specifically asked members to lobby Congress,
but Gaffney said ''the message was understood by its recipients.''
</P>
<P>
   She included an e-mail from one of the report's recipients, the
director of a HUD-funded community program, encouraging members of
her group to write to their members of Congress and urge them to
oppose the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a report in the over 20 years I've been
in Congress that has raised a red flag the way that this one did,''
said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who asked for the GAO
investigation last November. ''This is something that's unique to
Cuomo's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said he may ask the House Appropriations Committee
to cut Cuomo's next budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to send a clear message to any Cabinet secretary ...
that if you use taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress in a way that
violates the law, your personal empire is going to get cut,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, whose father was former Gov. Mario Cuomo, has said he may
be interested in running for his father's old job.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Older Cancer Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women who develop breast cancer after age 55
tend to have a less aggressive type of tumor and most older
patients live about as long as the women without breast cancer in
their age group, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   The study, appearing Wednesday in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, found that the characteristics of breast tumors
in women past age 55 are more favorable for treatment and control
than are the breast cancer tumor types found in younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the study found that the eight-year survival rate for
breast cancer patients past the age of 70 who have small tumors and
no lymph node spread, was almost identical with the survival rate
for age-matched women who did not have breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The research was prompted by the increasing rate of breast
cancer among elderly women, said the authors. The conclusions are
based on an analysis of medical records of 50,828 breast cancer
patients in San Antonio and 256,287 in a national cancer registry.
Survival rate of the patients was compared with a similar number of
age-matched women from the general population.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Holds Medical Marijuana Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Under the Compassionate Care Program,
multiple sclerosis patient Barbara Douglass was one of 15 people in
the country who was chosen to receive medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The federal program was discontinued in 1992, but the pain
Douglass feels in her back and legs hasn't stopped. Neither has her
use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the leg is just killing you, you rub it and rub it.
Sometimes you rub it so much and so hard you can bruise yourself,''
said Douglass, who developed MS in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marijuana helps. It eases the pain and spasms. I believe
smoking marijuana helps me deal with the disease that I'm forced to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglass, 43, carries a letter from her doctor stating that she
participated in the program and may continue using marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   She'll have that letter with her Thursday when she travels to
the University of Iowa for a three-day conference on the
therapeutic use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the first of its kind, organizers say the conference
is being held in response to a report last year by the Institute of
Medicine. A report by the federal advisory panel said marijuana can
help fight pain and nausea and should be tested further in
scientific trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there can be some enlightenment, that would be wonderful,''
said Melanie Dreher, dean of Iowa's College of Nursing and a former
board member of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that people need to know the whole picture of
marijuana. That, in fact, it's not just a recreational drug but has
medicinal value.''
</P>
<P>
   It is against federal law for doctors to prescribe the drug. Yet
voters in Alaska, Washington, California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon,
Maine and the District of Columbia have approved laws allowing
doctors to recommend marijuana use by patients suffering from
cancer, glaucoma and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is challenging those laws.
</P>
<P>
   Al Byrne Jr., cofounder of a group called Patients Out of Time,
which asked Iowa to hold the conference, said the government has to
fight the laws because ''if they give up their control and pass
that control to the health care community, then they're out of a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne says he smoked marijuana to relieve eye pressure from
glaucoma. He said his father also smoked it in the late 1960s --
under advice from his doctor -- to relieve nausea and pain from
liver cancer. He said his dad bought the drug illegally off the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass said she gets upset when asked if she gets high as a
result of smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just think about it. There you are, you've got this disease
and you need something to relieve the pain. That's certainly not
going to be a high,'' she said. ''We're a different group of people
than those who smoke it for a high.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices opened lower on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 75 points in early
trading. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a nearly
2-to-1 lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 135 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The selling waves went around the globe overnight, returning to
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dow and the Nasdaq each had suffered intraday
losses of more than 500 points on Tuesday, they settled with just
double-digit declines.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was down 57 points while the Nasdaq lost 74.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the most volatile trading ever for Wall Street, as
well as the busiest single day of trading on record.
</P>
<P>
   And markets have been losing ground across Europe following a
mostly lower session in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices are higher.

<HEADLINE> Man killed in logging accident in central New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HASTINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A 20-year-old man walking through a wooded
area on his way to work was struck and killed by a falling tree,
state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Warren II, of Central Square, was the victim on Tuesday of
a logging accident in the Oswego County Town of Hastings, troopers
said. He was walking near train tracks on his way to Buoy's
Restaurant in Brewerton.
</P>
<P>
   A crew from DK Enterprises had just finished cutting the 80-foot
tree, and it struck the Warren as it crashed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Warren heard the logger's warning and tried to get out of the
way, but inadvertently moved into the path of the tree, state
police Investigator Rick Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just came up over the hill. My guy tried everything he
could,'' said David Kline, the company's owner. ''He was on posted
property. He wasn't supposed to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Edward Foster said no criminal activity was involved in
Warren's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my 12 years with the state police, it's the first time I've
seen anything like this,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a state prison guard was killed while supervising an
inmate work crew that was clearing some woods in nearby Madison
County.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Lower; Nasdaq Drops 109  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading today as an
uncertain market sought a direction one day after Wall Street
experienced its most volatile session in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 109.82 to 4,039.07, and the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 15.90 to 11,148.94 during the first
hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decline followed a stomach-churning rout Tuesday, when
the Nasdaq and Dow each dropped more than 500 points. The stampede
reversed as buyers returned in search of bargains, and most stocks
ended the chaotic session with only moderate losses.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets also fell today in response to Wall Street's
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 132.16 points
to post its second consecutive decline of 0.64 percent. In later
trading in Europe, Paris' CAC-40 index was off 3.62 percent and
Frankfurt's DAX index was down 3.62 percent. Computer problems
meant London's FT-SE 100 index could not be tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq and the Dow each recorded their widest point swings
in history Tuesday on record volume. The Nasdaq was down 574.57
points at midday, then clawed back to finish down 74.79 at
4,148.89. From its high to its low, the Nasdaq moved more than 634
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 196.31 points Tuesday morning before careening to a
loss of 504.15 in early afternoon. It finished down 57.09 at
11,164.84, having made its way back to positive territory briefly
before turning lower once again. It swung more than 700 points
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no one catalyst for Tuesday's volatility, the
market continued to flee from technology stocks, which had already
been pummeled in previous sessions as investors questioned their
stratospheric advance over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best-known high-tech stocks are still up for the
year, but smaller companies with little or no earnings have been
knocked down to prices that are more justifiable to investors still
eager to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   When the market stopped swooning Tuesday, the
technology-dominated Nasdaq and the blue chips in the Dow had
obliterated much of the divergence that had perplexed market
analysts since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq ended the day up just 2 percent in the year to date.
The Dow was down less than 3 percent. At the height of the market's
divergence in early March, the Nasdaq had risen 24 percent for the
year and the Dow had sunk nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it is to believe, this is a good thing,'' said Pete
Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ''One sector of the market was insanely
overvalued. The rest was deeply undervalued. Now we are reversing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple, rational thing to say is that that the technology
sector is coming back to Earth,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''We've gone through a
period of dramatic speculation, and historically, every period of
speculation has been followed by a period of distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors in Tuesday's selling were what's known in the
market as margin calls. When investors buy stock using borrowed
money, known as margin, they are forced to sell if prices drop
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ''That substantially exaggerated the downturn,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the swiftness of the selloff evoked memories of
October 1997, when the Dow fell 554 points in a single session as
financial crises in Asia and Russia gripped world markets. But
market watchers noted one crucial, though perplexing, difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen a bout of panic selling like today's since
then, but there was a clear catalyst then, and there isn't one
now,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, the pain was short-lived. Computer programs
that triggered selling on the way down eventually sparked buying.
Investors resumed their recent shift to blue-chip stocks, which are
seen as more stable and less speculative than their high-tech
counterparts.

<P>
   The Dow rose 196.31 points Tuesday morning before careening to a
loss of 504.15 in early afternoon. It finished down 57.09 at
11,164.84, having made its way back to positive territory briefly
before turning lower once again. It swung more than 700 points
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no one catalyst for Tuesday's volatility, the
market continued to flee from technology stocks, which had already
been pummeled in previous sessions as investors questioned their
stratospheric advance over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best-known high-tech stocks are still up for the
year, but smaller companies with little or no earnings have been
knocked down to prices that are more justifiable to investors still
eager to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   When the market stopped swooning Tuesday, the
technology-dominated Nasdaq and the blue chips in the Dow had
obliterated much of the divergence that had perplexed market
analysts since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq ended the day up just 2 percent in the year to date.
The Dow was down less than 3 percent. At the height of the market's
divergence in early March, the Nasdaq had risen 24 percent for the
year and the Dow had sunk nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it is to believe, this is a good thing,'' said Pete
Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ''One sector of the market was insanely
overvalued. The rest was deeply undervalued. Now we are reversing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple, rational thing to say is that that the technology
sector is coming back to Earth,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''We've gone through a
period of dramatic speculation, and historically, every period of
speculation has been followed by a period of distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors in Tuesday's selling were what's known in the
market as margin calls. When investors buy stock using borrowed
money, known as margin, they are forced to sell if prices drop
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ''That substantially exaggerated the downturn,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the swiftness of the selloff evoked memories of
October 1997, when the Dow fell 554 points in a single session as
financial crises in Asia and Russia gripped world markets. But
market watchers noted one crucial, though perplexing, difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen a bout of panic selling like today's since
then, but there was a clear catalyst then, and there isn't one
now,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, the pain was short-lived. Computer programs
that triggered selling on the way down eventually sparked buying.
Investors resumed their recent shift to blue-chip stocks, which are
seen as more stable and less speculative than their high-tech
counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Docs Face Murder Charges  </HEADLINE>
By BUSABA SIVASOMBOON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Three doctors and a former hospital
executive already penalized for ethical breaches involving a series
of kidney transplants now face murder charges, Thai police said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police issued subpoenas for the four Wednesday on two charges of
conspiracy to commit murder after a commission found that they had
not followed proper procedures in declaring organ donors brain
dead. Conspiracy to commit murder carries the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Thailand's Medical Council revoked the license of
one doctor and suspended those of four others at the hospital after
finding that they had illegally traded in human organs.
</P>
<P>
   The council said it had sufficient evidence to show that surgeon
Sirot Kanchanapanchaphol and his colleagues improperly harvested
kidneys. The council also found the team violated brain-death
analysis standards. Sirot was one of those charged by police.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, from Vachiraprakarn Hospital on the outskirts of
Bangkok, are also charged with falsifying documents.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects have previously denied all allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The police acted on a complaint by the Law Society of Thailand,
acting on behalf of the relatives of two people from whom kidneys
were harvested after they were declared brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   They alleged that the kidneys were obtained by malpractice,
trickery and payment. The cases came to light about a year ago,
after one of the relatives took his story to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in organs is prohibited in Thailand. Organ donation is
done by agreement between donors and recipients without any
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Sirot, former chairman of the hospital, and his colleagues
allegedly used false documents which claimed relatives of
brain-dead patients permitted them to remove kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   They were also accused of giving money to the relatives of the
organ donors, and then charging organ recipients.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 97; Dow Off 29  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors beaten down and bewildered by
Tuesday's wild market returned to Wall Street with a measure of
caution today, sending technology shares and blue-chip stocks
moderately lower.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 97.94 at 4,050.95. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 29.78 at 11,135.06.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were slightly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 14.87 at 1,479.86, and the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies was fell 0.63 to 500.03.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly modest, but the volatility that marked
Tuesday's session remained, sending indexes fluctuating.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell from the opening bell as traders struggled to find
their footing after Tuesday's chaotic selloff, when both the Nasdaq
and the Dow fell more than 500 points only to finish the turbulent
session with modest, double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   The wildness on Wall Street rattled most overseas markets,
making it difficult for the U.S. market to mount any real recovery.
In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent, with
technology shares leading the decline. In afternoon trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 3.8 percent and France's CAC-40 was
down 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on the London Stock Exchange was suspended Wednesday
because of a technical fault which wiped out accurate price data
from the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks continued their slide, with large and small
names all lower. Cisco Systems fell 2 9/64 to 70 63/64, and
Broadcom, a maker of silicon semiconductors, fell 7 to 197.
</P>
<P>
   Sears helped offset the Dow's losses, rising 3} to 34\. The
company said today it expects first-quarter profits to beat
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Breadth was poor across the board. On the New York Stock
Exchange, decliners led advancers by a 4-to-3 margin. On the
Nasdaq, decliners led by a 7-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume was 149.89 million shares, slightly ahead of
Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, two major players in the market's recent swings
are scheduled to speak at a White House conference on the new
economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will discuss the
Internet and productivity. Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment
strategist at Goldman Sachs, is also scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cohen's recommendation that clients put some of their
stock holdings into cash sparked selling on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens 'New Economy' Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the world is
undergoing a profound economic transformation in which computers
and the Internet offer incredible opportunities to combat poverty
and ''help people everywhere fulfill their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the opening speaker at a daylong White House
conference on the ''new economy,'' being held one day after Wall
Street suffered its wildest one-day swing in history.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not talk about the market's turbulence, but
other speakers cautioned that even the new economy is still
vulnerable to shocks, including a huge drop in the stock market.
Investment banker Roger Altman predicted there will be a correction
that will be particularly sharp in some technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Texas economics professor James K. Galbraith
said, ''A crash need not come.'' Despite the nervousness of the
markets, he said, ''These are good times. They are very good
times.'' He said that if government continues to pursue the right
policies, ''We can continue to grow and prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton assembled dozens of Wall Street gurus, economists,
thinkers and high-tech entrepreneurs in the chandeliered East Room
to explore the economy's future. Microsoft's Bill Gates and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan were among the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We meet in the midst of the longest economic expansion in our
history and an economic transformation as profound as that that led
us into the industrial revolution,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the computer and the Internet give us a chance to
move more people out of poverty more quickly than any time in all
of human history,'' Clinton said. ''I believe we can harness the
power of the new economy to help people everywhere fulfill their
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference's purpose was to demonstrate ''that we're all
continuing to focus like a laser beam on the economy, as the
president promised to do when he came into office,'' said Gene
Sperling, director of the president's National Economic Council.
''And that means not sitting around and patting yourself on the
back because of the unemployment and inflation rates being low.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, the founder of Microsoft, sits down at the White House
two days after a federal judge ruled that the software giant
violated antitrust laws by stifling competition. He was meeting
with members of Congress before seeing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the White House supports the Justice Department's
suit against Microsoft but that Gates ''has much to offer in terms
of his point of view. We aren't endorsing or necessarily
disagreeing with all sorts of things people are going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates was to speak at a panel on ''closing the global divide:
strategies for health, education and technology.'' Gates and his
wife, Melinda, have donated $750 million to help protect poor
children around the world against disease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced he would spend two days traveling from Palo
Alto, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley, to Chicago, site of a
computer conference. The trip, scheduled for April 17-18, would
focus attention on efforts to help poor people gain computer skills
and access to high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would make the case that new technologies ''can
be an incredible tool of empowerment in schools, homes, businesses,
community centers and every other part of our civic life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before today's conference, the administration professed no
concern about stock market turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we have about the lowest unemployment rate we've had
in 30 years,'' Sperling said. ''We've seen remarkable productivity
growth, we've seen very high levels of business investment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ''the new economy is doing quite well. And I do not
think that one should judge the strength of the fundamentals of our
economy based on the movement of the market over a one-day or even
a one-month period.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues addressed at the White House conference were
raised by protesters last December in Seattle, where they disrupted
meetings of the World Trade Organization to highlight their
complaints that the poor in many nations were being left behind in
the current global economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Today's conference occurs a week before many of the Seattle
protest groups are scheduled to stage demonstrations in conjunction
with the spring meetings in Washington of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Approach To Cancer Promising  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Promising early results from a new
treatment for skin cancer are raising hopes that a clever approach
called antisense therapy may pay off in fighting the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been talking about antisense technology -- which
zeros in on a cancer gene to halt malignancy at its roots -- for
more than a decade. But on Tuesday, they described the first cases
in which the technique actually seemed to slow a deadly malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Testing is still early, and doctors do not know whether the
treatment will pan out. But a large international study is starting
to settle this.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all been waiting for something like this. It's very
exciting,'' commented Peter Jones, director of the USC/Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, code-named G3139, was developed by Genta Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., which financed the research. The preliminary
results were released in San Francisco at a meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   All cancers spring from genetic errors. Often, ordinary genes
turn into killers when they develop glitches in their code that
make them churn out dangerously mutant proteins. Others simply get
stuck in the ''on'' position, producing large amounts of normal
proteins that help cancers grow.
</P>
<P>
   One of these overproducing genes is called bcl-2. Its protein
protects cancer cells from apoptosis, the normal process that
triggers the death of defective and worn-out cells. Many
chemotherapy drugs attack cancer by making them launch this dying
process.
</P>
<P>
   The bcl-2 gene runs in overdrive in 90 percent of all cases of
melanoma, the deadly form of skin cancer that strikes about 26,000
Americans annually. As a result, the cancer is shielded from the
killing power of chemotherapy as well as from the body's own
surveillance system against tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The Genta drug slows the production of bcl-2 protein.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a novel concept designed to make melanoma respond better
to chemotherapy,'' said Dr. Burkhard Jansen of the University of
Vienna in Austria, who directed a study on 16 patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is called an antisense oligonucleotide. All genes
convert their information into RNA, which carries the blueprint for
constructing proteins. The drug is a short stretch of genetic
material that is a mirror image of the RNA. This reverse image has
a natural attraction to the RNA. It latches onto it and disables
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jansen's team tested the treatment on patients with
advance-stage melanoma who had failed to respond to other
treatments. Doctors gave them G3139 followed by dacarbazine, a
standard chemotherapy medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the patients, a 90-year-old woman, responded about three
months ago with complete disappearance of her spreading cancer. In
two others, more than half of the cancer went away, and three
others have had lesser responses.
</P>
<P>
   The patients have survived an average of more than nine months
so far. Their expected survival is four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''These cells are very resistant to chemotherapy,'' noted Dr.
John Mendelsohn of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston. ''If you can potentiate chemotherapy in
melanoma, you've done something very important. The fact that this
happened is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   A new study involving about 300 melanoma patients is expected to
begin this month in the United States, Canada, Europe and
Australia. Patients will be randomly assigned to get either G3139
plus dacarbazine or dacarbazine alone.
</P>
<P>
   Antisense was once considered to be a hot area of cancer
research. However, it fell from favor after scientists were unable
to duplicate promising test tube results in people.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach appears to work because the synthetic genetic
material is able to penetrate cells but is not immediately broken
down by the body.
</P>
<P>
   Overproduction of the bcl-2 protein is involved in a variety of
cancers. Researchers say the same antisense medicine might also be
useful against other malignancies, including lymphoma and prostate,
breast and small-cell lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say this is just one of many new approaches that are
precisely tailored to exploit weaknesses in cancer cells. Unlike
ordinary chemotherapy, which broadly attacks all fast-growing
cells, these treatments often have few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   These treatments result from a basic understanding of how tumors
evade the normal body controls that prevent unwanted growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the beginning of an enormous payoff in the nation's
investment in cancer research,'' said Dr. William N. Hait, director
of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Third poll shows Giuliani support waning  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A statewide poll today showed that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's former lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton in New
York's Senate race has evaporated in the wake of the Patrick
Dorismond shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third such poll result in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, sent
his counterpart in the Clinton campaign, Bill de Blasio, a letter
asking for a meeting to discuss possible debates. There was no
immediate comment from de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   While both Giuliani and Clinton have said they want debates,
they have yet to be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute, had
the first lady favored by 46 percent of registered voters surveyed
while 43 percent backed the New York City mayor. Giuliani led
Clinton, 48 percent to 41 percent, in a March 2 poll from the
Hamden, Conn.-based institute.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier polls, from Zogby International for the New York Post
and from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, had similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time in months that Mrs. Clinton has been on
the plus side in this very close race and there's a one-word
explanation -- Dorismond,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the
polling institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was fatally shot by New York City police last month.
In defending the police in the shooting of the unarmed black man,
Giuliani made public Dorismond's criminal record, including
court-sealed juvenile records. That has drawn heavy criticism of
the mayor, including some from fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 1,058 registered voters was
conducted March 28-April 3 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss, noting that
the three recent polls all had the race close, said ''in light of
the recent media coverage, this is not unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's been having a bad couple of weeks,'' Clinton said
this morning during a campaign stop in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the poll found that Giuliani's former lead among
white women had also disappeared. He is now favored by 44 percent
of those voters to 42 percent for Clinton, a statistical tie. In
the March 2 poll, the mayor had enjoyed a 14-point edge over
Clinton among white women.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 50 percent of voters said they disapproved of
Giuliani's response to the Dorismond shooting, with the greatest
disapproval coming from New York City (72 percent) and in the
suburban counties surrounding the city (54 percent). ------

<HEADLINE> House Nears 'Partial Abortion' Ban  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Courting a third presidential veto on the
subject, the Republican-controlled House marched methodically today
toward passage of politically charged legislation banning ''partial
birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody in this room knows this is wrong. It is not legally
or morally defensible,'' said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont., graphically
describing a procedure in which he said a fetus is partially
delivered, then its ''brains are extracted with the suction device
... .''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Republicans of playing politics with the
issue, and said their real goal was to undermine a 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that guaranteed women the right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Proponents of this bill are not just chipping away at the
right to choose, they are taking a jackhammer to it,'' said Rep.
Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill was a virtual certainty, but opponents held
out hope that support would be less than the two-thirds majority
needed to override a threatened veto.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors say the measure, similar to a bill passed last fall in
the Senate, is designed to abolish a certain type of late-term
procedure in which a fetus is partially delivered, then aborted.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents counter that, as written, the bill would apply far
more broadly, thus undermining a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that
granted women the right to abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is voting on the measure at the same time the Supreme
Court is prepared to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a
''partial birth'' ban enacted in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no direct connection between the court case and
the pending legislation, sponsors say the measure before the House
was crafted to meet objections of federal appeals court judges who
said the Nebraska statute failed to meet constitutional standards.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the House bill seeks to ban abortions in which a
doctor ''vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living fetus
until the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother'' and
''kills the fetus while the intact living fetus is partially
outside the body of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions would be in cases in which the life of the
mother was threatened, and Democrats were discussing Tuesday night
whether to seek to a broader exceptions to include women whose
physical health were jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining their majority in the House and Senate in 1994,
Republicans have twice pushed ''partial birth'' measures to Clinton
desk, causing political anguish in the process for many Democrats
who favor abortion rights but found the bills impossible to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has voted for similar
bills in the past, for example, and will do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vetoed two ''partial birth'' bills in the past and
has served notice he will do so again, calling on Congress to
provide for exceptions in the case of potential harm to a woman's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Both previous vetoes were overridden in the House before being
narrowly sustained in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome this time, Canady offered one prediction:
''I can't say that we're going to hear any new arguments.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors beaten down and bewildered by
Tuesday's wild market returned to Wall Street with a measure of

Technology stocks crept higher after an early decline.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 21.36 at 4,127.53, having recovered from a drop of 139.80
earlier in the session. The Dow Jones industrial average was down

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Drug Benefit Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rejected a Democratic effort today
that would have forced creation of a Medicare prescription drug
benefit before lawmakers could vote on broad tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Though the provision was killed, the vote served Democrats'
political purposes of trying to cast Republicans as more eager to
cut taxes for the rich than to help the elderly pay for their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get our priorities straight and do what's correct,''
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-49 in favor of the provision, which was
introduced by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. But it died because
Republicans used a procedural move that required 60 votes to
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   All 45 Democrats and six Republicans voted for the measure. They
were Sens. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and four facing voters this fall: Spencer Abraham of
Michigan, Conrad Burns of Montana, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island
and Mike DeWine of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Robb's proposal was offered as an amendment to a $1.83 trillion
budget for 2001 that Republicans plan to push through the Senate by
week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Next for the budget will be negotiations with the House, which
adopted a similar plan two weeks ago. Congress' budget, which is
not signed by the president, sets overall tax and spending limits
but saves specific decisions for later bills.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget sets aside up to $40 billion over five years for
a prescription drug plan, but it omits details and does not require
any action. Such a benefit has been a top priority for President
Clinton the past two years, and Republicans have talked about
writing a similar but scaled-down package.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said there is no need to link tax cuts
to prescription drug coverage, as the Democratic amendment would
have done. And he said it would be irresponsible to create new
Medicare benefits without also taking steps to assure the solvency
of the health-insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is deceptive, it is not right,'' Frist said. ''Seniors
deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Democratic amendment designed to embarrass Republicans
would oppose rolling back the 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal tax on
gasoline. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., proposed the
rollback, but it has been criticized by some for jeopardizing money
for popular highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another would force a vote on including George W. Bush's
larger tax cut in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP lawmakers would rather avoid that because it would
probably erode Social Security surpluses both parties want to leave
alone. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, would cut
taxes by $483 billion from 2002 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In ways subtle and explicit, the budget debate underlines how
Republicans have sought to de-emphasize the size of their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, cutting taxes remains a signature issue for GOP
lawmakers, who have spent much of the year trying to do just that.
Their budget envisions at least $150 billion in tax cuts through
2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''That money ought to be looked at very carefully,'' Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., the Budget Committee chairman, said regarding the
budget surpluses that would pay for the tax cuts. ''Because it's
the American people who are overpaying their taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders also plan a Senate vote next week on reducing taxes
by $248 billion over 10 years for married couples, including
millions who face the so-called marriage penalty because they owe
higher levies than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, much of the GOP's budget rhetoric emphasizes cutting
taxes less than other priorities like protecting Social Security
surpluses, debt reduction and financing defense and education. That
could reflect polls showing that most voters enjoying today's
healthy economy prefer bolstering Social Security, Medicare and
education to a dramatic effort to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Domenici said the spending plan he wrote has a
''modest tax reduction'' and contains $13 in debt reduction for
every $1 in tax cuts. And the Republican report accompanying the
budget describing the plan's ''general principles'' lists tax cuts
ninth -- right behind emergency aid for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Common Mistakes When Filing Taxes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Older Americans who may be on a fixed income or
limited budget often overlook standard deductions and may make
mistakes when filing their income taxes, according to a tax expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking your time and a little care can avoid most of these
mistakes,'' as well as save you some money, says Michael B. Cates,
a professional tax preparer and an academic assistant at the
College for Financial Planning.
</P>
<P>
   A common mistake is forgetting to take an additional standard
deduction for being age 65 or older, says Cates.
</P>
<P>
   ''That amounts to an additional $850 deduction on the 1999
return -- $1,700 for married couples if each is age 65 or older.
Unmarried taxpayers, age 65 or older, can take an additional
standard deduction of $1,050,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, Cates says, a filer would have to turn 65 sometime
during the tax year, even if it is as late as Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Cates says you also can claim an additional standard deduction
if you are legally blind. So a married person age 65 and legally
blind can take a total of $1,700 in standard deductions in addition
to their regular standard deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Certain medical expenses are another common area older taxpayers
overlook. For example, you can claim 10 cents a mile for the trips
to the doctor, the hospital, pharmacy or other medical facility, as
well as expenses associated with those trips such as tolls and
parking fees. You also can claim public transportation costs. Most
transportation claims may appear small, but they can add up,
especially if you are regularly going to the doctor or other
medical facility, says Cates. You can also claim up to $50 a night
for lodging if you stay overnight on a medical trip.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to claim the amount you pay for Medicare Part B
premiums. These premiums may not add up to a lot by themselves,
because the only medical expenses you can claim are those that
exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. However, the
premiums might make a difference when combined with out-of-pocket
expenses and the premiums you pay for a supplemental Medicare
policy, perhaps a Medicare HMO, and long-term care insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Cates says that for 1999, the maximum you can deduct is $800 for
long-term care insurance premiums if you are aged 51-60, $2,120 for
those aged 61-70, and $2,660 if you are over age 70. Of course, the
cost of any medical expenses not reimbursed for long-term care also
is deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Points for the purchase of a home is another confusing deduction
area for taxpayers, says Cates. Perhaps you sold the home last year
that you raised your children in and you've moved into a smaller
home. You can fully deduct the points on the home you bought.
However, Cates notes that if you bought the new home late in the
year, it may actually pay to deduct the points over the life of the
loan instead of fully deducting them in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is, explains Cates, the mortgage interest deduction
for the new home would be very low for 1999, and it may have been
very low or nonexistent for the previous home if it was near the
end of its mortgage or paid off. Consequently, you may not have
enough home expenses to itemize for 1999 and you would lose the
points deduction. You may be more likely to benefit from amortizing
them over subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   Refinancing is also confusing regarding deducting points. For a
first refinance on a home, you can only amortize points over the
life of the loan. For a second refinancing, you can deduct the
remaining points from the previous refinance in full in the year
you refinanced again.
</P>
<P>
   Cates emphasizes that taxpayers doing their own returns double
and triple check everything. The IRS reports up to an 18 percent
error rate on returns, involving everything from inaccurate math to
missing Social Security numbers. Since most people receive refunds,
that only delays their refund.
</P>
<P>
   Cates says you can automatically file for a four-month filing
extension using Form 4868, and you can request an additional
two-month filing extension using Form 2688, though you'll have to
get permission from the IRS for the second extension.
</P>
<P>
   A filing extension is not the same as a payment extension,
emphasizes Cates. Assuming you owe the IRS, you should make a
reasonable payment by the April deadline. If you don't end up
paying enough, you may be assessed interest and penalties, but you
won't get socked with a five percent a month failure to file
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxpayers do get one good piece of news this year,'' says
Cates. ''April 15 falls on a Saturday, so your taxes aren't due
until Monday the 17th. You get a two-day bonus.''

<HEADLINE> Deer-Hunting Inspires Daniels Film  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN FLESHER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESCANABA, Mich. (AP) -- Pssst. Here comes dat Reuben Soady. Don't
get too close -- he's jinxed. Been huntin' deer since he was
knee-high to a gopher. Now he's 43 and still ain't bagged a buck.
Dey call him ''Da Buckless Yooper!''
</P>
<P>
   In the woods and small towns of Michigan's Upper Peninsula --
fondly dubbed ''the U.P.'' and its residents ''yoopers'' -- chronic
bucklessness is the worst form of lucklessness.
</P>
<P>
   To Michigan native Jeff Daniels, it's also fodder for film. Five
years after his ''Escanaba in da Moonlight'' opened as a stage play
in the Detroit area, Daniels is making a movie about Reuben's
struggle to avoid setting the Soady family record for hunting
futility.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, whose screen credits over a 23-year acting career
include ''The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' ''Terms of Endearment'' and
''Dumb and Dumber,'' is making his debut as a director and also
plays Reuben. He needs to line up a distributor, but hopes the
movie will be in theaters later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members spent March filming scenes in and around starstruck
Escanaba, a shipping and factory town of 13,600 on the northern
shore of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who'd have ever thunk it, eh?'' jokes retired logger Reinhold
''Einie'' Bittner, 75, whose two-room hunting camp is where most of
the outdoor scenes were shot.
</P>
<P>
   About three dozen residents were given roles as extras.
Moviegoers will see Rosy Cox, a wisecracking Texas native who moved
to Escanaba 13 years ago, pouring coffee in her downtown diner and
taunting poor ol' Reuben in a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them they'd probably want some skinny young thing
instead of me, but they said, 'No, we want you,''' Cox said,
flipping burgers on the grill during a recent lunchtime rush. ''I'm
just loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is thrilled. Yoopers have long been the target of
country-bumpkin jokes, courtesy of city slickers in Lower Michigan.
Some worry that a humorous film about deer camp will make them look
like, well, bumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the old values -- courtesy, decency. My biggest fear is
that they'll mock all that,'' says Roxanne Schramm of Rapid River,
a village up the road from Escanaba where a bawdy bar scene was
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up, responds Daniels, a native of Chelsea, about 50
miles west of Detroit in the Lower Peninsula. People will realize
that ''Escanaba in da Moonlight'' is a parody, he says. Besides,
yoopers are known for self-deprecating, salty humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I defy anyone up here to look me in the eye and tell me you've
never told a two-holer joke,'' he said in an interview. (For the
uninitiated, a two-holer is an outhouse with two seats.)
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he says, the funny business about beer and
bodily functions and the exaggerated ''yooperese'' dialect -- ya
know, sorta like dey talked in dat ''Fargo'' movie, eh? -- are
simply a backdrop for the film's theme: Reuben's quest, with the
help of a loving family, to summon his courage and finally bag that
buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's all the film were, me coming up here with my
Hollywood roots and making fun of people and going away, I don't
think the play would be as successful as it's been and the film
certainly won't be,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks don't seem too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, it's a comedy, not a documentary,'' says Rick Rudden,
editor of the Daily Press of Escanaba, which got into the spirit by
inviting readers to submit humorous deer-camp tales. ''We need to
be able to laugh at ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a couple of films on Mackinac Island, the only major
motion picture shot anywhere in the Upper Peninsula was ''Anatomy
of a Murder,'' the 1959 courtroom drama set in Marquette County,
says Janet Lockwood, director of the state film office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Escanaba in da Moonlight'' is set in November 1989, the night
before the opening day of hunting season. Reuben has arrived at
camp with his gruff father, Albert (Harve Presnell), and
half-witted brother Remnar (Joseph Albright).
</P>
<P>
   Reuben is desperate to avoid becoming the oldest Soady never to
get a buck. Even his Potawatomi Indian wife, Wolf Moon Dance
(Kimberly Norris Guerrero), is a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to change his luck, Reuben unnerves his superstitious
kinsmen by altering longstanding camp rituals. That triggers a
series of bizarre events. Things get even weirder with the arrival
of Jimmer Negamanee from Menominee (Wayne David Parker), a
wild-eyed backwoodsman once abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmer's car bursts into flame and drives away on its own;
Albert's homemade ''sweet sap whiskey'' turns into syrup. An
officer with the despised state wildlife agency barges in to
announce he's seen God up on Soady Ridge. Finally, as an
otherworldly blast of light illuminates the ridge, Reuben charges
off alone for a climactic showdown with his own fears.
</P>
<P>
   While the surreal aspects of ''Escanaba in da Moonlight'' may be
puzzling, veteran U.P. hunters will see much that's familiar.
Antlers, skins and old license plates on the cabin walls. Rickety
bunk beds covered with patchwork quilts. Rusty wood stove.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention off-color humor, drinking, card games, hearty
eating and especially camaraderie -- all part of life at deer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of beer,'' admits Dave Theoret of Escanaba.
''But, hey, you're not driving anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels says the film's $1 million price tag would be lower had
he crossed into Canada, as many U.S. filmmakers do for favorable
exchange rates and government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But he sought authenticity and wants to promote talent in his
home state. It's one reason he established the Purple Rose Theatre
Co. in Chelsea a decade ago after deciding he'd lived enough in New
York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Escanaba in da Moonlight'' is the first project for the
company's new moviemaking arm, Purple Rose Films.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels lined up investors -- most of them friends or associates
from Michigan -- to pay the production costs without first arranging
to get the film distributed. A gamble, he admits, but one that he
says gives him more creative control.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to get on the phone to someone in L.A. who put up
the money ... and justify why I'm rewriting scene 24,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially important for ''Escanaba in da Moonlight,'' he
said. Daniels wants to be sure the story is told his way,
reflecting his appreciation of earthy yooper culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what someone from the U.P. thinks about something
right away, and I find that very refreshing,'' Daniels says. ''That
honesty, that love of family and the land ... is really the heart
and soul of the film.''

<HEADLINE> Barter in 2000? Sharing 'Sopranos'  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEADWOOD, Ore. (AP) -- Deep into his second season as a rabid fan
of ''The Sopranos,'' Michael Zachai started thinking it might be
nice to follow mobster Tony Soprano's lead and become a waste
management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ''But everybody in Deadwood burns their garbage or feeds it to
the pigs,'' said Zachai.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's conflicted mobster, who once fell in love with the idea of
wild ducks in his swimming pool, should take a look at Deadwood,
where Zachai mixes art and carpentry to make his living and must be
counted as the series' biggest fan.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked up a winding canyon in the rain-soaked Coast Range, where
the trees are heavy with luminescent green moss and sword ferns
blanket the forest floor, Deadwood could not be farther from the
gritty New Jersey sprawl that is the show's backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through satellite delivery, the hit series has penetrated
even here, and the pioneer tradition of barter has now evolved into
exchanging a taped episode for a home-cooked meal. Country folks
with urban roots, like the Brooklyn-native Zachai, depend on it for
a breath of gritty city air.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like E.L. Doctorow said in 'Billy Bathgate': 'I can't
wait to get this country air out of my lungs,''' said Zachai.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like it here. There is something about living on 40 acres
that is reassuring. You don't have to see ugliness around you all
the time. You create your own world. But I am an urban person.
That's why I watch 'The Sopranos.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fans anywhere of popular premium-cable shows like ''The
Sopranos'' may swap the latest taped episodes with friends and
co-workers. But Deadwood is an extreme example.
</P>
<P>
   To say it is out in the country is to miss the mark. It is
waaaaaaaayyyyyy out in the country -- an hour and a half's drive
west from Eugene on a two-lane blacktop that climbs out of the
broad Willamette Valley, then down toward the Pacific along the
meandering course of Lake Creek.
</P>
<P>
   To a person driving by, Deadwood is a post office and
combination store-gas station, where you can rent a video, drink a
Coke or buy cattle feed.
</P>
<P>
   But those who fall under its ''Brigadoon'' spell will find 150
residents scattered up the lush valley: a mix of hippies, artists,
organic farmers, writers, loggers, carpenters and retirees who have
hung on or moved in since the collapse of logging as a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Zachai, 57, came to Oregon in 1969 to get a masters degree in
geography at the University of Oregon in Eugene, but soon found he
had no sense of direction and turned to carpentry. Now, his
children grown and his marriage dissolved, he lives alone in a
house he built up the hill from Deadwood Creek, where salmon spawn
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's not Italian, Zachai feels a connection to Italy and
has studied the language. When the weather is warm, he eats lunch
in an arbor of clematis and climbing roses. There are neat beds of
daffodils, and a vegetable garden surrounded by an artful 7-foot
fence topped by bent alder branches to keep out the deer.
</P>
<P>
   On the porch roof is the mini-dish for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Zachai saw his first episode of ''The Sopranos'' while hanging
out at the home of Boyd and Mary Upchurch. Boyd is a retired
science fiction novelist -- pen name John Boyd -- and Mary is a
former teacher. They came here from Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only watch it because of Michael,'' said Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   But Zachai was hooked, and signed right up.
</P>
<P>
   '''The Godfather' was luxurious and lush and operatic,'' said
Zachai. ''This is documentary.''
</P>
<P>
   He tapes every episode, and retired Hollywood accountant Paul
Kovalchuk recently cooked him a nice dinner of lamb shanks and rice
pilaf, no dessert, when they got together to watch a string of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read a review on it and thought, 'This is nice,' but I'm not
going to spend $12 a month on it,'' said Kovalchuk, who did the
books for a string of TV series and watches a lot of C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   The high point for Zachai comes every two weeks, when he drives
down off the mountain to buy his groceries at Costco in Eugene and
spends the night at the home of Jim and Pauline Lane, who became
friends when he did a remodeling job years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They watch his latest tape while eating a big Italian dinner
prepared by Pauline, who grew up Pauline Smarrella, the daughter of
a doctor in Dean Martin's home town of Steubenville, Ohio, and who
translates the Italian words for Zachai.
</P>
<P>
   ''It finally dawned on me that it would have been cheaper to get
HBO,'' Pauline quipped as she moved easily around the kitchen,
frying eggplant, stirring tomato sauce with shortribs, and offering
a taste of roasted peppers on bread.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to notice in 'The Sopranos' that Carmela (Tony's
wife) is so efficient in the kitchen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read somewhere she doesn't know how to cook,'' returned
Zachai.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, she does a good imitation,'' Pauline replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that is so good about 'The Sopranos' is that it is
kind of over the top, but it is also very true,'' Pauline added.
''You look at that show differently if you come from those
cultures. I think someone raised in Oregon on white bread and
mayonnaise ...''
</P>
<P>
   Zachai finished her sentence for her: ''It's like 'Star Wars' to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional cops-and-robbers shows never really worked for
Zachai, who preferred the peculiarities of ''Northern Exposure''
over ''NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When the cops always win every week, it's not that
interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Deadwood, volunteer fire chief Michael Ager, himself a
Star Trek fan who crafts wooden salmon in Zachai's shop, caught a
couple episodes of ''The Sopranos'' while house-sitting for friends
who had HBO up the road in Greenleaf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked it,'' he said as he sat recently and watched neighbor
Adam Wagner, an organic farmer, split wood. ''It's not all that
shoot-'em-up. The characters have depth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner's wife, Maria Kirwin, who teaches high school
Spanish, was put off by the profanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just used the 'f' word every other minute, and for no
good reason,'' she said as she patted the bare behind of her
10-month-old son, Dylan.

   Standing up for his favorite show, Zachai said it transports him
back to his youth in a Jewish section of Brooklyn, where kids knew
to stay out of the nondescript social clubs in the Italian
neighborhoods where the Mafiosi hung out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we are like salmon and we have to go back where we
were spawned,'' he said. ''I have to go back to Brooklyn.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Joyce Carol Oates  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH HASTINGS, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Marilyn Monroe has been dead for nearly four
decades and still the writers come, drawing from a well that is
shallow but never dry.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to appropriate Marilyn's soul is Joyce Carol Oates,
whose ''Blonde'' is 738 tortured pages of ''radically distilled''
reality.
</P>
<P>
   It is truth dressed up as fiction, to paraphrase the noted
author and women's advocate: an imagined look inside an actress who
died from barbiturates, written by someone who never met the
actress and didn't consult anyone who has.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, which reportedly earned more than $1 million from
advance fees and television rights, is scheduled for release Sunday
and is receiving national media attention before its publicity tour
even begins.
</P>
<P>
   CBS plans a four-hour miniseries. Oates plans a play.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that finding gold in Monroe's tapped-out veins
is about as likely as striking another mother lode at Sutter's
mill. Nothing, it appears, will deter those hell-bent on sifting
her remains.
</P>
<P>
   She is an icon no longer in need of a last name. Marilyn is
accorded fame for being a victim -- by strangers who claim to speak
for a woman permanently silenced in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that I was adding an intellectual and spiritual depth
to her that the others didn't give to her,'' said Oates sitting in
her Princeton, N.J. home. ''I certainly didn't think of it as
exploiting a subject. I certainly don't think of a book as doing
any harm.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been scores of books, written by the famous and the
fickle: Norman Mailer, Gloria Steinem, ex-husband Arthur Miller,
half-sister Berniece Baker Miracle, confidante Susan Strasberg.
</P>
<P>
   Mailer, sounding like an over-stimulated adolescent with an
affected vocabulary, called Marilyn a ''Stradivarius of sex'' and
''a sweet peach bursting before one's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first page of ''Marilyn,'' his 1973 biography, he wrote:
''Take me, said her smile. 'I'm easy. I'm happy. I'm an angel of
sex, you bet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mailer declined to be interviewed. ''You can quote from what
he's written,'' said his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller was criticized for ''After the Fall,'' his 1964
two-act play featuring Maggie, a blonde, disturbed, childlike
performer once married to the protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright was chided not only for borrowing the persona of
his dead ex-wife, but also for employing director Elia Kazan, who
had named Hollywood names to Communist-hunting members of the House
Un-American Activities Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who won a Pulitzer Prize for ''Death of a Salesman,''
does not like to talk about Monroe or their four-year marriage,
which began in 1956. In Oates' book, he is referred to not by name,
but as ''The Playwright.'' Joe DiMaggio, the legendary Yankee
Clipper whose union with Monroe in 1954 lasted nine months, is
''The Ex-Athlete.'' John F. Kennedy's brother-in-law, Peter
Lawford, is ''the President's Pimp.'' Monroe herself is ''the Blond
Actress,'' the ''Beggar Maid,'' the ''Fair Princess'' and ''Miss
Golden Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, now 84, refused to discuss the literary lure of his
ex-wife. ''I don't know how to answer that,'' he said, reached by
telephone at his Manhattan office. ''You'll have to ask Joyce Carol
Oates that question. I can't help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said she was enticed by an early photograph of Norma Jeane
Baker, a dreamy, needy teen-ager who hadn't yet changed her name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I could identify with this girl,'' Oates said. ''I went
to high school and junior high with girls who looked very much like
that'' -- young women trading on sex in an age when the ability to
please men was a girl's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   But with the women's movement in the 1970s, Gloria Steinem and
other feminists slowly came to embrace Marilyn, to portray her as
independent as well as irrational. Smart and sexy. Vulnerable and
vital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marilyn Monroe was twice cursed. When I was a child, she was
that naughty woman. When I was learning about feminism, she was
that bimbo,'' said mystery writer Carole Nelson Douglas, who edited
a 1997 collection of short stories created by crime novelists
titled ''Marilyn: Shades of Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair color dominates many Marilyn titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt about the exploitation factor,'' said
Douglas. ''She was exploited all along by the men who made the
movies. A lot of women think we need to reclaim these images, and I
think it's healthy for Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's getting a lot more respect these days than she ever did
when she alive. And if exploitation is the price for that, I don't
think there's anything wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others do. Last year, Miller briefly broke his self-imposed
silence to denounce a Christie's auction of Monroe possessions that
earned $13.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Included was the flesh-colored, sequined gown stitched onto her
so she could sing ''Happy Birthday, Mr. President'' during JFK's
1962 celebration at Madison Square Garden. The see-through dress
originally cost $5,000. It brought $1.15 million at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was gruesome, and even more gruesome is the fact that
nobody seems to think it was gruesome,'' Miller said at the time.
''It's literally like selling the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ''The Marilyn Monroe Encyclopedia'' published last
month, more than 224 authors have sold words about her.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been films, plays, TV movies, posters,
calendars, underwear, lapel buttons, jigsaw puzzles, statuary,
music videos and Thom McAn shoes and clutch bags.
</P>
<P>
   A former gofer on the set of Monroe's 1957 film with Laurence
Olivier, ''The Prince and the Showgirl,'' wrote a book earlier this
year that may take the prize for sleaze and silliness. In ''My Week
With Marilyn,'' 67-year-old Colin Clark claims that he and Monroe
slept together during London production of the movie. All emphasis
on the word sleep.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sex, said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you love me, Colin?'' Monroe purportedly asked him,
according to his book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love you like I love the wind, or the waves or the earth
under my feet or the sun coming out from behind a cloud,'' Clark
answered. ''You are a goddess to millions and millions of people.
Like an ancient Greek goddess, you can come down to Earth every now
and then, but you always remain out of reach to human men.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Marilyn succinctly replied: ''I'm not Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he didn't understand public derision that followed
his book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm mortified that people might think I'm a blackguard,
bragging about my conquests. I say, what a dreadful business.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said she, too, expects criticism for her Monroe book.
She's seen it before. Her ''Black Water,'' a fictional version of
Chappaquiddick told from the drowning woman's perspective, and
''Zombie,'' a novel about a serial killer taken from the mutilation
and cannibalistic murders of Jeffrey Dahmer, both received mixed
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' latest work already has been panned.
</P>
<P>
   ''These clumsy attempts to channel her characters' most intimate
thoughts, like her embroidering of already melodramatic events,
cannot help but remind the reader of how shamelessly Ms. Oates is
using the life of Marilyn Monroe as a substitute for inventing an
original story, how shamelessly she is trying to cash in on her
subject's status as a legend,'' wrote Pulitzer Prize-winning book
reviewer Michiko Kakutani in last Friday's New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though 'Blonde' purports to reveal 'the inner, poetic, and
spiritual life' of the actress, it turns out to be just the latest
effort to exploit the tragedy and fame of Marilyn Monroe.''

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Years at British Library  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A 1,000-year-old book of riddles, a 15th-century
love letter and a 20th-century bear named Pooh: All are strands in
the rich history of English literature being celebrated this summer
by the British Library.
</P>
<P>
   This body of literature is ''the thing, above anything else,
that Britain has given to the world in the course of the last
millennium,'' government arts secretary Chris Smith says about the
national library's major exhibit for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Called ''Chapter and Verse,'' it runs through Oct. 15 at the
vast, red-brick structure near King's Cross rail station that
houses the nation's collection of books, manuscripts and maps.
</P>
<P>
   The literature is not arranged chronologically, but by such
themes as love, loss, laughter, imagination, belonging and strife.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stars of the exhibit is a 1,000-year-old manuscript
of ''Beowulf,'' the Anglo-Saxon epic poem about a Scandinavian
warrior who rids the Danish kingdom of the monster Grendel. Written
in Old English, it is the first known major poem in a European
vernacular language and is believed to have been written in the
sixth century. The library says this copy, by an anonymous scribe,
may have been one of several, but is the only one known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   A prize-winning new translation of ''Beowulf'' by the Irish poet
Seamus Heaney is also part of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 300 items on display are written in the author's
hand, creating an intensely personal tie between the observer and
the likes of William Blake, James Joyce and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   The margin notes and crossings-out, the squiggles and lines and
arrows reveal not just the creative process that resulted in an
immortal work of literature but allow the moderately imaginative to
sense they are watching over the author's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   A book of Joyce's notes for ''Ulysses'' looks like an abstract
drawing, a kind of visual stream of consciousness. It's filled with
small writing every which way over the page and almost entirely
crossed out in red and blue.
</P>
<P>
   A tidier Geoffrey Chaucer looks out from a small portrait in a
lavishly decorated manuscript of the ''Canterbury Tales.'' He is
wearing a jazzy pair of red socks -- the very sort of 14th-century
footwear a fan would expect of such an amusing fellow.
</P>
<P>
   A book at least 1,000 years old contains the riddles of a
religious teacher named Aldhelm who is said to have lured crowds by
singing popular songs. Then, having captured his audience, he
turned to religious subjects. It's not clear when he told the
riddles which, unfortunately, are written in 10th-century Latin
with occasional notes in West Saxon.
</P>
<P>
   In a love letter written in 1477, a Norfolk woman named Margery
Brews tells her beloved John Paston that her father will not
increase her dowry, but ''Yf that ye loff me, as I tryste verely
that ye do, ye will not leffe me therefor.''
</P>
<P>
   She put her trust in the right man. They were married within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, you will find Elizabeth Barrett's secret sonnets to
Robert Browning, whom she loved ''to the depth and breadth and
height my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight for the ends of
being and ideal grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Austen has an entire case to herself, displaying a newly
acquired writing desk that is believed to have been given to the
author by her father in 1794. With it is a small pair of spectacles
that have always been in the desk and are believed to be hers.
Manuscript pages of ''Persuasion'' display her small, neat
handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The mahogany table on which the Bronte sisters did their writing
in the evenings is on loan to the library. It's ink-stained and
candle-burned -- apparently heavily used in the creation of Emily's
''Wuthering Heights,'' Anne's ''Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' and
Charlotte's ''Jane Eyre.''
</P>
<P>
   A section for children's literature is arranged in a
child-friendly way with recordings to hear through earphones.
''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Robin Hood'' are celebrated there with
other more recent classics. ''Peter Pan'' and ''Alice in
Wonderland'' are placed in the main exhibit in the Imagination
category.
</P>
<P>
   There, too, are J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Hobbit'' and J.K.
Rowling's stupendously successful 1990s creation, Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   A typescript of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' is
single-spaced, the author says, in an attempt to conceal that it
exceeded the generally accepted length for children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She is not likely to have to worry about that ever again.

<HEADLINE> On Stage: Anna Deavere Smith  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anna Deavere Smith doesn't need big costume
changes or lots of props to transform herself into someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing simple black slacks and a crisp white shirt, she just
slips on a tie, picks up a coffee cup or grabs a martini glass and
she's morphed from Abraham Lincoln to George Stephanopoulos,
shifting in between to Anita Hill and Gloria Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a playwright and performer best known for her one-woman
shows about riots in Los Angeles and Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is
back with a thoughtful, provocative play that seeks to shed light
on the America of today by taking stock of a quintessentially
American institution -- the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In ''House Arrest,'' now playing at the Public Theater, Smith,
alone on stage, revives a technique she has used to powerful effect
in the past. In just under three hours, she portrays close to 50
real-life characters, re-enacting what they told her in interviews
or -- for those plucked out of history -- reciting words they wrote
or said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hopes to understand the forces that have shaped America by
looking at the men who have led the country, from Thomas Jefferson
to William Jefferson Clinton. So she sifts through the history of
that most mythologized, most scrutinized American institution,
delving into issues of privacy, the press, power and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off her triumph with ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992'' --
about that city's deadly riots -- Smith went to Washington Arena
Stage for a new project in the mid-1990s, long before Monica
Lewinsky and Ken Starr forever changed the public's perception of
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Its inhabitant, Smith decided, would make the perfect subject
for the next piece in her series, ''On the Road: A Search for
American Character.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to know, originally, to what extent the president
keeps us together, and to what extent he does not,'' she said
during an interview in a bare, spacious Public Theater rehearsal
room. ''I think we're living in a time now, more than ever, where
it's difficult to conceive of the one person who can have the one
explanation for how we are, and I wanted to know why that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find the answer with ''House Arrest,'' she sings at
one moment in the drunken Scottish brogue of a 19th-century
Jefferson critic and orates the next in the aristocratic Virginian
tones of the third president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Her characters, all real people, living and dead, also include
high-powered Washington pundits, a rural South Carolina churchgoer
and FDR's longtime cook. She invokes them vividly and verbatim,
including every giggle, pause, um and uh as she combines pieces of
conversations and speeches into one smooth montage.
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of ''House Arrest'' were performed in Washington
in 1997 and in Los Angeles in 1998 with a cast of actors. But in
New York City, it opened recently as a one-woman show -- updated
with current events. It runs through April 16 but may be extended,
and Smith is likely to take it on the road, as she did with
''Twilight'' and ''Fires in the Mirror,'' about the 1991 riots in
Crown Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 49, spent more than five years bringing ''House Arrest''
to the stage. She followed Clinton and Bob Dole on the 1996
campaign trail, interviewed three presidents and some 300
journalists, scholars, politicians and government aides, and, with
a team of research assistants, pored through material on Jefferson,
Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   While the play's first half is historical, Act II focuses
entirely on the Clinton presidency -- sex and politics as only
modern Washington can combine them. Smith pursues the theme
suggested by her title, examining the peculiar paradox of a man who
has immense power but must live with the pressure of being watched
almost constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a celebrity culture and the president is the celebrity
in chief,'' Stephanopoulos says in the play, portrayed by Smith
with a martini glass in hand. ''The deal is you can do whatever you
want. The price is, everybody's going to know everything you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny has a morbid side. Former U.S. News &AMP; World Report
photographer Brian Palmer -- Smith with a red baseball cap pulled on
backwards -- describes how he and his White House colleagues remain
constantly focused on the president during public events, just in
case disaster strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wanna have the president in your view, in your viewfinder,
pretty much all the time,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Smith does in a gripping segment that combines
past and present, as she re-creates Lincoln's last moments while
training a row of cameras on the doomed president.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can't write a play about privacy in the White
House without mentioning Lewinsky and that blue dress. Smith
captures the fervid pursuit of sexual wrongdoing that lay beneath
the calm, legalistic face of Starr's investigation when she
performs as one of the special prosecutor's deputies questioning
Clinton for a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me define 'phone sex' for the purposes of my question,''
the lawyer says in a segment that recalls the complicated language
Washington used to debate the meaning of a very simple act.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, a Baltimore native who now lives in San
Francisco, sees the Lewinsky investigation as the culmination of a
cynicism that began with the Vietnam War and Watergate and has
grown deeper since.
</P>
<P>
   In today's public life, she said, ''There isn't so much a
pursuit of truth as there is a pursuit of lies. The question is,
how will we ever move out of that? ... Spiritually, it breeds a
dreadful, dreadful cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes theater can help reinvolve Americans in the nation's
future, and bridge schisms like the one between blacks and whites.
That's the mission of her Harvard-based Institute on the Arts and
Civic Dialogue. In 1996, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation gave Smith a so-called ''genius grant'' to promote her
work, and she is also a professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Her plays' inclusion of so many opposing viewpoints has been
praised for helping promote understanding and letting audiences see
the humanity of those who disagree with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission of my adult life,'' Smith explains, ''is how to
cause communication across boundaries of difference, and how to use
art as part of that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The rifts associated with color have long interested Smith, and
in ''House Arrest,'' she traces the divides to the nation's
earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   The play begins by musing over Jefferson's internal
contradictions and his complicated legacy. The eloquent and
passionately intellectual author of the Declaration of Independence
owned slaves, believed black people were inferior to whites and did
little to oppose the spread of slavery as America expanded.
</P>
<P>
   In the play, he comes to symbolize the moral ambiguity on which
America was founded, and which haunts us today.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, Smith quotes documentary filmmaker Ken Burns as
saying, ''ensured that we would inherit the poison of the
indecision on race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This idea that Jefferson was living in moral ambiguity every
single day of his life, and that there was a shadow side to
everything he did, is a part of human nature,'' Smith said. ''And
the question is, how do we work with the shadow, how do we keep it
in check?''
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, she answers herself, opening one mind at a time,
optimistic that America's deepest wounds can be healed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slavery was a big mistake, so that seems to me to indicate
that there can also be a big lesson,'' she says. ''I don't know
that I will live to see the great symphony, the sort of Beethoven's
Ninth of America, but I believe that will happen in the next
century, and plan on living whatever time I have left to push that
along.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 137.44; Nasdaq Down 27.43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks turned lower today as investors
beaten down and bewildered by Tuesday's wild market stopped
punishing technology stocks, but decided it was time to start
taking profits from other sectors that ran up last week.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 137.44 at 11,027.40, having given up an early
gain. American Express, down 2} to 144\, and J.P. Morgan, down 3 to
133 1/16, led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 27.43 at 4,121.46, having
recovered from a drop of 139.80 earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly modest, but the volatility that marked
Tuesday's session remained, sending the indexes fluctuating between
positive and negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 15.38 at 1,479.35, and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was up 7.91 to 508.57.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell at the opening bell as traders struggled to find
their footing after Tuesday's chaotic selloff, when both the Nasdaq
and the Dow fell more than 500 points only to finish the turbulent
session with modest, double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   The wildness on Wall Street rattled most overseas markets,
making it difficult for the U.S. market to mount any real recovery.
In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent, with
technology shares leading the decline. In afternoon trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 2.6 percent and France's CAC-40 was
down 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the FT-SE 100 index was down 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York session wore on, some Wall Street investors went
looking for bargains, but there wasn't much enthusiasm, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it more as the eye of the storm,'' said Gail Dudack,
chief investment strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
''The danger for the market place has not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed. Microsoft fell 2 3/16 to 86] and
Qualcomm, a wireless communications company that led the Nasdaq's
advance in 1999, fell 6 9/16 to 140 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, a leading maker of computer chip equipment,
rose 4\ to 102].
</P>
<P>
   Financial and consumer goods stocks, which rose sharply last
week, slipped as investors nervously took profits. Procter &AMP; Gamble
fell 1 7/16 to 62.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks that are representatives of the ''old economy''
continued to fare better. Sears rose 4 9/16 to 35 1/16 after saying
it expects first-quarter profits to beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market received a vote of confidence today from Abby Joseph
Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, who spoke at a
White House conference on the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past decade, we have been enthusiastic about the
outlook for U.S. stock prices in the United States, and we remain
so,'' Cohen said. She said the long-running bull market had been
driven by steady economic gains and therefore was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cohen's recommendation that clients put some of their
stock holdings into cash sparked a round of selling on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was
scheduled to discuss the Internet and productivity at the same
conference.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues led advancers
by a 10-to-9 margin. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 5-to-4
margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume was 504.18 million shares, well behind Tuesday's
chaotic pace.

<HEADLINE> Britain Not Warned of Rover Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's trade secretary, criticized for failing
to avert the sale of Rover cars and the likely loss of thousands of
jobs, said Wednesday he had no chance to act because BMW gave no
warning of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The German automaker played its cards ''very close to its
chest'' in the months before deciding to sell its loss-making
subsidiary, Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said during
two hours of questions by a parliamentary select committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rover chairman Walter Samann outlined a plan to stem Rover's
mounting losses when he met Byers on March 10 -- six days before the
BMW board voted to sell Rover.
</P>
<P>
   BMW had given the impression that it was ''business at usual''
at Rover despite daily losses of $3.2 million in 1999 and that it
was continuing with planned investment at its Longbridge Plant in
Birmingham, where 8,000 jobs are now at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not given information that BMW (was) considering
breaking up Rover and selling Longbridge,'' Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   BMW announced in mid-March its plan to sell Rover to a group of
British venture capitalists, Alchemy. The group has no experience
with auto-making, and has acknowledged that job losses are
inevitable as the plant becomes a niche producer of sports cars
under the name MG Car Co.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy hopes to post a profit within three years and sell the
company within seven.
</P>
<P>
   Labor union leaders fear Rover will be allowed to die and
thousands of jobs will die with the company. They are trying to
find another buyer for the car group, but the response has been
torpid.

<HEADLINE> 'Jaws' Author Teams With Sharks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As he's being lowered into the water off
southern Australia in a shark cage, author Peter Benchley has a
sudden morbid thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of these days one of these fellows is going to take
revenge for 'Jaws,''' said the novelist whose shark tale cleared
beaches 25 years ago, ''and I don't want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   He's safe. Great White Sharks don't appear to hold grudges. And
if the sharks of the world could somehow understand what Benchley
is doing now to protect them and educate the world about their
behavior, they'd probably watch his back, not bite it.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century after ''Jaws'' chilled all who read it,
Benchley caught up with sharks for a ''National Geographic''
special that airs Sunday on CNBC at 8 p.m. EDT. His impressions and
David Doubilet's photos are also in April's issue of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing that his research in Australia and off the
coast of South Africa taught him, it's that he could not write
''Jaws'' today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not posit the situation now that I posited then -- sort
of a rogue shark that came around and wouldn't go away because it
had found a steady diet of human beings,'' Benchley said in an
interview over a seafood lunch (crab, not shark).
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned that much of the shark behavior they
used to ascribe to aggression is simply curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I attributed to them a kind of marauding monsterism that
became what 'Jaws' was,'' he said. ''Now we know that sharks do not
attack boats. The way they decide what to eat is by biting it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the split second after a shark sinks its teeth into human
flesh, it makes a complex calculation to determine whether the prey
is worth the caloric energy needed to kill and eat it, Benchley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks consider humans, for the most part, too bony and lean to
make a good meal. Fatty seals are much better. That's why 75
percent of humans attacked by Great Whites are spit out.
</P>
<P>
   One bite is often enough, as Rodney Fox learned. He was attacked
in 1963 while spearfishing off the coast of Australia, and needed
462 stitches. Rather than begrudge the species, he's spent much of
his time working to protect sharks, and accompanied Benchley on his
research mission.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Benchley had always been fascinated by sharks during
summers in Nantucket, and wanted to write a book about them.
Clearly, others shared his interest.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't regret ''Jaws,'' or the more than 20 million copies
of the book that were sold. It gave a struggling free-lance writer
a successful and comfortable career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Completely inadvertently, it tapped into a very, very deep
fear,'' he said. ''If I had done it on purpose, it would be one
thing. But I didn't know for years what was responsible for the
enormous phenomenon of 'Jaws.'''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like the ''momentary spasm of macho nonsense'' that
made people go out and kill sharks in the wake of his book. He's
comforted by the letters he gets to this day from people who say
his book triggered an interest in sharks and a desire to preserve
them.
</P>
<P>
   The development of modern fishing technology, like long lines
that stretch as far as 80 miles, has done more harm to sharks than
any response to ''Jaws,'' Benchley believes.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles when reminded of the nightmares ''Jaws'' caused, and
how John Williams' ominous score for the movie became a symbol of
impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that way about 'Psycho.' When I went to see 'Psycho' in
1961, my date wet her pants,'' he said. ''I cannot be responsible
for how people react. I can only be responsible for what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Benchley is amazed by what he sees in a Great White Shark
feeding ground off the coast of South Africa. The sharks leap out
of the water while attacking seals, their balletic movements
fearsome yet beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   And he watches, in horror at first, as the co-owner of a
shark-diving operation reaches down toward a shark that had
surfaced near his boat's motor. The man wraps his hand around the
shark's nose. The animal pauses, seemingly transfixed for a few
seconds, then disappears back into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've ever seen a Great White Shark,'' Benchley said,
''it's something you never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll never forget the details of one inadvertent encounter off
the coast of the Bahamas in the early 1980s. He was in scuba gear,
diving down to see a huge pile of cannons that had been buried at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he swam along one side of the cannons while, unseen by
him, a shark was swimming along the other side. A companion
watching from the surface could see both of them, and slapped the
water to get Benchley's attention. Not understanding, he ignored
the warning.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to swim until he reached the front of the pile,
arriving at the exact same time the shark did. They stopped, nose
to snout, each shocked at the sight of the other. The shark's fins
dropped like brakes, he voided his bowels, then fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took off, needless to say, in the other direction,''
Benchley said.

By The Associated Press	   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment, born on April 10, 1988, was the
third youngest supporting-actor nominee in the history of the
Academy Awards. Brandon De Wilde, a nominee for ''Shane'' in 1953,
was a day younger, and Justin Henry, nominated for ''Kramer vs.
Kramer'' in 1979, was 8 years old. ''I never had dreams of the
Oscars, even when the movie came out,'' Osment said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannen Doherty, born on April 12, 1971, recently starred in
ABC's ''Satan's School for Girls,'' a remake of a 27-year-old movie
that capitalized on television's current obsession with the
supernatural. Doherty, one of the stars of The WB's ''Charmed,''
said her portrayal of Beth in the TV movie was probably one of her
more interesting performances. ''I'm not saying good, I'm just
saying interesting because my reactions are really bizarre. When
horrifying stuff happens, my character sort of deadpans it and
rolls her eyes,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Country singer Vince Gill, who was born on April 12, 1957, is
one of the nominees for best male vocalist at this year's TNN
Awards. Winners will be announced June 15 during an awards ceremony
to be broadcast by the TNN cable network. Gill and singer Amy Grant

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Dave Douglas  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. GANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ask Dave Douglas what he's listening to and
he'll give you an eclectic earful: the Emerson String Quartet
playing Shostakovich, new records by Steely Dan and Joni Mitchell,
and older recordings by pioneering female jazz pianist-composer
Mary Lou Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas believes in musical diversity -- breaking down boundaries
and using jazz as a vehicle to absorb other influences. The
36-year-old trumpeter and composer leads 10 different ensembles,
including Magic Triangle, an acoustic jazz quartet; the chamber
group Charms of the Night Sky; the Balkan-jazz band Tiny Bell Trio;
the string ensemble Parallel Worlds; and the Indian-jazz group
Satya. He also finds time for collaborations with choreographer
Trisha Brown and performances as a sideman with John Zorn and other
contemporary improvisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Montclair, N.J., native arrived in New York in 1984 and
worked as a street performer while finishing his musical studies at
New York University. In the 1990s, he emerged as a mainstay of the
downtown alternative jazz scene, making more than 100 recordings,
including 14 as a leader for independent labels. The most recent,
''Leap of Faith'' (Arabesque), features 11 Douglas tunes that serve
as launching pads for his quartet's improvisatory flights.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas has won accolades from jazz critics, winning four
categories at the 1999 New York Jazz Awards, including artist,
composer and trumpeter of the year. He now stands poised to reach
an even larger audience with the release of his major-label debut,
''Soul on Soul'' (RCA), with his sextet celebrating the musical
legacy of Mary Lou Williams.
</P>
<P>
   1. What inspired you to do this tribute to Mary Lou Williams?
</P>
<P>
   Douglas: Mary Lou Williams is really one of the giants of last
century's music. ... but she has been somewhat overlooked. ... She
was on the cutting edge of music beginning in the teens of the 20th
century and ending in the late '70s. It's hard to think of too many
other musicians who spanned all of those different stylistic
periods and who really continued to challenge themselves. I look at
her as an inspiration to myself to keep moving forward and keep
challenging myself and doing new things.
</P>
<P>
   2. In celebrating Williams, how do you see yourself relating to
the jazz tradition?
</P>
<P>
   Douglas: I didn't feel that Mary Lou Williams would want someone
to just play her music and re-create it. I think her vision was
very much about creating new music on the remains of the old music.
... I felt the strongest thing I could do would be to write new
music in celebration of her spirit, thinking about the elements she
dealt with and the story of her life. ... So on the record, there
are four of her pieces and nine of mine. ... I think that the
tradition is here to be moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   3. Why do you work in so many diverse ensembles rather than
focusing on one band?
</P>
<P>
   Douglas: I like to make music in a lot of different ways. The
luxury of living in New York is that there are more inspiring
musicians around than you could ever have time to play with. So by
writing for a lot of different ensembles, I'm able to work with a
lot of these musicians. ... Each project has a very different sound
because I'm writing specifically for the players that are involved.
... I enjoy the challenge of trying something different.
</P>
<P>
   4. Have you had to make any artistic compromises by signing with
a major record label?
</P>
<P>
   Douglas: It's actually been inspiring to be involved with the
people at RCA because they have encouraged me to do exactly what I
want to do and not to pull any punches. When I was offered the
chance to sign with a major (label), several labels came along at
the same time. It was RCA that really made it clear that they
wanted me to continue doing what I'm doing. I'm making four records
over two years for them and producing them myself.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you think your music can appeal to a wider audience?
</P>
<P>
   Douglas: I don't honestly know. I feel that already I'm seeing
this record get to a lot of people who have never heard what I do
and people seem to have a positive reaction. ... As I travel around
the world playing this music, I see that audiences are aware of a
much broader spectrum of music now than they used to be. People
don't tend anymore to be just a jazz fan or just an opera fan. ...
The people I see at my shows seem able to stay with me as I bring
in all these different references to the music. ... People are not
as shocked by music that crosses genre boundaries any more.

<HEADLINE> Dio Unleashes 'Magica'  </HEADLINE>
By GERARD O'LEARY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Heavy-metal singer Ronnie James Dio takes a sip
of herbal tea, collects his thoughts and reflects on his longevity
in the world of hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do anything with quality, I think it will always
last,'' he said. ''Back in the early days of rock -- with Presley
and Little Richard -- people said that wouldn't last, but as history
tells us, it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dio has lasted long enough to earn the title of ''legend,''
bestowed on him by fans and music insiders alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to give the fans what they want even though rock 'n'
roll is very generational; you try to keep your main fan base
happy,'' he said. ''I knew from early on that if I do it well, my
music would always be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   His career began in the late 1960s with Elf. When legendary
guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple in 1975, he enlisted
Elf's rhythm section and Dio's amazing vocals for his new band.
Rainbow recorded four albums before Dio and Blackmore parted ways
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Dio then became known as a hired gun.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Black Sabbath to replace charismatic frontman Ozzy
Osbourne in 1979. He rejuvenated the popularity of Sabbath and
brought the band back on top.
</P>
<P>
   After three years with Sabbath, Dio left to form his own band.
He recruited guitarist Vivian Campbell, who went on to a successful
career with Whitesnake and Def Leppard, drummer Vinny Appice and
bassist Jimmy Bain. The band skyrocketed to success after the
release of its debut album ''Holy Diver.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically superior to many groups, Dio became known as the
thinking man's band with its array of subjects from mythology and
Arthurian legend to science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being an only child, I found comfort in reading books,'' Dio
said. ''Books by Walter Scott and books like the 'Knights of the
Round Table' and 'Mists of Avalon' have inspired my lyrics and the
way I want to tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Dio's tours were legendary, with the stage almost as big as an
aircraft carrier and with enough lights to power a small town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would spend a half-million dollars on our tours,'' he said.
''We had a huge dragon, lights and lasers that we toured around the
world with for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of heavy metal currently at a standstill,
Dio said he's just bringing out the band and giving fans what's
most important -- the music.
</P>
<P>
   ''Magica'' (Spitfire Records) is his first concept album.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept album was something I wanted to do for a long
time, and was pretty easy because you have a plan,'' he explained.
''You write a song about this guy or that place, suddenly you have
lyrics to go with a song and the story line falls into place.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Magica'' takes the listener on a mystical journey to a land
known as Blessing, where evil comes to destroy good. ''It tells of
how tyrants separate the old from the young and indoctrinate the
young with their own twisted ideas,'' Dio said.
</P>
<P>
   The album contains references to the holocaust. The evil ruler
Shadowlife begins to exterminate the people of Blessing and tries
to gain complete power.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is what tyrants do, they separate the people and burn all
their books and make them conform to their own beliefs,'' Dio said.
''And we can never forget that time in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The band consists of guitar virtuoso Craig Goldie, who replaced
Campbell in 1986, bassist Jimmy Bain and former AC/DC drummer Simon
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The songs are a throwback to vintage Dio, a mixture of ''Holy
Diver'' and ''Last in Line.'' The tracks ''Fever Dreams'' and
''Turn to Stone'' give Dio fans what they want: good old-fashioned
heavy metal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Pat Boone released ''In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice
Guy,'' a tongue-in-cheek collection of classic heavy metal hits
rearranged to a jazzy easy-listening format. Boone covered Dio's
''Holy Diver.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked Pat, 'Do you know what this song is about?' and he
answered, 'It's not a Christian song,''' Dio said with a smile. ''I
told him, 'In actuality. ... the song is about Christ.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dio will be touring most of the year in support of his new
album.

<HEADLINE> Blair Underwood's Frenetic Lifestyle  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. KENNEDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blair Underwood is back in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he's lived there for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, who played a young lawyer on the TV series ''L.A.
Law,'' now stars with Vivica A. Fox on the Los Angeles-based
medical drama ''City of Angels'' on CBS (Wednesday, 8 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   He also appears in the new film ''Rules of Engagement,''
directed by William Friedkin and starring Tommy Lee Jones and
Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But Underwood manages to take this frenetic lifestyle in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Los Angeles, there is such a drive for stardom and
celebrity,'' he said in an interview. ''It all becomes about the
showcase to get a pilot or a movie. But there's a balance. You can
take the work seriously, but not take yourself too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, 35, certainly takes an earnest approach to his work.
He is committed to making the characters he plays believable -- and
is willing to endure some rigorous training to do so.
</P>
<P>
   For ''Rules of Engagement,'' military technical adviser Dale Dye
(who also worked on the set of ''Saving Private Ryan'') trained
Underwood and 30 other men in modern desert warfare to prepare them
for their roles as U.S. Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent seven days and six nights in basic training in the
Sahara desert in Morocco. Dye did not allow us to speak of
filmmaking or Hollywood. So we all really bonded, and by the time
we started filming, we were like a well-oiled machine,'' Underwood
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also drew from his childhood as an ''Army brat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was raised in an Army family. My father retired as a
full-bird colonel. So I have a tremendous understanding of what it
is to follow orders. I was raised with great discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rules of Engagement'' is about a Marine officer (Jackson) who
is court-martialed for allegedly breaking the military's rules of
combat during a siege on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. Underwood plays
Capt. Lee, who carries out the officer's command to open fire on a
crowd of protesters. The gunfire kills 80 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Although he calls his time in basic training ''the most
extraordinary acting exercise I'd ever had,'' Underwood doesn't
think there is any special formula for taking on a certain role.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to believe whatever you're doing in order to make the
audience believe what you're doing. Whatever it takes for you to
believe it is what's necessary for you to do,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the role of Dr. Ben Turner, chief of surgery at
the inner-city Angels of Mercy hospital on ''City of Angels,''
Underwood observed doctors performing brain surgeries and spent
nights in a trauma ward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to absorb the technical aspects of surgery and the
atmosphere of a hospital. I wanted to feel the demeanor of doctors,
how they interacted under the everyday stress of their work and in
trauma situations,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ''City of Angels'' has a predominantly black cast, and black
directors and writers are key elements of the show. Underwood knows
that many people regard the series as an effort to put minority
characters on center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot is riding on this show,'' he said. ''Most of the
so-called black shows on television are comedies. A lot of people
in Hollywood felt that a black drama could not succeed, that a
white audience won't watch a show with black leads.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is confident that the tide is turning for the success of
black dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are smart enough to get beyond racial issues. They
either enjoy the show or not on its own merit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Underwood manage to relax?
</P>
<P>
   ''Movies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Underwood and his wife are not spending time with their two
young children, they take off for the local theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get popcorn, Raisinettes and a Coke and watch movies.''

<HEADLINE> London Trading Extended After Halt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The London Stock Exchange sputtered back to life
Wednesday after a technical fault forced the suspension of trading
for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure, which lasted 7{ hours, was the worst ever
experienced by Europe's biggest exchange. Trading finally resumed
at 3:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The market was paralyzed during what should have been one of its
busiest sessions -- the last day of the British tax year. Untold
numbers of people may have missed out on a chance to buy or sell
shares in a last-minute attempt to minimize their liability for
capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown also came at a time of extreme uncertainty on
equity markets around the world, following the most volatile
session in Wall Street's history on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown coincided with a report in the Financial Times
that the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges were holding initial
talks about a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing could not have been worse,'' said Jim Wood-Smith,
head of research at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure wiped out accurate price data starting at 8
a.m. (3 a.m. EDT), the market's normal opening hour.
</P>
<P>
   Once the system was up and running, the exchange announced
extended trading hours until 8:00 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT) to help make up
for some of the time lost.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stemmed from a fault in the electronic feed that
transmits prices from the exchange to dealers' screens. To fix it,
technicians turned off all computer links with the exchange, a move
that also deprived investors and dealers of key announcements by
companies listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very bad advertisement for the City of London.
This is not going to make us look good on the world stage,'' said
Mark Dampier, of the brokerage Hargreaves Lansdown.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown came just two days after another less dramatic
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was disrupted Monday morning when the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index of blue chip stocks and other
indexes could not be obtained due to a computer problem at the
financial information service group, Reuters PLC.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, unlike Wednesday, prices of individual shares
could still be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Shares fell after trading resumed, with the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index down 118.4 points, or 1.8
percent, at 6,308.6 in late trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's a non-event and we'll just start again
tomorrow,'' said Leonard White, a trader at Daiwa SBCM Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Financial Services Authority later announced an
investigation into Wednesday's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FSA sees the failure of major trading systems to open as a
serious matter that requires a prompt and thorough response,'' the
watchdog agency said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Justice Fund-Raising Files Found  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary
committees today sought documents from the Justice Department
detailing internal disagreements over appointing an independent
counsel in the campaign fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked for memos by former
fund-raising task force chief Charles LaBella and FBI Director
Louis Freeh that favor an independent counsel to investigate the
conduct of top Clinton administration officials in the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Congress also requested a memo by Lee Radek,
chief of the department's public integrity section, who opposed
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the request were Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla., who head subcommittees with congressional
oversight of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The requested documents were written by political appointees
or senior managers whose decisions are clearly subject to
congressional oversight,'' said the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Reno refused to turn over the LaBella and Freeh memos
to the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department has a substantial interest in avoiding a
chilling effect on the candor of future prosecutorial
deliberations,'' Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators and two representatives said that ''this
reason'' given in the letter to Burton ''is not enough to justify
your refusal to comply'' with the new request.
</P>
<P>
   Among other documents the four are seeking:
</P>
<P>
   --All records Reno relied on about whether to seek an independent
counsel in the campaign fund-raising probe.
</P>
<P>
   --A memo by James Robinson, head of the department's criminal
division.
</P>
<P>
   --E-mail and any other records relating to the key memos.

<HEADLINE> Poll shows more people think New York City a good place to live  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- More than half of New York voters statewide
approve of how New York City police are doing their job and think
that the city is safer than it was five years ago, a statewide poll
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute poll taken in
the wake of the Patrick Dorismond slaying by an NYPD officer showed
that 3 in 4 black voters disapproved of the police and only 13
percent had a favorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac Director Maurice Carroll said the breakdown was not
surprising since ''New York City has this racial split about the
cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a Brooklyn native of Haitian descent, was fatally
shot by undercover narcotics police in Manhattan. The incident,
coming just after four other city police officers were acquitted of
criminal charges in the slaying of Amadou Diallo, has outraged
black activists throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   And while half of upstate voters and 64 percent of suburban
voters voiced their approval of New York City police, city
residents weren't so positive.
</P>
<P>
   Among city residents, 50 percent say they disapprove of the
police while 40 percent approved. Ten percent say they don't know
or had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll attributed distance as a factor in the disparity in
attitudes about the NYPD. While three-fourths of New York City
residents followed the Dorismond case somewhat or very closely, 68
percent of suburban voters and only 35 percent of upstate voters
paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Familiarity dissipates and the attitude changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most black voters (87 percent) and 58 percent of New York City
voters also believe that police in New York City generally use
excessive force against minority suspects even as the statewide
count found only 39 percent of voters have that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But there is overwhelming agreement among voters -- nearly 70
percent -- that undercover police operations are a good idea. Black
voters also favored undercover operations, but the numbers were
lower, at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New York City was deemed safer by 52 percent of voters across
the state. In addition, More than two-thirds of voters polled think
the city is a good place to live and 32 percent of those living
outside New York City say they're now more likely to visit the city
than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 1,058 registered voters was
conducted March 28-April 3 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters believe that NYPD will fight crime more
effectively if New York City concentrates on building good
community relations.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Benevolent Association was not
immediately available for comment.

<HEADLINE> German Bank Merger Called Off  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Dresdner Bank AG has called off its
merger with rival Deutsche Bank AG after clashes over how to
integrate their operations, only a month after announcing a $30
billion deal to create one of the world's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse, revealed Wednesday, was seen as a major
embarrassment for some of Germany's most esteemed corporate names,
and analysts called it a lost opportunity to begin the shake-up
many believe is needed to compete globally.
</P>
<P>
   ''A true chance for German banks is over,'' said Volker von
Kruechten, analyst at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ''This deal would have
allowed the restructuring of the German banking sector.''
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement, Dresdner said its management board
''unanimously decided to discontinue the merger process'' with the
bigger Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner said that although the two banks had agreed to a
''merger of equals,'' Deutsche Bank proceeded after the deal was
announced March 9 to try to sell off Dresdner's investment banking
arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank chairman Rolf Breuer denied that the merger was
ever intended to be one of equals. Deutsche was to hold close to
two-thirds of the combined banks, and Dresdner the rest.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Breuer said ''no solution acceptable to
both sides could be found'' over the fate of Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not impressed with the planned merger, sending
both banks' share prices down more than 20 percent over the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief suspension of trading in Frankfurt on Wednesday,
both banks saw their stock prices climb more than 3 percent on the
day, with Deutsche finishing up 3.19 euros to 80.01 euros ($77.18)
and Dresdner closing up 2 euros to 49 euros ($43.28)
</P>
<P>
   However, shares in the Allianz insurance giant, a major
shareholder that had helped bring the two banks together, fell
nearly 14 percent when trading resumed, falling 61.16 euros to 380
euros ($365.50). Allianz had stood to gain a significant stake in
the two banks' retail operations as well as majority control of
Deutsche Bank's jewel DWS fund manager and insurer Deutscher
Herold.
</P>
<P>
   A major aim of the deal was to unravel the stakes Deutsche and
Dresdner have in Munich-based Allianz and vice versa. Currently
Deutsche Bank holds a 7 percent stake in Allianz, while Dresdner
holds 10 percent. Allianz holds 21.5 percent of Dresdner and 4.9
percent of Deutsche.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, swallowed New York-based
Bankers Trust last year, raising its total assets to $840 billion.
The merger with Germany's No. 3 player, Dresdner, would have
boosted assets to $1.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   That would have put the combined institution just behind the
Mizuho Financial Group of Japan, which announced last August it was
creating an institution with $1.3 trillion in assets by merging
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of unprofitable retail operations, the combined German
behemoth wanted to focus on lucrative investment banking and global
expansion. Breuer said, however, that Deutsche planned no other
mergers for now.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with their own uncertain futures, employees at both
banks were already defecting to other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Lim, head of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson's fixed-income
division and a member of the merger integration team, quit Tuesday.
And Salomon Smith Barney earlier this week poached seven analysts
from Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dobson, head of Deutsche Bank's asset management
division, resigned shortly after the merger was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was expected to save the company $2.8 billion by
wiping out overlapping operations. But German unions and some
politicians had complained about plans to close about 800 of their
combined 2,500 branches, resulting in an estimated 16,000 layoffs,
mostly in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 87.41; Dow Down 87.72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks moved higher today, shaking
off remnants of yesterday's volatility as investors stepped in
looking for bargains. Blue-chip stocks fell, although losses were
contained.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 87.41 at 4,236.30, having recovered from a drop of 139.80
earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 87.72 at 11,077.12
after giving up an early gain.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly modest, but the volatility that marked
Tuesday's session remained, sending the indexes fluctuating between
positive and negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 3.36 at 1,498.09, and the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies was up 16.88 at 517.74.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell at the opening bell as traders struggled to find
their footing after Tuesday's chaotic selloff, when both the Nasdaq
and the Dow fell more than 500 points only to finish the turbulent
session with modest, double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   The wildness on Wall Street rattled most overseas markets,
making it difficult for the U.S. market to mount any real recovery.
In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent, with
technology shares leading the decline. In afternoon trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 2.6 percent and France's CAC-40 was
down 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the FT-SE 100 index was down 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York session wore on, some Wall Street investors went
looking for bargains, but there wasn't much enthusiasm, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it more as the eye of the storm,'' said Gail Dudack,
chief investment strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
''The danger for the market place has not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors confined their technology buying to the best-known
names. Applied Materials, a leading maker of computer chip
equipment, rose 4\ to 102]. Dell Computer rose 1} to 56 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and consumer goods stocks, which rose sharply last
week, slipped as investors nervously took profits. Procter &AMP; Gamble
fell ~ to 62| and J.P. Morgan fell 2~ to 133 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks that are representatives of the ''old economy''
continued to fare better. Sears rose 5 9/16 to 36 1/16 after saying
it expects first-quarter profits to beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market received a vote of confidence today from Abby Joseph
Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, who spoke at a
White House conference on the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past decade, we have been enthusiastic about the
outlook for U.S. stock prices in the United States, and we remain
so,'' Cohen said. She said the long-running bull market had been
driven by steady economic gains and therefore was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cohen's recommendation that clients put some of their
stock holdings into cash sparked a round of selling on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was discussing the
Internet and productivity at the same conference.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues led advancers
by a 10-to-9 margin. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 5-to-4
margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume was 750.40 million shares, well behind Tuesday's
chaotic pace.

<HEADLINE> States Water Pollution Failure Cited  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three-fourths of the states are failing to
address water pollution caused by runoff from farms and forests,
ignoring a provision in the federal Clean Water Act, a leading
conservation group charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation said a survey it conducted
shows that 38 states have done little to address non-point
pollution under the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''States have not stepped forward to systematically deal with
polluted runoff and contaminated rain,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murray, the report's co-author, attributed the states'
reluctance to ''a combination of political intimidation ... and
bureaucratic inertia'' and said ''our lakes, streams and coasts are
paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The group evaluated compliance with a provision of the Clean
Water Act aimed at protection watersheds from pollution --
pesticides, excessive nutrients and other chemicals -- that come
primarily from agriculture and forests as opposed to a specific
smokestack or discharge pipe.
</P>
<P>
   States are required to designate waterways impaired from such
pollution, prioritize the severity of the problems and develop a
plan to curtail the pollution. Murray said most states have done
little beyond compiling lists.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous lawsuits have been filed accusing both the federal
Environmental Protection Agency and many states of not aggressively
putting the provision into practice, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the EPA proposed a rule that would strengthen
compliance, requiring states to step up development of plans for
watershed protection so that all impaired waterways are safeguarded
within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Federation said the regulation, which has yet to be
issued, will improve state compliance, but with its lengthy
compliance schedule ''does not acknowledge the urgency in restoring
polluted rives, lakes and estuaries''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed EPA rule has been criticized by farm groups and
even the U.S. Agriculture Department. A senior USDA official last
year suggested the EPA does not have authority to regulate
agricultural runoff, a position later disavowed by Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Glickman has expressed concern about the EPA's lack of
a clear estimate on how much compliance will cost farmers,
landowners and the logging industry.
</P>
<P>
   The rule would require certain pollution levels to be
established for impaired waterways and it would be up to each state
to determine how to meet the reductions, EPA Administrator Carol
Browner told lawmakers at a hearing in February.
</P>
<P>
   EPA has estimated that states so far have approved only a small
fraction of the 40,000 runoff-control plans need to comply with the
law, a reflection of the findings disclosed Wednesday by the
National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation group said 19 states, Puerto Rico and the
District of Columbia have largely ignored the law and another 19
states have demonstrated ''poor'' compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve states were found to meet ''minimum'' requirements:
Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   States with the worst compliance were: Alabama, Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York,
Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

   Roger Altman, former Treasury Secretary: There's going to be a
correction, it's probably going to be sharp one, at least in terms
of technology equity values. Not all companies will be affected --
the Intels, Ciscos and Microsofts should be less affected.
</P>
<P>
   ... But should such a shakeout occur, my point here is that it

speculation is, I believe, a danger; margin lending, especially,
has been exploding and those loans will be, are being, exposed as
stock prices decline.
</P>
<P>
   ... But a crash need not come. Despite the nervousness of the
markets, these are good times. These are very good times.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   William D. Nordhaus, Yale University professor: It's my view
that the current level of stock prices is not only unrealistically
high, but I think it's also economically damaging. Inflated asset
values make people feel wealthier than they are, and they reduce
national saving. And I think that's one reason ... one of the
important reasons to have a budget surplus is to offset the lower
private savings.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Carl Frederick Bergsten, Institute for International Economics
director: I think there is one big imbalance in the economy that
has not been mentioned, somewhat to my surprise. And that's the
huge and growing trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ... A sharp decline of the dollar would push up inflation, would
push up interest rates. That in turn would push down the stock
market. That triple hit could be the speed limit that we're worried
about.

<HEADLINE> Plans for Pan-American Exposition centennial party slow going  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Organizers of a centennial celebration to
commemorate the 1901 Pan-American Exposition have already scaled
back their original grandiose plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even their hopes for a more modest celebration are fading
as they battle apparent apathy from corporate and government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're limping along,'' said Robert Skerker, a co-chairman of
the Pan-Am 2001 Committee.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8 million visitors attended the 1901 event in Buffalo.
A Los Angeles consulting firm hired by a Pan-Am committee in 1998
predicted 1.5 million to 2 million visitors might attend events
over a five-month period during the centennial.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers have been unable to persuade top political and
business leaders to line up with funding for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difficulty we so often have in accomplishing things in
this community reared its head,'' Kerry Grant, one of several
people who have been discussing the centennial since 1996, told The
Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants recommended a smorgasbord of events under one
umbrella, with possible themes being the Canadian border, Buffalo
as a transportation ''gateway to the West,'' the Erie Canal, the
city's historic grain milling industry and the assassination of
President William McKinley at the 1901 exposition, and Theodore
Roosevelt's subsequent inauguration in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration envisioned by MCM Group International would
carry a $40.9 million operating budget, plus a $9 million
''elective capital budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm forecast revenues totaling $50.6 million, including $30
million from corporate sponsors, ''yielding a break-even event''
but it also assumed ''a 25 percent funding subsidy from various
city, regional and state government sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rudnick, president of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership,
said the business organization was never courted for the Pan-Am
once the exploratory planning phase ended.
</P>
<P>
   Skerker said he was told the group was too busy to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, individual groups are moving ahead with plans to
observe the Pan-Am's 100th anniversary. They agree all would
benefit from an umbrella group to package and sell the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there were a coordinating entity, it would raise the
visibility and credibility of some things that are going on and
make fund raising easier,'' said William Siener, executive director
of the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society. The society's
Greek Revival building is the only original exposition structure
still standing on the site and will be the site of a visitor
center.
</P>
<P>
   Other centennial plans in the works include conferences and
events focusing on female contributions to the 1901 exhibition and
a documentary for public television on the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backer To Focus on Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas entrepreneur who spent $2.5 million on
ads touting George W. Bush's environmental record plans to
reorganize his Republicans for Clean Air to focus on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The group will lobby lawmakers on clean-air issues and also air
issue ads meant to influence congressional races, spokeswoman Mona
Taylor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Sam Wyly said he was getting out of presidential
politics, noting that his TV efforts had failed to garner attention
for environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly's group will use direct mail and an Internet site to
recruit support and dues-paying members, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, who with his brother has donated more than $210,000 to
Bush, stirred the presidential campaign last month with TV ads that
praised Bush's environmental record and criticized rival John
McCain. The ads were strongly criticized by the McCain camp, which
said they were an improper effort by Bush. The Bush campaign denied
any connection.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday in Seattle, Wyly said the ads during the
presidential primaries were not effective in publicizing his
message about environmentally friendly power and that he would not
be making any more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of you are aware of my recent foray into presidential
politics. I have already decided it is to be my last,'' he said
upon receiving an award from the Climate Institute. ''I thought I
had a clever idea to get America to focus on the clean air issue
and to help my presidential candidate.''

<HEADLINE> London Stocks End Down After Glitch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The London Stock Exchange sputtered back to life
Wednesday after a technical fault forced the suspension of trading
for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure, which lasted 7{ hours, was the worst ever
experienced by Europe's biggest exchange. Trading finally resumed
at 3:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The market was paralyzed during what should have been one of its
busiest sessions -- the last day of the British tax year. Untold
numbers of people may have missed out on a chance to buy or sell
shares in a last-minute attempt to minimize their liability for
capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown also came at a time of extreme uncertainty on
equity markets around the world, following the most volatile
session in Wall Street's history on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown coincided with a report in the Financial Times
that the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges were holding initial
talks about a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing could not have been worse,'' said Jim Wood-Smith,
head of research at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure wiped out accurate price data starting at 8
a.m. (3 a.m. EDT), the market's normal opening hour.
</P>
<P>
   Once the system was up and running, the exchange announced
extended trading hours until 8:00 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT) to help make up
for some of the time lost.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stemmed from a fault in the electronic feed that
transmits prices from the exchange to dealers' screens. To fix it,
technicians turned off all computer links with the exchange, a move
that also deprived investors and dealers of key announcements by
companies listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very bad advertisement for the City of London.
This is not going to make us look good on the world stage,'' said
Mark Dampier, of the brokerage Hargreaves Lansdown.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown came just two days after another less dramatic
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was disrupted Monday morning when the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index of blue chip stocks and other
indexes could not be obtained due to a computer problem at the
financial information service group, Reuters PLC.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, unlike Wednesday, prices of individual shares
could still be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Shares fell after trading resumed, with the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index finishing down 47.7 points, or
0.74 percent, at 6,379.4 on a provisional market volume of 857
million shares. The exchange said the last 90 minutes of trading
would not be cleared through the system until Thursday morning,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's a non-event and we'll just start again
tomorrow,'' said Leonard White, a trader at Daiwa SBCM Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Financial Services Authority later announced an
investigation into Wednesday's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FSA sees the failure of major trading systems to open as a
serious matter that requires a prompt and thorough response,'' the
watchdog agency said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 122.66; Dow Down 76.32  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks moved higher today as
investors shook off memories of Tuesday's head-spinning selloff and
stepped in looking for bargains. Blue-chip stocks fell, although
losses were contained.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 122.66 at 4,271.55, having recovered
from a drop of 139.80 earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.32 at 11,088.52
after giving up an early gain.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly modest, but the volatility that marked
Tuesday's session remained.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 6.50 at 1,501.23, and the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies was up 24.10 at 524.66.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell at the opening bell as traders struggled to find
their footing after Tuesday's chaotic selloff, when both the Nasdaq
and the Dow fell more than 500 points only to finish the turbulent
session with modest, double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   The wildness on Wall Street rattled most overseas markets,
making it difficult for the U.S. market to mount any real recovery
in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   But as the session wore on, bargain-hunting investors stepped
in, their confidence boosted by some calming words from major
market movers.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, delivered an upbeat message at a White House
conference on the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past decade, we have been enthusiastic about the
outlook for U.S. stock prices in the United States, and we remain
so,'' Cohen said. She said the long-running bull market had been
driven by steady economic gains and therefore was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cohen's recommendation that clients put some of their
stock holdings into cash sparked a round of selling on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon, the market drew some additional support from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who gave credit to the
''extraordinary surge in technological innovation'' for America's
current record-breaking economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as investors returned to the market, most confined their
technology buying to the best-known names. Applied Materials, a
leading maker of computer chip equipment, rose 11\ to 109]. Oracle
rose 4{ to 80 7/16. Hewlett-Packard rose 9[ to 147\.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and consumer goods stocks, which rose sharply last
week, slipped as investors nervously took profits. Procter &AMP; Gamble
fell ~ to 62| and J.P. Morgan fell 2~ to 133 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks that are representatives of the ''old economy''
continued to fare better. Sears rose 5 9/16 to 36 1/16 after saying
it expects first-quarter profits to beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Even as stocks stabilized, some analysts remained skeptical of
the market's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it more as the eye of the storm,'' said Gail Dudack,
chief investment strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
''The danger for the market place has not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Breadth was improving. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing
issues led decliners by a 4-to-3 margin. On the Nasdaq, advancers
overtook decliners by a 5-to-4 margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume was 896.87 million shares, well behind Tuesday's
chaotic pace.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Vets Die Awaiting Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rob Booker tried for nearly two years to
qualify for veterans' compensation, arguing the Lou Gehrig's
disease ravaging his body was connected to his service in the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   But because in almost all cases Gulf War illnesses aren't
automatically recognized by the government, a lengthy investigation
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he and his wife were even urged by a Veterans'
Affairs doctor to get their private physician to change his
diagnosis to improve their chances of securing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't even bother,'' Lynn Booker recalled. ''No doctor is
going to change a diagnosis and set himself up for malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   The VA finally agreed this week to grant Booker benefits. But it
was too late for the former Army national guardsman from Evergreen,
Ala. He died in February at age 35, leaving behind his wife, two
daughters -- ages 2 and 7 -- and lots of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The family's compensation will amount to $1,300 a month in
survivors' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the U.S. victory in the Persian Gulf, there are
the first glimmers of hope that veterans suffering from a variety
of ailments -- some affecting the nervous system -- may one day
automatically qualify for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   VA officials have announced a yearlong study to determine
whether there is a higher incidence of Lou Gehrig's disease among
the 700,000 veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   At least 28 Gulf veterans have been diagnosed with possible
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which destroys the brain and
spinal cord nerve cells. It is the most deadly of so-called Gulf
War illnesses, which also include severe reactions to certain
smells, night sweats, lower back pain, diarrhea, cramps, fatigue
and memory loss
</P>
<P>
   If researchers establish a higher incidence among veterans,
their finding could trigger a presumption that it was
service-connected and lead to automatic compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see this as a solid victory and a very positive move by the
VA,'' said Paul Sullivan, spokesman for the National Gulf War
Resources Center, a nonprofit group. ''It clearly opens the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Gulf veterans still must prove that ailments or
injuries are connected to their service. About 136,000 veterans of
the war have succeeded in securing disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Booker, a study seems like a waste while sick and dying
veterans are being denied compensation. ''It has been nine years
since the war,'' she said. ''They should use the money to help guys
who need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers share the Bookers' frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., criticizes the VA for not
giving Gulf veterans ''the benefit of the doubt. The worst that
could happen is you help someone who needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Bernard Sanders, a liberal Vermont independent, said he
is concerned that serious researchers on Gulf War illness ''are not
getting the kind of support we need from VA and the Department of
Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   One researcher, Dr. Robert Haley, has concluded that Gulf
veterans suffered brain injuries due to chemical exposure during
the war. The chief of clinical epidemiology at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center also found the veterans have a
higher death rate from auto accidents and suicides.
</P>
<P>
   ''In medical science, people who have brain injuries have higher
rates of automobile accidents and a higher rate of depression and
suicide,'' Haley said. ''We proposed that as an explanation and
they (the VA) have not accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John R. Feussner, the VA's chief research and development
officer, said the agency has been ''very receptive to following
leads that might help explain Gulf War illness.'' He said the
agency is spending $160 million for 150 projects.
</P>
<P>
   Those researchers are trying to learn whether Gulf veterans'
ailments resulted from exposure to depleted uranium, tropical
diseases, oil well fires or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the difficulty that lay people don't understand is the
research process is quite methodical,'' Feussner said. ''Gulf War
syndrome isn't as precise as fever or pneumonia. My fear is that
people misunderstand how long it may take to clarify a difficult
issue'' and view the VA as ''bad or inattentive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the 28 likely ALS diagnoses made so far would
approximate the rate expected for the general population. But the
VA proceeded with the study because of other warning flags,
including that veterans with the disease were generally younger
than average ALS sufferers.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Asks Icahn To Join Bidding  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOORE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after Carl Icahn proposed buying Nabisco
Group Holdings Corp. for $16 a share, Nabisco Group's chairman
invited the suitor to join the process the company's financial
advisors have set up to assure shareholders get the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Steven F. Goldstone told Icahn in a letter released
today that by doing so, Icahn could qualify to obtain confidential
information and would be informed about the procedures for
presenting a formal bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our board will consider all bona fide proposals at the
appropriate time,'' Goldstone wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Icahn said he was willing to pay $16 per share for
the 90.5 percent of Group Nabisco he doesn't already own. That
would value the company at $5.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was an improvement on his proposal last week to pay $13 a
share under certain conditions for about 30 percent of Group
Nabisco shares.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading today, Nabisco Group shares were up 50
cents a share at $15 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Parsippany, N.J.-based Nabisco Group is the successor to RJR
Nabisco Holdings which spun off its tobacco holdings to
shareholders last June amid mounting legal challenges to cigarette
companies. Icahn, who had made three unsuccessful efforts to unseat
the RJR board, wanted RJR to spin off its food holdings instead.
</P>
<P>
   Since the split, Nabisco Group has retained an 80.6 percent
stake in Nabisco Holdings, maker of Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Newtons,
Ritz crackers and Snackwells. The company also makes condiments
such as Grey Poupon mustard as well as Milk-Bone dog biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said Nabisco
Group's board is likely to find itself caught in a bidding war,
which would benefit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the board of directors will say they will consider the
offer,'' Ghez said Tuesday. ''But essentially it puts the companies
on the block and Icahn and anyone else could bid up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sometimes terse letter to Nabisco Group's board of
directors, Icahn offered to buy the company on a ''friendly basis''
and said ''there should be no problem in facilitating the
acquisition of NGH, especially in light of the large amount of
capital my companies would contribute to the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Nabisco Group's board passed on Icahn's original
offer of $13 per share saying it didn't accurately convey the true
worth of the company's operations. The company also said it was
exploring the sale of the company or its majority stake in Nabisco
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Icahn chided the company's directors, saying:
''If you are not willing to go forward with me and do not
officially put the company up for sale now, stockholders can only
conclude that your press release was simply designed to give them
false hopes and prevent your losing a proxy contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said he believes the company is undervalued, even at $16
per share, but he didn't want to see the company given away for
something less.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my point of view I want to be sure that they're sincere
about putting it up for sale,'' he said.

<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An Ohio teen-ager is suing The Black
Crowes, claiming his hearing was damaged during a concert last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Harmon, 19, and his parents Paul and Sarah Harmon of
Granville, Ohio, filed a $385,000 lawsuit Monday in Knox County
Circuit Court against the Atlanta-based band.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Harmon, who was sitting in the second row,
suffered ''severe acoustic trauma'' and permanent damage to his
right ear because the sound system was set up negligently at the
band's April 2, 1999 concert.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 401(k)s Vulnerable To Volatility  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The 401(k) plan, the focus of retirement savings
for many Americans, is extremely vulnerable to the stock market's
volatility. No one knows that more than workers whose 401(k)
accounts are heavily concentrated in the stock of one company -- the
company they work for.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees' 401(k)s have grown exponentially in recent years
as their companies' stock prices have risen, particularly in
high-tech companies where employees have become millionaires. But
these accounts can also plunge in value amid a selloff, making many
workers uneasy about their retirement nest eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a hypothetical Microsoft employee with $100,000 in
company stock on March 31. In just one day, this past Monday,
Microsoft shares fell 10.8 percent and the employee's holdings
would have dropped to $89,200.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of Procter &AMP; Gamble took an even bigger hit last
month. A hypothetical employee with $100,000 in P&AMP;G stock in his or
her 401(k) as of March 6 found that amount reduced to $70,000 one
day later after P&AMP;G shares had tumbled 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies use their own shares to match employees'
contributions, which means the shares pile up and leave many
employees with a portfolio overweight in one stock. In some plans,
the employee decides whether to take the company match in stock or
another investment, while in others, company stock is the only
option. Either way, many employees are top-heavy in company stock,
and that runs counter to the advice of financial experts who advise
investors to diversify their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's risky because it's one company. Even if you hold stock in
a diversified organization, the risk is still there, simply because
it's one stock,'' said Mike McCarthy, a 401(k) consultant with
Lincolnshire, Ill.-based Hewitt Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruffel, chief executive officer of Plan Sponsor
magazine, said, ''you cannot defend a situation where employees
have excess in 50 percent of their 401(k) retirement plans in
company stock. It goes against all logic of diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   At an extreme, an employee can find their retirement nest egg
vanishing if the company's stock falls precipitously, or worse, if
the company goes bankrupt. That was the case at Carter Hawley Hale,
a retailer that went bankrupt in 1991. Its 401(k) plan was invested
solely in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like using their stock to match employees'
contributions because they believe workers perform better when they
have a stake in the company and how well it does.
</P>
<P>
   ''They firmly believe that employee ownership does affect
results. It motivates employees,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with a large block of shares in the hands of
employees, a company ''is effectively insulated from a whole lot of
things that happen in the marketplace,'' Ruffel said.
Employee-shareholders are more likely to support a company in the
event of an unwanted takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   Companies don't save any money by matching employee
contributions with stock. They actually contribute cash, which is
turned over to a third party such as the company that manages the
401(k) accounts; that company then buys the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees are heavily weighted in company stock because
they hold other shares beyond those in their 401(k)s. Many
companies reward top employees with options to buy stock at greatly
reduced prices and others have programs under which any worker can
buy shares at a discount. It can be a real temptation, especially
at a growing company and in a bull stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who take advantage of such programs need to look at
''how much overall ... future finances are tied up in one
company,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   If employees are uncomfortable with so much company stock, they
should try to diversify as much as possible. That might be
problematic, because some plans limit the amount of company stock
employees can sell.
</P>
<P>
   But employees can always diversify their investments and savings
besides their 401(k) plans. They can open brokerage or mutual fund
accounts and buy other securities. And at companies where there are
a variety of investment choices available, employees should
consider transferring some of their funds into them.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers that have more restrictive plans are moving
toward being more flexible, McCarthy said. In today's tight job
market, companies trying to attract good workers have learned they
need to offer plans with many investment options besides company
stock, and to make it easier for employees to sell their stock.

<HEADLINE> $40B Set Aside for Aviation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Wednesday signed a bill
that designates $40 billion for aviation improvements, from airport
construction to collision-avoidance systems and safety standards
for traveling pets.
</P>
<P>
   The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the
21st Century increases aviation spending by more than $10 billion
beyond current levels over three years. It seeks to accommodate an
expected burst in air travel from 600 million passengers last year
to more than 1 billion by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improvements, Clinton said he is still concerned
that there will not be sufficient funding in the future for air
traffic control and other safety functions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on Congress to join me in moving forward to further
system-wide reform of air traffic control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee, said the bill would be a great relief
to an overburdened aviation system. He was particularly pleased
that money from ticket taxes will be dedicated solely to improving
safety and efficiency in the aviation system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Air travelers are the big winners,'' Shuster said in a
statement. ''This new law will make our skies safer and help to
improve air service in our big cities and in our small
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to increase flights to smaller markets, the bill phases
out flight limits at Chicago's O'Hare in 2002 and at New York's
LaGuardia and JFK in 2007. It permits 24 more flights out of
Washington's Reagan National, including 12 beyond the current
1,250-mile ''perimeter rule,'' which limits the distance planes can
travel nonstop into and out of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows airports to raise their passenger taxes, or
''passenger facility charges'' from the current ceiling of $3 to
$4.50 a person, a move which could bring in an extra $700 million a
year for local airport projects.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the bill are provisions to help airlines buy
regional jets if they use them to serve small airports, money to
improve the training of airport screeners, requirements for
emergency locator devices on small jets and guidelines for air
tours over national parks.

<HEADLINE> Further Testimony in Marine's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain accused in the
heat-stroke death of a reservist during a training march brushed
off concerns about the hike's fast pace, a sergeant testified
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Victor Arana, 28, is charged with dereliction of duty and
failure to obey an order in the death last year of Lance Cpl.
Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto, 21. Arana could get up to nine months in
prison if convicted in the non-jury court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Timothy Lucas, a squad instructor in Arana's company, said
he complained to Arana that the pace was too fast and that the 180
Marines were ''spread out real bad.'' Lucas said Arana told him
that ''we weren't going that fast and to tighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said he then pushed the Marines, each carrying up
to 30 pounds of gear, to hurry up.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys begin presenting their side Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Leto died July 7 after an eight-mile nighttime hike in 80-degree
temperatures at Camp Lejeune. Prosecutors say Arana marched his
unit too fast and without enough time for rest breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers contend Arana wasn't given proper guidance by
his superiors. Outside of court Wednesday, attorney Mark Stevens
described Arana as ''a sacrificial lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Sgt. Jonathan Ginsberg, who was Leto's squad
leader, testified that Arana skipped a two-minute gear assessment
break during the first leg of the hike. He said he told Arana
during the first rest stop that the company was marching too fast.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ginsberg testified, Arana said ''tell them three
(more) minutes, we've got to get there sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg said one Marine was evacuated by helicopter to a
hospital for heat problems.

<HEADLINE> House Passes 'Partial Abortion' Ban  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Courting a third presidential veto on the
subject, the Republican-controlled House today approved
politically-charged legislation banning ''partial birth''
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 287-141. While the margin was big enough to
overturn a threatened veto by President Clinton, the Senate vote on
a companion bill last fall was not.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after several hours of well-worn debate.
Supporters claimed the measure would ban a barbaric and unnecessary
procedure while opponents contended it was a vaguely worded
stalking horse for an unconstitutional effort to ban all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody in this room knows this is wrong. It is not legally
or morally defensible,'' said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont., graphically
describing a procedure in which he said a fetus is partially
delivered, then its ''brains are extracted with the suction
device.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Consider our common humanity,'' appealed Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla., the lead supporter of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.: ''Proponents of this
bill are not just chipping away at the right to choose, they are
taking a jackhammer to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., accused the GOP of trying to
exploit a ''wedge issue in this election year,'' a reference to the
extent to which the measure causes many Democrats to part company
with organizations that support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   	   Passage of the bill was never in doubt, but opponents held out
hope that support would be less than the two-thirds majority needed
to override a threatened veto. The House has overridden two
previous vetoes on the issue, but the Senate has sustained
Clinton's rejection each time, and is expected to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a similar bill last fall, and a compromise
is expected before fall. The only difference between the two bills
is a Senate-passed provision -- engineered by Democrats -- declaring
that the high court's Roe vs. Wade ruling in 1973 established ''an
important constitutional right'' and should not be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors say the measure is designed to abolish a certain type
of late-term procedure in which a fetus is partially delivered,
then aborted.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents counter that, as written, the bill would apply far
more broadly, thus undermining the Supreme Court ruling in Roe vs.
Wade in that granted women the right to abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is voting on the measure at the same time the Supreme
Court is prepared to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a
partial birth ban enacted in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no direct connection between the court case and
the pending legislation, sponsors say the measure before the House
was crafted to meet objections of federal appeals court judges who
said the Nebraska statute failed to meet constitutional standards.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the House bill seeks to ban abortions in which a
doctor ''vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living fetus
until the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother'' and
''kills the fetus while the intact living fetus is partially
outside the body of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions would be in cases in which the life of the
mother was threatened. Shortly before final passage, Democratic
opponents of the bill sought unsuccessfully to exempt cases
involving ''serious long term physical health consequences'' to the
mother. The vote was 289-140.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of opponents of the measure also sought a
vote on an alternative to ban ''post-viability abortions'' except
in cases where the woman's life or health were in jeopardy. The GOP
leadership successfully prevented the measure from coming to a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining their majority in the House and Senate in 1994,
Republicans have twice pushed partial birth measures to Clinton
desk, causing political anguish in the process for many Democrats
who favor abortion rights but found the bills impossible to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has voted for similar
bills in the past, and did so again. In all, 209 Republicans, 77
Democrats and one independent voted for the measure, while 132
Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vetoed two ''partial birth'' bills in the past and
has served notice he will do so again, calling on Congress to
provide for exceptions in the case of potential harm to a woman's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Both previous vetoes were overridden in the House before being
narrowly sustained in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Rebound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rebounded Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, finishing mostly higher in a technical
recovery to the previous day's Wall Street-inspired selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans led the way, regaining a majority of the ground that
prices lost Tuesday when funds took profits on agricultural
commodities to cover their losses in equities.
</P>
<P>
   Market-watchers said rumors that China had purchased a cargo of
U.S. soybeans also underpinned the mild rally.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices were near flat. The late rally in soybeans pushed
wheat into positive territory for the session after being under
early pressure from generally good conditions for the winter wheat
crop. Sri Lanka's purchase of U.S. wheat also helped the market,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Corn finished mixed, as support related to the stock market's
regained equilibrium was offset by pressure from slightly wetter
forecasts for Midwest growing regions this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose { cent to $2.56\ a bushel; May corn
was unchanged at $2.32 a bushel; July oats rose \ cent to $1.20{ a
bushel; May soybeans rose 4{ cents to $5.43 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures advanced while pork futures retreated on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .43 cent to 69.10 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .58 cent to 83.75 cents a pound; June lean hogs
fell .13 cent to 72.32 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .42
cent to 95.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Slowly, China Releases Information  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- One man got 17 years for tying anti-government
statements to the legs of locusts and releasing them. Another gave
protest speeches in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Facing possible censure in the United Nations for its human
rights record, China has released information on these and 13 other
political prisoners lost in the Chinese gulag.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a year of silence, Beijing quietly resumed the
Prisoner Information Project, relaying details on the prisoners to
the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time the Chinese government has provided
this information to a non-governmental organization,'' says John
Kamm, executive director of the rights group. ''They never directly
deal with human rights groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Official talks with the United States remain suspended due to
lingering rancor over the bombing of Beijing's embassy in
Yugoslavia last May and U.S. efforts to chastise China at the U.N.
Human Rights Commission in Geneva. But on March 21, responding to
inquiries from Kamm and U.S. congressmen, the Ministry of Justice
sent information on eight prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that from today onward, your efforts will go one step
forward in promoting American understanding of the Chinese
situation,'' the ministry said in a letter addressed to Kamm.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Kamm received information on seven other prisoners
from Guangdong province, an affluent region bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Best known among the Guangdong prisoners was Liu Baiqiang.
Originally arrested for robbery, he was sentenced in 1989 to 17
years in prison for counterrevolutionary incitement -- for tying
anti-government statements to the legs of locusts he released from
his prison cell. Liu's sentence was reduced three times and he is
due for release in June 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On the Justice Ministry list was Zhou Guokui, identified as a
74-year-old doctor from Hong Kong, who was sentenced in 1987 to 15
years for endangering state security.
</P>
<P>
   Li Junmin, a 39-year-old soldier from Taiwan, was given a
commuted death sentence in 1983 for endangering state security and,
according to some accounts, for making anti-government speeches in
jail. His sentence was later reduced and is to run until Dec. 20,
2011.
</P>
<P>
   Several prisoners on the list were released on medical parole or
had served out their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kamm has received information on 66 of the 100 names he
submitted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said six people on Kamm's list were never
imprisoned. They could be among the thousands of prisoners held in
police-run labor camps, rather than prisons. Those sentenced to
death are transferred from police detention centers to the
execution grounds and also are omitted. In rare cases, suspects may
have been acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Other human rights groups praise Kamm's effort, but fault the
Chinese government for not providing more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think his work is important, but it's very small-scale,''
said Sophia Woodman, the Hong Kong-based research director for
Human Rights in China. ''They never respond to any of our
inquiries. It's really important to keep it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners sentenced for political crimes are usually tried in
secret and the authorities rarely discuss their cases. Kamm, who
travels frequently to China, founded the Dui Hua Foundation last
summer to support his decade-long effort to gain information on
those prisoners, who may number in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can get the Chinese government to talk about and to
reveal the existence of people in these situations then you greatly
increase the chance that justice will be done,'' Kamm said in a
telephone interview from his home in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important goal in policy toward China is to promote
transparency, whether it's in the area of national security, the
military budget, in trade ... or in the area of human rights. We
must have a dialogue on human rights that is based on accurate
information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By scouring publicly accessible but often obscure publications,
the Dui Hua foundation, which is supported by grants from the Smith
Richardson Foundation and the International Republican Institute,
has uncovered 250 cases involving 600 people charged with
committing political offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its just a system that developed on its own for many years.
People have been lost in it,'' Kamm says. ''I live from installment
to installment. Everyday, I go to the office. I can see the fax
machine from the door, and I look to see if something has come
in.''

<HEADLINE> Athletes Fuel Eye Surgery Trend  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux had laser
surgery to correct his vision in July. He won nine of his next 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods had the operation in October. He won his next five
PGA tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure, but hundreds of athletes in sport after
sport -- baseball, golf, auto racing and even kickboxing -- are
turning to the surgery to boost their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on an obvious marketing tool, eye doctors are touting
their athlete-customers, helping accelerate public acceptance of
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best thing I ever bought myself,'' said Maddux,
who now has 20-15 eyesight and says he can focus on home plate
better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year about 1.5 million blurry-eyed Americans are expected
to have the operation in hopes of throwing away their glasses and
contacts, up from 1 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular type is called LASIK, which stands for laser
in-situ keratomileusis. It refers to the process of cutting a flap
in the cornea -- the eyeball's outer coating -- and reshaping it with
a sharp laser beam. It costs about $1,500 to $2,500 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   While LASIK is fast and painless, for the most part, there can
be complications for a small number of patients. The American
Academy of Ophthalmology estimates that 1 percent to 5 percent
develop such problems as blurred vision and nighttime glare. In
addition, the long-term consequences are impossible to know because
the procedure has only been on the market a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also caution the surgery is not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   While teen-agers might want to emulate their favorite athlete,
doctors discourage it for anyone under 20 because their eyesight
may still be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Also doctors rule out some people because of the curvature and
thickness of the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of doctors performing the procedure has increased,
consumers are seeing more advertising with celebrity endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   TLC Laser Eye Centers, based in Ontario, Canada, has signed
endorsement deals with Woods and LPGA golfer Se Ri Pak.
</P>
<P>
   ''The average Joe is very scared of it,'' said TLC chief
executive Elias Vamvakas. ''But when they see athletes like Tiger
do it they think it must be effective if they go to the right
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who is the favorite to win the Masters that starts
Thursday, had the surgery at a TLC center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had worn contacts throughout his career, causing him
problems when allergies kicked in. He also said it had been
difficult to gauge long putts, but the eye surgery gives him a
clearer view of the course.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that I'm normal, one of the things that appears to me is
the slopes are bigger, objects are bigger,'' Woods said in a recent
interview. ''The hole is bigger, the ball is bigger, clubs are
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Maloney, a Los Angeles ophthalmologist, said
celebrities are a distinct drawing card.
</P>
<P>
   ''The acceptance by professional golfers has brought a huge
number of amateur golfers into our practice,'' said Maloney, who
has also performed the procedure on musicians Kenny G. and Barry
Manilow.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees slugger Bernie Williams said he carefully
researched the procedure before having it done in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing short of miraculous,'' Williams said. ''I saw the
success a lot of people have had with it. I did some research, I
talked to doctors, other patients, other players who've had it, and
I got enough confidence in the whole thing to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who won his opening day start on Monday, said not having
to wear glasses or contacts makes it easier to pitch, especially in
bad weather. But he seems more excited about how the operation has
changed his time off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just little things,'' Maddux said. ''Watching TV. Putting
your shirt on without taking your glasses off. Just a bunch of
nit-picking things that really don't mean a whole lot, but when you
add them all together, it's a great convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has also helped manufacturers of the lasers prosper.
Visx, the market leader, saw its fourth-quarter profits rise 50
percent, to $25.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Jewish Suspects Get Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's judiciary has agreed to allow 13
Iranian Jews accused of spying to hire their own lawyers, Iran's
only Jewish legislator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Manouchehr Eliassi came after conflicting
reports suggested the defendants would have to use state-appointed
lawyers for the espionage trial.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish Society had urged Monday that the suspects be
allowed to choose their own lawyers. But Iranian officials had said
the court had appointed lawyers for the suspects because they had
missed the deadline for choosing their own.
</P>
<P>
   The society also asked for a delay in the espionage trial, which
is due to begin April 13 in Shiraz, 550 miles south of the capital,
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known whether the court will agree to postpone the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, arrested more than a year ago, are accused of
spying for the United States and Israel. If convicted, they could
be executed. The U.S. and Israeli governments have denied any ties
to the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, which has been under international pressure to free the
Jews or ensure that their trial is fair, says religion has no
bearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish society also asked that the suspects be freed on bail
for this month's Jewish holiday of Passover, with the release also
covering Ashoura, a period when Muslim Shiites mourn the death of
their most revered saint. Ashoura is April 15.
</P>
<P>
   There were 80,000 Jews in Iran just before the 1979 Islamic
revolution, but the community has dwindled to 25,000. It remains
the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian Jews are allowed to practice aspects of their religion,
but are forbidden to teach Hebrew, the liturgical language.

<HEADLINE> FAA Releases Stewart Transcript  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air traffic controllers grew increasingly
worried as they tried over and over again to contact golfer Payne
Stewart's plane as it flew on autopilot before crashing last
October and killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Their vain attempts to contact the doomed plane, and efforts to
get other pilots to help, are heard on three hours of audio tape
made public today by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Both civilian and military pilots were able to see the Learjet
as it flew steadily on, but none could get an answer from the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The last radio message from the plane: ''Three nine zero bravo
alpha,'' the simple acknowledgment that he had been cleared to
climb to 39,000 feet, came at 9:27 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, air traffic control at Jacksonville, Fla.,
radioed the plane, getting no response. Another try three minutes
later got no response and controllers quickly became concerned as
the craft rose above its assigned altitude.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:38 a Cubana airliner tried to raise Stewart's plane but
advised the controllers he also got no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''OK, thank you,'' the controller responded. ''I think we got a
dead pilot up there. He's through his altitude and off course now
so we don't know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the controller literally thought the
pilot was dead or meant his radio had gone dead. The FAA made no
comment about the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined why
the plane crashed Oct. 25 near Aberdeen, S.D., killing Stewart and
five others on board.
</P>
<P>
   Some aviation analysts, however, have speculated that Stewart's
plane suffered from depressurization that incapacitated those on
board after the plane took off from Orlando, Fla. The plane then
continued on a northwest course, apparently on autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   As time wore on, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines planes
were asked to try their hand at contacting the plane when it was
near them. Neither they nor military pilots who also could get an
answer. Some reported seeing the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The controller thanked the other pilots for their help in
looking for ''this guy that's unresponsive, climbing and ...
probably going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape was studied by the National Transportation Safety Board
in its analysis of the disaster and then returned to the FAA. Its
release is a routine post-crash step.
</P>
<P>
   The tape does not include any sounds inside the cabin of the
plane. However, the Safety Board previously reported that alarms
were heard on the cockpit voice recorder tape, which also was
reviewed. One that signals cabin pressure problems was sounding
when the plane crashed in South Dakota. No one was heard talking on
the 30-minute cockpit tape from the Learjet 35.
</P>
<P>
   The human body has a limited ability to function above 10,000
feet because there is less oxygen in the air and there is less
pressure to force that oxygen through the lungs. Airplanes are
pressurized so that the atmosphere inside never feels higher than
about 8,000 feet even if the aircraft is flying much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has reported that Stewart's plane climbed as high as
51,000 feet during its flight across the nation's heartland. The
jet, which was supposed to have gone to Dallas, instead flew four
hours -- some 1,400 miles -- to South Dakota before running out of
fuel and crashing.

<HEADLINE> Congress Seeking Key Documents  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary
committees demanded Wednesday that the Justice Department turn over
key memos on its decision not to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate Democratic fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked for memos by former
fund-raising task force chief Charles LaBella and FBI Director
Louis Freeh that favor an independent counsel to investigate the
conduct of Vice President Al Gore and other top Clinton
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the letter requested a memo by Lee Radek, chief of
the department's public integrity section, who opposed appointment
of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno in the past has refused to give the LaBella and Freeh memos
to another congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   Also signing the letter were Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla., who head subcommittees.
</P>
<P>
   Among other documents covered by the request:
</P>
<P>
   --A second Freeh memo written late in 1998 recommending an
independent counsel for Gore, according to legal sources aware of
the existence of the document. The memo was written after the last
of two interviews the FBI did of the vice president regarding his
knowledge of fund-raising practices in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   --A memo written at about the same time as the second Freeh memo
by Judith Feigin, a detailee to the department's public integrity
section who favored appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate Gore, said the legal sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   --Any legal opinions from the department's Office of Legal
Counsel relating to fund-raising phone calls or events in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The requested documents were written by political appointees
or senior managers whose decisions are clearly subject to
congressional oversight,'' said the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Reno refused to turn over the LaBella and Freeh memos
to the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, led by Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department has a substantial interest in avoiding a
chilling effect on the candor of future prosecutorial
deliberations,'' Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators and two representatives said that ''this
reason'' given in the letter to Burton ''is not enough to justify
your refusal to comply'' with the new request.
</P>
<P>
   The four also are seeking e-mail and any other records relating
to the key memos as well as all records received by Reno regarding
whether to seek appointment of an independent counsel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helping Destroy Russian Weapons  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian and U.S. officials on Wednesday opened an
American-funded laboratory designed to help Russia dismantle its
stockpiles of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the 1993 Paris Convention on Chemical
Weapons, Russia must destroy 44,000 tons of chemical weapons -- the
largest stockpile in the world. But Russian officials said the
estimated $5 billion cost was too high for the cash-strapped
government and asked foreign countries for help.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory, located at the State Scientific Research
Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology, which served as the
key center for developing chemical weapons in Soviet times, will
help evaluate technologies for destroying chemical weapons, assess
their impact on the environment and train personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory, created under the Cooperative Threat Reduction
program, cost $18.5 million, according to program director Thomas
E. Kuenning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The laboratory represents the heart of the program to equip
the Russian Federation with adequate facilities to ensure the safe,
secure, ecologically sound and expeditious destruction of chemical
weapons,'' U.S. Ambassador James Collins said at the opening of the
facility in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States would follow up with the
construction of a destruction site near the town of Shchuchye, 960
miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Zinovy Pak, the head of Russia's Munition Agency which is in
charge of dismantling chemical weapons, voiced hope that the U.S.
assistance would help Russia to end a delay in fulfilling its
international obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the global ban, Russia was supposed to
destroy 440 tons of chemical weapons by the end of this month, but
had to put off the deadline because of the money shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We promise to do all we can to reach the second stage of the
program, which envisages the destruction of 8,800 tons of chemical
weapons by April 29, 2002, on time,'' Pak said. ''But we must say
that this task is incredibly hard to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Kapralov, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's
department in charge of chemical disarmament, has aggressively
lobbied for more foreign aid, saying that Western nations promised
generous assistance to Russia while persuading it to join the
global ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see that the United States has taken efforts to help us,
but a large number of other countries have also promised their
assistance,'' Kapralov said. ''I must underline that this is not a
charity effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Convention on Chemical Weapons bans the use, production,
stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons. It has been ratified
by more than 100 nations, but several countries hostile to the
West, including Iraq, Syria, Libya and North Korea, have note
signed.

<HEADLINE> Shalala Backs Tobacco Regulation  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking a new tack, Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala urged lawmakers to approve government
regulation of tobacco because it's ''a political winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an election year. Are you for protecting kids or aren't
you?'' Shalala said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to congressional leaders to be published
Thursday, Shalala said Congress should ''pick up the flag''
following a Supreme Court ruling that current law doesn't allow the
Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In a tongue-in-cheek gesture signifying that Cabinet secretaries
don't usually hand out political advice to lawmakers whose
decisions may help or hinder their agencies, the op-ed letter is
written as a memo from ''Anonymous.'' It will be published Thursday
in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called on Congress to give the FDA power to
regulate tobacco after the March 21 Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco members of Congress have pledged to revive
legislation and presidential contenders Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush have both said Congress should act to
reign in cigarette makers and tobacco ads aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans in Congress have aggressively fought previous
efforts to regulate the tobacco industry. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., one of four congressional leaders to whom
Shalala addressed the letter and the lawmaker who has final say on
what legislation gets to the Senate floor, has said he opposes FDA
regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they do a very good job with what they're doing
now without more requirements being dumped on them,'' Lott said
after the Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said legislation should allow the FDA to regulate
tobacco, increase prices for cigarettes, strengthen anti-smoking
campaigns and impose fines for companies that don't comply with
requirements for anti-smoking advertising and lowering teen
smoking.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Sets Vote on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House will vote during the week of May 22
on legislation granting China permanent trade privileges, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert said Wednesday. The move gave President
Clinton the early vote he had sought on one of the top priorities
of his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking to ultimate victory,'' Hastert, R-Ill., told
reporters. He said he set the timetable after consulting with the
White House and looked forward to working with the president to
build support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will have to be a bipartisan effort,'' he said. Both
sides predicted an extremely close vote.
</P>
<P>
   The setting of a certain time for House debate on the measure
heartened its sponsors, who feared that delaying it until the
summer in an election year could sink it.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Hastert had hinted that he would wait until the
president could guarantee about 100 Democratic votes for the
measure. Democratic sponsors have suggested that the best they can
do is probably about 70 to 80 Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is strongly opposed by organized labor, environmental
groups and some conservative organizations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed Hastert's move and announced it at a
White House conference on the new economy. ''This is very good
news,'' Clinton said. ''I want to thank the speaker and the
leadership of the House for doing this, and I assure you I will do
what I can to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also greeted the vote
while suggesting that much work needs to be done to build support,
given labor's strong opposition. ''Economically, it's a no
brainer,'' she said in an interview with Associated Press editors
and reporters. ''It's an opening up of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert indicated he would bring the bill up whether he has the
votes or not. ''We're going to move it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is wide Republican support for the bill, House
Democrats are deeply divided. The measure was expected to win
easier approval in the Senate, where free-trade sentiment is higher
in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions fear that expanded trade with China will cost U.S.
jobs. They also decry China's lack of worker rights.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would grant China the same low-tariff access to U.S.
markets that all but a handful of U.S. trading partners now enjoy.
Currently, China's trade status must be renewed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calling for permanent normal trade relations,
formally known as most favored nation status, is part of an
agreement the Clinton administration reached with China in
November.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that pact, the United States also agreed to support
China's bid to join the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based
body that sets rules for international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the trade bill suggest that rejecting it would not
keep China out of the WTO but could result in China closing its
markets to U.S. goods in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ''gives us a chance to break down barriers and build up
trust between our two nations,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he was hopeful that the measure could generate
about 150 Republican and 100 Democratic votes. But he said he
realistically expected the tallies to be lower than that on both
sides of the aisle. The bill needs 218 votes if all members of the
House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a leading supporter of the bill and
chairman of the House Rules Committee, accused Democratic opponents
of having ''tied themselves to the ideological baggage of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's aggressive lobbying campaign in behalf of the
China trade pact, the House Democratic leadership has not helped
the administration with the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., remains undecided.
House Minority Whip Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the second-ranking
Democrat, is actively working to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's spokeswoman, Laura Nichols, said Wednesday that
Gephardt still has not decided how to vote. But, she said, he
welcomed Hastert's decision. ''We've been arguing, the sooner the
better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the administration's point man
among Democrats for the bill, said that Democrats are ''well within
the range of getting 70-80 (Democratic) votes,'' but that dozens of
Democrats are still uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   He said the setting of a certain date ''will hopefully change
the dynamics'' and bring more members off the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Matsui said, ''This is going to be a tough battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the setting of a certain House date was applauded
by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading supporter of the bill.
''Delay on this issue is not an option,'' Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee is expected to take up the
legislation later this month.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Shy Away From Biotech Crops  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foods made from genetically engineered crops
are safe, but the government needs to tighten its monitoring of
biotech plants to ensure they won't cause allergies or harm the
environment, a panel of scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Better methods are needed to identify potential allergens,
including long-term studies of feeding the crops to animals,
according to a study sponsored by the National Research Council, an
arm of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The 261-page study, which focused on plants that have been
genetically engineered for protection against insects and viruses,
said none of the varieties developed so far poses allergy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the federal regulatory process for approving
pest-protected crops ''is working well,'' said Perry Adkisson, a
former Texas A&AMP;M University chancellor who chaired the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found no distinction between the health and environmental
risks posed by plants modified through modern genetic engineering
techniques and those produced by conventional breeding practices.
... Just because a plant is transgenic doesn't make it dangerous,''
Adkisson said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves transferring one or more genes from
one organism into another to give it specific traits.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacteria gene
that makes it toxic to a pest, became especially controversial last
year after a university study suggested its pollen could be killing
Monarch butterflies. A soybean that proved allergenic after
scientists inserted a gene from the Brazil nut was withdrawn before
it reached the market.
</P>
<P>
   The council's study said that more research is needed to prevent
biotech crops from killing harmless insects, including the Monarch,
and to stop pest-resistant genes from spreading into weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech crops caught on quickly with U.S. farmers in the late
1990s and were planted on at least 70 million acres nationwide last
year
</P>
<P>
   Biotech food has met consumer resistance in Europe -- in Britain
it's derided as ''Frankenfood'' -- and in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of genetic engineering said the panel was biased because
many of its members have received funding from the industry and
that the report could undermine efforts to increase regulation of
biotech foods. ''A panel that leans overwhelmingly toward a
pro-biotech position ... cannot be expected to produce an
independent report with an objective conclusion,'' said Rep. Dennis
Kucinich, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member panel included 11 scientists, most of them
university researchers, and one attorney, an expert in government
regulation who has represented the industry. Officials with the
National Academy of Sciences acknowledged that some members of the
committee had conflicts of interest but said they were needed
because of their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The study was limited to crops that are modified to resist
pests. Crops that have been genetically engineered to be tolerant
to herbicides, including a popular variety of soybeans, or modified
to stay fresher longer were not covered by the study.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of crop biotechnology, who announced a $50 million
advertising campaign earlier this week to counter criticism of the
industry, said the report should bolster public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The report ''will reassure consumers on the thoroughness of the
scientific scrutiny in place by U.S. regulatory agencies,'' said
Val Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said that:
</P>
<P>
   --The three agencies that regulate pest-protected plants -- the
Environmental Protection Agency, Agriculture Department and Food
and Drug Administration -- should develop a coordinated database for
findings about plant compounds that pose dietary or toxicological
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   --The EPA should implement rules first proposed six years ago for
regulating pest-resistant crops, although the study questioned the
justification for some proposed exemptions.	   ------

<HEADLINE> S. African Government Attacks Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa on Wednesday accused
international drug companies of taking advantage of the country's
lenient regulations to test unsafe AIDS drugs on human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to Parliament, Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang said she recently learned five South African
women had died during a clinical trial of the anti-retroviral AIDS
drug Nevirapine, a cheaper alternative to AZT.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by South Africa's Medicines Control Council
into the deaths showed that Nevirapine was a ''probable'' cause of
death in three women. The other two died of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   The council found that 510 patients had been recruited for the
trial, which compared the effects of the drugs FTC and lamivudine.
Some of those tested were given Nevirapine as part of a ''drug
cocktail.'' The council halted further recruitment for more trials.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was being conducted by Quintiles Clindepharm on behalf
of the U.S.-based firm Triangle Pharmaceuticals, she said. A
spokeswoman for Triangle, based in Durham, N.C., was not available
for comment after several phone calls from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Nevirapine has been used successfully in Uganda to reduce
mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
and other drug trials have proved it to be highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   But Tshabalala-Msimang said the Ugandan studies had not
adequately considered the drug's long-term safety. South Africa was
conducting its own testing, which would be completed by midyear,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been criticized for not distributing AZT to
pregnant women to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child.
The government has said it can't afford the expensive drug, and
lobbyists have called for Nevirapine to be made available.
Tshabalala-Msimang dismissed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be immoral and unethical for government, despite the
numerous requests that we are receiving and the demonstrations
which have been staged, to attempt to make policy decisions
regarding the use of Nevirapine in our country, until the full
results of the clinical trial of the drug are available,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Thabo Mbeki's government has been engaged in a
long-running battle with drug companies, accusing them of putting
profits before lives. The government estimates about a tenth of the
country's 42 million people are infected with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia de Lille, a member of Parliament with the opposition
Pan African Congress, said 13 academic and research institutions
and 15 drug companies were conducting clinical trials of AIDS drugs
in South Africa. She called for more stringent controls on drug
testing.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Chief Wants Night Hours  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence M. Small, the new head of the
Smithsonian Institution, said Wednesday he would open its 16
museums and the National Zoo at night if he could get enough money
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would strongly oppose any attempt to charge
entrance fees at Smithsonian facilities because most visitors are
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''If 90 percent of the visitors are Americans,'' he said,
''Americans who have already paid with their income taxes and their
philanthropy, I see no reason for putting in a regressive tax that
likely would fall hardest on the shoulders of those people whom
you'd like to see come into the museums more than any others: young
people, minorities, and people who maybe haven't been to a museum
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Small, who spoke at a National Press Club luncheon, said there
was no question in his mind that people would come if he could get
the money for the museums and zoo to stay open at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an enormous need for money,'' he told one questioner,
''money from the federal government, money from private
philanthropists and money from private commitments.'' But Small
emphasized that an institution ''like the Smithsonian should never
put itself in the position of endorsing products for people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any reason why business shouldn't be able to
provide money for museum exhibits. There is a difference between
providing the funding and having an endorsement or having a
commercial relationship with the museums,'' Small said.

   LETHBRIDGE, Alberta (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy who shot two
students at his high school last year is mentally fit to stand
trial in either adult or juvenile court, a judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting in Taber, Alberta, occurred eight days after the
Littleton, Colo., school shootings in which two students killed 13
people before turning the guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour Der, the boy's lawyer, said Wednesday his client fired

</P>
<P>
   ''We will not change our position that he pulled the trigger,''
Der said. ''It's never been an issue.'' By law, the boy's name
cannot be released because he is a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Der has said his client was reacting to bullying at school and
also was affected by the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, the boy underwent open-heart surgery to
correct a previously undetected birth defect.
</P>
<P>
   Der said Wednesday the surgery harmed his client's mental
capacity. But he agreed with Youth Court Judge Gerald Debow that
the boy was able to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Debow scheduled a two-week hearing in September to determine if
the case would remain in juvenile court or move up to adult court.
The boy was not present at Wednesday's hearing.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Set To Cap Tobacco Damage Bond  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina, the nation's No. 1 tobacco
producer, swiftly passed a law Wednesday to shield the state's
cigarette makers from what could be a crippling verdict in a
smoking case under way in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-day special session convened specifically to consider
the bill, the Legislature took just four hours to pass the measure
by an overwhelming vote. Less than an hour later, Gov. Jim Hunt
signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
   The law sets a cap of $25 million on the amount a company has to
post as bond while appealing a punitive-damage verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Carolina has been well-served by tobacco,'' said Sen.
Ham Horton. ''A six-person jury in Florida is on the verge of
bringing a gigantic industry to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Miami is considering how much compensatory damages to
award three plaintiffs in a class-action case involving 500,000
sick Florida smokers. The jury will then decide whether to award
punitive damages to all of the smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has said it fears the jury could come back with a
punitive-damage verdict of $300 billion that could wreck the
tobacco companies. Under Florida law, a defendant must post a bond
equal to the damages levied while appealing a case.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is the home of three of the defendants in the
Florida case: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Liggett Group and
Lorillard Tobacco Co. Tobacco brings in $1 billion for North
Carolina's farmers, and 114,000 people in tobacco-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia have quickly approved
laws limiting the bond cigarette companies would have to post.
Virginia and Georgia approved a $25 million limit; Kentucky set it
at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Senate approved the $25 million limit 48-2;
the House passed it 114-1.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina politicians argued that the law is necessary not
just to preserve the cigarette makers but to keep annual payments
coming from the $246 billion settlement between the tobacco
industry and the states.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have suggested that such laws violate the
clause in the U.S. Constitution requiring that states recognize
each other's court proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Krispy Kreme Has Sweet Nasdaq Debut  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Like a fresh serving of its tasty
treats, Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corp.'s reception on Wall Street on
Wednesday was hot and sweet, with its shares climbing more than 75
percent in their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston-Salem company's initial public offering was priced
at $21 per share, and opened at $32 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. At
4 p.m., the shares under the KREM ticker symbol stood at $37, after
7 million shares had changed hands during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like a dream,'' president Scott Livengood said in
a telephone interview from New York. ''It's a culmination of a lot
of work for generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Livengood said the Nasdaq's roller coaster ride on Tuesday only
''added a little excitement to the day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would bet the timing could be better,'' he said. ''But the
sector Krispy Kreme falls into seems to be doing OK. We're a
63-year-old business, so we're keeping that kind of perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Livengood remembers selling boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts in
high school. He's been with the company for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lombardi, an executive vice president at Technomic Inc.,
a Chicago food-service consulting firm, wasn't surprised by the
public interest in Krispy Kreme shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think lots of people want to be friends and family to this
type of deal,'' he said Tuesday. ''The real question is where will
the stock be two months from now? A lot of food-service stocks come
out and peak and then they go back to the IPO price in a few
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The foodservice industry has been struggling lately, but
Lombardi said Krispy Kreme's aura might defy the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have virtually a cult following,'' he said. ''The closest
thing I can think of that's similar is Coors beer back in the '70s.
When people couldn't get Coors anywhere but in Colorado, everybody
wanted it. But it became a national brand, and it lost its aura.''
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme, founded in 1937 by Vernon Carver Rudolph in a
Winston-Salem storefront, is issuing 3 million common shares,
putting the value of the IPO at about $63 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to use the proceeds to repay debt, renovate
some older stores and finance expansion.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six years, the Southern institution has ventured
into such decidedly un-Southern markets such as Manhattan and Las
Vegas. Krispy Kreme now has 141 stores in 27 states, from New York
to California.
</P>
<P>
   Each store makes and sells about 20 different kinds of
doughnuts. But their signature item remains the Hot Original Glazed
doughnut. True fans find the urge irresistible to stop at Krispy
Kreme when the ''Hot Doughnuts Now'' sign is on.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prospectus, Krispy Kreme's net income for the
first nine months of last year was $5.7 million on sales of $231.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters for the offering are J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown, Dain Rauscher Wessels and BB&AMP;T Capital Markets.

<HEADLINE> Governor proposes expansion of state's ''Son of Sam'' laws  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Crime victims would be able to sue for
gifts, income, even inheritances acquired by their assailants under
an expanded and stronger ''Son of Sam'' law that Gov. George Pataki
proposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The current ''Son of Sam'' statute bars criminals from profiting
from their illegal activities -- for example, selling book rights
about a well-known crime. Pataki's proposal would allow victims to
seek criminals' assets unrelated to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''By expanding the law, we will give victims and their families
the tools they need to obtain justice and ensure that no criminal
is allowed to reap financial rewards in the face of those they have
harmed,'' Pataki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Victims are already allowed to sue for criminals' assets under
other laws, but Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said there are
often statute-of-limitations hurdles. The ''Son of Sam'' statute
allows victims to sue whenever they learn of a criminal's earnings
or windfall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is also calling for the law to extend to people convicted
of misdemeanors -- a class of crimes that includes offenses such as
harassment and hazing.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it sounds like a reasonable proposal,'' said Jim Acker,
a State University of New York at Albany criminal justice
professor. He added that there might be long-term benefits from the
law, like forcing criminals to recognize the harm they have done.
However, he said a long-term problem could be forcing criminals
trying to re-enter society into poverty, a condition that could
propel them back into crime.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Grieshaber, a victims' rights lobbyist since her daughter
was murdered in 1997 in Albany, said the current law is already
''potent'' but anything Pataki can do to draw attention the plight
of victims trying to gain restitution is ''a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, leader of the state Senate's Republican majority
also supports expanding the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Leader Sheldon Silver's office did not return a call
seeking comment on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The state's first Son of Sam law was passed in 1977, after
reports that publishers were offering ''Son of Sam'' serial killer
David Berkowitz huge sums of money for the rights to his story.
</P>
<P>
   The original law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1991 on free speech grounds. Legislators shortly thereafter enacted
a revised version, which expanded the definition of ''profits from
the crime'' to include ''any property obtained through or income
generated from the commission of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   A weakness of the current law, according to Pataki's office, is
that victims who had ongoing medical expenses, loss of earnings,
burial costs, and counseling after suffering from crimes are
uncompensated.
</P>
<P>
   Morris cited the case of Arthur Shawcross as one of several
prompting Pataki's proposal. Shawcross killed 11 Rochester-area
women and last year was caught selling his artwork over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said at the time that Shawcross did not violate
the ''Son of Sam'' law because he was not accused of benefiting
from the actual crimes that led to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal would also make clear that the law applies to
federal and out-of-state convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a panel of New York's Appellate Division court ruled
that the current law does not give the state Crime Victims Board
authority to seize book proceeds owed to Salvatore ''Sammy the
Bull'' Gravano because the law does not apply to the federal
racketeering crimes to which he pleaded guilty.

<HEADLINE> Political Opportunists Using Elian  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Behind the platitudes about serving only the
interests of a 6-year-old boy, respecting the rights of a father
and the rule of law, politicians -- both here and abroad -- have made
Elian Gonzalez's custody case an exercise in opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, President Fidel Castro is using it to serve his own
campaign against the U.S. embargo and refugee haven policies toward
his country, rallying demonstrators to demand that the boy be
returned to the communist island his mother died fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has become a pawn, as one Democratic senator said, in the
40-year struggle between Castro and Washington. Another called it a
despicable situation, with a young boy caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   And not only between Washington and Havana. Florida is a major
prize in presidential elections, with 25 electoral votes, and
Cuban-Americans are a bloc to reckon with -- or cater to -- in
campaigning for them.
</P>
<P>
   After Vice President Al Gore broke with President Clinton to
support a bill giving permanent resident status to Elian, his Cuban
father and family -- who haven't sought it -- Gore denied campaign
motives, although his certainly would be served by gaining among
Cuban-American voters in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Gallup Poll shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans
think Elian should be sent home to Cuba with his father, as the
administration decided in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he didn't change his position on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''... Over four months ago, I said exactly the same thing, that
the father and his family should be given visas to come here and to
state on free soil what the father's wishes really are,'' Gore
said. ''It's the same position that I have had from the start in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   That much is so. But it didn't cover the next step, his sudden
backing of a bill giving resident status to the boy and his family.
And it was enough of a break with Clinton that Gore alerted the
White House chief of staff to it. John Podesta then called it an
honest disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore had differed on the issue before. When the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Jan. 5 that Elian
should be returned to his father, Clinton said that following
immigration law and procedure was the way to keep politics out of
the case. Gore said it should be settled in court.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court has upheld the INS order, but the agency held
off on enforcement while the boy's Miami relatives appealed. Gore
now says it should be handled in Florida family court. A state
court ruled earlier that despite the INS decision, Elian should
remain temporarily with the Miami relatives with whom he has been
living since his rescue from the sea in November. In a family court
with an elected judge, south Florida politics would again be in
play.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says that if the boy's father comes to the United States
and ''says on free soil'' that he wants to take his son home to
Cuba, that would be ''determinative.''
</P>
<P>
   But he then hedged, saying a family court should handle the case
guided by ''the best interest of the child -- not diplomacy, not
politics, not immigration precedents.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional leaders oppose Gore, their presidential
candidate, on this issue, especially the permanent resident status
legislation, which was proposed after Republican leaders got
nowhere with a bill to make Elian a U.S. citizen. The White House
doubts the residency bill would pass, either.
</P>
<P>
   There is no defining issue here between Gore and Republican
presidential rival Gov. George W. Bush, who wants the boy to stay
and says a family court should decide.
</P>
<P>
   Only the tactics are different. Bush stood with his brother,
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, against returning Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   George W. said that if Gore is serious ''and not playing Florida
politics,'' he should get the administration to have the INS back
off and drop its efforts to repatriate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But after the ritual statements that they are only concerned
about the boy, almost everyone is playing Florida politics, or at
least anti-Castro politics.
</P>
<P>
   One nod of dissent came from Rep. Steve Largent, a conservative
Republican from Oklahoma, who said ''the poisonous political
rhetoric coming from Miami and Washington'' ignores the well-being
of the boy, who should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be for family values and at the same time advocate
that governments be allowed to come between a father and his
child,'' Largent said in a New York Times commentary.
</P>
<P>
   That is an inconsistency other politicians generally have
ignored.

<HEADLINE> Group Labels Parks 'Endangered'  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threats facing national parks range from
urban sprawl and vandalism to snowmobiles, a private park advocacy
group said Wednesday, as it announced the 10 federal parks it
considers most endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park and Conservation Association removed five park
units from last year's imperiled list and added five new ones, but
the group said attacks on the park system have not eased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of our national parks are becoming a disgrace,''
complained Tom Kiernan, president of the group, whose primary
purpose is as a private watchdog for the federal park system. He
said the park system's biggest challenge is to overcome a shortage
of money to address a massive backlog of repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Making the list for a second year were some of the most popular
and well known national parks: Yellowstone, Great Smoky Mountains,
and the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The parks that were replaced from last year included Gettysburg
National Monument in Pennsylvania where improvements were made in a
proposed visitors center; the Grand Canyon because steps are being
taken to ease congestion; and Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota
because of a moratorium on Jet Skis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group said a gamut of threats jeopardize the park
system, which includes more than 360 separate units from the widely
known parks like Yellowstone to historic battlefields, national
monuments, seashores and historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone in northwestern Wyoming was the nation's first
federal park, created in 1872, but today ''it ranks as one of the
most endangered, said the association. Overcrowding with motor
vehicles and winter recreation, including about 1,000 snowmobiles,
is ''pumping tons of pollutants into the air,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone was featured in last year's list when concern was
raised about its ''crumbling sewage system.'' Previously a huge
proposed gold mine near the park caused concern, but plans for that
mine have been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The five new park sites on the list were:
</P>
<P>
   --Joshua Tree National Park in the California desert. A landfill
is being proposed one and one-half miles from the park with 20,000
tons of garbage expected to arrive daily.
</P>
<P>
   --Stones River National Battlefield in Tennessee. A highway is
being proposed to bisect the Civil War site which contains graves
of 7,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   --Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. It's been a target
of vandals and thieves. Vistors cart away 12 tons of fossilized
wood annually.
</P>
<P>
   --Ozark Scenic Riverways National Park in Missouri. Mining
companies are seeking permits to explore the watershed for deposits
of lead, raising concern about pollution of the scenic riverway.
</P>
<P>
   --National Underground Railraod Network to Freedom. Only recently
created by Congress, the association says lawmakers are not
providing enough money to restore deteriorating structures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Yellowstone, the four other parks on the list for
the second year are:
</P>
<P>
   --Denali National Park in Alaska. Concern about noise and
pollution from a proposal for snowmobile access. Also, as last
year, concern about a proposed road and resort development.
</P>
<P>
   --Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North
Carolina. Polluted air from coal-burning power plants, some
hundreds of miles away, and pollution from a growing number of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   --Everglades, Biscayne and Big Cypress in Florida. Development of
a proposed airport near the Everglades, off-road vehicle use in Big
Cypress, and a disruption of natural water flow.
</P>
<P>
   --Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. A proposed airport expansion
raises concern about an increase in alien species being brought
into the park, posing additional threats to native island plants
and other species.
</P>
<P>
   Also taken off the list from last year were the Chaco Culture
National Historic Park in New Mexico, after Congress provided more
money for preservation, and the Mojave National Preserve, because
of the closing of a mine long located there.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers OK Controversial Artwork  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- After impassioned debate, lawmakers Wednesday
narrowly approved installing a controversial artwork in the
Reichstag parliament building that many believe raises the
uncomfortable question of who is a German.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house voted 260-258 in favor of the piece by artist
Hans Haacke, whose dedication ''To the Population'' is meant as a
liberal, modern-day counterpart to the old inscription above the
Reichstag's entrance: ''To the German People.'' Thirty-one
legislators abstained.
</P>
<P>
   But the contrast of the two inscriptions goes to the heart of
current debates over immigration and citizenship: whether those who
live within Germany's borders are a ''people'' or a ''population.''
</P>
<P>
   It poses the question of whether being German means ''being of
German descent,'' or if it includes anyone who feels at home here.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of Haacke's proposal -- a wooden flower trough, 23
feet wide and 70 feet long -- has also sparked controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The trough is to be filled with dirt brought by each of the 669
legislators from their hometowns -- something that many lawmakers
across party lines say draws an awkward allusion to the mythical
veneration of German ''blood and soil'' practiced by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament President Wolfgang Thierse had come out in favor of
the project hours before the vote, saying it would remind lawmakers
at a time of rising immigration of their obligation to everyone
living in Germany -- not just those of German descent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us not react with fearful defensiveness to the
contradictions raised by Hans Haacke's project,'' Thierse implored
the packed chamber under the Reichstag's new glass dome during the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary leaders ordered a recount because of the close
ballot. However, the result was not expected to change.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, a German based in New York, said he intended his artwork
to be a statement against xenophobia and rising neo-Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions lost their lives because of an understanding about
who belongs or does not belong to the German people,'' he said in
an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that there are again people in this country who attack
passers-by on the street if they don't look German enough,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the piece called it inappropriate and unnecessarily
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Lammert, a member of the conservative opposition
Christian Democrats, whose motion to block the project was rejected
in Wednesday's vote, called Haacke's proposal ''politically and
esthetically a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said German lawmakers ''need lessons from no one'' on how to
protect the rights of people living here.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives insist Germany is not a country of immigrants,
even though almost 10 percent of its 83 million people are
foreigners. New laws that went into effect this year cut the
decades-old link between blood and citizenship, but only after much
heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke has said he would neither accept changes to the work nor
agree to install it elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Arcadia Skeet Shoot Game Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Approximately 435,000 skeet shoot games are
being recalled by the manufacturer because of defective cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday the
Arcadia Electronic Skeet Shoot game catridge may cause the
projector to overheat, melt and smoke. Game manufacturer Toymax
Inc., of Plainview, N.Y. has received 100 reports of this problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Arcadia Electronic Skeet Shoot game sets are indoor image
projecting game systems that include Duck Shoot and Deer Hunter
games. The game set includes a pump action rifle with a simulated
laser scope and realistic shooting sounds when fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Duck Shoot Game has a gray rifle and projector, and the Deer
Hunter game has a camouflage rifle and projector. Meteor Attack and
Fighter Attack cartridges, sold separately, are also included in
the recall. The Meteor Attack cartridge is silver and the Fighter
Attack cartridge is black.
</P>
<P>
   ''ARCADIA ELECTRONIC SKEET SHOOT'' is written on a label on the
projector, and writing on the bottom of the projector includes
''1998 TOYMAX,'' ''PATENT PENDING,'' and ''MADE IN CHINA.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy and discount department stores nationwide, including Toys R
Us, Sam's Club, KB Toys and Costco, sold the games from October
1998 through March of this year for about $65.
</P>
<P>
   Customers should immediately stop using the games and remove the
game cartridge from the console. To receive a free replacement
cartridge or for more information, customers can contact Toymax at
(800) 477-6215 anytime, or visit the company web site,
www.toymax.com. Customers should not return the games or cartridges
to stores.
</P>
<P>
   New and replacement game cartridges are orange. All Arcadia
Electronic Skeet Shoot game cartridges that are not orange should
be replaced.

<HEADLINE> Beef Blamed for E. coli Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ground beef in an undercooked casserole
caused an E. coli outbreak that sickened 18 schoolchildren, and
meat from the same batch may have been served in school lunches
elsewhere in the state, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak was at Minneapolis' Risen Christ Catholic School,
where a casserole of ground beef, pasta and tomato sauce was served
March 14, the state Health Department said Tuesday. The students
starting showing E. coli symptoms -- severe or bloody diarrhea and
abdominal cramps -- between March 16 and March 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department confirmed six students were infected by
the E. coli 0157:H7 strain and is awaiting test results on 12 other
students.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those sickened had to be hospitalized. All of the
children are recovering or have recovered, Health Department
spokesman Buddy Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meat containing E. coli may have been shipped to other Minnesota
schools from several processing plants since December, said Carol
Blake, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Food and Safety Inspection
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible that we may issue a recall of the meat, but
we're not at that stage yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blake would not identify the processing plants.

<HEADLINE> Labor Sec. Herman Cleared  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ending a two-year investigation, an
independent counsel on Wednesday cleared Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman of allegations that she solicited $250,000 in illegal
campaign contributions. President Clinton said ''she did not
deserve what she's had to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Ralph Lancaster said he will not seek an
indictment of Herman, who was accused by businessman Laurent Yene
of having a deal to receive a 10 percent kickback for aiding
clients of a firm co-owned by Vanessa Weaver, a close friend of
Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The sole indictment was against Singapore businessman Abdul
Rahman for making $200,000 in illegal contributions to the
Democratic Party through Weaver and her sister, Caryliss.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahman is not in the United States so any action against him
seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lawrence Barcella, a lawyer for the Weavers, said
he's been advised by Lancaster's office that the decision not to
prosecute includes the sisters as well as Herman -- a decision which
signals an end to the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said she is ''gratified personally and for my family that
the independent counsel has terminated his investigation'' while
her lawyer, Neil Eggleston, said the secretary of labor
''cooperated ... in every way possible'' with Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I said at the start of this inquiry nearly two years ago,
Secretary Herman did nothing wrong,'' Clinton said in a statement
from the White House. ''But throughout it all, she was never
deterred from her mission -- making life better for America's
working families. I am proud to call her my friend, and I am
honored that she has been willing to work in this administration on
behalf of working people everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Yene alleged that Rahman made political donations to help obtain
a Federal Communications Commission license for a company to which
he had ties. The company obtained an FCC license in 1997 to develop
a telephone satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   Herman had been introduced to Rahman by Vanessa Weaver on one or
two occasions. Rahman was introduced to Clinton during the 1996
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, while running the White House Office of Public Liaison
before becoming labor secretary, took Caryliss Weaver on a trade
mission. Clinton nominated Vanessa Weaver for the board of
directors of the U.S. Export-Import Bank and she was confirmed by
the Senate late last year. Vanessa Weaver served at the White House
from 1994 to 1999 as deputy assistant to President Clinton and
deputy director of presidential personnel.

<HEADLINE> MCI, Sprint Defend Merger  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The proposed marriage between two of the
nation's top three long-distance carriers had supporters and
opponents jousting Wednesday over this question: What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   When it's a brand name, it's important, say consumer advocates
and others who are concerned that a proposed merger between the
well-known MCI WorldCom and Sprint will curtail competition.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and Sprint officials say that names aside, there are
hundreds of long-distance competitors that are making headway in
attracting new customers. In a recent filing with the FCC, the
companies asserted that even after their deal closes, 98 percent of
Americans would have at least three long-distance carriers to
choose from and 90 percent would have four.
</P>
<P>
   ''The genie is out of the bottle in terms of competition,'' said
Michael H. Salsbury, MCI WorldCom's general counsel, at a Federal
Communications Commission forum on the deal Wednesday. ''The
customer base is increasingly very well-educated, very price
sensitive and very willing to switch carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several panelists still questioned whether that vibrant market
really exists for residential consumers -- who may still lean toward
the top three brands rather than a sea of upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that the market is changing significantly,
but one cannot disregard the market as it exists,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition contended
many consumers rely on advertising and name brands in making their
telecommunications decisions. He added that competition between the
three big-name players -- MCI, Sprint and No. 1 carrier AT&AMP;T -- has
helped to drive down rates and spur new pricing plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sprint was seen as a catalyst to competition,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI are ''talking at best about a market that is just
beginning to materialize,'' said Sandy Wagner, SBC Communications
vice president for federal regulatory matters. SBC, the nation's
largest local phone company, is seeking to get into the
long-distance business itself within its calling region.
</P>
<P>
   But Salsbury and other officials said new competitors are
garnering a strong foothold in the long-distance market, even
without brand name power and that the entry of the local Bell
companies into even a few states to offer long-distance would help
drive down prices throughout the market.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and Sprint also touted their ability to provide new
competition for the local Bell companies, if allowed to combine,
and bring consumers more local/long-distance packages. That could
mean additional savings for those consumers who don't make a large
number of calls, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some panelists argued that the benefits of increased local phone
competition could be achieved by the two companies independently or
through some other arrangement other than a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also raised concerns that fiber used to roll out
advanced telecommunications services was not being laid in
low-income urban areas. He cited parts of downtown Chicago as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sallet, MCI's chief policy counsel, said the combined
operation of the two companies would help hasten the delivery of
Internet services to underserved parts of the country, using the
high-speed wireless network the merged businesses would share.

<HEADLINE> Bush Waits for Gore News Conference  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Onetime reporter Al Gore hasn't held a news
conference in more than six weeks. The Bush campaign is starting to
track the days, suggesting the vice president is hiding from
questions about fund raising and other controversial matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee -- with the Bush camp's
blessing -- launched the ''Al Gore News Conference Watch'' on
Wednesday. Opening count: 46 days without one, dating back to Feb.
19 in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In that interval, the Justice Department has begun an
investigation of missing e-mails at the White House, some of which
related to Gore. The vice president's office has also acknowledged
contacting the IRS on a union tax matter. And Gore has broken ranks
with President Clinton over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that Gore regularly grants one-on-one
interviews, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said those are easier to
control. ''News conferences are a way to see how fast you are on
your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds almost daily ''availabilities'' while campaigning. No
subject is off limits, although the Texas governor sometimes takes
a pass on issues with which he is unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe Bush needs the practice,'' responded Gore spokesman Doug
Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore talks to reporters ''virtually every single day,''
albeit in an individual setting. On Tuesday it was USA Today,
Knight Ridder, ''Lifetime Live'' and the ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaign is trying to have as much interaction as possible
with voters, and that's an important way to get the message out, so
we want to focus our efforts there as well,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, an interview can cause problems for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his campaign's press office went into overdrive
after Gore told ''Today's'' Matt Lauer that Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Elian's father, should be allowed to take his son home to Cuba if
the father comes to the United States and declares that's what he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Such a pronouncement by the father, Gore said, would be
''determinative'' regarding custody of Elian, who was rescued off
Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned after fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Aides rushed to point out that Gore also told Lauer that family
courts typically have the final say in such cases. The campaign
followed with a statement clarifying that Gore wanted a family
court to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts see an irony in Bush highlighting Gore's
dearth of news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush is taking his cues from the problems with his own
campaign,'' said Wayne Fields, an English professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. Fields wrote a book about presidential
rhetoric, ''Union of Words.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People liked McCain's accessibility,'' and that caused
problems for Bush, the professor said. ''Now he's hoping that
Gore's lack of accessibility will cause problems'' for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his presidential campaign, Bush was criticized for
inaccessibility. He traveled separately from the press corps and
stayed in different hotels. He also skipped debates and faced
questions about his nimbleness after he stammered through a foreign
policy pop quiz from a TV reporter.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, the Arizona senator and Bush's closest Republican
challenger, drew rave reviews for holding rolling, daylong news
conferences aboard his campaign bus, the ''Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, a nonpartisan media analyst, cited a difficult 1997 news
conference as an explanation for Gore's reluctance to meet with
reporters en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a flurry of questions about fund-raising calls he made from
the White House during the last presidential election, the vice
president held a hastily arranged news conference at the White
House. He insisted there was ''no controlling legal authority''
preventing his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Aides conceded the event was a public relations disaster. To
this day, Bush mocks Gore's phrase on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Lichter said: ''Gore has already gotten burned for his choice of
words and some of his claims, like he invented the Internet, so
it's understandable that he would avoid similar settings.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton warns kids about smoking, backs smoke-free bars  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday said she
supports the concept of smoke-free bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would vote for it if I were on the City Council,'' Clinton
told reporters. ''I made the White House a no-smoking zone because
I think it's a terrible imposition on others. It's not only what
you do to yourself but what you inflict on others.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been recent talk of tightening a New York City law
that bans smoking in restaurants seating more than 35 people. The
current law permits smoking in the bar area of such establishments,
but some anti-tobacco activists would like to see smoking banned
there as well. No formal legislation is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican rival for the Senate seat, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, does not support changing current regulations, which he
signed into law in 1995. Giuliani spokesman Ed Skyler said he
thinks the existing law ''strikes the right balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton appeared at a public middle school, the Salk
School, where she lectured 350 students in grades 6-8 on the evils
of smoking as part of Kick Butts Day, a national anti-tobacco event
aimed at young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to kick butts out of the way of every single
teen-ager, child and hopefully even adults,'' she said. She also
accused tobacco companies of targeting children, saying: ''They're
trying to get that advertising into your mind to enable you to
cross the barrier of health and science and start smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that she supports legislation to give the Food
and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco as if it
were a drug. The Supreme Court ruled last month that the FDA cannot
do so under the current law.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently buoyed by a new poll showing her support inching up,
Clinton appeared relaxed and chatty throughout the day. The new
survey from Quinnipiac College showed Clinton leading Giuliani
46-43, a statistical dead heat but cause for celebration in the
Clinton camp because it confirmed two previous recent polls showing
that the first lady is finally making a dent in the support for the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's having a bad couple of weeks,'' she said
gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton appeared at a National Council of Jewish Women
luncheon at a conservative synagogue in Rockville Centre, Long
Island. The organization is working on an anti-domestic violence
campaign in Nassau County to support women escaping abusive
situations and to post cards offering emergency help in public
restrooms and other places around the county.
</P>
<P>
   A domestic violence survivor, Harriet Feldman, brought the
audience to tears as she described her 30-year marriage to a doctor
who regularly beat her. He died 15 years ago but she said the abuse
had scarred her children, who are both recovering alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked Feldman for her ''courage and eloquence,'' and
called for a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,
which provides federal funding for local assistance to rape
victims, prosecution of batterers and related projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Julian Cook paid tribute to Clinton's ''inspirational
leadership'' and the 300 women assembled gave her a standing
ovation. But afterward, some said they remain undecided about her
Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''She spoke beautifully on this issue but there are a hell of a
lot of other issues out there,'' said NCJW member Marilyn Lamstein.
''I think she's a brilliant woman and I admire her intellect, but I
don't know who she really is ... She should get a real identity and
not waste time denigrating Rudy Giuliani. He's doing a good job
denigrating himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended her day by participating in a global conference on
women and business that connected 160 sites via satellite. Asked if
female politicians have a different leadership style from men, she
said she thought women were more likely to lead by ''consensus and
create a win-win situation than a zero-sum game.''

   Dow Ends Down 130.92; Nasdaq Up 20.45
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks suffered another bout of
volatility today, giving up a major advance to finish with slender
gains and proving that the nervousness that sent Wall Street into a
tailspin yesterday lingers. Investors were torn between hunting for
bargains and waiting for the dust to settle after Tuesday's
head-spinning session. Ultimately, only the largest, best-known
technology names held their gains. Profit-taking continued in both
the technology sector and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial
average. ''It's not nearly as dramatically as yesterday, but this
is still a wild market,'' said Larry Lawler, manager of equity
trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 20.45 at 4,169.34 and the Dow Jones Industrials were down

resumed at 3:30 p.m. The market was paralyzed during what should
have been one of its busiest sessions -- the last day of the British
tax year. Untold numbers of people may have missed out on a chance
to buy or sell shares in a last-minute attempt to minimize their
liability for capital gains tax. Once the system was up and
running, the exchange announced extended trading hours until 8 p.m.
to help make up for some of the time lost. At the end of trading,
British stocks were lower.

scheduled to begin holding hearings on the case on May 24,
according to sources close to the case. During a private meeting,
he gave attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states
suing Microsoft until the end of this month to submit their
proposed remedies. Jackson gave Microsoft slightly less than two
weeks to respond to that proposal, and the government another week
for a rebuttal. Earlier, there had been some mention of a possible

<HEADLINE> Transplant Fight Shifts To Senate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the House came down squarely
against the Clinton administration's effort to assure that more
donated organs go to the sickest transplant patients, the fight is
shifting to the Senate, where a compromise is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who was a heart and lung transplant
surgeon before coming to the Senate, was introducing legislation
today that tries to balance the interests of the private company
that runs the transplant system under a government contract with
those of the Department of Health and Human Services, which wants
to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal is to have medical decisions made by the transplant
community, with strong oversight and strong accountability,'' Frist
told reporters today. He invoked his experience as a surgeon, when
he knew that five out of his 20 patients would die waiting for a
heart or lung. ''They would look at me each day recognizing ... if
they didn't receive a heart, they'd be gone in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Frist had hoped to co-sponsor the bill with Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., a leader among Senate Democrats on health care issues. But
as of this morning, Kennedy had not agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The two offices were still talking, and Frist said they were 99
percent in agreement. But he was moving forward without Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Frist's plan is a significant improvement over the
House bill, and we will continue to work together to find an
equitable solution,'' Kennedy said today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy aides said the dispute involved Frist's decision to
eliminate a directive to policy-makers to develop broader sharing
of organs, what HHS had been pushing for. They also wanted to
strengthen the department's authority, although the details of
their disagreement were not clear.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is which side should have the power to write rules
governing the distribution of scarce organs, and what those rules
should be.
</P>
<P>
   HHS and its allies argue that this is an issue of public policy
that should be decided by federal officials who are accountable to
taxpayers, and it has proposed replacing the current geographically
based distribution system with one that would get organs to the
neediest patients first, no matter where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The United Network for Organ Sharing and its supporters argue
that this is a medical question that should be decided by the
transplant professionals who make up the network. The network's
distribution system is designed so that local patients get first
crack at donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the House backed the network in a 275-147 vote that
would strip HHS of its authority to set policy and overturn its
proposed new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government is simply not equipped to make these
decisions,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the House Commerce
Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration promised a veto should his bill reach
the president's desk. The House bill did not attract the 290 votes
that would be needed to overturn a veto.
</P>
<P>
   HHS Secretary Donna Shalala accused the House of ignoring the
findings of a congressionally ordered study of the organ transplant
system. But she predicted that a better bill would emerge
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the months ahead, this vote will be seen for what it is --
an unfortunate footnote to larger good-faith efforts that are under
way to achieve the best organ transplant system possible,'' she
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala and others are now looking to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Frist bill would allow the transplant network to write
allocation policy. But if HHS objected to the network's actions and
the two sides could not find a compromise, the matter would be
settled by an independent commission. The commission would comprise
five people appointed by each sides, plus five experts picked by
the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is supply and demand. Only about half of
families asked to donate organs say yes, and many families are
never asked. Meanwhile, nearly 5,000 people die each year waiting
for organ transplants; 68,530 people are waiting for transplants
today.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed by the House also encourages organ
donation, something all sides support. It calls for financial
assistance for living donors who give away a kidney or part of a
liver, and offers grants for states to encourage donation.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, it gives the transplant network complete
control over the rules governing how to distribute more than 20,000
organs that are donated each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the network's system, patients who live in the same area
as donors have first chance at organs, even if a sicker patient
lives just outside the border. The Clinton administration wants to
eliminate those geographic barriers, saying someone's chance at
life should not be dictated by where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ''Healthy people are getting organs before they need them and
the very sick are not getting organs before they die,'' said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant network and many transplant centers --
particularly smaller hospitals -- fear that change would siphon away
locally donated organs to other centers, jeopardizing their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the current system also argue that states would
have little incentive to encourage organ donation if the organs
were being shipped elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Nuns Indicted in Fundraising Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Buddhist nuns were indicted Wednesday for
failing to appear as government witnesses at last month's trial in
which Democratic party fund-raiser Maria Hsia was convicted for
arranging more than $100,000 in illegal donations during the 1996
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said the pair,
Venerables Yi Chu and Man Ho, fled the country after being given
immunity for their testimony and are believed to be in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury here charged them with contempt of court
for failing to appear. In January, a judge had refused their bid to
quash the subpoenas, originally issued in May 1998. The indictments
brought to 24 the number of people charged by the department's
campaign finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns' attorney, Mark Flanagan, said he would seek to have
the indictment dismissed because prosecuting them ''for not
appearing as witnesses in a trial that the government won serves
absolutely no legitimate purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuns ''assisted in the government's investigation. They were
available in the United States to testify at trial for over 15
months preceding their reassignment to Taiwan and assumption of
demanding religious duties,'' Flanagan added.
</P>
<P>
   The two nuns were to testify about one of the most well-known
elements of the Hsia case -- an April 29, 1996, event at their
temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, then running for re-election with
President Clinton, attended but says he didn't know it was a
fund-raising event. On various occasions, he has said he thought it
was community outreach, finance-related and donor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's role in that event has continued to dog his presidential
campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia was convicted of five counts of causing false statements to
be made to the Federal Election Commission in a scheme the Justice
Department said was designed to conceal the true source of illegal
donations through the use of ''straw'' donors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that Hsia tapped the Buddhist temple in
California and some of her well-to-do business clients for money to
reimburse straw donors who were listed as the contributors in
campaign records. According to evidence presented in the case,
$109,000 in reimbursed donations went to Clinton-Gore '96, the
Democratic Party and the campaign of Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Video footage was played at the trial showing the vice president
attending the temple event.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang,
the central figure in the campaign fund-raising scandal, testified
that Hsia handed him an envelope containing $100,000 the day after
he and Hsia discussed the fact that the event hadn't raised much
money, despite Gore's appearance. Much of the money was illegally
reimbursed from temple funds.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that Hsia got five blank checks from the
Buddhist temple and reimbursed five donors, including herself, in
connection with a temple fund-raiser that Kennedy attended.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's lawyers said there was no evidence that Hsia was aware of
the reimbursements from the Gore fund-raiser, but prosecutors
introduced canceled checks suggesting that on three instances from
1993 to 1996 Hsia used temple funds to reimburse her own political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia did not testify at the trial, but her lawyers said the
money was for public relations work Hsia had done for the temple.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Gather at Reno Fla. Home  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Carrying signs depicting Janet Reno as the devil,
anti-Castro activists protested outside the attorney general's
Florida home Wednesday against the government's effort to send
Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, a former Miami-Dade County state attorney, was not in
Florida, but several dozen demonstrators targeted her house in the
Kendall neighborhood anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''My message here is to give freedom to Elian,'' said one of the
protesters, Barbara Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, other demonstrators
maintained a vigil outside the home of Elian's great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez, who has had temporary custody of the 6-year-old boy since
he was rescued from an inner tube at sea in November.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha Sanchez shouted denunciations of President Clinton through
a bullhorn, saying: ''You might as well send Elian back to the
ocean and let him die there.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of a possible reunion between Elian and his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, are being negotiated by attorneys for the Miami
relatives and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues is whether the father, who has been granted a
U.S. visa, would stay in the United States until the Miami
relatives' court battle to keep Elian is over.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are suspended until Thursday. But INS officials have
said that once Elian's father arrives in the United States, they
will go about turning the boy over to him.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the American lawyer for Elian's father, was in
Cuba on Wednesday to discuss his client's possible trip to the
United States. U.S. officials said they understood Craig made the
trip to try to persuade him to travel to the United States to be
reunited with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Remirez, head of the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington, said the father's travel plans depend on ''the
assurance he will get temporary custody.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has granted visas to Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
his wife and their infant son, as well as a cousin, a kindergarten
teacher and a pediatrician. The agency said it is reviewing visa
requests from 22 other Cubans, including 12 of Elian's classmates
and Ricardo Alarcon, a top adviser to Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, the cousin who has served as Elian's
surrogate mother in Miami, was released from a hospital Wednesday
after an overnight stay for treatment of exhaustion. A family
spokesman said she was staying temporarily at the home of other
relatives.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 130; Nasdaq Up 20  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks suffered another bout of
volatility Wednesday, giving up a major advance to finish with
slender gains and proving that the nervousness that sent Wall
Street into a tailspin on Tuesday lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were torn between hunting for bargains and waiting for
the dust to settle after Tuesday's head-spinning session.
Ultimately, the largest, best-known technology names held their
gains. Profit-taking continued in both the technology sector and
the blue-chip Dow Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not behaving nearly as dramatically as yesterday, but
this is still a wild market,'' said Larry Lawler, manager of equity
trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.33 to 4,169.22. During the
regular trading day, the index fell as much as 139.80 and rose as
much as 133.40.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 130.92 to close at
11,033.92 after giving up an early gain. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 7.36 to 1,487.37.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000, which has also dropped sharply this week, rose
11.92 to 518.04.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly modest, but volatility remained. Stocks were
down at the opening as traders struggled to find their footing
after Tuesday's chaotic selloff, during which both the Nasdaq and
the Dow fell more than 500 points only to close with modest,
double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   The wildness on Wall Street rattled most overseas markets, which
made it even more difficult for the U.S. market to mount any real
advance in morning trading. As the session wore on, however, some
bargain-hunting investors stepped in, their confidence boosted by
some calming words from major market movers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment
strategist at Goldman Sachs, delivered an upbeat message at a White
House conference on the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past decade, we have been enthusiastic about the
outlook for U.S. stock prices in the United States, and we remain
so,'' Cohen said. She said the long-running bull market had been
driven by steady economic gains and therefore was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cohen's recommendation that clients put some of their
stock holdings into cash sparked a round of selling on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon, the market drew some additional support from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who gave credit to the
''extraordinary surge in technological innovation'' for America's
current record-breaking economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even as investors returned to the market, most confined
their technology buying to the best-known names. Applied Materials,
a leading maker of computer chip equipment, rose 6 1/16 to 104
3/16. Oracle gained 2 5/16 to 78\ and Hewlett-Packard rose 4} to
142~.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' shifting sentiment played out in companies including
i2 Technologies, a business-to-business service provider for the
electronic commerce industry. Shares rose 10 9/16 to 105 Wednesday
after Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette boosted its rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But just Monday, i2's shares had tumbled 24 percent after
Prudential Securities cut its rating. Ultimately, concern over that
type of decline undermined the market's attempts to rally sharply,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and consumer goods stocks, which rose sharply last
week, slipped as jittery investors took profits. Procter &AMP; Gamble
fell 1 15/16 to 61 9/16 and J.P. Morgan fell 1 9/16 to 134{.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola fell 4} to 47| after the company lowered its long-term
annual earnings-per-share growth target to 15 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some representatives of the ''old economy'' fared better.
Sears rose 7 to 37{ after saying it expects first-quarter profits
to beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Two initial public offerings that are far removed from the
dot-com world attracted buyers. MetLife, the nation's
second-largest life insurer, rose 1[ from its offering price to
close at 15] in heavy trading. And Krispy Kreme, a doughnut company
with massive brand loyalty, rose more than 70 percent from its
offering price, ending at 37 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Amid Wednesday's uncertain performance, some analysts remained
skeptical of the market's short-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it more as the eye of the storm,'' said Gail Dudack,
chief investment strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
''The danger for the market place has not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, eight stocks rose for every
seven that fell.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.33 billion shares, compared with 1.82
billion in Tuesday's turbulent session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent,
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 2.6 percent and France's CAC-40 fell
3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's FT-SE 100 index fell 0.7 percent after markets
reopened following a technical problem that suspended trading for
7{ hours.

<HEADLINE> Former Spy Files Returned to Germany  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The CIA has given Germany a first batch of spy
files obtained from the former East Germany that could expose many
agents who operated in the West during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The archive, said to contain 320,000 names, was obtained by the
U.S. intelligence agency after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, though
the circumstances have never been officially explained.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Wednesday that the
first CD-ROM arrived at Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's office last
Friday. It was still sealed and had not yet been analyzed, he said.
Some 1,000 further discs are to follow over the next 1{ years, Heye
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA agreed last year to share the records, believed to
contain information about thousands of former communist East German
spies and informants. However, the CIA said it would withhold data
that compromises U.S. sources.
</P>
<P>
   German officials have said they believe the files will identify
as yet undiscovered spies who worked for East Germany's Stasi
intelligence agency, including Cold War agents who operated in
former West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But Heye stressed that is was unclear how many revelations the
files actually contain.
</P>
<P>
   ''First we have to know what's really in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heye said experts from the government and the agency that
oversees the Stasi archive in Berlin will analyze the data, then
determine how much of it should be open to the public. He said it
was too early to tell how long that would take.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder pledged Wednesday to treat the material
confidentially.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will handle it in such a way that there are no
indiscretions,'' he told reporters in the eastern city of Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   A German newspaper reported Wednesday that the CIA acquired the
files from the former Soviet KGB in 1992 after the Stasi spirited
them to Moscow during the peaceful democratic revolution that
brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That contradicts the widely held theory that the CIA got hold of
the files in East Berlin in 1990, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in
a report to appear in Thursday's editions. The report gave no
details of the alleged transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The poor quality of the files -- which are also believed to
contain handwritten notes -- makes scanning them onto discs
''extraordinarily hard'' and explains the lengthy process, Heye
said. The data is contained on up to 600,000 individual file cards,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Radioactive Material Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- Scientists have found that material
hidden in 10 lead boxes seized from a truckload of scrap metal
bound for Pakistan was highly radioactive, the Interfax news agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials in Uzbekistan said they discovered nearly a
ton of material emitting radiation when the truck was halted last
week at a remote border crossing with Turkmenistan. It was headed
for Pakistan via Iran on a trip that began in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery reinforced worries about smuggling of nuclear
material from countries of the former Soviet Union to such
countries as Iran, which the United States believes is trying to
build a nuclear bomb, and Pakistan, which successfully tested a
nuclear bomb in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After being halted in Uzbekistan, the truck was sent back to
Kazakstan, where officials were investigating what was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Kazak nuclear scientists at the Institute of the Radiation
Control Department told Interfax the material was emitting about
1,200 milliroentgen per hour, enough to cause radiation sickness in
a person after 50 days of exposure. The radiation level was more
than 100 times Kazak safety limits.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention whether the truck's driver, an
Iranian national, had become ill.
</P>
<P>
   To get a closer reading of what sort of material is involved,
authorities sent a sample from the boxes to Kazakstan's National
Nuclear Center at Semipalatinsk, a facility in eastern Kazakstan
formerly used to test Soviet nuclear weapons, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet collapse in 1991, Kazakstan declared itself a
neutral and non-nuclear country and turned over its Soviet-made
nuclear weapons to Russia, but retained nuclear research
facilities. The United States is helping the country destroy
remaining weapons facilities.

<HEADLINE> Survey: McCain Can Help GOP  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican presidential contender John
McCain is well liked by swing voters who could be decisive in the
battle for control of the House this fall, according to a GOP
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, taken since McCain suspended his campaign for the
White House, indicates the Arizona senator is favored -- more than
Al Gore and George W. Bush -- by voters who describe themselves as
uncommitted in a hypothetical matchup of congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The finding emerged from a poll conducted for SAFE, an
organization associated with Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, to help
assure continued GOP control of the House in the fall elections.
Watts presented the data at a closed-door meeting of the House
Republican leadership earlier in the week, according to party
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly McCain has appeal among undecided congressional
voters,'' said David Winston, the pollster who conducted the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans already were moving eagerly to enlist McCain's
aid in campaigning in key districts around the country. The Arizona
senator won seven primaries -- five New England states and Michigan
as well as his home state -- and attracted the support of thousands
of moderates and Democrats before suspending his campaign last
month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aside, the survey showed congressional Democrats still
lead Republicans by double-digit margins on several key issues, but
the GOP has made ''incremental improvement'' in areas such as
education, health care, Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which party cares more about them, 42 percent of those
surveyed said Democrats, and 33 percent said Republicans. That was
a slight change from a 44-31 Democratic advantage in a previous
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The SAFE survey showed that in a hypothetical matchup of two
congressional candidates, the Democrat won 44 percent support, the
Republican 42 percent, 12 percent were undecided, and 2 percent
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Of the uncommitted 14 percent, McCain got the support of 41
percent in a separate, hypothetical three-way presidential ballot
test, while Democrat Gore drew 19 percent and Republican Bush drew
21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Material from the survey was made available to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   It tracks findings in public polls, including a Voter.com
Battleground 2000 survey that found McCain a benefit in swing
congressional districts. Bush's support in those districts rose
from 49 percent to 61 percent with McCain on a hypothetical ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, who conducted polls for McCain's campaign, said
that based on several surveys he's seen, ''McCain voters are the
absolute swing part of the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who frequently challenged Bush and his own party to
support campaign finance legislation and other items on his
''reform agenda,'' has indicated a strong desire to campaign on
behalf of Republican congressional candidates. He made his first
foray this week, appearing for New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a
candidate for the Senate. He also has plans to campaign for Sen.
Lincoln Chafee, seeking his first full term from Rhode Island, and
GOP challengers Mark Nielsen in Connecticut and Greg Becker in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Other stops are planned this month in Michigan, New Jersey,
Illinois, Pennsylvania and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the survey was made available, Republican House
campaign officials had been advising rank-and-file lawmakers to
take advantage of the strength McCain demonstrated beyond their own
party.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo late last month, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman
of the party's campaign committee, said, ''Every House Republican
must open their arms to these independent and like-minded Democrat
voters and let them know they are welcome in our family.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Gaining Among Women  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is making progress among women voters,
but George W. Bush is showing enough strength among certain groups
of women to cause continuing concern among Democrats about a
crucial voting bloc, a poll released Wednesday suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by Emily's List, a political network for Democratic
women who support abortion rights, showed Gore with a 6-point edge
among women. It also gave the advantage to Democrats on having the
right approach to education, a top issue in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led the vice president by 10 points among men.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, were even among women
voters in the same poll in December.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support is stronger now among women who are black,
Hispanic, from union households, white and college-educated, and
earning at least $50,000, according to the survey of likely voters
by Democratic pollsters Geoff Garin and Celinda Lake. Bush's
support was stronger among high-school educated and evangelical
white women.
</P>
<P>
   In the overall race, Bush led Gore 44 percent to 42 percent, and
Pat Buchanan had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Recent independent polls have reflected Gore's gains among
women, and also have shown Bush, the Texas governor, with an
advantage among men.
</P>
<P>
   Double-digit advantages among women aided Bill Clinton's
victories in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were close among women who are independent,
suburban, seniors, Midwestern, Western and Protestant, while Bush
led among white married mothers and evangelical women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore has not finished his work,'' said Garin. ''Bush is making
a pretty strong play for women with his focus on education.''
</P>
<P>
   Education was cited as a top campaign issue by 37 percent in the
survey, followed by health care and Social Security -- all issues
that have been traditionally stronger for Democrats. Moral values,
a stronger issue for Republicans, dropped out of the top three; it
was No. 2 in December.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were given the edge on education by 42 percent of
women; Republicans by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 women said education was an extremely important issue
for the next president. Just under half of the men surveyed felt
that way. About six of 10 women said increasing funding for
education should be a higher priority than cutting taxes; just
under half of the men said that.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 809 women and 408 men, all likely voters, was taken
March 21-24 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points, slightly higher for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Corzine emerges from county battles with advantage in ballotposition  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an important early test, Democratic Senate
candidate Jon S. Corzine has secured a prime spot on June 6 primary
ballots in nine counties where more than two-thirds of registered
Democrats live.
</P>
<P>
   By ''winning the line'' in those counties -- including Essex and
Hudson, home to 24 percent of New Jersey Democrats -- Corzine
ensured that his name will appear alongside those of the
best-known, officially endorsed Democrats in congressional and
county races.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, won the line in 11
counties. Somerset County, which holds its convention April 6, will
give Corzine his ninth party line because Florio has conceded that
contest. In tiny Hunterdon County, Florio and Corzine each won
enough support to share equal ballot position.
</P>
<P>
   All told, about 32 percent of registered Democrats live in
counties where Florio is the endorsed candidate; the remaining 68
percent live in Corzine territory.
</P>
<P>
   Florio counties are in the southern and northwestern parts of
the state, while Corzine has the ballot advantage in a swath of
counties from Bergen to Mercer to Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Few Democratic leaders deny that ballot position matters. The
question is how much. Campaigns are influenced by many unexpected
events, like the controversy that engulfed Corzine last week when
he apologized for joking comments about Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last time there was a Democratic primary for
statewide office, Woodbridge Township Mayor Jim McGreevey won the
line in counties that were home to about two-thirds of registered
Democrats. He did win the nomination -- but only narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (ballot position) can make a difference,'' said Tom
Giblin, the Democratic state chairman. ''People look at a column
and see a candidate for sheriff or a candidate for (county) clerk
identifying with a candidate for senator or governor or president.
It does have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldstein, one of Corzine's two campaign managers, said
Corzine's success at winning party support in major counties
''sends a message that the people who know Governor Florio and Jon
Corzine best, those in public service, prefer Jon Corzine by two to
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florio said an increasingly independent-minded electorate
cares less and less about whom party leaders endorse.
</P>
<P>
   A county-by-county breakdown makes for ''an interesting
analysis,'' Florio said, ''but it presupposes that everybody votes
monolithically. And that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Florio and Corzine both pulled out the stops to win
county lines. In wooing county leaders, both candidates tried out
arguments they hope will appeal later in the year to rank-and-file
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, pitched himself
as a new face who would apply private-sector can-do enthusiasm to
stubborn national problems.
</P>
<P>
   Florio stressed the importance of government experience and
raised questions about whether Corzine was offering deep
convictions or deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a longtime financial supporter of the Democratic party,
has written large checks this election cycle to several county
organizations, including $30,000 to Bergen County's Democratic
party and $25,000 each to the parties in Union and Ocean counties.
He won the line in all three counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''His investments have paid off handsomely,'' said Michael
Murphy, a spokesman for the Florio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein said such suspicions were put to rest when Corzine
won party conventions in Bergen and Mercer, traditionally among the
most democratic and competitive contests in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the party chairman in a county that endorsed
Corzine ended up with a paid job with his campaign. But Goldstein
said that chairman, Al Santoro of Ocean County, was offered the job
only after the county endorsement was decided.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid being exiled to a lonely part of the ballot in counties
where they lost the line, Florio and Corzine can choose to align
themselves with candidates in other races who also did not win
county support.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he intends to do just that in every county where
Corzine holds the party line. In fact, he conceded Somerset County
-- where Corzine was likely to win anyway -- so that he could run on
the same line as Fanwood Mayor Maryanne Connelly, a candidate for
House who is not supported by party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said Florio is hurting the party by running competing
slates in local races. Murphy replied that Florio has neither
drummed up nor sought out disgruntled Democrats to run with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are people out there who are anti-organization,
and now they've found a home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has not said whether he will field slates of competing
candidates in counties where Florio has the prime ballot spot.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Hold Talks in Ukraine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to encourage economic reform, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright will hold talks in Kiev with Ukrainian
leaders April 20-21 on the way home from a trip to Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It will be her second visit to Ukraine. The first was in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin said Albright would affirm strong U.S.
support for Ukraine's ambitious reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Albright already was scheduled to travel to Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan April 14-20 on her first visit to the
region in more than three years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The region is the target of foreign developers, including
American corporations, trying to get a head start on reserves of
natural gas and other energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the State Department condemned as
''incomprehensible'' the detention in Bishkek, the capital of
Kyrgyzstan, of Daniyar Usenov, a leader of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the person who brought assault charges against Usenov
had withdrawn them but the government still was going ahead with
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the statement called for the release of another prominent
opposition leader, Feliks Kulov of the Ar Namys party.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts High-Tech New Economy  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton heard an earful of worries
Wednesday when he challenged a group of the country's greatest
economic minds to forecast what could derail the current
supercharged economy.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned about
''imbalances'' represented by a dwindling supply of available
workers and a soaring trade deficit. Others fretted that more
stomach-churning days on Wall Street might finally signal an end to
the economic expansion after a record nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The president used a daylong conference in the White House East
Room to examine how to keep the current good economic times going.
As president-elect, the former Arkansas governor relied on the same
format in December 1992 when he summoned top economists to Little
Rock for two days of discussions about how to battle huge budget
deficits and weak job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen joined Microsoft's
Bill Gates, Greenspan and other top economic thinkers on Wednesday
to explore how the U.S. and global economies were being changed by
the so-called New Economy -- the explosion in the use of computers
and other high-tech inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the country's policy wonk-in-chief, expressed regret
after nine hours of discussion on issues ranging from providing
vaccines to Third World nations to the surge in e-commerce sales,
that the conference had to end.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks for staying,'' he told the invited guests who remained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed optimism about the promise that technological
advances offered, not only for the United States but also
impoverished nations bypassed by the current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the computer and the Internet give us a chance to
move more people out of poverty more quickly than at any time in
all of human history,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warmly praised billionaire Bill Gates -- just two days
after his Microsoft Corp. was found guilty of violating federal
antitrust laws -- for the ''phenomenal commitments'' he and his wife
have made in contributing $750 million to combatting global poverty
and health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan defended the Federal Reserve's five interest rate
increases over the past 10 months, saying that imbalances
represented by tight labor markets and the rising trade deficit had
to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has been raising interest rates in an effort to
dampen consumer spending, thus slowing the economy and alleviating
the threat that tight labor markets will trigger inflationary wage
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern is that the huge trade deficits, a further
reflection of strong consumer demand, could become a liability if
foreigners suddenly decide they no longer want to invest in U.S.
assets such as the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The significant uncertainties surrounding these new economic
forces counsel prudence,'' Greenspan said. ''We need to be careful
to keep inflationary pressures contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan used his appearance to address critics who have
charged that the Fed's rate increases were an effort to tame the
''irrational exuberance'' of investors he has worried about from
time to time. He said the central bank had no desire to target
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent volatility in stock prices was a leading
concern at the conference, held the day after both the Dow Jones
industrial average and the technology-heavy Nasdaq index suffered
their biggest one-day swings in history.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's uneasiness lingered Wednesday even though the
swings were far less than dramatic. The Dow fell 130.92 points to
close at 11,033.92 while the Nasdaq composite index managed a 20.45
point gain.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Altman, a former Clinton administration Treasury official
who is now an investment banker in New York, said that he believed
that the stock market was already in a market correction. It was
likely to be a ''sharp one, he said, at least in terms of
technology'' stocks, many of which have soared in price despite an
absence of company profits.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the famously bullish chief investment
strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said she believed ''over
the next period of time, the aggregate rate of return in the market
will decelerate sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   She triggered a market selloff last week when she recommended to
her firm's clients that they reduce their allocations of stock in
favor of holding more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University economics professor William Nordhaus raised
concerns about inflation. ''The speed limit (for economic growth)
has been raised, but there is still a speed limit,'' he said. ''The
betting odds are long against another four years as strong as the
last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   International economist C. Fred Bergsten said he was troubled by
''the huge and growing trade deficit,'' which hit a record high of
$267.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten said the deficit could trigger a panic response in
which foreign investors start fleeing U.S. markets, triggering a
sharp decline in the value of the dollar. ''A sharp decline in the
dollar would push up interest rates and push down the stock
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the participants focused on economic threats. Some
argued that the current good times could continue as long as the
Fed did not overreact and raise interest rates too much in a
pre-emptive strike against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith said that the
big surge in productivity was allowing the economy to expand at a
faster rate with lower unemployment without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why not take the positive view?'' he asked. ''Full employment
and strong growth are great achievements. Let us celebrate and
defend them.''

<HEADLINE> Norway Train Fires Spur Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Fears that burning propane tankers from a
train wreck could explode prompted police on Wednesday to evacuate
more than 2,000 people from the center of a small Norwegian city.
</P>
<P>
   Two freight trains collided and caught fire at about 1 a.m.
Wednesday at the Lillestroem train station, some 10 miles north of
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Both trains involved in the crash had an automatic train stop
system that should have prevented a collision.
</P>
<P>
   However, one train's brakes apparently failed on a downhill
grade into the station, Arne Tordhol, of the national railroad
NSB's freight division, told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the crash, but police evacuated a 800-yard
area around the trains because they feared the cargo of about 90
tons of propane gas in two cars could explode in a devastating
fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Citing experts, newspapers said if the tanks were half-full, an
explosion would last 14 seconds and cause a deadly fireball
extending up to 200 feet around the cars.
</P>
<P>
   It could take days before people would be allowed to return to
the homes, schools, businesses and a medical clinic because fire
experts say gas leaking from one or both cars must be allowed to
slowly burn off.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing that could have happened was that it started to
burn,'' said Tore Dahlbo, of the Norwegian Directorate for Fire and
Explosion Prevention. He said if unburned gas had spread, the
slightest spark could have caused a huge explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Firemen were using a remote-controlled water cannon to pump
thousands of gallons per minute onto the tank cars to cool them
without dousing the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The station where the crash occurred is a key railway crossroad,
so the wreck has stopped service that includes express service from
the capital to Norway's main airport.
</P>
<P>
   The accident came as the country was engaged in an anguished
debate over railroad safely prompted mainly by a crash in January
between two passenger trains that killed 19 people, some of whom
burned alive when a fire swept the wreckage.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Roth Having Back Operation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. William Roth, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, will have back surgery next week to remove bone
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Republican from Delaware stumbled in public at a
recent White House meeting because of numbness in his feet, then
experienced the same sensation on a few other occasions. His
physician, Dr. David Cornblath of the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, said tests revealed that bone spurs on the
senator's spine were the cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Cornblath described the operation as a
''standard procedure'' for ''a common ailment for which hundreds of
thousands of Americans are treated each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation is set for April 12 at Johns Hopkins University
Hospital in Baltimore. A spokeswoman said Roth expects to
recuperate for up to a month, and Cornblath said Roth should
recover completely. Congress will be on a two-week recess during
much of that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am eager to get this behind me so I can return to my work in
the Senate,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who was first elected to the Senate in 1970, is facing a
stiff challenge for re-election this year from Delaware Gov. Tom
Carper, a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Twists, Turns in Mexico Murder Case  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A slain television host with a taste for
cocaine. His ridiculed sidekick. An alleged drug smuggler known as
the Amphetamine King. An aspiring young actress.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after television funnyman Paco Stanley was gunned
down in broad daylight, the already bizarre case has taken even
more twists -- and Mexicans are following every one.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mexico's two national television networks aired
footage of the key witness retracting his testimony, saying
authorities forced him to testify against the three main suspects.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities scoffed at the retraction and said it was a
ploy by the federal government to distract attention from their
attempt to bring corruption charges against a Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, in turn, suggested the city, run by an
opposition party, was using the corruption scandal to discredit the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone was trying to divert attention, they couldn't have
picked a better case than the June 7 killing of Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Television newscasts lead with even the smallest development in
the case. Web pages are dedicated to Stanley, and chat rooms have
sprung up to discuss the case on the Internet. When a radio program
recently asked for opinions on the case, the switchboard lit up
with more than 4,000 calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I watch it every day,'' said Ignacio Arroyo, a 57-year-old
butcher. ''I like to see the officials make a mess of everything.
It gives me insight into how incapable they are in resolving
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stanley was gunned down outside a restaurant in Mexico
City, it was portrayed as an example of the crime wave that has
plagued the largest city in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon became clear this was no common crime. Revelations
of Stanley's cocaine use and links to an alleged smuggler created
speculation about a drug link, and the case exploded with the
spectacular arrest of his television sidekick, who had lingered in
the restaurant's bathroom at the time of the attack, saying his
hemorrhoids were acting up.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Stanley's killing was ordered by alleged drug
smuggler Luiz Amezcua Contreras, whom U.S. and Mexican prosectors
call the Amphetamine King. The case against Amezcua is based
largely on testimony from Luis Gabriel Valencia Lopez, who
authorities say worked as Amezcua's cook.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Amezcua, who is in jail on drug and
money-laundering charges, was angered that Stanley owed him money
for his cocaine habit and recruited Mario Rodriguez Bezares,
Stanley's television sidekick and the butt of most of his jokes, to
help carry it out in exchange for forgiving his own drug debt.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia testified that the intermediary in the plot was Paola
Durante Ochoa, a 23-year-old aspiring actress who worked as an
assistant on Stanley's show.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution's case suffered a blow Monday when Valencia
said that he had lied in his testimony and that the three suspects
he had named all are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lied because they forced me with threats of hurting my
family and with the promise I'd be freed soon and that they'd help
me financially,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City Attorney General Samuel del Villar dismissed the
retraction. He claimed federal officials were trying to divert
public attention from his office's embezzlement investigation into
Tourism Secretary Oscar Espinosa Villarreal.
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo said in letter to the media late last month
that even if there was a case against Espinosa, it would be
lamentable if it was ''electorally motivated.'' Mexicans elect
their next president on July 2 in one of the closest races in
history.

<HEADLINE> Jury chosen for trail of Wall Street executive linked to X-ratedactress  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prospective jurors in the case of a former Wall
Street executive accused of trading stock secrets with an X-rated
movie star faced a tough question themselves Wednesday: Do you have
any opinions about extramarital affairs that could affect your
judgment?
</P>
<P>
   The question was 36th on a list of 42 posed to each potential
juror at the start of the Manhattan trial of James McDermott Jr.,
the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. By
the end of the day, a jury had been chosen in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will hear evidence in this case about an extramarital
affair. Is there anything about extramarital affairs, or a person
who has had one, which might affect your ability to be fair and
impartial, or which might otherwise make it difficult for you to
serve as a juror?''
</P>
<P>
   The first prospective juror to be asked the question publicly
said, ''Extramarital affairs are wrong but not illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the case have not said it was illegal for
McDermott to engage in an affair with Kathryn Gannon, who went by
the name Marylin Star in the adult entertainment business. But they
have alleged in pretrial arguments that his desire to impress
Gannon might have influenced him to feed her inside information
about impending mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, a fugitive in the case, then allegedly gave the tips to
a friend, Anthony P. Pomponio, who is on trial with McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wanted to tell the jury when opening statements
begin Monday about Gannon's career, but Judge Kimba Wood has
decided Gannon will be referred to only as a model, dancer and
actress.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, Pomponio and Gannon are each charged with conspiracy
and securities fraud. Prosecutors allege the trio made more than
$170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, and Pomponio, 45, of North
Caldwell, N.J., remain free on bail. Gannon, 30, formerly of Miami,
Fla., is believed to be living in Canada, and prosecutors are
seeking her extradition.

<HEADLINE> Nader Seeks To Shrink Major Parties  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Consumer activist Ralph Nader scoffed
Wednesday at suggestions that his presidential campaign merely
drains liberal votes from Democrats, saying that shrinking either
major party is ''exactly what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to studies of the 1996 election when he was on the
ballot in California, and said he drew almost as many Republican
voters as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our two parties are basically one corporate party wearing two
heads and different makeup,'' Nader said. ''There is a difference
between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but not that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader was in Iowa to announce his presidential bid as a Green
Party candidate. He made his name as a consumer advocate and his
campaign is a hard-core liberal assault on monied interests and
what he sees as corporate control of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats worry that Nader will pull from liberal voters
who otherwise could be counted on to vote Democratic. Though his
appeal is small, draining a few votes in key competitive states
could make the difference in the race between Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said there's balance in the campaign, with Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan likely to drain votes from Republicans. In
the last election, Nader said about 40 percent of the votes he
received in California came from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he said, it really doesn't matter very much.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are look alike parties,'' Nader said. And if his campaign
causes either party to shrink, ''that's exactly what we want them
to do.''

<HEADLINE> Wife of Bosnian Suspect Appears  </HEADLINE>
By RADUL RADOVANOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The wife of Bosnia's most wanted
war crimes suspect, Radovan Karadzic, appeared Wednesday at a rally
of the hard-line Serb party once led by her husband -- an effort to
boost its chances of a comeback in this weekend's municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 supporters of the Serb Democratic Party stood and
cheered as Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic entered the small, packed hall
in this hard-line Bosnian Serb stronghold east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Party faithful chanted her husband's nickname: ''Rasho, Rasho.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelen-Karadzic's appearance -- her first in years at such a large
public gathering -- came two days after NATO troops arrested her
husband's former aide, Momcilo Krajisnik, on charges of genocide,
crimes against humanity and violating the customs of war.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, who was the Bosnian Serb president and head of the
Serb Democratic Party during the 1992-1995 war, remains at large.
He is rumored to be living in the Serb-ruled part of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the presence of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, Zelen-Karadzic refused to comment on her husband's
whereabouts, but admitted her family was afraid he might be
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance was designed to rally the hard-line party in
advance of Saturday's municipal balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic had to withdraw from politics after he was indicted by
the U.N. war crimes tribunal. He has been charged with crimes
against humanity and genocide for allegedly masterminding the 1995
slaughter of Muslims in the U.N.-protected enclave of Srebrenica in
northeastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic's Serb Democratic Party lost its grip on absolute power
two years ago when some of its prominent members defected and
formed an alliance with moderate opposition parties, which took
half of the seats in the Bosnian Serb parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The party's main opponent in the weekend elections is the
Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik -- blamed by hard-liners
for having steered the Bosnian Serbs toward the West and for
abandoning the goal of an ethnically pure Bosnian Serb mini-state.
</P>
<P>
   An ethnically pure entity goes against the terms of the 1995
Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Republika Srpska, as the Serb entity is known, is politically
divided into the pro-Dodik west, with its headquarters in Banja
Luka, and the nationalist-run east, based in Pale.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect only victory'' for the party, Zelen-Karadzic told
reporters when asked about the coming election.
</P>
<P>
   She described the arrest this week of top war crimes suspect
Momcilo Krajisnik as a ''very bitter'' loss for Pale and the
hard-line faction.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik signed the Dayton deal but afterwards advocated Serb
secession from Bosnia. He was arrested Monday by French
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''A man who signed the Dayton Peace Agreement together with
Clinton was arrested in a way they arrest mafiosi,'' she said.
''But the Americans can only do it that way. But we are decent
people and will wait for the vote and the results will show our
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelen-Karadzic said she was concerned her husband could be the
next arrested. ''But we have confidence in God and we pray,'' she
added.

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Albright Interview  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highlights from Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's interview Wednesday with Associated Press editors and
reporters:
</P>
<P>
   On Elian Gonzalez:
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a terrible, terrible issue. It's a question of a child
needing to be with its natural parent and the desire for that child
to have a good life. It's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   On President Fidel Castro:
</P>
<P>
   ''The question I always have about any of these dictators is are
they really interested in their people.''
</P>
<P>
   On US-Cuban relations:
</P>
<P>
   ''The embargo is the law of the land. We worked hard to put
measures that would provide additional space for the Cuban people.
We had hoped there would be enough of a change in Cuba to make more
changes possible, but that has not been Castro's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   On overtures to Iran:
</P>
<P>
   ''On Iran, my speech stands as the record of where we think
we've been, what our agenda is and where we think we can go in
mutually balanced and small steps...''
</P>
<P>
   On China-Taiwan relations:
</P>
<P>
   ''There needs to be a peaceful dialogue ... This is the only way
this can be resolved. I think we are in a phase where they are
watching each other very carefully. (Taiwanese President-elect Chen
Shui-bian's) language has moderated from the way it was earlier.
... I think that some of the tension has reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   On Chinese threats against Taiwan:
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely don't brush (them) off. Obviously, China is an
increasingly strong and powerful and important country and we watch
very carefully and listen very carefully. But it's important not to
overreact because some of the statements have been made previously.
Our job is to make clear to them -- both actually -- that it's very
important to keep the rhetoric down.
</P>
<P>
   On relations with Congress:
</P>
<P>
   ''The Constitution is set up in such a way that it is an
invitation to struggle because Congress is given ... a lot of power
in terms of trade, and there are more and more economic issues that
are part of foreign policy. They do have increasing power. I think
this is a period where Congress is playing a huge role. I am all
for a very strong role for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   On congressional failure to approve funding for Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been working very hard to try to work with the
Europeans to provide a larger part of what they need in terms of
troops and money and police and all that for Kosovo. At the same
time, I've been dealing with the (congressional funding) problem
... that I do not think has foreign policy roots .. It's very
difficult to press the Europeans to do more if I have to say this
has now been delayed for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mideast peace talks:
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that the Israelis are going to withdraw (from
Lebanon.) It would be much better that that be done within the
context of negotiation ... I think it would be an internationally
legitimatized way of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the difference between Russian President Valdimir Putin and
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin:
</P>
<P>
   ''You have a sense you are getting through a meeting, in
contrast to Yeltsin who made grand statements, then we all worked.
President Yeltsin and President Clinton had a very special
relationship where they kind of looked at the future together.
Putin strikes me as a more pragmatic man who wants to get through a
very serious agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   On Latin American democracy:
</P>
<P>
   ''When I about Latin America in the varying conversations I've
had with Latin Americans and others is there is a sense of the
fragility of democracy in Latin America ... that these countries
have moved into the democratic column but because there has not
been as much work done on some of the social and economic
development issues, there is the question of what is the payoff of
democracy for the people.''

<HEADLINE> Gap Inc. COO Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gap Inc.'s chief operating officer resigned on
Wednesday, the third top executive to leave the giant retail chain
in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of John Wilson's departure came as the company
named a new president of its struggling Gap stores division and
reported disappointing sales for the month of March.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's resignation follows the exodus of Jeanne Jackson, who
left as head of the Banana Republic division in March to head
Wal-Mart.com, and the November departure of Gap stores president
Robert Fisher, the son of the chain's founders.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap said it will not fill the COO position.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Gap is a mature company and total corporate growth may be
at this point considered very limited,'' said Kurt Barnard,
president of the retail consulting firm Barnard's Retail Trend
Report. ''These people are very talented and they see that there
are better opportunities for themselves in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the darling of the retailing world, Gap has been struggling
to find its way over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its namesake Gap stores -- long the anchor and big money maker of
the San Francisco-based Gap Inc. chain -- have been the most
troubled. Many of its shoppers have fled to rival retail chains as
well as its sister division -- Old Navy -- which offers trendier
fashions at cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gap Inc. reported that its sales at stores open at
least a year, an industry gauge of performance, fell 11 percent,
below analysts' expectations. Much of that decline was attributed
to weakness at the Gap stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that the slump in March was due to the fact
that it held fewer sales promotions and there was a shift in the
Easter calendar. Most holiday sales last year took place in March
because Easter fell on April 4, but this year they will be tallied
in April, with the holiday falling on the 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   New Gap division president Ken Pilot will be charged with
stepping up sales in its stores here and abroad. Pilot was formerly
the president of Gap International.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a few other executive changes on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Gust was promoted to executive vice president and chief
administrative officer, responsible for real estate, corporate
communications, global affairs, legal services and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Crovitz was named executive vice president and chief
supply chain officer, while Heidi Kunz will add responsibility for
strategic planning to her title of executive vice president and
chief financial officer.

<HEADLINE> Vanguard 500 Eclipses Magellan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vanguard Group's Index 500 fund apparently
eclipsed Fidelity's flagship Magellan fund as the largest mutual
fund in terms of total assets -- at least temporarily, according to
reports Wednesday from two newsletters that track the funds.
</P>
<P>
   James Lowell, editor of ''Fidelity Investor,'' and Daniel
Wiener, editor of ''Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors,''
claim in their reports that the Vanguard Index fund had $107.2
billion in funds as of Tuesday, compared with $106.9 billion in the
Magellan fund.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the two funds has been watched closely by analysts
because the two represent different investment strategies: low-cost
passive management vs. higher-cost active management.
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost Vanguard fund requires little management because
its goal is simply to mirror the performance of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index. The Magellan fund is actively managed,
usually by well-paid, high-profile fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   The two newsletter editors based their findings on historical
cash flows into the two funds. In addition, the two used stock
market performance through Tuesday to determine each fund's assets,
according to a joint statement issued by the editors.
</P>
<P>
   A Vanguard spokesman said he couldn't confirm that the Index 500
fund had surpassed Magellan in assets. But the spokesman said the
fund had $107.4 billion in assets at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   In statement issued after the reports surfaced, Vanguard
Chairman John Brennan issued a statement saying, in part, ''We are
gratified that our shareholders have embraced indexing as an
investment strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan added that Vanguard believes it's ''irrelevant'' to
focus on the size of a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity officials could not be reached for comment. A phone
call seeking comment was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> More Tests Called for in Nazi Case  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The state prosecutor on Wednesday asked
that an aging doctor accused in the deaths of nine children in a
Nazi-run clinic face new psychiatric tests to determine whether he
is fit to be retried.
</P>
<P>
   The formal request was submitted less than three weeks after Dr.
Heinrich Gross' trial was indefinitely suspended because he was
found to be suffering from dementia. It will likely be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's court session was the third attempt to prosecute
Gross, 84, on charges linked to the deaths of thousands of children
killed by the Nazis because they were deemed physically, mentally
or otherwise unfit for Adolf Hitler's vision of a perfect world.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the suspension March 21 after a
court-appointed psychiatrist testified that Gross' dementia had
worsened since two examinations in 1998. Although the judge had
ordered more tests over the next six months, leaving open the
possibility the trial could resume, it had appeared unlikely that
Gross would ever be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The new tests were requested earlier than expected, however,
after prosecutor Michael Klackl viewed a post-hearing televised
interview that showed Gross alert and able to deal with fairly
complex questions.
</P>
<P>
   Klackl told the Austria Press Agency that he had ''strong
misgivings'' about Gross' inability to stand trial after viewing
the videotape. The agency cited unnamed legal officials as saying
that a Swiss expert witness would probably examine Gross after
criticism that most Austrian psychiatrists were on cordial terms
with him.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Gross became a prominent neurologist, publishing
research based on the preserved brains of children killed by the
Nazis and was himself an expert witness at numerous court hearings
up to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Under Nazi rule, 75,000 people across Europe, including 5,000
children, were murdered for being mentally or physically
handicapped. Children were killed by injection, medical
experimentation or simply starved. The Nazis called them ''unworthy
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross was put on trial twice before, but the case was thrown out
in 1950 because of legal technicalities and again in the 1980s
because the 30-year statute of limitations on manslaughter had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors filed a new set of charges, accusing him of
complicity to murder in the cases of nine children who allegedly
died as a result of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Gross pleaded innocent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-American's Release Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli Supreme Court on Wednesday
postponed the early release of an Israeli-American serving a life
sentence for killing a Palestinian in retaliation for the stabbing
of an Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   Yoram Skolnick, a Jewish settler from an area near the West Bank
city of Hebron, was to have been released Friday after serving
seven years in prison, according to a parole board ruling last
month. President Ezer Weizman had already reduced his sentence to
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Skolnick shot Moussa Abu Sabha nine times as he lay on
the ground, his hands tied behind his back, unarmed and
blindfolded. Abu Sabha had stabbed and injured a Jewish settler
moments earlier. Skolnick maintained he thought Abu Sabha had a
grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Left-wing lawmaker Zehava Galon petitioned the Supreme Court to
overturn the parole board's decision, which was denounced by peace
activists. Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein also issued a legal
opinion saying Skolnick, 31, had not grasped the severity of his
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick told reporters before the hearing that he regretted his
action, which he called ''a one-time act, something that took one
second.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to three hours of arguments from both sides, a
seven-judge panel decided to postpone its ruling, and issued a
temporary restraining order against Skolnick's release until it
rules. It did not say when that would be.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist lawmaker Benny Elon, who petitioned the court to
permit the early release, argued that it was unfair to release
Palestinian militants who have harmed Israelis as part of a peace
agreement with the Palestinian Authority and not release Jews who
have harmed Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman said Wednesday that Israel's release of Palestinian
militants prompted him to reduce Skolnick's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has released hundreds of Palestinians who injured
Israelis in attacks before peace accords were signed, but has
refused to negotiate the release of Palestinians who killed
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick was born in Israel and has U.S. citizenship through his
parents, who immigrated to Israel from New York in 1963.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prospective jurors in the case of a former Wall
Street executive accused of trading stock secrets with an X-rated
movie star faced a tough question themselves Wednesday: Do you have
any opinions about extramarital affairs that could affect your
judgment?
</P>
<P>
   The question was 36th on a list of 42 posed to each potential

the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. By
the end of the day, a jury had been chosen in U.S. District Court.

   ''You will hear evidence in this case about an extramarital

   The first prospective juror to be asked the question publicly

   Prosecutors in the case have not said it was illegal for

Caldwell, N.J., remain free on bail. Gannon, 30, formerly of Miami,
Fla., is believed to be living in Canada, and prosecutors are
seeking her extradition.

<HEADLINE> Joe D items strike out at auction  </HEADLINE>
By MARV SCHNEIDER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe it was the shaky stock market. Maybe there
is a glut of Joe DiMaggio memorabilia. Or maybe the items were
simply priced too high.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe DiMaggio mementos struck out Wednesday at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The prize of the 96 pieces at auction was a New York Yankees'
jersey worn by DiMaggio in his final game, in the 1951 World
Series. It was expected to bring between $150,000 and $300,000. But
when the top bid of $100,000 was $20,000 shy of the minimum, the
jersey was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the DiMaggio memorabilia failed to meet the
minimum price, forcing auctioneer Nick MacLean to declare the items
''passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the DiMaggio mementos were among the top 10 items to
go.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of boxing shoes worn by Muhammad Ali in 1972 fights
headed the list at $25,850. Next, at $17,625, was a pocket watch
presented to Honus Wagner by Pittsburgh Pirates fans. Then came a
baseball autographed by Babe Ruth, which sold for $14,688.
</P>
<P>
   The only two DiMaggio items among the top 10 were his 1986
Florida driver's license, signed Joe Paul DiMaggio, which went for
$11,750, and a glove, which drew $11,162.
</P>
<P>
   But bidders passed on such items as a Florida license plate that
read ''DiMag5'' and signed ''with best wishes'' by DiMaggio; a golf
cart given to the Yankee Clipper by his lawyer and longtime friend,
Morris Engelberg; DiMaggio's passport; and scores of autographed
photographs and lithographs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am shocked and disappointed,'' said Engelberg, who couldn't
explain the collection's failure to sell better.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested a possibility: Christie's decision to auction
DiMaggio's items last -- after Ali's shoes, Wagner's watch and other
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ''By then, the bidders were out of money,'' Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   John Martino, Christie's sports memorabilia specialist, disputed
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually save our star attraction for last,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably estimated DiMaggio items a little bit too
aggressively,'' said Martino, who acknowledged he was guided by his
feeling that the Yankees' Hall of Famer was ''probably the last
American icon in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the non-DiMaggio items that failed to sell was an
artificial leg used by Monte Stratton, who pitched for the Chicago
White Sox in the 1930s and lost his leg in a hunting accident.
</P>
<P>
   Martino thought a lack of precise documentation kept bids for
the prosthesis under the $3,000 minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought a collector would want it for a private
collection,'' Martino said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the DiMaggio items were supplied by Engelberg, who was
the player's confidant and neighbor for 16 years. Some were offered
for sale by people who worked for DiMaggio or befriended him.
</P>
<P>
   The 1951 jersey was offered a woman who worked in DiMaggio's
home. She found it in a supermarket shopping bag under DiMaggio's
bed after his death in March 1999 at 84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio had given the jersey to a New York detective and the
officer's family returned it when the policeman died.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will go back to the woman who owned it,'' said Engelberg,
who declined to identify her.

<HEADLINE> Waco Case Judge Asked to Nix Claims  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is asking the judge
presiding over the Branch Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit to
throw out most of the plaintiffs' claims, among them that the
government bears responsibility for the fire that incinerated the
sect's retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Admissible evidence amply supports a finding that the
Davidians themselves -- at least some of them -- started the fire
intentionally,'' government lawyers said in a motion to be filed in
federal court in Waco, Texas. The plaintiffs' own fire expert
''cannot determine who started the fire,'' according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   The government is asking U.S. District Judge Walter Smith to
throw out three major aspects of the civil lawsuit -- that federal
agents erred in not bringing in armored firefighting equipment;
that they wrongly held back firefighters as the compound burned;
and that the use of tanks to push into the compound deviated from
the operations plan approved by Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   If the government prevails, the plaintiffs would have only two
areas left to pursue at trial: whether federal agents used
excessive force during the Feb. 28, 1993, gun battle that prompted
the seven-week standoff and by firing into the Mount Carmel
compound on the siege's final, deadly day. Federal officials have
long insisted that no shots were fired by its agents on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's on-scene commanders, Special Agent Jeffrey Jamar and
Hostage Rescue Team leader Richard Rogers, acted within their
authority, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lead counsel, Michael Caddell, said the Justice
Department is overreaching in its interpretation that all of the
decision-making that occurred during the siege falls within the
commanders' discretionary authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were decisions made at the highest levels of the FBI
leadership which were either violated or not followed ... by the
on-scene commanders,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 Davidians died during the fire that swept through
their wooden building several hours into an FBI tear-gassing
operation designed to end the standoff. Most died of smoke
inhalation or burns, some from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have long insisted the Davidians died by their
own hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department motion includes the transcript of a
two-hour deposition Reno gave last week. She denied any deviation
from the plan by Jamar or Rogers and rejected the plaintiffs'
contention that the on-scene commanders ordered the compound
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Reno acknowledged not giving permission for use of pyrotechnic
tear gas rounds. It was the FBI's belated admission last August
that potentially incendiary tear gas canisters were used that
prompted congressional investigations and Reno's appointment of a
special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript suggests the deposition, marked by frequent
objections by Reno's lawyers, was testy at times.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly exasperated after asking Reno the same question several
times, Caddell told her: ''You grew up in America, correct? You
have used the English language all your life?''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Reno: ''If you will just ask it to me again, maybe I can
try to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial on the lawsuit is to begin June 19.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Sets Cap on Tobacco Damage Bond  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina, the nation's No. 1 tobacco
producer, swiftly passed a law Wednesday to shield the state's
cigarette makers from what could be a crippling verdict in a
smoking case under way in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-day special session convened specifically to consider
the bill, the Legislature took just four hours to pass the measure
by an overwhelming vote. Less than an hour later, Gov. Jim Hunt
signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
   The law sets a cap of $25 million on the amount a company has to
post as bond while appealing a punitive-damage verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Carolina has been well-served by tobacco,'' said Sen.
Ham Horton. ''A six-person jury in Florida is on the verge of
bringing a gigantic industry to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Miami is considering how much compensatory damages to
award three plaintiffs in a class-action case involving 500,000
sick Florida smokers. The jury will then decide whether to award
punitive damages to all of the smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has said it fears the jury could come back with a
punitive-damage verdict of $300 billion that could wreck the
tobacco companies. Under Florida law, a defendant must post a bond
equal to the damages levied while appealing a case.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is the home of three of the defendants in the
Florida case: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Liggett Group and
Lorillard Tobacco Co. Tobacco brings in $1 billion for North
Carolina's farmers, and 114,000 people work in tobacco-related
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill will help ensure that the tobacco industry, or any
other industry that might find itself in similar circumstances in
the future, will receive due process under the law,'' said R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia have quickly approved
laws limiting the bond cigarette companies would have to post.
Virginia and Georgia approved a $25 million limit; Kentucky set it
at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Senate approved the $25 million limit 48-2;
the House passed it 114-1.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina politicians argued that the law is necessary not
just to preserve the cigarette makers but to keep annual payments
coming from the $246 billion settlement between the tobacco
industry and the states.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have suggested that such laws violate the
clause in the U.S. Constitution requiring that states recognize
each other's court proceedings.

<HEADLINE> New York ready to reimburse New Jersey commuters  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey commuters will have to wait a
little longer for the jackpot awarded them by New York's high
court, which earlier this week deemed that state's commuter tax
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   New York state tax officials will launch a massive public
information campaign designed to spread the word about the commuter
tax rebate once the New York Court of Appeals formally enters its
ruling, Department of Taxation and Finance spokesman Marc Carey,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carey could not say when that will happen, but said the state
has asked the court to do so quickly so that taxpayers can be ready
by the looming tax filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   About 240,000 Garden State residents who commute to New York
City are owed more than $80 million, the amount they paid since New
Jersey sued on the grounds that the tax was discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The New York court agreed, saying Tuesday that the state cannot
impose the tax on non-New York residents alone.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the court cooperates with the timing, taxpayers will be
able to recoup 1999 payments by filing or amending their tax
returns due April 17. The deadline is later this year because April
15 falls on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For commuter taxes paid this year, taxpayers will be able to
fill out a special form and send it to New York authorities this
year instead of waiting until the 2001 filing deadline, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Carey said the plan is waiting the court's final action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the forms, we have the mailings ready to go,'' he
said. ''All we have to do is back up the truck and take them to the
post office which we can do within hours of the order being
signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The public information campaign will involve mailing notices to
370,000 commuters as well as accountants and lawyer to let them
know about the program, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   New York also has a telephone hotline, 1-800-CALLTAX, and a Web
site, www.tax.state.ny.us, that taxpayers can use to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   New York authorities will also mail out notices to city
employers telling them to halt commuter tax withholding, Carey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling means out-of-state commuters, including those
from Connecticut and other states, are eligible to receive about
$105 million in refunds, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the decision was delivered, Gov. Christie
Whitman sent a letter to Gov. George Pataki, asking him to take
steps to return money that had been collected from Garden State
residents since New Jersey took the matter to court in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Prof. Fired After Holocaust Book  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A Polish history professor was fired by
his university Wednesday and banned from teaching elsewhere for
publishing a book suggesting Nazi Germany did not have a
comprehensive plan for exterminating Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run University of Opole announced that Dariusz
Ratajczak, 37, had violated ethical standards and would be banned
from teaching at other universities for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak had been suspended from his post in Opole last year
after prosecutors opened an investigation into the publication of
his book, ''Dangerous Themes,'' which includes an assertion that
gas chambers at Nazi death camps were intended to kill lice on
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's decision by the university's disciplinary
committee, Ratajczak charged the panel did not consider his
explanations and said he would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was only presenting various views on the Holocaust to
students,'' he told The Associated Press by telephone from Opole,
some 190 miles southwest of Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Opole in December found Ratjaczak guilty of spreading
revisionist views on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not punish him, saying the book's limited
distribution was not damaging enough to warrant punishment under a
Polish law which makes it a crime to publicly deny Nazi and
communist-era crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said Ratajczak had distanced himself from
revisionist views in a preface to the second edition of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak argued that he had merely summarized opinions of
historians who deny the Holocaust and that his own views are not in
line with all the opinions in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak published 320 copies of the book in March 1999 at his
own expense. Five were sold at the university bookstore, and the
rest were sold directly to Ratajczak's students or given away to
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The book says 3 million Jews died in the Holocaust -- not 6
million as almost all historians say -- and that the Nazis had no
uniform plan to exterminate Jews.
</P>
<P>
   According to excerpts reprinted in newspapers, the book calls
testimony from witnesses ''useless'' and describes researchers of
Nazi crimes as ''followers of the religion of Holocaust'' who
impose on others ''a false image of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Ratjaczak financed a second edition of 30,000
copies offered in kiosks and by mail order across Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, a small firm in Warsaw, censored the most extreme
statements, placing them in notes at the book's end. A few thousand
copies have sold, Ratajczak said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Courting Hispanics With New Ad  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going after the traditionally Democratic
Hispanic vote, Republicans are airing a Spanish-language TV ad in
California that asks voters to at least consider the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year I plan to keep an open mind and vote for the best
person, and that includes Republicans,'' Christina Bustos, a Latina
from Los Angeles says in the ad, which is also airing in English.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is spending $125,000 to test
the ad in the Fresno, Calif., area and plans to take it national if
it proves effective. This year, the party plans to spend $7 million
to $10 million on a media campaign reaching out to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno, with a sizable Hispanic population, is located in
central California in the heart of the state's richest agricultural
area. The ads there will run enough times so that the average TV
viewer will see them 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   As the fastest growing ethnic group in America, Hispanics are
being courted by both Democrats and Republicans. Historically,
Democrats have had the advantage, and the GOP wasn't helped in
California by pushing Proposition 187, an effort to deny government
services to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide Republican candidates were getting around 40 percent
of the Latino vote in California before that battle and are now
getting 20 to 25 percent, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an ebb and flow in politics,'' Republican national
chairman Jim Nicholson told reporters in Sacramento, Calif.
''That's the past. Whatever that was is the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats noted that while the GOP is airing in an effort to
attract Hispanics, former California Gov. Pete Wilson, a supporter
of George W. Bush, has raised money for a group that is running ads
criticizing Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Republicans want to attract more Hispanic voters,
they'll have to change their policies to reflect what our community
believes in,'' said Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California, general
co-chair of the Democratic National Committee. ''The discriminatory
policies that the Republican party and people like Pete Wilson
advocate have sent a loud and clear message to Latinos across the
country that unlike Democrats, there is no room for us in their
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans think they have a new opportunity to attract
Hispanics this year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. Bush, who speaks Spanish, attracted as much as half
the Hispanic vote during his 1998 re-election victory, and Bush has
rejected anti-immigration views that marked the California debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't that much difference between Latinos and
Republicans. We share the same core values,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   The new ads open with images of modern downtown Los Angeles
skyscrapers, then a Latino neighborhood market. The pictures move
to shots of family scenes and suburban streets as Bustos describes
the progress of her family from Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents were dreamers. They came to Los Angeles from Mexico
wanting a better future. They learned the language, worked hard and
raised a family,'' Bustos says.
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that she will consider Republicans because ''now,
it's our time to dream.''

<HEADLINE> UN May Have To Close Haiti Mission  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
Wednesday that a new U.N. mission to help promote human rights and
organize elections in Haiti may have to close because the United
States hasn't kept its promise to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the General Assembly president, Annan said the
civilian mission, started March 16 to help bring development and
democracy to Haiti, has been unable to do its job because it didn't
have enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Annan suggested the 188 U.N. members may want to transfer the
mission's duties to the U.N. Development Program, which already
runs democratic governance, poverty and environmental programs in
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said the secretary-general's
message was that ''we should be prepared for a worst-case scenario
if the funding doesn't come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's deputy U.N. Ambassador Michel Duval said canceling the
mission would be ''pretty unwelcome at this stage because of
developments in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 violent incidents have occurred since October. Haiti
has no parliament at present, local and legislative elections have
been postponed three times, and Haitian President Rene Preval has
failed to set a date for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.N. operation, also charged with helping to reform the
justice system, replaced a three-year mission to train Haiti's
national police force. The Haitian force was established in 1995 to
replace a corrupt army that killed as many as 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly set a budget of nearly $24 million budget
for the mission's first year; the U.N. was to contribute $9.2
million and $14.7 million was to come from contributions, primarily
by the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said the only money that's been received so far is an
initial $600,000 contribution from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to transfer some $7.5 million
in money that wasn't used in earlier Haiti programs and is
currently held in U.N. trust funds. But it is unclear whether the
U.S. Congress needs to approve the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ''the
United States remains committed to providing its voluntary
contributions to the U.N. for the new Haiti mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to consult with Congress in order to make these
funds available as soon as possible,'' the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan noted in the letter that the U.N. has increasingly
authorized missions and programs without providing the necessary
funds. Two major U.N. peacekeeping operations -- in Kosovo and East
Timor -- are consistently running out of money.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs TV Marriage Annulment  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A judge annulled the made-for-TV marriage of
millionaire Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger, who testified Wednesday
she wasn't told about her groom's background before their on-air
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, 42, selected Conger, 34, from among 50 contestants on
the Fox TV show ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' They
married on the spot and left for a Caribbean honeymoon cruise --
during which they barely saw each other.
</P>
<P>
   Despite smash ratings, Fox canceled a rebroadcast of the show
after it was disclosed that a former fiancee obtained a restraining
order against Rockwell in 1991, saying he hit and threatened her.
He denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was not honest and did not represent those restraining
orders,'' Conger told Family Court Judge Steven E. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell did not appear in court and no lawyer appeared for him.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he said: ''I'm kind of disappointed that the
annulment is final because for a while I was the only man in the
world who could meet a woman and tell her, 'My wife doesn't
understand and we're splitting up,' and she would actually believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones could have granted the annulment based simply on Conger's
March 7 written request, but said he called the hearing because
Conger entered into a ''very legal wedding ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Conger's attorney, John Hanover, told the judge that the
marriage was a fraud and that Conger and Rockwell had signed an
agreement before the Feb. 15 broadcast saying they could annul the
marriage at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court and once more a free woman, Conger said she never
plans to talk to Rockwell again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to learn from this and move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked if she planned to marry again, Conger
quipped: ''Is that a proposal?''

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Shift Sienna Production  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, Ind. (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. will shift production
of its Sienna minivan from Georgetown, Ky., to this southwestern
Indiana city in 2003, company officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota also announced Wednesday that its factory in Cambridge,
Ontario, will start producing the Lexus RX 300 sport utility
vehicle in 2003. Employment at the plant 80 miles west of Toronto
is expected to increase from 2,700 to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario plant already builds the Corolla and the Solara, so
to make room for the RX 300, production of the Solara will be moved
to Georgetown that year.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota announced in December that it would spend $800 million to
expand the Indiana plant to accommodate production of a third
vehicle. Toyota already has invested $1.2 billion in the plant,
which now makes the Tundra pickup truck and will begin producing a
new sport utility vehicle, the Sequoia, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will increase the plant's work force by 2,000,
bringing total employment there to 4,300. It will also double
annual production capacity to 300,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The move won't affect the number of jobs at the Kentucky plant
because it will begin building the Camry Solara, said Michael Goss,
a spokesman for the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana Inc. plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky plant, which has a production capacity of about
500,000 vehicles per year, also will continue to manufacture the
Camry and the Avalon, which share the same platform as the Solara.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will really enable them to maximize their production
efficiencies there,'' said Barbara McDaniel, a spokeswoman for
Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The RX 300 will be the first Lexus vehicle manufactured outside
of Japan, McDaniel said. It will be the ninth Toyota model built in
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will boost the automaker's total North American
annual production capacity from 1.25 million vehicles to 1.45
million vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Brit Trying To Run Around The World  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- He dodged bullets in Russia, got
robbed in Brazil, collapsed from heat exhaustion in Australia and
went to jail in China.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped Robert Garside, a 33-year-old former
psychology student from Britain, from chasing his goal of becoming
the first person to run the length of the Earth's seven continents.
</P>
<P>
   Garside, who calls himself The Running Man on his Web site, has
already run across Australia, Asia, Europe and South America in a
three-year journey that has taken him more than 20,000 miles and
earned him the world record in long-distance running.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very powerful, very personal,'' Garside said in an
interview after arriving in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas -- on
the northern tip of South America -- following an 11-month
transcontinental run that began in Punta Arenas, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a while you can get into your thoughts and relax and
forget that you're running,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To complete his goal within two years, Garside must still run
across North America, Africa and Antarctica, where it's far from
clear how he'll be able to traverse 3,500 miles of icy, uninhabited
land mass in sub zero temperatures, all the while maintaining an
average speed of at least 6 mph to avoid being classified as a
walker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine a 6-foot-long aerodynamic fiberglass egg on skis,''
he said of an as yet uninvented, solar-heated contraption he plans
to sleep in during his run across Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets to California, hopefully by July, he said he
expects thousands of people to join him in his run across the
United States -- a spectacle that conjures up images of the
fictional character Forrest Gump.
</P>
<P>
   But first he must cross Colombia en route to Central America and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is where a Russian cyclist on a similar mission was
murdered four years ago, and where leftist guerrillas, right-wing
death squads and drug runners rule large swaths of territory.
</P>
<P>
   A Colombian friend arranged for Garside to meet guerrilla
leaders and the Colombian ambassador in Caracas on Wednesday in an
effort to secure safe passage through Colombia, Garside said. He
hoped to meet Colombian guerrilla leaders in Caracas Wednesday, but
that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   However, Garside said his friend spoke by telephone with
representatives of the Colombia's National Liberation Army who
offered safety guarantees, but said they could not speak for the
country's largest rebel outfit, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''My message to the Colombian powers is that I am just a runner
wishing to run north,'' Garside posted on his Web site on Tuesday.
''I am not a preacher of peace, nor religious or political in any
way. I am running around the world and will mind my own business.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be Garside's first brush with danger. He said he
''ran for his life'' when he was shot at three times by bandits in
Russia, and that Chinese police convinced he was a spy nabbed him
and threw him in jail for five days.
</P>
<P>
   ''A huge mass of wriggling maggots were spilling over the
sides,'' Garside wrote of the urinal in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   But the dangers can seem mild compared to the loneliness, he
said. He's left behind girlfriends all over the world, including
three women in Brazil who proposed marriage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he set off from London's Piccadilly Circus of Dec. 7, 1996,
Garside says most of his friends and family thought he was crazy.
But the Running Man says he merely wants a little adventure, and
''maybe even to make a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to do something different. I'm a very normal
person,'' he said, adding that 30 percent of the proceeds he plans
to earn from three book projects and a planned sportswear line will
go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   When he started out, he had virtually no money -- in Nepal he
slept on prison floors because he couldn't afford a hotel -- but his
fortunes changed recently when a donor in Hong Kong agreed to back
his project for a percentage of any future profits.
</P>
<P>
   That donor recently persuaded a friend to put another $150,000
into the project, Garside said.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas this week, Garside bought a change of clothes (he
runs with only one) and a video camera to film himself every 90
minutes or so to prove he's actually running. He's also collecting
witness statements along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Garside broke the world long-distance running record in
September 1998 in Australia, where he eclipsed the old mark of
11,134 miles, held by American Sarah Lovington-Fulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a 15-pound backpack, Garside runs to the music of
Pavarotti, Beethoven, Dire Straits and Enya. He takes breaks when
he gets to big cities, he said, but spends an average of eight
hours a day on the road -- counting rest stops, witness interviews
and filming time -- and covers about 40 miles.

<HEADLINE> Nike Sued Over Shoelace  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Manhattan orthopedic surgeon sued Nike Inc. on
Wednesday for $10 million, saying shoes made by the athletic
footwear giant tripped her and caused permanent injury.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deborah A. Faryniarz filed the lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, alleging she sustained serious and permanent
injuries when she fell last April 8 while jogging.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the right shoelace hooked around the
back tab of the left sneaker, spilling her onto her wrists and
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney James P. Kreindler, who filed the lawsuit on
Faryniarz's behalf, said the fall severely injured the doctor's
right wrist several days before she was to begin performing wrist
surgeries as part of her residency. She also was pregnant with her
first child at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''She ended up with her professor being her treating physician
as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her child was born healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the injury, Faryniarz has continued to perform surgeries,
but has had to ask others to help her twist screws and do other
surgical chores that require mobility in her injured wrist,
Kreindler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's still working as a doctor, pursuing her career, but
she's had kind of a tough time of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Nike knew before Faryniarz was injured
that the Nike Certitude Cross-trainer sneakers were hazardous but
failed to fix the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   It said Nike was negligent for carelessly designing,
manufacturing, assembling, inspecting, testing and distributing the
sneakers and for failing to warn they were hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl McCants, a spokeswoman for Nike in Beaverton, Ore., said
the company was not ready to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't even seen a copy of the complaint yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not recall reports of serious problems with
Nike sneakers but observed, ''In general, people have problems and
sometimes don't tie their shoes properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged Faryniarz has suffered permanent physical
disfigurement and disabilities with ''far reaching effects on all
aspects of her personal and professional life as well as great
pain, suffering and mental anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks $10 million in damages for past and future
medical expenses, pain and suffering and the loss of past and
future earnings and earning capacity.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Lawmakers Asked to OK Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Reeling from recent corruption charges,
Colombia's lawmakers were asked Wednesday to approve a referendum
inviting voters to throw them out of office before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana formally submitted the ballot
initiative he announced last week to battle what he termed the
''dark cancer'' of graft in the South American nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our political system is rotten,'' Pastrana stated bluntly in a
televised speech Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have until June to either approve or reject the
referendum, floated following revelations of alleged fraud and
favoritism in some $2.7 million in contracts handed out by Congress
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two top congressional staffers are under arrest in the scandal,
and three senior lawmakers have resigned from leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal was only the latest in the country where corruption
allegations surface almost daily and at all levels of government.
Leftist guerrillas regularly cite corruption as one of the
justifications for their decades-old war.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show heavy popular support for the referendum, and
political observers expect besieged lawmakers to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Pastrana is unfairly singling out the legislature --
where the opposition Liberal Party has nearly two-thirds of the
seats -- when graft is also rampant in the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Voters could dictate constitutional changes including: cutting
the number of legislators from 263 to 173; forbidding persons
convicted of corruption from holding public office; reforming
campaign-finance laws to reduce the influence of special interests.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Cole Campbell resigned Wednesday as editor of
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to become a fellow at the Poynter
Institute of Media Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, 46, has been editor since October 1996. He came to the
Post-Dispatch from The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the newspaper changed its graphic design,
launched three new zoned editions and created the ''Imagine St.
Louis'' section.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Dispatch, flagship of Pulitzer Inc., became an
independent, publicly traded company in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Terry Egger said Campbell ''made significant
contributions when we were rudderless as a company. His work and
leadership in developing a strategic plan for this company was
outstanding and will benefit this company for a long time to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell will join Poynter, a journalism education center and
think tank, on May 1.

<HEADLINE> GOP Blocks Drug Coverage Amendment  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans rebuffed Democratic efforts
Wednesday to bolster prescription drug coverage and schools at the
expense of tax cuts in votes underlining each party's election-year
effort to embarrass the other.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate debated the Republicans' $1.83 trillion budget for
next year, lawmakers rejected an amendment that would have erected
procedural hurdles to senators even voting on the GOP's coveted tax
cuts unless prescription drug coverage is enacted first.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Senate killed another Democratic provision that
would have shrunk the GOP's proposed $150 billion tax cut over the
next five years by $28 billion and used it to boost spending for
schools. Only Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., crossed party lines as
the measure was defeated 54-46.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were hoping that even in defeat, the votes would let
them grab the political high-ground on a pair of issues that are
widely popular with voters. Their goal was to cast Republicans as
more covetous of tax cuts than of helping senior citizens or
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no guarantee'' in the GOP-budget that ''you are ever,
ever, ever'' going to push prescription drug legislation through
Congress, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., told Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted that with budget language ordering congressional
committees to write a tax-cutting package later this year, saying,
''Why is it there's absolute certainty for tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fired back that there was enough room in the budget
to both cut taxes and extend Medicare coverage to prescriptions.
And they said that before adding another benefit to the
health-insurance program for the elderly, lawmakers should secure
its solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is deceptive, it is not right'' to do otherwise, said Sen.
Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ''Seniors deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also defeated a pair of amendments -- one by
Democrats, the other by conservatives -- that would have sharply
increased the money set aside for debt reduction at the expense of
the tax cuts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The budget sets tax and spending totals but leaves details for
later legislation. The House approved a similar spending plan on
March 24. President Clinton's signature is not required.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget would set aside up to $40 billion for a new
Medicare drug benefit if one is created. Though they have yet to
write specific legislation, Republicans would bar coverage for
higher-income people while President Clinton and Democrats prefer
universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-49 for the prescription drug provision. But it
died because under a GOP parliamentary move, it needed 60 votes to
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how thoroughly politics pervaded the debate,
Democrats let the amendment be sponsored by Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., who faces perhaps the toughest re-election fight of any
Democratic incumbent this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And of the six Republicans who voted for Robb's proposal, four
face the voters this fall: Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Conrad
Burns of Montana, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Mike DeWine of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The other two Republicans voting ''yes'' were Sens. Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget proposes spending $68.6 billion for education
next year, $6.7 billion more than this year and $500 million less
than Clinton wants.

<HEADLINE> Arnn Named Hillsdale College Head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSDALE, Mich. (AP) -- Trustees at conservative Hillsdale
College on Wednesday named the president of a California think tank
as the school's new president.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Arnn replaces George Roche III, who abruptly retired in
November amid allegations he had a lengthy affair with his
daughter-in-law, Lissa Roche. She had committed suicide in October.
</P>
<P>
   Arnn, an outspoken critic of affirmative action who leads the
Claremont Institute in Claremont, Calif., was chosen unanimously by
the school's 35-member board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ''He brings loads to Hillsdale College. He has terrific skills,
all of the skills that will help Hillsdale move forward smartly,''
said William Brodbeck, who led the presidential search committee.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Roche transformed Hillsdale from a
little-known college to a beacon of the conservative movement. The
college gained national attention for refusing to accept any
federal aid so it wouldn't have to comply with federal regulations,
including affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But Roche stepped down abruptly after allegations surfaced about
the alleged 19-year affair with Lissa Roche, who was 41 when she
died Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Arnn, who is expected to take over duties at Hillsdale in June,
has led the Claremont Institute since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken critic of affirmative action, he was the founding
chairman of Proposition 209, a successful 1996 ballot initiative
that banned affirmative action in California. He also is a member
of the Congressional Policy Advisory Board, which helps decide
policy for Republicans in the U.S. House.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Arms Store To Warn New Yorkers  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Florida-based weapons store will
warn customers in New York that some of its products are illegal
there after a 13-year-old boy obtained deadly weapons from the
company's Web site, the New York attorney general said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy used a parent's credit card to obtain weapons that are
illegal in New York from Family Defense Products Inc. of Ocala,
Fla., said Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The stun guns,
switchblades, blackjacks and eight-pointed martial arts stars the
boy purchased were seized by authorities after the boy's parents
intercepted the items.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer described the boy as emotionally disturbed but would not
give details and would not comment on whether he made threats or
why he bought the weapons. Because his parents immediately
contacted authorities, the boy will not face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that a 13-year-old could go online and get all
these weapons, the very weapons that we see kids bringing into
schools and causing such horrendous incidents, is what really
concerns us,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Family Defense's owners claimed to be unaware of
New York's laws. A woman who answered the phone for the company
Wednesday refused to give her name and said the owners were out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the company's Web site will say that it
will not sell illegal weapons to New Yorkers. The company will also
warn past customers that they might be subject to arrest.

<HEADLINE> Joke controversy, reaction to 'threat' test newcomer's politicalskills  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- ''I know politics can be tough. I do know
how to take a punch. But sometimes people go too far during
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine
firmly denounced a man who had left a testy phone message with a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This, combined with a second phone call in which the man was
rude to his wife, prompted Corzine to assemble the New York
television media in Newark this week to share his outrage over what
he proclaimed to be the dirtiest form of gutter politics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., joined Corzine, though he
continues to insist that he is neutral in his primary contest with
former Gov. Jim Florio. Torricelli said he attended only to
sympathize with Corzine and to hope for the day when such horror
tactics will be banished from New Jersey politics.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit behind all this was one Michael Cino, an officer in
the Columbus Coalition, an Italian-America political group.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Corzine said Cino called her at home and threatened to
expose ''dirt'' if Corzine did not agree to have a meeting. Corzine
says Cino had wanted a job with the campaign, which has turned
heads by paying $20,000-a-month salaries to a whole team of
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no meeting, not today, not ever,'' Corzine said
as a room full of reporters began to question the candidate openly
about whether this alleged offense was worth so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Cino has not returned several telephone messages this week from
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The event marked a strange week in a state where strange
politics is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   -- The news breaks that an Italian-American anti-defamation group
has evidence that Corzine insulted Italians at two meetings,
greeting one businessman with, ''Oh, you make cement shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Corzine announces a half-denial: ''I shouldn't have said what
I am reported to have said, and if I did, I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent revisions include: ''I am not trying to deny that
I said or didn't say anything. I don't remember what I said,'' and,
''If I offended, I apologize, and that is where I want to leave
this because I can't deny or confirm the kind of language that was
used in a conversation (nine months ago).''
</P>
<P>
   -- Corzine holds another news conference to decry Cino as a
midnight blackmailer evidently because he was threatening to make
public another Italian joke Corzine may or may not have said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   At issue here is how Corzine reacts, how he copes with pressure
from the news media and how he handles mistakes that all human
beings make.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have spent millions trying to craft a careful image here
of a rags to riches guy who became a world-class business leader,''
said David Rebovich, a political analyst at Rider University. ''He
is trying to show himself as a serious businessman who knows how
the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebovich said Corzine fraying under stress suggests ''the
tenuousness of the image that his campaign has crafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebovich said the blackmail allegations against Cino, who has
proclaimed innocence, fed the stereotype. ''All this does is
perpetuate the Italian-American issue. Now the mob is chasing me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent political analyst Jim McQueeny said the news
conference this week to repeat the apology and to demonize an
insignificant figure was an astonishing mistake. ''Everybody who
sees this sees weakness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McQueeny also said this was not the right moment to have
Torricelli rally to his side with an in-person endorsement. ''Bob's
appearance at that press conference made Corzine look like even
more of a victim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Corzine's candidacy is really damaged. The events of
the past week are too minor and too early. Manny Alfano, the head
of the group that disclosed the jokes, said Corzine apologized, and
that is good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''A huge reality about the Corzine campaign, when it is factored
in, is that when he makes mistakes, he has a $10 million eraser on
the end of that pencil,'' McQueeny said.
</P>
<P>
   But McQueeny said political skills are required for political
victory, and in the past week Corzine has not displayed skill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is the allure of saying you are the non-politician. So
many have taken that and cloaked themselves with it. So many of
them take that with them into oblivion,'' he said. ''That is a
problem. He is not enough of a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine wants to avoid a fistfight with Florio but Rebovich said
mistakes like this make the street brawl harder to avoid. ''Jon
Corzine may have to mix it up a little more on Jim Florio's terms,
and go beyond his general and generous campaign ad that says I am
for everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next trap for Corzine is openly set.
</P>
<P>
   The Florio campaign intends to hammer Corzine for his
association with Goldman Sachs. Corzine has used his chairmanship
of the investment firm as a feather in his political cap, boasting
of his role there in creating ''700,000 New Jersey company jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   When the question was asked whether it would be fair for Florio
to attack him on less favorable aspects of his Goldman Sachs
background, Corzine cried foul, saying he is the candidate, not his
firm.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful this defense will play well with Democrats, many
who see tough politics as a test of desire. ''People want to see
that you really want it,'' McQueeny said.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Security at S.C. Flag March  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDY RUN, S.C. (AP) -- With police leading the way to ease
tensions, protesters on Wednesday continued their march to the
Statehouse to object to the flying of the Confederate Flag.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the roughly 50 marchers approached Confederate
flag-waving supporters along U.S. 176, state law enforcement
officers emerged from a motor home in front and talked to the flag
supporters until the marchers passed.
</P>
<P>
   Few cross words were exchanged and the police and protesters
repeated the scene every couple of miles. A police plane circled
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want the flag lowered from the Statehouse in Columbia
say it represents hate and slavery. Supporters see it as a heritage
symbol that honors Confederate war dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is squabbling about what to do. Lawmakers raised
the flag in 1962 to commemorate the Civil War centennial and in
1995 gave themselves sole power to lower it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
has started a tourism boycott of the state in protest. South
Carolina's largest convention and visitor bureaus have reported 122
conventions and group meetings canceled statewide with losses
approaching $10 million. Tourism officials say exact numbers on the
boycott's impact are impossible to calculate.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. has led the ''Get in Step''
march through the state's rural heartland since it left his city
Sunday, hoping that more public attention will force lawmakers to
act. A protest is planned Thursday in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He has noticed some of the signs that flag supporters have put
all along the route proclaiming, ''Keep the flag, Dump Riley.''
</P>
<P>
   The people putting them up ''are obviously unemployed,'' Riley
said. ''They are the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bradley, one of the leaders of the pro-flag group, said he
was retired, not unemployed. The march won't work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flag is flying right now ... No matter what Riley says,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers spent the day in one of South Carolina's most
racially balanced counties. Calhoun County has about 600 more
blacks than whites in its population of just around 13,700 people
and many of them are descendants of cotton mill and sharecropper
families. Racial tensions have been seen there, however, as
desegregation was forced.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the town of Cameron chose to tear down its
whites-only school rather than integrate. The town's school
district had been labeled a ''hard core resistor'' by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The march started with about 600 people on Sunday and was down
to 50 Wednesday afternoon. Marchers were being shuttled in and out
so those who can spend only a short time still can participate.
</P>
<P>
   The state said the Public Safety Department has spent at least
$23,000 to provide security at a pro-flag Statehouse demonstration
in January and at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally nearly two
weeks later that attracted 46,000 people. Two rallies planned for
the Statehouse grounds Thursday will add even more expense.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Chief: No 1st USA Sale Now  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One's new chief executive said Wednesday
he's not inclined to sell the company's First USA credit-card unit
or the banking company itself, despite problems that have sullied
the bank's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here only to build a great financial services company,
not to sell it,'' Jamie Dimon said in an investor conference call.
</P>
<P>
   He did not preclude a transaction later on, however.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks that should hearten customers, he also declared that
customer service must be improved in all of Bank One's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, named CEO and chairman of the nation's fifth largest bank
holding company on March 27, has his hands full after taking a year
off since departing his job as president of Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Bank One has endured rocky times since the
disclosure last August that soaring growth in First USA, the
country's No. 2 credit-card issuer, had slowed due to a series of
flawed marketing strategies that drove existing customers off. The
mistakes carved deeply into Bank One earnings and caused its stock
to lose half its value.
</P>
<P>
   But Bank One shares have been rallying since Dimon's hire,
rising 25 percent in eight days and closing at $35.18} Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange, a 56\-cent gain.
</P>
<P>
   That's an encouraging sign for Bank One, whose executives have
insisted for months that its operations are healthy outside the
well-publicized First USA troubles and that a turnaround should be
completed by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a whopping paper profit of $14 million for Dimon, who
bought 2 million shares of Bank One stock on March 27 at $28.37{ a
share.
</P>
<P>
   While avoiding specific details of his Bank One plans in what he
called an introductory call, Dimon quickly dampened speculation
that he might want to shed First USA as a quick fix for the
company's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fun for me is to make this a great American financial
institution, and it certainly is a great platform to do that, in
spite of some of the problems and stubbed toes and broken legs we
may have had lately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My quick read is this company's not ready to do deals right
now,'' Dimon said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding First USA, he said ''I know what you know. I think
clearly it is a serious thing, but I also look at the credit-card
business as fundamentally a good business. I don't see any reason
why we can't stabilize ours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully we'll be able to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimon also said Wingspan, Bank One's Internet bank unit, ''did a
lot of things right'' but spent too much money on bad advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a topic that has hurt Bank One's image, he said
''We've got to do a better job in customer service. It's just so
important to the current health of the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his own decision to come back to a traditional banking
operation rather than pursue offers to delve into an Internet
business: ''I liked what I did, I like complexity, I like problems.
Maybe I'm a masochist. ... I love the financial services
business.''

<HEADLINE> Kindergartners suspended for playground 'cops and robbers'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAYREVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- School district officials have said they
will review their ''zero-tolerance'' policy after four
kindergartners playing 'cops and robbers' on the school playground
were suspended from Wilson School for making threats.
</P>
<P>
   The students received the three-day suspension after the March
15 incident, in which the children pretended their fingers were
guns and said they wanted to shoot each other. Classmates overheard
their comments and reported them to a teacher, who told the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   School principal Georgia Baumann followed school district policy
on threats and violence when she suspended the students after
learning of the game, according to district superintendent William
L. Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a no tolerance policy. We're very firm on weapons and
threats,'' Bauer said. ''Given the climate of our society, we
cannot take any of these statements in a light manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer said parents of one of the suspended students have
complained, and added that the district would review the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The father of one of the suspended students, who did not want
his child identified, told the Home News Tribune of East Brunswick
in Wednesday's editions that the school overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand there is fear and paranoia going on, but there
has to be some rationale to it,'' he said. ''It was at a time when
these kids were supposed to be playing. They don't even understand
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Ferrandino, executive director of the National
Association of Elementary School Principals, said school districts
throughout the country have revised their policies on threats and
violence in the wake of recent school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to principals to enforce those policies, Ferrandino
said, and most would rather err on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always the fear of not doing enough in a potentially
dangerous situation. So much of this is a reaction to what is
taking place in society,'' he said. ''We've also seen unfortunately
that these kinds of episodes of violence in the schools can take
place at any age level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he supported Baumann's decision, although he
understood why parents were upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents' real complaint was these are kindergarten kids
playing cops and robbers,'' he said. ''However, given the fact that
you have people of a similar age going in and shooting people'' the
suspension was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was referring to a 6-year-old boy in Flint, Mich., who
shot and killed a classmate on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University psychology professor Maurice J. Elias said
while zero-tolerance policies are admirable on the surface, they're
not applicable to all children in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ''People sometimes get very uncomfortable for not appearing very
tough,'' he said. ''We take the easy and safe way out in having a
harsh penalty. It's an easy and safe way because you know that most
of the public is not going to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of one of the suspended students, however, said he
wanted to see school policies return to ''normalcy,'' rather than
treating children as potential threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son wanted to know if he was in trouble,'' he told the
newspaper. ''I said I was not going to punish him for playing.''

<HEADLINE> Latest casino suicide was a Sands dealer, police say  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Distraught gamblers aren't the only
ones who resort to suicide at casinos. Sometimes, even dealers do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanh Nguyen, 50, a craps dealer at the Sands Hotel Casino, was
identified Wednesday as the man who killed himself by jumping from
a casino parking garage Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He was the second casino dealer to commit suicide that way in
the last eight months. On Aug. 23, Caesars Atlantic City Hotel
Casino dealer Sy Souvannavong, 28, of Galloway Township, plunged
from that casino's parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, of Ventnor, had worked at the Sands since emigrating
from Saigon 10 years ago. Married, with four adult children, he was
described as a quiet family man with no known troubles at home or
on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, I don't know what happened,'' said his son-in-law,
Sy Dang, 30. ''Inside the family, he had no problem. It's a very
lovely family. We're shocked. We don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Nguyen went to the ninth floor of the Trump
Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino parking garage and jumped to his death about
4:30 p.m. Tuesday. He died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   No suicide note was left. Police weren't saying what drove
Nguyen to it, or if they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just usually try to speak to the family and find out if
there was any depression or any history, but we wouldn't release
that information. We're satisfied that it is a suicide, though,''
said Sgt. Michael Tullio, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow dealer at the Sands who knew Nguyen described him as a
quiet man and a good worker. He didn't gamble, according to the
woman, who did not want her name published.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really surprised,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he gambled or not, working as a casino dealer is a
high-pressure job, according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dealers certainly have a very difficult job,'' said Marvin
Steinberg, a psychologist who heads the Connecticut Council on
Problem Gambling. ''They are required to provide friendly, good
customer service and they deal directly with people who are often
not happy with the results of their gambling. Sometimes, customers
are pretty nasty, especially if they're drinking and they're
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dang, the son-in-law, said Nguyen sometimes complained about
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, he'd complain about what was happening on the job,
about where he worked at and the people,'' Dang said. He would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Sands officials declined comment on the suicide Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In August, three people killed themselves by leaping from casino
buildings here in an eight-day period.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Caesars dealer, a gambler who had lost
$87,000 at the tables jumped off a Trump Plaza roof and a German
tourist died after leaping from the Resorts Atlantic City parking
garage.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Give Ads Environmental Bent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will give all of its corporate
brand advertising an environmental theme, starting with a special
edition of Time magazine commemorating Earth Day, the company said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the exclusive sponsor for the magazine, which goes on
sale April 19 worldwide. Ford also will air TV ads, put up outdoor
ads in major cities before Earth Day on April 22, and host a
concert in San Francisco on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is part of a broader push at Ford to reduce
pollution from its operations and improve its image. Ford's
chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., is a self-described ''lifelong
environmentalist'' and has pledged to make the world's No. 2
automaker the industry leader in developing clean vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will use the corporate logo -- the words ''Ford Motor
Company'' in script lettering -- rather than the familiar blue oval
Ford logo.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Cervantez, manager of Ford corporate marketing, said
the ads were the first Ford corporate campaign to focus on a single
theme. She declined to say how much the company was spending on the
ads or the magazine, but said it was comparable to the ad spending
for a new car introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The edition of Time, ''How to Save the Earth and the Heroes for
the Planet Who Are Making it Happen,'' is the first global special
edition of the magazine, which has 30 million readers worldwide.
Time officials said Ford had no say in the magazine's editorial
content.

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution Failures Cited  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three-fourths of the states are failing to
address water pollution caused by runoff from farms and forests,
ignoring a provision in the federal Clean Water Act, a leading
conservation group charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation said a survey it conducted
shows that 38 states have done little to address non-point
pollution under the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''States have not stepped forward to systematically deal with
polluted runoff and contaminated rain,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murray, the report's co-author, attributed the states'
reluctance to ''a combination of political intimidation ... and
bureaucratic inertia'' and said ''our lakes, streams and coasts are
paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The group evaluated compliance with a provision of the Clean
Water Act aimed at protecting watersheds from pollution --
pesticides, excessive nutrients and other chemicals -- that come
primarily from agriculture and forests as opposed to a specific
smokestack or discharge pipe.
</P>
<P>
   States are required to designate waterways impaired by such
pollution, prioritize the severity of the problems and develop a
plan to curtail the pollution. Murray said most states have done
little beyond compiling lists.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawsuits have been filed challenging the
Environmental Protection Agency's authority to limit pollution from
non-point sources, while other lawsuits claim the agency has not
been aggressive enough to implement the law.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in San Francisco last week upheld the EPA's
authority to control pollution in California's Garcia River from
agricultural and forest runoff, the Justice Department said
Wednesday, calling it the first court decision ''to squarely
address the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit involving the Garcia River had been filed by The
American Farm Bureau Federation and other agriculture and timber
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the EPA proposed a rule that would strengthen
compliance, requiring states to step up development of plans for
watershed protection so that all impaired waterways are safeguarded
within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Federation said the regulation, which has yet to be
issued, will improve state compliance, but with its lengthy
compliance schedule ''does not acknowledge the urgency in restoring
polluted rives, lakes and estuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed EPA rule has been criticized by farm groups and
even the U.S. Agriculture Department. A senior USDA official last
year suggested the EPA does not have authority to regulate
agricultural runoff, a position later disavowed by Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Glickman has expressed concern about the EPA's lack of
a clear estimate on how much compliance will cost farmers,
landowners and the logging industry.
</P>
<P>
   The rule would require certain pollution levels to be
established for impaired waterways and it would be up to each state
to determine how to meet the reductions, EPA Administrator Carol
Browner told lawmakers at a hearing in February.
</P>
<P>
   EPA has estimated that states so far have approved only a small
fraction of the 40,000 runoff-control plans need to comply with the
law, a reflection of the findings disclosed Wednesday by the
National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation group said 19 states, Puerto Rico and the
District of Columbia have largely ignored the law and another 19
states have demonstrated ''poor'' compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve states were found to meet ''minimum'' requirements:
Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   States with the worst compliance were: Alabama, Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York,
Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Burns Near Fla. Everglades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Smoke enveloped areas of western Miami-Dade County
on Wednesday as wind worked against firefighters battling a
3,500-acre blaze at the edge of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, nearby residents were asked to stay indoors,
keep windows and doors shut and turn on their air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   That was ''due to toxic fumes from the fire in the area,''
according to an advisory issued by Miami-Dade Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out Saturday, according to the Florida Division
of Forestry, and a strong northwesterly wind pushed it through an
undeveloped, swampy area on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No residences or businesses were threatened by fire, but smoke
hampered visibility for drivers on nearby Tamiami Trail, Okeechobee
Road and Florida's Turnpike, said David Utley, Everglades district
manager for the state Division of Forestry.

<HEADLINE> Report: Driver Didn't Heed Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The driver of a school bus struck by a
freight train did not observe warnings before crossing the tracks,
according to a state police report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Cloer drove the bus that crossed in front of a CSX train,
killing three children in Tennga, Ga., just over the Tennessee
line, on March 28. According to the Tennessee Highway Patrol
report, Cloer failed to obey traffic signs posted at the railroad
crossing and did not observe other warnings, such as the train's
whistle blowing.
</P>
<P>
   Polk County District Attorney Jerry Estes will decide if charges
should be filed, said Highway Patrol spokeswoman Dana Keeton. Estes
was in staff training and unavailable Wednesday, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer's attorney, Greg Melton, said the driver will not talk to
investigators until she is allowed to view a videotape taken from a
camera aboard the bus. Police said the tape is evidence that cannot
be released.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators have said
they do not know how fast the school bus was going or if Cloer
tried to stop, but are reviewing copies of the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer examined the bus' antilock braking system and
told the NTSB it was working properly. The train's crew members
said they sounded their whistle before the crash and tried to apply
the emergency brake, but could not stop in time.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer and four other children were injured in the wreck. Cloer's
5-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old boy remained hospitalized in
critical condition Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Okla. House Passes Creationism Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Science books used in Oklahoma public
schools would be required to acknowledge ''that human life was
created by one God of the universe'' under legislation passed
Wednesday by the Oklahoma House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The House addressed the issue of creationism in an amendment to
a bill dealing with the embattled State Textbook Committee, which
last year ordered biology books to carry a disclaimer about the
teaching of evolution that described it as a ''controversial
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclaimers were scrapped after Attorney General Drew
Edmondson said the committee has no authority to require them.
</P>
<P>
   But House members approved an amendment that says ''the
committee shall ensure'' that science textbooks it approves for use
in public schools ''include acknowledgment that human life was
created by one God of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The House went a step further when it passed another amendment
that gives the committee ''authority to insert a one-page summary,
opinion or disclaimer into any textbook reviewed and authorized for
use in the public schools of Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   The original intent of the bill was to require that two members
of the textbook committee be elementary level teachers and two be
secondary level teachers. The bill now goes to a joint House-Senate
conference committee for review.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Kansas Board of Education sparked a national
debate by passing new testing standards that minimized the
importance of evolution.

<HEADLINE> Two LA Police Officers Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a case predating the city's police
corruption scandal, two officers were indicted Wednesday on federal
charges of framing a suspect and lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights charges against Officer Edward Patrick Ruiz and
former Officer Jon Paul Taylor mirrored the allegations of
frame-ups, lying and planted evidence that have come to light in
the Rampart Division scandal, which has led to 50 convictions being
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictment relates to a five-year-old case dealing
with officers assigned to the 77th Division.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, these officers participated in an activity similar
to Rampart,'' Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-count grand jury indictment accuses the men of
conspiring to frame Victor Tyson for possession of a concealed
weapon. U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said the officers knew he
was not the man who had dropped a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He said the officers had been chasing two black men who dropped
a blue-handled revolver and escaped. Tyson, who was standing
nearby, was arrested, Mayorkas said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Ruiz testified at Tyson's trial, but in mid-trial a
deputy city attorney dismissed the charge after discovering
inconsistencies in testimony. The judge referred the matter for
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor resigned from the force, and in 1998 Ruiz was found
guilty of lying in the Tyson case by a police department board of
rights panel. He was given a 22-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, who are not in custody, will be arraigned at an
unspecified future time. They face up to 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell slightly early Thursday after
further weakness on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against the
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 4.05 points,
or 0.02 percent, to 20,458.72 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed down 132.16 points, or 0.64
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.98 yen, down 0.12 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 104.66 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index weakened as investors
remained cautious amid recent volatile trading in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.92
points to 11,033.92 at Wednesday's close. But the Nasdaq composite
index gained 20.33 to 4,169.22.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 6.17 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,688.88.
The TOPIX closed down 19.24 points, or 1.12 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar remained under some selling
pressure amid expectations Japan's economy will continue to recover
under new Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling party insider, he was elected Wednesday to replace
Keizo Obuchi, who remains in a coma and on life support at a Tokyo
hospital after suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said players were avoiding making significant moves
ahead of a meeting of finance officials of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministers and central bankers from the United States,
Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada are scheduled to
meet in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.88 yen, down
from 101.44 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7500 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7750 percent. Its
price rose 0.22 point to 101.29.

<HEADLINE> Kin of Admitted Swindler Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The father and brothers of an admitted
swindler were indicted Wednesday, accused of defrauding customers
at their now-defunct Essex County brokerage of more than $100
million, mainly by selling them investments in fictitious office
equipment leases.
</P>
<P>
   The principals of First Interregional Equity Corp., of Millburn,
siphoned some $20 million from its operations from 1988-97 to
support a posh lifestyle, according to the 13-count federal
indictment returned here.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy and income tax evasion charges against company
founder and owner Herbert Goettlich and two of his sons came 16
months after another son, company president Richard Goettlich, and
two employees pleaded guilty to roles in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 1,750 investors in equipment leases were ''close
family friends'' of the Goettlichs, and some invested millions of
dollars, believing they were buying the rights to the revenue
stream from leases for office equipment such as copiers,
authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the illusion clients were getting revenue from these
leases, they sold more fictitious leases and made payments with
that money, Richard Goettlich has admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a ripoff of mammoth proportion for the investors. The
losses to some of the individual investors are huge,'' U.S.
Attorney Robert J. Cleary said. ''One consolation is that each of
these defendants faces hard prison time.''
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage was shut down in March 1997 after the FBI learned
of massive shredding, and raided its offices. The Securities and
Exchange Commission filed civil charges and had company accounts
frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Zohn, a Newark lawyer involved in customer claims to
the parent corporation, said the total losses to customers of First
Interregional and its affiliate, First Interregional Advisors
Corp., is about $120 million, nearly all of which involved the
leases.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Goettlich and his sons were not arrested, and no date
was scheduled for their arraignment. Each faces charges of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to evade income
taxes, and three to four counts of income tax evasion. Each charge
carries up to five years in prison and hundreds of thousands in
fines and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Goettlich, 79, of Cedar Grove, founded First Interregional in
the late 1970s. He could not be reached for comment as no home
listing could be found and his lawyer was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Goettlich, 46, of Livingston, had been vice president and
a director of First Interregional. No home listing could be found
for him, and his lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   David Goettlich, 43, of Florham Park, a licensed securities
broker at First Interregional, was not immediately available for
comment, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Goettlich, who had been president of First
Interregional, pleaded guilty in November 1998 along with treasurer
Anthony Gianninoto and Eileen Laine, the company's data processing
manager.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to cooperate in the government investigation and
await sentencing; each could get several years in prison. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Amy S. Winkelman said she could not comment on
whether they have been cooperating.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Winds in Turkey Kill Two  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Winds reaching 60 mph lashed Turkey's
northwest Wednesday killing two elderly people and fanning fires
that burned down scores of village homes, officials and news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The strong southwesterly winds lifted roofs, uprooted trees and
knocked down electricity poles, cutting power in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   The winds blew down the minaret of a village mosque in the
province of Balikesir, killing a 71-year-old passer-by, the
region's Gov. Alaadin Yuksel said. A woman in her seventies was
also killed after being hit by an uprooted tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fires ignited by overturned stoves and heaters raged through 23
homes and stables in the village of Kiraz, Yuksel said. At least 50
homes caught fire in three villages in the provinces of Bursa and
Canakkale, the Anatolia news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The winds also helped fan forest and brush fires in at least 19
different locations in the region, devastating more than 3,000
acres, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists forecast that the winds would subside by early
Thursday.

Liberals Accused of Politicizing Health Care
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Premier Mike Harris accused the federal Liberals
of playing politics with medicare Wednesday as he rejected Ottawa's
claim Ontario is the obstacle to an agreement on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says federal Health Minister Allan Rock brought nothing
constructive to the table at last week's two-day meeting of health
ministers near Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''To date, we've heard the word reform but not one little bit
about what he likes about ours, what he dislikes, what he'd like to
see nationally,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, he suggested, is trying to portray
itself as a defender of medicare, while holding back money the
provinces need so it can go on a health-care spending spree in the
next election, expected within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Rock has rejected that allegation, but Nova Scotia Health
Minister Jamie Muir said Wednesday he has doubts about Ottawa's
motives.
</P>
<P>
   Muir also said Prime Minister Jean Chretien's refusal to hold a
quick first ministers' meeting on health suggests Ottawa isn't
prepared to take an activist role.

Klees's Withdrawal From Ontario Race Questioned
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Some Canadian Alliance MPs are questioning the
credibility of Ontario provincial politician Frank Klees's
explanation for suddenly withdrawing from the party's leadership
race.
</P>
<P>
   MP Ian McClelland called Klees's rationale for bowing out
''fishy,'' and suggested the whole story has yet to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's insane, which further underscores the fact that the
excuse that he gave for deciding not to run, in my opinion, was
specious at best,'' McClelland said outside the Alliance's caucus
meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Klees announced Tuesday he wouldn't run for the leadership
because he could not agree to a condition placed on him by a key
campaign donor. The unnamed donor allegedly wanted him to throw his
support behind another candidate if he lost the first ballot of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Klees denies any ulterior motive for backing out, but some
Alliance members doubt that.
</P>
<P>
   They note that since voting for a leadership occurs by mail
rather than at a convention, it would be difficult to ensure
thousands of members agree to throw their support behind a
particular candidate.

Fatal Accident Spurs Debate on Senior Driving
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A fatal accident in which an 84-year-old driver
is accused of striking a pedestrian and dragging her several blocks
under her car has touched off debate about whether seniors are safe
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not determined if age played a role in the deadly
incident, but safety activists cited studies Wednesday that suggest
driving abilities deteriorate as a person gets older.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Canada Safety Council says forcing seniors to hang up
their car keys would be a disservice to society, making the elderly
virtual shut-ins or leaving responsibility for their transport to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old pedestrian was struck Tuesday at a crosswalk and
dragged for almost one kilometer before the vehicle turned into a
residential driveway. There, the woman's body dislodged and
slumped, as the car headed for the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The body sat on the driveway for 30 minutes before a neighbor
made the grisly discovery around 10:30 p.m. and phoned police.
</P>
<P>
   Pilar Hicks was charged with failing to stop causing death and
careless driving.

<HEADLINE> NC School Ends Same-sex Classes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN TRAIL, N.C. (AP) -- A middle school ended the experimental
use of same-sex classes for some eighth-graders after the American
Civil Liberties Union complained the classes discriminated against
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Parkwood Middle School began the program in October
to see whether students going through puberty learned better
without distractions from the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU filed a complaint in February with the federal Office
for Civil Rights. School officials sent a letter to the OCR office
last week saying the classes had been disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Ross, executive director of the state chapter of the
ACLU, said the classes violated a 1972 law barring sexual
discrimination at schools that receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that it violates the law on its face,''
Ross said Wednesday. ''The history of separating women and men and
boys and girls for academic classes has always redounded to the
detriment of girls, politically and professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkwood principal Larry Stinson said the classes were
temporary, involved only 55 of the school's 335 eighth graders, and
parents were notified well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson said he believes the students showed improvement during
the brief experiment. ''If it wasn't working, we would have jerked
it out of there a long time ago,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RHINELANDER, Wis. (AP) -- Four teen-agers were killed when their
car ran off a road and crashed into a driveway embankment,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the Tuesday night accident, about 100 miles
northwest of Green Bay, was being investigated, the Oneida County
Sheriff's Department said. Neither alcohol nor excessive speed
appeared to be a factor, Sheriff Timothy Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims attended Rhinelander High School, said Principal Jim
Gehrke.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Steffke, an 16-year-old junior, was at the wheel when the
car went onto the shoulder, skidded across the road, hit the
embankment and flipped on its roof, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Richard L. Blackburn, an 18-year-old junior;
and freshmen Corry Jefferson, 15, and Adam J. Ring, 15, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is sad and crying,'' Samantha Jefferson, a friend of
two of the victims, said Wednesday. ''When I got to school today,
everybody was devastated; many went home.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselors were available Wednesday for the 1,140 students at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my 36th year as a school person, and I guess I've never
seen this many tears,'' Gehrke said.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Foods Said Safe  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foods made from genetically engineered crops
are safe, but the government needs to tighten its monitoring of
biotech plants to ensure they won't cause allergies or harm the
environment, a panel of scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Better methods are needed to identify potential allergens,
including long-term studies of feeding the crops to animals,
according to a study sponsored by the National Research Council, an
arm of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The 261-page study, which focused on plants that have been
genetically engineered for protection against insects and viruses,
said none of the varieties developed so far poses allergy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the federal regulatory process for approving
pest-protected crops ''is working well,'' said Perry Adkisson, a
former Texas A&AMP;M University chancellor who chaired the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found no distinction between the health and environmental
risks posed by plants modified through modern genetic engineering
techniques and those produced by conventional breeding practices.
... Just because a plant is transgenic doesn't make it dangerous,''
Adkisson said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves transferring one or more genes from
one organism into another to give it specific traits.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacteria gene
that makes it toxic to a pest, became especially controversial last
year after a university study suggested its pollen could be killing
Monarch butterflies. A soybean that proved allergenic after
scientists inserted a gene from the Brazil nut was withdrawn before
it reached the market.
</P>
<P>
   The council's study said that more research is needed to prevent
biotech crops from killing harmless insects, including the Monarch,
and to stop pest-resistant genes from spreading into weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech crops caught on quickly with U.S. farmers in the late
1990s and were planted on at least 70 million acres nationwide last
year
</P>
<P>
   Biotech food has met consumer resistance in Europe -- in Britain
it's derided as ''Frankenfood'' -- and in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of genetic engineering said the panel was biased because
many of its members have received funding from the industry and
that the report could undermine efforts to increase regulation of
biotech foods. ''A panel that leans overwhelmingly toward a
pro-biotech position ... cannot be expected to produce an
independent report with an objective conclusion,'' said Rep. Dennis
Kucinich, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member panel included 11 scientists, most of them
university researchers, and one attorney, an expert in government
regulation who has represented the industry. Officials with the
National Academy of Sciences acknowledged that some members of the
committee had conflicts of interest but said they were needed
because of their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The study was limited to crops that are modified to resist
pests. Crops that have been genetically engineered to be tolerant
to herbicides, including a popular variety of soybeans, or modified
to stay fresher longer were not covered by the study.

   Advocates of crop biotechnology, who announced a $50 million
advertising campaign earlier this week to counter criticism of the
industry, said the report should bolster public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The report ''will reassure consumers on the thoroughness of the
scientific scrutiny in place by U.S. regulatory agencies,'' said
Val Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said that:
</P>
<P>
   --The three agencies that regulate pest-protected plants -- the
Environmental Protection Agency, Agriculture Department and Food
and Drug Administration -- should develop a coordinated database for
findings about plant compounds that pose dietary or toxicological
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   --The EPA should implement rules first proposed six years ago for
regulating pest-resistant crops, although the study questioned the
justification for some proposed exemptions.	   ------

<HEADLINE> CKE Reports 4Q Loss  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- CKE Restaurants said Wednesday it lost $61.8
million in its fourth quarter and is talking to investment bankers
about how to stem mounting losses from its 1998 purchase of the
Hardee's chain.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of $1.22 per share was due to lagging sales at Hardee's
outlets and costs associated with a restaurant makeover effort, CKE
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net income of $13.5 million, or 26 cents
per share, for the fourth quarter last year. This year's fourth
quarter, which ended Jan. 31, was a week longer than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reported a loss of $29.1 million, or 56 cents
per share, for the year, compared with net income of $77.7 million,
or $1.45 per share, last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply disappointed with our overall results for the
quarter and the fiscal year,'' Tom Thompson, CKE's president and
chief executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call for stock analysts, Thompson blamed the
losses on two failed advertising campaigns, a decision to bear the
brunt of the costs for remodeling older restaurants and
difficulties in consolidating administration of the Hardee's chain,
based primarily in the east, with the company's California-based
Carl's Jr. chain.
</P>
<P>
   CKE said it is in the initial stages of ''evaluating strategic
alternatives'' regarding Hardee's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's the right thing to do to explore other options
and have a contingency plan just in case,'' a company spokesperson
said, adding that selling the chain is among the range of options.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the company has high hopes for its effort to
convert many of its older Hardee's locations into ''Star Hardee's''
restaurants -- a hybrid Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. Over the past year,
the company has shouldered most of the cost of those conversions, a
decision Thompson said, ''compounded the turnaround challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, CKE began franchising more of its
company-owned Hardee's restaurants and Thompson said continued
sales should help the company return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   CKE sold 83 restaurants in the fourth quarter for a one-time
gain of $40 million. Thompson said the strategy should generate
another $200 million in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales at the flagship Carl's Jr. outlets increased
1.5 percent, which includes both the company-owned and franchised
outlets. Same-store sales at Taco Bueno stores increased 1.8
percent. Those gains were offset by a drop in same-store sales at
company-owned and franchised Hardee's stores of 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CKE's stock lost 93} cents, ending at $5.18} on the New York
Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT-XGR--Treasurer Reform, Conn Bjt,600  </HEADLINE>
sdstfpr
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A controversial treasurer reform bill
debated in the House on Wednesday was attacked by opponents who
said the measure doesn't contain enough safeguards to prevent
another corruption scandal in the state Treasurer's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the measure will strengthen oversight of state
pension fund investments and eliminate the controversial ''finder's
fees'' that formerly were paid in connection with investment
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would replace the deputy treasurer with a chief
investment officer and also prohibit the state treasurer, any
candidate for state treasurer or any member of the Investment
Advisory Council, from seeking campaign contributions from persons
connected to an investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Committee co-chairwoman Anne McDonald, D-Stamford, said
the bill would go a long way toward ensuring there are no further
scandals in the state treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Robert Ward, R-North Branford, said
finder's fees will still exist but will be called something else.
The State Ethics Commission should be given the responsibility of
defining what constitutes a finder's fee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Plofsky, executive director of the State Ethics Commission,
said the House bill actually weakens the current law and
essentially leaves oversight in the hands of the treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't cure the problem. It makes it worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plofsky noted that the House bill permits fees to be paid to
''investment professionals.'' He added, ''Anybody can hang out a
shingle and call himself an investment professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Plofsky said he supported a failed Republican amendment that
would have allowed fees to be paid only to licensed financial
counselors who have met rigorous standards set down by Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   If the state Senate doesn't repair the bill, Plofsky said he
will ask the governor to veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP amendment, offered by Ward, was defeated 91-57, with the
voting following party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment called for the creation of a powerful, bipartisan
board of trustees that would have superseded the current Investment
Advisory Council and would have the final say on all investments.
Republicans said 47 other states currently use this investment
approach.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the bill supported by the Democrats will require
the treasurer to adopt an investment policy and present it to the
IAC. The IAC will provide adequate oversight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill supported by the Democrats, the treasurer would
be barred from awarding a contract for trust fund-related activity
until the IAC has reviewed the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The reform was inspired by last year's corruption scandal
surrounding former state Treasurer Paul J. Silvester. He pleaded
guilty in September to charges of racketeering and money laundering
related to fund-raising in his failed 1998 campaign. He admitted
accepting kickbacks in the form of campaign donations from
companies with which he invested state pension money, and raising
money for the campaigns of others including Gov. John G. Rowland,
who appointed Silvester after the former treasurer resigned to go
to work for an investment company that had done business with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill would require the treasurer to wait at least one
year from the date a contract is negotiated before going to work
for the company, if the contract amounts to at least $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also restricts the governor's power to appoint someone
to fill a vacancy in the Treasurer's Office when the General
Assembly is not in session.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Firm Settles Suits  </HEADLINE>
By HUNTER T. GEORGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Mary Blake wanted to win a sweepstakes so
badly that she often went without groceries and medicine so she
could buy merchandise that boosted her chances.
</P>
<P>
   When the mail came, family members say, the 82-year-old Olympia
woman would immediately fill out the entry forms and rush to the
post office with the idea of beating deadlines for free gifts. She
wrote notes on her checks, asking in vain for the sweepstakes firms
not to cash them until her Social Security check was deposited.
</P>
<P>
   Blake is the kind of consumer that the nation's attorneys
general are hoping will benefit from a settlement announced
Wednesday with one of the country's biggest sweepstakes firms.
</P>
<P>
   United States Sales Corp. of Northridge, Calif., agreed to
refund $30 million to consumers in 48 states and the District of
Columbia, and to change its marketing practices. Connecticut and
Iowa are not involved in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the firm, which does business as United States
Purchasing Exchange or USPE, agreed to a separate $20 million
settlement that resolves a class-action lawsuit filed in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal with the states, USPE agreed to provide
''Sweepstakes Facts'' in big print on its contest entry forms
explaining that entrants have not yet won prizes and are not
required to buy anything to enter or improve their chances of
winning. It also will disclose the odds of winning a prize.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was negotiated by a task force representing
attorneys general from every state except Iowa and Connecticut. It
was praised across the country as a blueprint for the industry,
which is under fire for alleged deceptive marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Washington state sued Publishers Clearinghouse,
American Family Publishers and Time Inc. Those companies have
denied any wrongdoing. Trial is scheduled in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''A favorite target of these companies are the elderly, who are
duped into believing a small investment will net them millions,''
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said. ''This
should send a very clear message that it's time to stop the
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   USPE has been in business since 1967 and has undergone a recent
downsizing, admitted no wrongdoing under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company recognized that growing attention to the
issue and ''inappropriate purchasing by some customers'' made it
clear that changes were needed, spokesman Harvey Englander said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a model for the entire industry in this settlement,'' he
said. ''We stepped up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm sells low-cost household items and has given away
millions in prizes, including a $3.3 million jackpot a few weeks
ago to a winner in Florida, Englander said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, USPE customers who spent at least $1,870
in either 1997, 1998 or 1999 are eligible for restitution. Eligible
consumers will be contacted within six months by a private company
hired by the states to administer the restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Walsh, an assistant Washington attorney general who was
involved in the negotiations, said more than 150,000 consumers
nationwide could receive restitution under the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   USPE also agreed to discontinue mailings to ''high activity''
customers, defined as those who make more than 25 purchases or
spend more than $935 on sweepstakes offers in a year.
</P>
<P>
   It will come too late for Blake, who now lives in the
Alzheimer's wing of a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Her family cleaned out ''truckloads'' of useless merchandise
that Blake bought over the years from companies offering big
prizes, daughter-in-law Sherry Blake said Wednesday. Mary Blake
bought magazines, sports memorabilia and even videocassette tapes,
although she does not own a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mom was a firm believer that, to win, you have to buy,''
Sherry Blake said, adding that the family sometimes paid as much as
$800 to $1,000 to cover the monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really sad. She always wanted to win a car because hers
was so bad. She could have bought 10 or 12 of them for the money
she spent. She was so depressed because she never won and she
couldn't understand why.''

</P>
<P>
   He was best known for representing Holmes, who was charged with

Mary Smith McClain:
</P>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Blues singer Mary Smith McClain,
better known to fans as ''Diamond Teeth Mary,'' died Tuesday. She

   SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) -- Terence McKenna, spiritual theorist
and author of several books proclaiming the virtues of psychedelic
mushrooms, died Monday of brain cancer. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   One of McKenna's best known books was 1975's ''The Invisible
Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching,'' which he
co-wrote with his brother Dennis. ''Food of the Gods,'' published
in 1992, and 1993's ''True Hallucinations'' followed in the same

and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna traveled extensively through Asia, Europe and South
America before completing a self-tailored degree in Shamanology at
Berkeley in 1975.
Robert E. Miller:
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Robert E. Miller, an Associated Press
reporter who covered the Ohio Statehouse for more than 30 years,
died Tuesday of complications from cancer. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who covered the administrations of five Ohio governors
and seven national political conventions, joined the AP in
Charleston, W.Va., in March 1957. Two weeks later, he was named
Bluefield, W.Va., correspondent and the following year, he
transferred to the news cooperative's Huntington, W.Va., bureau.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to Columbus in 1960, joining the bureau as a
radio newsman. He moved to full-time coverage of the Ohio
Legislature in 1964. He resigned in 1968 to join Gongwer News
Service, which provides daily Statehouse coverage to statewide
trade and professional organizations, then returned to the Ohio AP
Statehouse bureau in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and a lifetime member of the Ohio
Legislative Correspondents Association also served as lead
political writer for the Ohio AP until his retirement on Feb. 1,
1994. He returned to Gongwer on a part-time basis, covering
legislative sessions until he became ill last year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's career was not limited to government and political
coverage. He was one of the lead writers in the AP's coverage of
the December 1967 collapse of the Silver Bridge, which connected
Gallipolis, Ohio, to Point Pleasant, W.Va., across the Ohio River.
The collapse, which killed 46 people, prompted federal regulations
requiring states to inspect bridges every other year and post
weight limits on those spans.
</P>
<P>
   He was a stickler for getting the story straight -- so much so,
that he wrote his own obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include two sisters, Rosemary Jewell of Columbus, and
Connie Adkins of Hilliard; a niece and two grandnephews.
Lee Petty:
</P>
<P>

circuit's infancy in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first winner of the Daytona 500 and a three-time
champion on what has become the Winston Cup circuit. He also won
the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959, beating Johnny Beauchamp in a
photo finish that wasn't decided for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Petty was one of the first stars in stock car racing's formative
years. He began his career with an eight-race schedule in 1949 and
went on to score 55 career wins, becoming a three-time Grand
National champion.
</P>
<P>
   His 55 career wins placed him seventh on the list of the most
victorious drivers in NASCAR Winston Cup history. Richard Petty
ranks first with 200 wins.

   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Businessman, Republican fund-raiser and
one-time Delaware Lt. Gov. John Rollins died Tuesday. He was 83.

a car dealership and parlayed it into a fortune that saw him found
five companies that made it onto the New York Stock Exchange and
carried him into the presence of senators, presidents and American
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Rollins Truck Leasing Corp., the Rollins
Environmental Services Inc., which managed hazardous waste, and
Rollins Inc., which acquired Orrin Pest Control.

36 hours, and Sitter endured grenade burns to his face, arms and
chest.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to evacuate as the fight continued. More than half of
his company was killed, wounded or captured, but a successful
defense of the area was mounted by U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Sitter later was presented the Medal of Honor by President
Truman and is expected to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

</P>
<P>
   Under the bill supported by the Democrats, the treasurer would
be barred from awarding a contract for trust fund-related activity
until the IAC has reviewed the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The reform was inspired by last year's corruption scandal
surrounding former state Treasurer Paul J. Silvester. He pleaded
guilty in September to charges of racketeering and money laundering
related to fund-raising in his failed 1998 campaign. He admitted
accepting kickbacks in the form of campaign donations from
companies with which he invested state pension money, and raising
money for the campaigns of others including Gov. John G. Rowland,
who appointed Silvester after the former treasurer resigned to go
to work for an investment company that had done business with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill would require the treasurer to wait at least one
year from the date a contract is negotiated before going to work
for the company, if the contract amounts to at least $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also restricts the governor's power to appoint someone
to fill a vacancy in the Treasurer's Office when the General
Assembly is not in session.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Challenges Culture Ban on Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday
challenged the constitutionality of a sweeping county ordinance
that restricts commerce with Cuba, filing a federal class-action
lawsuit on behalf of several artistic groups and promoters.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges Miami-Dade County's so-called ''Cuba
ordinance'' improperly infringes on First Amendment rights of free
speech and free association and establishes a cultural embargo that
unconstitutionally supersedes the federal government's authority in
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance bans county vendors from doing business with
organizations that deal with Cuba, prohibits contractors from
visiting the island and authorizes county commissioners to grant
waivers to the policy. Air carriers with contracts to fly in and
out of Miami are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The county commission passed the ordinance in July 1996 after
two civilian planes were shot down by Cuban military jets and was
intended to punish the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Miami-Dade County officials for comment
Wednesday night were not successful.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU state leader Howard Simon said similar federal legislation
historically has exempted artistic and cultural expression. The
trade embargo imposed after Fidel Castro came to power permits
cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people recognize that there is something wrong with
the application of the Cuba ordinance here,'' Simon said. ''In the
middle of the Cold War in this country, we had the Bolshoi Ballet
and the Kirov Ballet perform in the United States. We had the
Shanghai Circus. We had the Soviet Army Chorus and Band perform at
Carnegie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Cancio, a Cuban-American music promoter who is a plaintiff
in the lawsuit, said the ordinance prompted organizers of the Latin
American Grammy Awards to move the ceremony from Miami to Los
Angeles last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miami is the door to the Americas. It is not just about
Cuba,'' Cancio said. ''There are other communities that are not
Cuban that are tired of following decisions made by our local
politicians when it comes to Cuba.''

<P>
   CHEBOYGAN, Mich. (AP) -- Police are investigating allegations
that the Cheboygan Daily Tribune gave a candidate for mayor special
deals on campaign advertisements, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's publisher, Roy Trahan, said he could not comment
on the investigation on advice from the paper's lawyers, but he
confirmed police executed a search warrant at the Tribune offices
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern is there may be a much larger political picture
here,'' Trahan told The Associated Press. He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Kurt Jones said his office received a complaint
about the alleged special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Tribune reported Wednesday that one of its employees
had made the complaint. Neither Trahan nor Jones would identify the
person.
</P>
<P>
   ''We opened an investigation. We are collecting evidence to
determine whether it's true or not,'' Jones said. No charges have
been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Police are investigating whether mayoral challenger Tom Verwys
received a cheaper rate than incumbent Mayor Bill Chlopan. Chlopan
defeated Verwys on Monday 373 to 205.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Campaign Finance Act requires that if media grant
any discounts, they must go to all candidates in a race, according
to Liz Boyd, a spokeswoman with the secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations that violate the act can be fined up to $10,000.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 11, Indians 7  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Charles Johnson homered twice and drove in five
runs Wednesday night as Baltimore beat the Cleveland Indians 11-7,
giving Mike Hargrove his first victory as manager of the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's second homer, a two-run shot in the eighth inning off
former Oriole Scott Kamieniecki (0-1), snapped a 7-7 tie. He also
hit a three-run homer to give Baltimore a 7-6 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Johnson struggled against Cleveland, going just
2-for-27 with one RBI, and also started the season in a slump,
hitting .176 with one home run.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle hit a three-run homer for the Orioles, who
rebounded from an opening day loss to Hargrove's former team. Cal
Ripken went 0-for-4 and remained eight hits short of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Manuel, Hargrove's replacement in Cleveland, was ejected
in his second game as a major league manager. Manuel was
complaining about the strike zone from the dugout when home plate
umpire Ed Rapuano ousted him in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome homered and Omar Vizquel had three hits for the
Indians, who scored two runs on wild pitches and two on
bases-loaded walks.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's homer off Chuck Finley put the Orioles up 3-0 in the
first inning. The Indians scored five runs in the second and led
6-4 in the sixth before Johnson connected off Steve Reed to give
Baltimore a short-lived lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made it 7-7 in the seventh when Kenny Lofton reached
on an error, took third on a single by Vizquel and scored on a wild
pitch by Chuck McElroy.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark hit a one-out single in the eighth and Johnson
followed by driving a 2-1 pitch deep into the left-field seats.
B.J. Surhoff iced the victory with a two-run, two-out double off
Tom Martin.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Ryan (1-0) got the last out in the eighth to earn his
second major league win.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, making his debut with Cleveland after spending his
previous 14 seasons with the Angels, allowed four runs on four hits
in five innings but was in position to get the victory before
Johnson homered off Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland batted around in the second, using three hits and
three walks to go up 5-3. After Sidney Ponson issued successive
bases-loaded walks, David Justice scored on a wild pitch before
Vizquel hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got a run in their half when Clark doubled and
scored on a single by Mike Bordick. Thome made it 6-4 with a solo
homer in the sixth, his first hit of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was Baltimore's second win in 12 games against Cleveland
over two seasons. ... Delino DeShields stole two bases for
Baltimore. He had 11 all last year. ... After Finley hit Belle with
a pitch in the third, several players from both teams left the
dugout before order was restored. ... Despite allowing six earned
runs in six innings, Ponson lowered his lifetime ERA against the
Indians to 10.52.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose made three free throws and Reggie
Miller hit two -- all in the final 17 seconds -- as Indiana held off
the New Jersey Nets 105-101 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn had 26 to lead an injury-plagued New Jersey team
which was playing without leading scorer Stephon Marbury for the
first time this season and lost Evan Eschmeyer with a sprained left
ankle early in the second quarter. Marbury didn't make the trip
because he is scheduled to have an MRI on a sore right knee on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits scored 17 of his 25 points in the first quarter to
give Indiana a lead it never lost.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey trailed by as many as 20 points in the second half,
but reduced its deficit to 98-97 on a 3-pointer by Van Horn with
47.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perkins then found Dale Davis open underneath the basket for
a dunk with 33.4 seconds left. Davis was fouled on the shot, but
missed the free throw and New Jersey got the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burrell missed a layup off a drive and Rose snared the
rebound. He was fouled and made both free throws, giving Indiana a
102-97 lead. Kendall Gill's driving layup brought New Jersey to
within three again until Miller sank two free throws with 11.2
remaining. Van Horn got a dunk with six seconds to go and then Rose
made one-of-two free throws with 5.2 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman scored 20 for New Jersey, while Gill and Elliot
Perry had 14 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana had five players in double figures. Rose finished with
17 and 10 rebounds. Davis also had a double-double with 11 points
and 11 boards, while Mark Jackson scored 16.
</P>
<P>
   The victory reduced Indiana's number for clinching a second
consecutive Central Division title to any combination of two Pacers
victories or Charlotte losses. It also put Indiana 2 1-2 games
ahead of Miami in the race for home court advantage throughout the
Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana appeared to have broken the game open as it scored 14
consecutive points in an 18-2 run early in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had six points during Indiana's 14-point run, starting with
a jumper with 10:59 left in the period. His 19-foot jumper with
7:59 remaining ended the run, giving the Pacers a 62-47 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers went on to take their biggest lead of the game at
79-59 and took a 79-65 advantage into the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indiana's streak of sellouts at Conseco Fieldhouse is 38
games. ... Smits, who was 8-for-14 in the opening quarter, scored
Indiana's first 13 points. ... The Nets haven't won at Indiana
since Dec. 29, 1996, a streak of seven games. ... New Jersey is
8-28 when its opponent scores 100 or more points. ... The Nets
posted a 26-8 advantage in fast break points.

<HEADLINE> Giants 11, Marlins 9  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Rich Aurilia hit a three-run homer with one out in
the ninth inning and the San Francisco Giants came from behind
twice to beat the Florida Marlins 11-9 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 9-7, the Giants started the ninth with singles by Barry
Bonds, Jeff Kent and pinch hitter Felipe Crespo to score a run
against Antonio Alfonseca (0-1). Following a forceout, Aurilia hit
his first homer on the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants overcame a 5-4 deficit on Kent's three-run homer in
the fifth. They blew leads of 3-0, 4-1 and 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The sloppy but exciting game drew a crowd of 8,365, the smallest
at Pro Player Stadium in the Marlins' eight-year history.
</P>
<P>
   John Johnstone (1-0) gave up one run in 1 1-3 innings. Robb Nen
pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored three runs in the seventh and took advantage of a
two-out passed ball on a strikeout to take an 8-7 lead. With the
score 7-all, Mark Kotsay swung and missed on a 2-2 pitch from Felix
Rodriguez, but the pitch glanced off catcher Bobby Estalella's
glove and sailed over his head to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins made it 9-7 on Derrick Lee's RBI single in the
eighth, their 12th hit. San Francisco had 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar had a two-run homer and an RBI single for the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants scored three in the first against Vladimir Nunez.
Bill Mueller doubled, Bonds walked and Kent doubled home a run.
Ellis Burks hit a sacrifice fly, and J.T. Snow drove in a run with
a two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco added an unearned run in the second. Estalella
doubled, took third when Nunez bobbled a sacrifice bunt for an
error, then scored on Marvin Benard's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo led off Florida's first with a triple and scored
on a two-out single by Mike Lowell. Mike Redmond led off the second
with his first triple in 364 career at-bats, then scored on Nunez's
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Florida tied the game in the third when Cliff Floyd singled and
Millar homered on a 3-2 pitch with two out.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Kirk Rueter walked the bases loaded in the fourth
and was replaced by Aaron Fultz, who walked Preston Wilson to give
Florida a 5-4 lead. Kent homered in the fifth to put the Giants
ahead 7-5.
Notes: The Marlins' smallest home crowd previously was 8,468 last
Sept. 21 against Montreal. ... Marlins owner John Henry ordered the
removal of the tarps that have covered upper-deck seats in seasons
past. ''Why should we hide the fact that we're playing in a
football stadium and no one is coming out to see us?'' Henry said.
... Florida's Alex Gonzalez went 0-for-5 and is 0-for-13 this
season. ... Outfielder Derrick Gibson cleared waivers, and his
contract was outrighted to Calgary, the Marlins' Triple-A
affiliate. ... Wilson made a leaping catch of Snow's 425-foot fly
at the base of the center field wall in the fifth. ... Fultz,
making his major-league debut, singled in his first at-bat.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Mexican Peasant Wins Prize  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The imprisoned leader of a Mexican peasant
group has been awarded an environmental prize for his efforts to
protect forests in the western state of Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo Montiel, 44, the leader of a band of ''peasant
ecologists'' that battled against forest companies, received the
$125,000 Goldman Environmental Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel says he was arrested, tortured and jailed on trumped-up
drug and weapons charges last year in retaliation for his efforts
to protect the trees. Human rights groups have backed his claims.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities have said that Montiel and his supporters were
protecting marijuana fields, not the environment. Montiel and
members of his group have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   The group formed in February 1998 after rivers and streams were
drying up due to excess logging, Montiel told The Associated Press
in an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   His group would form human chains to stop logging trucks,
sometimes threatening to burn the trucks and their shipments of
old-growth pine and fir. Most of the group's leaders were
eventually forced to flee and Montiel and another member of the
group, Teodoro Cabrera, were arrested May 2.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group Amnesty International and the
environmental group Sierra Club have been campaigning for the
release of the Montiel and Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   The award is one of six that the San Francisco-based Goldman
Environmental Foundation gives annually to environmentalists from
around the world to give them the ''recognition, visibility, and
credibility their efforts deserve.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Transportation Bill Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In an effort to loosen California's
notorious traffic gridlock, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday proposed
spending $5.2 billion on transportation projects around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The plans range from a new ferry on San Francisco Bay to a study
on a proposed 700-mile high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the plan would slow the
spread of gridlock as California's population climbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in some cases easing congestion and in some cases all
we can do is break even,'' he said. ''Did Governor Davis create
congestion? No. Is he going to solve congestion? No. But it will
certainly make the situation better.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis proposes spending $4.7 billion for a variety of rail, bus
and highway projects, including $1.5 billion in the San
Francisco-San Jose area, $2.24 billion in the Los Angeles area,
$481 million in the San Diego area, and $518 million in the Central
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends spending $500 million to ease a backlog in road
maintenance and asks lawmakers to allocate $5 million to begin
environmental studies for a high-speed rail system that would link
Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be funded in part with $3 billion from the
state's largest budget account, the general fund, that would be
spread over four years, and $2.2 billion from a bond measure that
Davis wants to put on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew criticism earlier this week from Democratic Senate
leader John Burton and Republican Assembly Minority Leader Scott
Baugh, who said it failed to address long-term needs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal now goes before the state Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes U.S. Flexibility  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday he welcomed a U.S. decision to be more flexible in talks
on expanding the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats cautioned that reform of the most important U.N.
body was still bogged down by competing national and regional
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
told the General Assembly's Open-Ended Working Group on Monday that
Washington was dropping its demand for any expansion of the council
to have a ceiling of 20 or 21 members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is now prepared to consider proposals that would
result in a slightly larger number of seats than 21,'' he said,
without giving a new ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, speaking to reporters in Rome on Wednesday said he was
encouraged by Holbrooke's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will facilitate transaction among member states for
reform in the council,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, the only U.N. body with power to enforce
its decisions militarily or economically, has five permanent
members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China --
and 10 non-permanent members whose terms rotate every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke stressed that the U.S. position during future
negotiations would be based on the need for the Security Council to
be reformed and strengthened, not merely expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''While progress will not be easy, if we approach this
discussion with a spirit of openness, we can energize this debate
and begin to build common ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and France favor adding five new permanent
seats -- Japan, Germany, and one member from Asia, Africa and Latin
America, to be selected by their regional groups. Those regions are
a long way from agreement on a single country to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Many industrialized and developing countries oppose any
expansion of the permanent members, who have veto power. And
proposals for the size of the council go up to 26 members.
</P>
<P>
   As Italy's U.N. Ambassador Sergio Vento told the working group,
adding new permanent members would be discriminatory and would
further divide the council and make decision-making more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   China's deputy U.N. ambassador Shen Guofang said Beijing is
flexible on the number, but is concerned about maintaining the
council's efficiency and wants to ensure ''the representation of
the developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a step in the right direction,'' said Namibia's U.N.
Ambassador Martin Andjaba, a non-permanent council member. ''We
just hope that it will contribute positively to the process. There
are still a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's U.N. Ambassador Agam Hasmy said Holbrooke's
announcement opens ''the possibility of negotiation'' but if
Washington is only prepared to expand to 22 members it won't
satisfy most developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a long way away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Remember the Previous Bush  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore told union members on Wednesday that
electing George W. Bush would mean a return to the economic hard
times of Bush's father's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We face an opportunity to build on today's prosperity, use it
to make sure no one is left behind, or to choose the other
direction, which would mean a right wing U-turn back to the
Bush-Quayle deficits, the Bush-Quayle recession, the Bush-Quayle
assault on working families,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Workers and union leaders who gathered for a meeting of the
Construction and Building Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, which
has endorsed Gore for the presidency, welcomed the vice president
with raucous applause and shouts encouraging him to be a
''Bushwhacker.''
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging speech, Gore conspicuously avoided a sore
point in his relationship with the labor movement: U.S.-China trade
relations. The AFL-CIO is helping to mobilize demonstrators for a
march on Washington next week against the World Trade Organization
and Clinton administration policy, including permanent normal trade
status for China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his only reference to trade, said ''I will fight to
keep our prosperity going, which means keeping our budget balanced
and paying down our national debt, (and) fighting for free and fair
trade because open markets can create high-paying jobs for our
people here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore focused on domestic issues instead, including the nation's
booming economy, which has had record expansion during the Clinton
administration, with unemployment reaching its lowest in three
decades. A recession had just started to lift when Clinton won the
White House from George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let anybody ever forget what the contrast has been these
last seven years compared to the Bush-Quayle years,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also attacked the younger Bush's record as Texas governor
and his proposals for the White House. He said Bush would raise the
retirement age and divert public education money into
private-school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't be asked by Governor Bush or anyone else to keep
carrying bricks or pouring cement until you're 70 years of age.
Give me a break. Talk about being out of touch,'' Gore told the
crowd of construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks 48th in the nation in the percentage of high school
students who go on to graduate from college, Gore said. The vice
president said anew that he would devote federal money to school
renovation and construction and to hire more teachers if he is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign on Wednesday released a statement
counterattacking Gore on education, saying that nationally test
scores have not improved among poor and minority students during
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''After having had eight years to lead, Al Gore fails to make
the grade,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show the two candidates are evenly matched with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said running against Bush is a ''real close, hard-fought,
neck and neck race,'' but added, ''We have a choice that is as
stark a contrast, that is as clear as any we have ever faced in an
election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was tending to state business in Austin, Texas, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Raking in $600,000 for the Democratic National Committee at an
evening dinner in Annapolis, Md., Gore summed up the Republican
Party's economic message as, ''Let's abandon what has worked so
spectacularly well.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to visit a sick friend, he scuttled plans to fly from
Annapolis to North Carolina. His campaign schedule is to resume
Thursday evening in Florida, with events Thursday and Friday in
Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa. Gore's visit to the Marie G.
Davis Middle School in Charlotte, N.C., was being rescheduled for
April 13, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been courting political independents as well as
traditional supporters such as union members, also will meet next
week with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the nation's best-known independent officeholder, will
travel to Washington for the meeting next Wednesday hoping ''to get
the ear of the vice president on federal priorities for the
state,'' spokesman John Wodele said.
</P>
<P>
   The two met in Minnesota last month.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Gather at Cemetary  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Family members and protesters gathered
Wednesday outside the padlocked gate of a cemetery the state closed
after finding human remains scattered above ground.
</P>
<P>
   An inspection in February revealed that graves at Woodlawn
Cemetery in Compton had been dug up and new coffins placed on top
of old ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were told on Saturday by a state official that cemetery was
full in 1968, and they shouldn't have been burying anybody there
since then,'' said Lawanda Hawkins, one of about 20 protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Consumer Affairs obtained a court order to
have the cemetery closed, saying it ''unlawfully converted single
burial graves to multiple graves, disturbed previously interred
remains and then failed to properly reinter all of the remains
during these conversions.''
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery will remain shut pending administrative hearings on
whether the company that runs it, Evergreen Memorial Care Inc.,
should hold a license to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The phone number for the cemetery office has been disconnected,
and phone calls made to Evergreen Memorial Care after business
hours Wednesday night were not answered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing everything we can to make sure justice is
served,'' said department spokeswoman Tracee Weatherby. ''We are
returning every call that is received. People are asking if the
graves of their loved ones were involved.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell moderately Thursday morning
carrying over weakness on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 120.72 points,
or 0.59 percent, to 20,342.05 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the average closed down 132.16 points, or 0.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.72 yen in late morning trading, down 0.38
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level
of 104.66 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index moved lower as investors
remained cautious amid recent volatile trading in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.92
points to 11,033.92 at Wednesday's close. But the Nasdaq composite
index gained 20.33 to 4,169.22.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 18.48 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,676.57.
The TOPIX closed down 19.24 points, or 1.12 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar came under some selling
pressure amid expectations Japan's economy will continue to recover
under new Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling party insider, he was elected Wednesday to replace
Keizo Obuchi, who remains in a coma and on life support at a Tokyo
hospital after suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said many investors were avoiding making significant
moves ahead of a meeting of finance officials of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations late next week. Finance Ministers and
central bankers from the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Canada are scheduled to meet in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.83 yen, down
from 101.44 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7700 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7750 percent. Its
price rose 0.05 point to 101.12.

<HEADLINE> Braves 9, Rockies 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andres Galarraga isn't just back, he's flashing
his power of old.
</P>
<P>
   After homering in his first game following a one-year layoff,
Galarraga hit a go-ahead, three-run homer Wednesday night that
rallied the Atlanta Braves past the Colorado Rockies 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, who missed all of last season because of elbow
surgery, made his first appearance since a playoff appearance
against San Diego on Oct. 12, 1998. He pitched a perfect ninth for
his first save since recording 30 as a rookie two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are counting on Ligtenberg to be their closer, at
least until John Rocker's suspension ends April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who missed last season for cancer treatment, was
2-for-3 with a walk and was hit by a pitch for the third straight
game. He struck out with two on in the eighth but is 3-for-9 with
five RBIs thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta trailed 6-2 in the fifth before Quilvio Veras' RBI
grounder and a run-scoring throwing error shortstop Neifi Perez on
Reggie Sanders' grounder. Perez also booted Andruw Jones' two-out
grounder in the eighth for an error that allowed two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves down 6-4, Galarraga followed sixth-inning
singles by Quilvio Veras and Reggie Sanders with a drive off Manny
Aybar (0-1) that landed in the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 30,008 didn't stop cheering until the Big Cat came
out of the dugout for a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Kevin Millwood, 18-7 last season as Atlanta won
its eighth straight division title, allowed six runs -- five earned
-- and eight hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton hit a two-run homer in the first, and the Rockies
made it 4-2 in the second when Jones, presented his second
consecutive Gold Glove trophy prior to the game, misjudged Tom
Goodwin's drive to center into a two-run inside-the-park home run.
</P>
<P>
   Jones raced back to the warning track and attempted a Willie
Mays-like basket catch with his back to the plate. But the ball hit
off Jones' glove, and the speedy Goodwin scored easily as Jones
fell into the wall and couldn't retrieve the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez, who went 3-for-4, had an RBI single in the first,
and Brian Bohanon walked Trenidad Hubbard with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 6-2 lead in the fourth on Mike Lansing's
run-scoring, double-play grounder and an error by shortstop Walt
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado right fielder Darren Bragg saved two runs in the fifth
when he made a diving over-the-shoulder grab in right center of a
drive by Weiss with runners at second and third and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon gave up four runs -- three earned -- five hits and four
walks in four innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta OF Brian Jordan missed his second straight game
because of a strained right rib cage. ... Galarraga was hit a
career-high 25 times in 1998 and has been plunked 140 times
overall. ... Goodwin's inside-the-park homer was the sixth in
Colorado history -- the first on the road and the first since Larry
Walker last May 17 against Cincinnati. ... In pregame ceremonies,
Atlanta's Chipper Jones picked up his 1999 NL MVP award as well as
a Silver Bat trophy. Greg Maddux got his 10th consecutive Gold
Glove. ... Walker, the two-time defending NL batting champion,
missed his second straight game because of a strained right calf.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr tallied two goals and an assist as
the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2 Wednesday
night to clinch a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Brown and Robert Lang also scored for Pittsburgh, while Ron
Tugnutt made 31 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, seventh in the Eastern Conference with 86 points, is
five points ahead of both Montreal and Buffalo, and six ahead of
Carolina. Buffalo has three games left, while Montreal and Carolina
each have two.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs failed for the second successive game to clinch their
first division title since 1962-63. Toronto is five points head of
Ottawa in the Northeast Division. The Leafs have two games left and
Ottawa three.
</P>
<P>
   Kris King and Steve Thomas scored for Toronto, but Jagr turned a
2-1 deficit into a 3-2 Penguins lead after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The winger ripped a shot from a bad angle past Curtis Joseph at
8:13 of the second period on a power play and scored again with
1:35 left in the period when he one-timed a pass from Jan Hrdina.
</P>
<P>
   Lang gave Pittsburgh a two-goal lead 1:14 into the third when he
turned in a Jagr pass.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto held a two-man advantage for 1:46 of the third period,
but could not convert.
</P>
<P>
   King opened the scoring midway through the first period when
Kevyn Adams fanned on a shot, leaving King with an open net.
</P>
<P>
   Brown replied for the Penguins when he brought the puck out from
behind the Leafs' net and jammed it past Joseph at 13:31.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas put the Leafs back in front 50 seconds later when he
gathered the puck and sent it home after Jonas Hoglund fanned on a
shot.

<HEADLINE> Astros 11, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jose Lima shook off control problems to pitch
seven effective innings and Daryle Ward homered in the Houston
Astros' 11-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, 1-5 in Three Rivers Stadium last season, have
outscored the Pirates 16-4 in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (1-0), a 21-game winner last season, walked two and gave up
three singles in the first, including a hit by Aramis Ramirez that
drove in two runs. An extra-base hit might have driven Lima from
the game, but he settled down to finish up with six shutout
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Astros starter Shane Reynolds did in outdueling Jason
Schmidt in a 5-2 victory Tuesday, Lima outpitched one of the
majors' best pitchers during spring training, Kris Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Benson was nearly unhittable at times this spring but, just as
Schmidt did, fought his control. He walked No. 7 hitter Richard
Hidalgo and No. 8 hitter Tony Eusebio in a three-run third ahead of
Lima's grounder that glanced off first baseman Kevin Young's glove
for a two-run error. Young led all major league first basemen with
23 errors last season.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio followed with a run-scoring single that made it
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who gave up five runs -- two earned -- in six innings,
quickly got into trouble again in the third. Jeff Bagwell doubled
and Ken Caminiti singled before Moises Alou grounded into a
run-scoring double play.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, starting only because newly acquired center fielder Roger
Cedeno has a sore right elbow, followed with a solo homer to right
field. Ward was 2-for-3 and reached base three times.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays of Cedeno's elbow revealed a bone spur that will be
treated with anti-inflammatory medication. He is listed as
day-to-day and is not expected to be sidelined long.
</P>
<P>
   When Cedeno couldn't start Tuesday's rain-delayed opener, Bill
Spiers took his place in the lineup and made one of the game's key
plays by throwing out rookie Chad Hermansen at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers opened at shortstop Wednesday and had a three-run triple
in a six-run eighth inning started when relievers Scott Sauerbeck
and Marc Wilkins each walked in a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had only one serious threat after the first, putting
runners on second and third in the sixth before Lima got
pinch-hitter John Vander Wal to ground out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Astros were 5-7 against Pittsburgh last season. ...
Pirates 2B Warren Morris (infected shin) took batting practice and
hopes to play Thursday. Mike Benjamin has started for Morris and
has a pair of two-hit games. ... The Pirates did not lose a game
Benson started this spring. ... Pirates C Jason Kendall singled in
the first inning, his first hit since severely dislocating an ankle
in July. ... Alou, who missed last season with an injured knee, has
three hits in two games. ... Ramirez was 3-for-3 and reached base
four times.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Devil Rays 7  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Matt Lawton's three-run homer off Rick White
with nobody out in the ninth inning lifted the Minnesota Twins to a
10-7 victory over the stunned Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton's first homer capped a comeback that began with the Twins
down 7-1 with just six outs to go. It was the 11th time the Twins
had overcome a six-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   White (0-1) gave up singles to Todd Walker and Cristian Guzman
before Lawton's 417-foot shot to right field made a winner of Eddie
Guardado (1-0), who struck out two in one inning of work.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second come-from-behind victory for the Twins in 24
hours. On Tuesday night, the Twins had a two-run ninth-inning rally
to beat Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Yan made the most of his promotion to Tampa Bay's
starting rotation, scattering three hits in seven innings and
leaving his bullpen a 7-1 lead that it frittered away in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who spent his first two seasons with Tampa Bay in the
bullpen, gave up an unearned run, walked one and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays were cruising with a 7-1 lead before the bullpen
surrendered six runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey hit a run-scoring double off Dave Eiland, bringing
on Jim Morris, who surrendered an RBI single to Corey Koskie. That
made it 7-3 and the Devil Rays summoned Albie Lopez, who loaded the
bases by walking Ron Coomer before Jacque Jones' infield single
made it 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Midre Cummings hit a three-run double that barely
eluded the grasp of Dave Martinez in shallow right field. Lopez
struck out pinch-hitter David Ortiz to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Bergman's first start for the Twins lasted all of three
innings as he allowed five earned runs on seven hits, including
Kevin Stocker's three-run homer on a two-out, two-strike pitch in
the third that gave Tampa Bay a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman also gave up RBI singles to Miguel Cairo in the second
and Greg Vaughn in the third.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins surrendered RBI singles to John Flaherty and
Martinez in four innings of relief. Hawkins lost his spot in the
rotation to rookie John Santana with several poor performances in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 1-0 lead in the first when Todd Walker reached
on a two-base error by Fred McGriff and scored on Matt Lawton's
single.
Notes: The game drew just 7,089, just above the 7,020 attendance
on Tuesday. ... Tampa Bay signed Ozzie Guillen, released by Atlanta
last week, to a one-year contract. The three-time All-Star will
join the team for Friday's home opener against Cleveland. ...
Santana, making the jump from Class A, will start night at Kansas
City. ... Hawkins had to jump to avoid McGriff's twirling broken
bat on a fourth-inning groundout.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Scott Pellerin had a goal and two assists in
the third period Wednesday night as the St. Louis Blues overcame
four goals by Marc Savard and clinched the NHL's best record by
beating the Calgary Flames 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Pellerin capped a wild final period by scoring with 5:10
remaining when Calgary goalie Fred Brathwaite's clearing attempt
ricocheted in off Pellerin's skates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the third, Pellerin sent both Scott Young and Pierre
Turgeon in on breaks against Brathwaite. Young beat Brathwaite with
a wrist shot at 3:56 to tie the game at 4-4, and Turgeon gave the
Blues a 5-4 lead at 10:43 when his shot trickled between
Brathwaite's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, before a season-high 20,361 fans, gives the Blues a
league-best 113 points. St. Louis finishes the regular season with
a home-and-home series against the Chicago Blackhawks this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Savard, who had never scored more than twice in a game, beat
Blues goalie Roman Turek with a one-timer at 12:56 of the third
period to tie the game at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pronger had a goal and three assists and Turgeon added
another goal and an assist for the Blues. The victory was the 42nd
for Turek, tying him with New Jersey's Martin Brodeur for the
league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mayers also scored for the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shantz scored Calgary's other goal.
</P>
<P>
   After Pronger scored at the 1:00 mark of the second period to
give the Blues a 3-2 lead, Savard and the Flames took over.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary outshot the Blues 17-5 for the period, and Savard scored
twice to give the Flames a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Savard's second goal of the game came at 11:05 when he stole an
errant Al MacInnis pass and blasted a slap shot from the right
circle that trickled past Turek. He grabbed his third goal of the
game by sneaking in from the left side and shooting a one-timer by
Turek at 19:26.
</P>
<P>
   Savard scored his first goal 5:30 into the contest, on a power
play.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign Shanahan for 4 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- All-Star left wing Brendan Shanahan signed a
four-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brendan has been a very large part of this club's success
since we acquired him in the 1996-97 season,'' general manager Ken
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the team nor Shanahan's agent, Rick Curran, would
disclose terms of the contract. The Detroit News and Detroit Free
Press reported the contract is worth $26 million and contains a
no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy here,'' Shanahan told the Free Press. ''All the
players that come here can't believe what a great hockey town this
is. ... I like what we've built here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, 31, has 77 points and leads the team with 40 goals
going into Friday's game against Washington. He is being paid $4
million this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 215-pound native of Mimico, Ontario, is currently
the 10th-leading scorer in the NHL. His career points total 878 in
945 games.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who became a Red Wing in October 1996, would have been
an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.

<HEADLINE> Bryant Has No Plans To Appeal Ban  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Kobe Bryantreturned to the lineup for the
Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night and said he has no intention
of appealing his one-game suspension for fighting with Chris Childs
of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's agent, Arn Tellem, said earlier Wednesday that he was
considering filing an appeal on Thursday with NBA commissioner
David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ''He mentioned it to me, but I said I don't want to,'' Bryant
said. ''Truthfully, man, I really don't care, I really don't. Arn
is just being an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant lost about $100,000 by sitting out the game, and was
fined $5,000 by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant went to see the movie ''Romeo Must Die'' while sitting
out his suspension on Tuesday and then watched on TV as his
teammates won at Phoenix. He was back in the starting lineup
Wednesday night as the Lakers brought a 10-game winning streak into
their game with Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Childs and Bryant were fined and suspended by the NBA on Monday
for fighting a day earlier in the nationally televised
Knicks-Lakers game. Childs was fined more because he was the
instigator of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said Wednesday he did not think Childs tried to goad him
into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you give him too much credit. I don't think he's that
smart,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Childs, suspended without pay for two games and fined $15,000,
planned to appeal after learning of Bryant's lesser ban.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bryant already served his suspension, the most he could
gain on appeal would be the recouping of some or all of his lost
salary -- $100,000, or 1-90th of his $9 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant would have to appeal to Stern, instead of a grievance
arbitrator, since punishments for on-court behavior are solely the
discretion of the commissioner. Stern would have 20 days to rule
after granting a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   NBA vice president Rod Thorn said Childs instigated the fight.
Bryant was disciplined for responding with a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Childs is scheduled to sit out Thursday's home game against

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 10, Cubs 4  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Edmonds made up for a quiet opener with a
home run, double and three RBIs as the St. Louis Cardinals, again
missing Mark McGwire, overpowered the Chicago Cubs 10-4 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, acquired from Anaheim on March 23, was disappointed
after walking twice and striking out twice in an 0-for-3 opener. He
again walked twice, but also hit a two-run homer to the opposite
field in left in the first inning and had an RBI double in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford also homered and even reliever Rick Ankiel had an
RBI triple for the Cardinals, who haven't missed McGwire's power a
bit. St. Louis has outscored the Cubs 17-5 the first two games with
five homers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hasn't played due to a lower back strain, although he
took batting practice Wednesday and expects to play on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Early-season troubles continued for the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who
was 0-for-4 with two popups and two groundouts. Sosa, who drove in
his first run with a groundout in the sixth, is 2-for-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are struggling with a 1-3 record and only 10 runs the
first four games. Henry Rodriguez also is 2-for-16 and has seven
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen, part of the Cardinals' all-new rotation, allowed
three runs in 5 2-3 innings. He allowed six hits and struck out
one.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who outhit the Cubs 22-12, got five straight hits
in the first off loser Jon Lieber, including doubles by Edgar
Renteria, Fernando Tatis and Craig Paquette, and Edmonds' homer.
St. Louis missed a chance for a bigger inning when Lankford was
easily thrown out at the plate trying to score from first on Tatis'
one-out RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber (1-1) who won on opening day in Tokyo against the New
York Mets, lasted five innings. He allowed five runs, four earned,
on seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals right fielder Eric Davis had a rough second inning. He
took the wrong angle on Shane Andrews' double off the wall, made a
risky snare of Damon Buford's liner on the short hop for a single,
and made a stumbling basket catch of Lieber's warning-track fly
ball to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Davis made up for it with a two-run double off Matt Karchner in
the eighth. Paquette added a sacrifice fly in the three-run
inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jesse Orosco became the eighth pitcher in major-league
history to pitch in four or more decades when he relieved in the
sixth. He also extended his games played record to 1,091. ...
Lankford has 182 homers for fourth on the Cardinals' career list,
one ahead of Jim Bottomley. ... Hentgen is 18-9 for his career in
April. ... The Cubs' Damon Buford is 8-for-17 with seven RBIs for
his career against Hentgen.

<HEADLINE> Kings 108, Spurs 98  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings won at the Alamodome for
the second time this season Wednesday night, getting 28 points from
Corliss Williamson in a come-from-behind 108-98 victory over the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 3-0 against the Spurs this season, with one more
game between the teams set for April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento won despite the absence of leading scorer Chris
Webber, who missed his second straight game with a strained left
hamstring. Vlade Divac added 20 points for the Kings, while Jason
Williams scored 18.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, which lost its third straight game, was led by Tim
Duncan with 28 points. David Robinson scored 23.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, which trailed 58-47 at halftime, rallied behind 12
points by Williamson to cut its deficit to 76-75 entering the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings continued the run in the fourth quarter, seizing their
first lead since the second quarter, 81-80, on Williams' 3-pointer
with 9:38 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento continued to stretch its advantage, grabbing a 95-84
lead on Divac's 15-foot jump shot with 4:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio could get no closer than eight points the rest of
the way as Sacramento connected on eight straight free throws over
the final 1:11.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio trailed 26-16 after the first quarter, then blitzed
the Kings 42-21 in the second as Terry Porter came off the bench to
score 11 points. San Antonio's season-high 42 points in the second
quarter came on 16-of-18 shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Antonio is now 28-9 at the Alamodome this season ...
San Antonio is now 40-12 all-time against the Kings in San Antonio.
San Antonio played without guard Mario Elie, who has a sprained
right ankle. ... Robinson topped 18,000 points for his career and
now has 18,003. He is second all-time for the Spurs, behind George
Gervin, who had 19,383.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Albright's Remarks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister on Wednesday
welcomed a recent overture by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
as a start toward reversing decades of mistrust, but said words
needed to be supported by actions.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's comments last month contained some positive points
that shed light on U.S.-Iranian relations, Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said, according to the official Islamic Republic News
Agency. But he added other comments were unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech March 17 in which she abolished a U.S. ban on
imports of Iranian luxury goods, Albright said that the United
States wanted a ''new relationship'' with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the shah, whom the United States had backed until
it was overthrown by the 1979 revolution, had been brutal to
Iranians, and that Washington had been ''regrettably shortsighted''
in its tilting toward Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither Iran, nor we, can forget the past,'' Albright said.
She also condemned the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
and criticized Iran as a supporter of terrorism, an opponent of
Middle East peacemaking and as bent on acquiring weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright has repeatedly stressed that she will keep
insisting that any U.S. dialogue with Iran include U.S. allegations
that Iran sponsors terrorism and seeks to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Iran denies that it supports terrorists or is seeking mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi said his ministry would give a detailed response to
Albright later. But he said Washington's apparent intention to
improve relations needed to be demonstrated in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the United States is really ready for an improvement in
ties with Iran, it should take practical steps in this regard and
show that it has abandoned its hostile policy,'' Kharrazi told a
joint press conference with Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi called for the release of Iranian assets that are
frozen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is long list of issues which Iran believes should change
before any talks with the United States. Before anything else, we
want to see sincerity from the United States through changes in
Washington's foreign policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his remarks showed a shift in Iran's line on the
United States, Kharrazi said: ''What I said was that Mrs.
Albright's speech revealed some changes in Washington's attitude
toward Iran, but it still contradicts what the U.S. government does
in practice.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sets Israel Pullout Rules  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon on Wednesday announced conditions
for its cooperation with Israel's troop pullout from the country's
south -- demands that could hamper efforts for a peaceful withdrawal
by summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud said U.N. troops would need to help in
disarming Palestinian guerrillas and that the United Nations must
guarantee his nation's territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential letter, released by the government Wednesday,
sought answers from the United Nations ''before Lebanon decides to
discuss other details.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a clear indication by Lebanon that it will not
coordinate the withdrawal with the United Nations before its
concerns are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has occupied 10 percent of Lebanese territory, along
Lebanon's southern border, as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on
northern Israel, since another invasion of the country in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, whose army has come under increasing guerrilla attacks
in southern Lebanon, has said it plans to withdraw its troops with
or without an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has not said whether it will deploy army
troops in the south to ensure stability and has refused to give
Israel any post-withdrawal security guarantees. Israeli leaders
have threatened harsh retaliation against Lebanon if guerrillas
stage attacks on northern Israeli towns after a pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud's letter came in response to word that Israel intended to
withdraw its troops from the south by July.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy assured Annan that Israel will cooperate with U.N.
peacekeeping forces stationed in south Lebanon during the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   American-brokered Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled,
making an agreement before the Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has accused Syria of using Lebanese guerrilla attacks on
Israeli forces in southern Lebanon to put pressure on the Jewish
state to make a deal to give back the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau Damascus lost in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Lebanese citizen held for nearly 10 years in Israel
was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Dirani, 35, was handed over to the International
Committee of the Red Cross at the Lebanese army checkpoint at Kfar
Falous, a crossing in southern Lebanon between the
government-controlled territory and the Israeli-occupied zone,
Lebanese security officials said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Dirani, a distant relative of Mustafa Dirani, a Lebanese
guerrilla leader held by Israel since 1994, was arrested by the
Israeli-allied Lebanese Forces militia in 1987 and taken to Israel
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Ghassan Dirani's detention has not been
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Students Ready To Move On  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Survivors of the Columbine High School
massacre are ready to move on a year after the shooting attack, but
the media spotlight makes progress difficult, students and faculty
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are ready to heal,'' said Crystal Woodman, a senior who
hid under a table in the suburban Denver school during the attack
that killed 12 students, a teacher and the two teen-age gunmen.
''They're ready to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 26 students and faculty members met with media
members. The event, set up by the school district, was to be the
only organized meeting of reporters with students in advance of the
one-year anniversary on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students, teachers, and administrators said they
wanted to publicly express thanks to Columbine Principal Frank
DeAngelis for his efforts at helping them heal and to people across
the country and worldwide for their support.
</P>
<P>
   Some also said they came to dispel what they termed ''myths''
surrounding the nation's worst school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jocks,'' said Woodman, defending athletes who were said to
have terrorized gunman Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. ''We have
really good jocks. Sure, Eric and Dylan got picked on, but we've
all been picked on by different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student said he believed blame was improperly placed on
the school system, the sheriff's department and even parents for
ignoring warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you possibly prepare for a day like that?'' asked Matt
Varney, a senior who left the school two minutes before the
shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to media attention, one student said the school has
become something of a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to move on when you have a vanload of people coming
into the parking lot and taking pictures of where the library used
to be, or coming up to you and asking you where the library is,''
said Sarah Bay, a senior. ''Having pictures taken of where people
died makes it hard.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Elian's Dad To Come to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father will fly to the United
States on Thursday to seek custody of his son, the 6-year-old Cuban
boy who has been the object of an international tug-of-war for the
past four months, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for this reunion to go forward,'' said attorney
Gregory Craig, who met earlier Wednesday in Havana with the elder
Gonzalez and Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Gonzalez ''is prepared to stay here until he has
achieved that objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the father, had said he would not travel
to the United States until he received assurances that custody of
Elian would be transferred from the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, who has cared for him since he survived a boat sinking
last Thanksgiving in which his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a statement
Monday that said, ''Once Mr. Gonzalez arrives in the United States,
the INS will begin transferring care from Lazaro Gonzalez to the
boy's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Wednesday night, ''We take this statement from the
INS to mean and be an assurance that when Juan Miguel comes to the
United States tomorrow, the process for transferring to him, the
care and custody of his son Elian will immediately begin.''
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona welcomed the news that Elian's
father was coming to the United States but said it did not mean
that the boy would be immediately reunited with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still working out the most appropriate manner in which
to proceed with the actual transfer,'' she said. ''This is an issue
that we will be addressing with the family tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night that
it is just matter of days before Elian would be reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told
hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the
Caribbean in town for a regional congress. It is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms, in legal
terms, in political terms,'' Castro said. The Cuban leader said he
would see the father off at airport in Havana at 4 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said only, ''We believe that
the father's travel to the United States could contribute to a
successful resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home of Elian's Miami relatives, word of Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's imminent trip to Washington filtered through a crowd of
more than 150 people clustered behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow is a crucial day. We must prepare,'' demonstrator
Gerardo Barrios shouted into a bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, another man read a prayer to supporters gathered in a
circle under the white glow of TV lights. ''Protect this boy,
Lord,'' they sang in Spanish. But Elian was not inside; he had
departed earlier to visit his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the relatives, Armando Gutierrez, said they
would ask the boy's father to come to Miami, ''meet in the house
and try to work it out as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be a family matter, and Juan Miguel, his wife and
kid (Elian's half-brother) are welcome in this house,'' Gutierrez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro activists also protested outside Attorney General
Janet Reno's Florida home, carrying signs depicting her as the
devil.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives are fighting for permanent custody,
opposing any move to return the boy to Cuba. They have appealed a
ruling that says he should be returned to his father, and
Cuban-American protesters have threatened to form a human chain
around the Miami home where Elian is staying to prevent him from
being sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They have challenged Elian's father to come to their home to
discuss Elian's future.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than flying to Miami, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife
and their infant son will travel Thursday to Washington. U.S. visas
for the three, along with a male cousin, a pediatrician and a
kindergarten teacher, were issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials had also requested visas for 22 others,
including 12 children who were classmates of Elian in Cuba. The
State Department is still reviewing those requests.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to determine how best to transfer temporary custody
to Elian's father were scheduled to resume Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even as Elian lost the love and companionship of his mother
when she died last November, Juan Miguel has lost the love and
companionship of his 6-year-old son for four long months,'' Craig
told reporters gathered at his downtown law office. ''The first
tragedy cannot be reversed. The second tragedy can and will be
ended. We look to the attorney general and to the commissioner of
INS to take immediate action aimed at reuniting Elian with his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   If Juan Miguel Gonzalez had come to the United States, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service was prepared to transfer
temporary custody of the boy from the great-uncle to the father.
But details of the transfer could not be worked out during two days
of negotiations in Miami between lawyers for the government and for
Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has said that for Elian to achieve ''recovery'' after
four months away from home, visas were being sought for the 22
others, including psychologists, a doctor and a senior Cuban
official, in addition to Elian's classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday the six
were approved because ''they were the immediate group. She said it
''seemed like a group that would serve a purpose for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   The six were to have stayed at the home of Cuba's chief diplomat
in Washington, Fernando Remirez. Classes were to be held for Elian
and his 12 classmates at the Remirez home until his fate was
decided.
</P>
<P>
   His case is before a federal appeals court in Atlanta, which
will begin hearing arguments on the case next month.

<HEADLINE> Response to Ethiopia Drought Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Relief organizations called Wednesday for
a broad international response to a drought in Ethiopia that
threatens millions of people with famine.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has warned that nearly 8 million people in
Ethiopia are in need of international aid to survive because of the
drought -- and that as many as 16 million in the region are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Oxfam America and Save the Children
showed a video, shot two weeks ago, showing the skeletal remains of
cattle that have died for lack of food and water and the parched
earth where wells and ponds used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam America's humanitarian director, Michael Delaney said
there was a ''small window of opportunity'' for governments, aid
groups and the people of Ethiopia to ''prevent this crisis from
getting even worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor rains over the past three years have depleted food stocks
and driven farmers to sell their tools, cattle and seeds to buy
what little food and water is available, Delaney said. That has
raised the specter of future food shortages even if rains arrive
for the next planting season in May and June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge those with the capacity to give, to give generously so
that we can save lives,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan told
reporters in Rome, where he is to meet with the head of the World
Food Program, Catherine Bertini, before dispatching her to the
region next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not too late to save lives if we respond at this
point,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's foreign minister, Seyoum Mesfin, complained on
Tuesday at a Europe-Africa summit in Cairo that the rest of the
world had been slow to respond to Ethiopia's warning that famine
was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union officials countered that Ethiopia's
22-month border conflict with neighboring Eritrea was keeping
relief food from the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canada announced Wednesday it was giving $4.28
million for emergency food aid in drought-stricken areas of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   International Cooperation Minister Maria Minna said the money
would be used by the World Food Program to purchase, transport and
distribute emergency food supplies.

<HEADLINE> Castro: Elian, Dad To Be Reunited  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night
that it is just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be
reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told
hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the
Caribbean in town for a regional congress. ''It is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms, in legal
terms, in political terms,'' Castro said as he wound up his speech
at Havana's Karl Marx Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig,
attorney for Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced in
Washington that the father would be traveling to the United States
Thursday with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and with Fernando
Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This courageous father will leave at 4 in the morning (4 a.m.
EDT Thursday),'' Castro said. ''And I, at least, will be there to
see him off.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group would be met on arriving in Washington by
Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches,
who traveled with Craig on his lightning trip to Havana on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader said that the U.S. government still did not
know how it would transfer Elian to his father, but that it would
happen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said earlier
this week that once Gonzalez arrives in the United States it will
begin the process to transfer Elian to his custody from the Miami
relatives who have been caring for him since he was rescued off the
coast of Florida in late November.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami kin has been battling to keep him in the United
States, saying it can give him a better life off the communist
island. But Gonzalez, backed by Castro, has demanded his rights as
Elian's sole surviving parent and insisted that the child be
returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother perished along with 10 others when their boat
sank during the crossing from Cuba to the United States. Since the
tragedy, Elian has become a political poster boy for Cubans with
diametrically opposed ideologies living on both sides of the
Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech Wednesday night, Castro expressed irritation
that much of the rest of the delegation was not granted visas to
travel to the United States to stay with Elian while waiting out a
federal appeal filed by Elian's Miami relatives and assist in his
''rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''More important than the doctors are those 12 children'' from
Elian's first-grade class in Cuba, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba had asked for 28 visas for the trip, for Elian's father,
his stepmother, his little half-brother, a 5th grade boy cousin,
the dozen classmates, and a host of teachers, doctors and other
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list was National Assembly President Ricardo
Alarcon, who has served as adviser to Gonzalez over the past four
months and a senior member of Cuba's communist leadership.
