<HEADLINE> IRA to Decide in November on Ceasefire Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
will decide in November whether to extend their ceasefire declared
a week ago, according to a report from Dublin, the capital of the
Irish Republic today.
</P>
<P>
It said a meeting of the guerrillas' Army Convention would meet
to decide whether it was worth prolonging the truce.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent reported that the IRA wanted Britain to
announce "confidence-building measures" including the release of
IRA prisoners, as a condition for extending the truce.
</P>
<P>
Other measures according to the paper, are the transfer of IRA
prisoners held in jails on the British mainland to prisons in the
Irish Republic and Northern Ireland so they can be closer to their
families.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the IRA also wanted Britain to announce the
departure of some of its 18,000 troops from Northern Ireland, who
have been in the province for 28 years backing up police patrols
against attacks from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the IRA's "total cessation" was
a temporary measure linked to demands for concessions from
Britain's new Labor government.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, many members of the IRA, which has
fount for three decades to oust Britain from Northern Ireland,
were unhappy at declaring the truce that will admit Sinn Fein to
Belfast peace talks which start in September.
</P>
<P>
The Independent quoted Irish police intelligence as saying that
it believed up to 15 percent of the IRA's leadership opposed the
ceasefire.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung
Huot today said Cambodia is willing to join the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as soon as possible despite a
delay in joining the regional group because of the domestic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia welcomed the ASEAN to play a role in stablizing the
situation in Cambodia, said Ung Huot when he returned to Phnom
Penh from the 30th annual meeting of foreign ministers of the
ASEAN last Thursday and Friday and the ASEAN Regional Forum
security conference attended by major Asian and Western countries
on Sunday in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who went to Malaysia in the status of observer,
said the ASEAN had affirmed Cambodia's efforts to solve the
crisis, which began on July 5 with bloody clash between the troops
loyal to First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Alliance Issues Ultimatum to Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Forces opposing the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia today sent out an ultimatum to the
militia, demanding their withdrawal from the capital city of Kabul
in 24 hours, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance warned in the ultimatum if the
Taliban failed to meet the deadline, they would launch a
three-pronged full-scale assault against the Taliban
simultaneously from the west, north and east sides of Kabul, said
the sources in Peshawar, a major city in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have controlled Kabul since September last
year, have so far made no comment on the deadline set by the
opposition alliance, whose forces have advanced to within the
rocket range of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three days, the anti-Taliban forces under the
commander of Ahmad Masood, former Afghan military chief, have kept
military pressure on Kabul with jets and artillery bombardments
while calling for a Taliban pullout from the beleaguered capital.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Saturday by the United Islamic Front for the
Salvation of Afghanistan, the name of the anti-Taliban alliance,
said that only when the Taliban "demilitarize Kabul" could issues
including a cease-fire and exchange of prisoners be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition's call has reportedly been rejected by
the Taliban, who now control about two thirds of the Afghan
territory, saying that they would defend Kabul at all costs.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in Kabul has been tense as the Taliban have
brought in hundreds of young fighters from southern provinces and
reportedly arrested hundreds of people suspected to be opposition
fighters who were said to have infiltrated into the capital.
</P>
<P>
Several diplomatic missions at Kabul have called back their
diplomats because of uncertainty prevailing in and around Kabul
due to the fresh fighting. Over 60 diplomats of various countries
from Kabul arrived in Peshawar bordering Afghanistan Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Opposes Timing of New Housing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said today he opposed going ahead now with the Jewish
housing project at Ras el Amud in East Jerusalem, which threatens
to scuttle the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting today, Netanyahu cited
the bad timing as the reason for his objection to the housing
project. He said Israel was building in Jerusalem, including at
Har Homa, in efforts to "spread our sovereignty over all parts of
the city and strengthen our security presence."
</P>
<P>
The expansion of Jewish settlement in Har Homa in East
Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want as their future capital,
has crippled the Middle East peace process since March.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that despite the government's opposition to the
housing project at this time, this should not be interpreted as a
change in its policy on Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its
eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
He added that Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein is examining
whether the government could block the American real estate
developer Irving Moskowitz from carrying out the housing project
at this time.
</P>
<P>
Most cabinet ministers voiced their support to Netanyahu and
criticized the Jerusalem municipality for having not consulted
with the government in authorizing the controversial housing
project.
</P>
<P>
But several rightist ministers, including Transportation
Minister Yitzhak Levy and Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan,
contended that the project should be carried out without delay.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that timing was a "poor excuse which could not be
used to cover every subject." He said the Ras el Amud project
would constitute the Jewish claim over Mount of Olives area in the
heart of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings from the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and the objection of the Israeli government, the American real
estate developer vowed today to push through his plan and begin
soon the construction work at the Ras el Amud Arab neighborhood,
where he intended to build about 70 housing units for Jews.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israeli Army Radio, Moskowitz expressed anger
at the statements by Jerusalem municipality and Netanyahu's
office declaring that he had decided to delay the housing
project. He argued that the Ras el Amud was not a political
question, but one concerning the right of a private owner to
build on his own property.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that since Israel is a democratic country, nothing
could block his project for any reasons.
</P>
<P>
Backtracking from his earlier hardline position, Likud's
Jerusalem Major Ehud Olmert confirmed today that Moskowitz still
needed further technical approval for going ahead with the
housing project. But he denied he had changed his position in
favor of carrying out the project, adding he did not know how the
Netanyahu government could block it since Moskowitz had obtained
legal permits.
</P>
<P>
The Ras el Amud housing project has revived the old dispute
between Israel and the PNA over the status of Jerusalem at an
unwanted time when the peace process has been deadlocked for four
months.
</P>
<P>
Israeli has claimed whole Jerusalem as the indivisible and
eternal capital of the Jewish state, while the PNA hopes to
establish a Palestinian state with the occupied East Jerusalem as
its capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the issue of Jerusalem should be
settled through negotiations in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In tough reactions to the Ras el Amud project, PNA officials
have repeatedly warned that implementation of the plan would lead
to violent confrontation and kill the moribund peace process.

<HEADLINE> Velayati on Ties with U.S., EU and Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today dismissed earlier reports that Saudi Arabia had
tried to mediate between Tehran and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"No one has brought us any messages (from the U.S.). The
message delivered by the recent envoy of Saudi King was about
bilateral relations and Organization of the Islamic Conference,"
Velayati said in an interview with the Persian-language daily
Kayhan.
</P>
<P>
Arab media earlier reported that King Fahd's envoy Abdul Aziz
Al-Khwather, during his meeting with Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani only July 1, expressed Riyadh's willingness to mediate
between Iran and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati said the U.S. did send signals to Iran and
its messages were "delivered through their interest section at
the Swiss Embassy in Tehran."
</P>
<P>
The two countries cut off their diplomatic relations soon after
the victory of Iran's Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
On relations with European countries, Velayati said Iran did
not want to harm its ties with the European Union, but the
Europeans should have to honor the dignity of Iran, a precondition
set by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei last April.
</P>
<P>
"We do not plan to disrupt our ties with Europe, but the
principle of dignity, as was said by the leader, is one of our
requirements," Velayati said.
</P>
<P>
The EU member countries recalled their ambassadors from Tehran
after a German court implicated Iranian leaders in the murder of
four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
On April 30, Khamenei retaliated by instructing Iranian
government not to allow the German ambassador to return to
Tehran. He said that other EU ambassadors could return but Iran
should not rush to send its ambassadors back to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said in the interview that Iran was engaged in
dialogue with Italy and Germany, but the results were not
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"Our embassies are open in both countries (Italy and
Germany). Our discussions are continuing as before and plenty of
dialogue have been held, but they have not yet to reach the point
as defined by the leader," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the newly formed secularist government headed by
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz in Turkey, Velayati said this
government is doomed to be weak.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister had criticized Turkey's top military brass
for putting pressure on Necmettin Erbakan, the country's first
Islamist prime minister and working for his oust.
</P>
<P>
"Pressures were brought upon to force Mr. Erbakan out of power
just because he is a Muslim. This all shows how Muslims are under
pressure around the world,+ he said.

<HEADLINE> TUC, CBI to Hold Talks on Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between business and
trades union leaders last week could lead to a deal over the Labor
government plan to give workers a legal right to union
recognition, the British newspaper, the Observer said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks appear to have softened the Confederation of British
Industry's (CBI) pre-election hostility to giving unions the right
to be heard where they speak for more than half the "relevant
workforce".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from CBI said: "We remain opposed to the policy in
principle, but we now accept it will happen and we have to talk
sensibly to the unions, to help our understanding and get the best
possible outcome."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month John Monks, the general secretary of the
Trade Union of Congress (TUC) told a CBI audience in a gathering
that he accepted that the unions must meet the employers' genuine
concerns about the plans, on which the Government is pledged to
legislate next year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are discussing guidelines to define the term
"relevant workforce" and pin down how the law should be enforced,
according to the Observer.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting were CBI director-general
Adair Turner, its president Sir Colin Marshall and Tony Greener,
chairman of drinks giant Guinness.
</P>
<P>
Monks headed the unions side, which included Rodney
Bickerstaffe of public service union Unison, John Edmonds of the
GMB general union, Ken Jackson of engineering union AEEU, and Tony
Dubbins of the GPMU printers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the second since the Labor came to power. The
Observer said it showed how times have changed. "The participants
dined on roast loin of pork in a prune and sloe gin sauce," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Settlements Should Be Final Status Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) - The Jewish settlements in Arab East
Jerusalem should be an issue to be discussed at the
Palestinian-Israeli final status talks, Jordanian Foreign Minister
Fayez Tarawneh said today.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh made the remarks to the press after holding talks
here with visiting Mahmoud Abbas, top Palestinian peace negotiator
and Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Saturday officially condemned the authorization by
Israeli Jerusalem Municipality of a United States millionaire to
build 70 Jewish homes in the heart of the Arab neighborhood
of Ras El Amud.
</P>
<P>
This is the first reaction of Jordanian government saying that
the new settlement plans would further aggravate tension between
Israel and the Palestinians which started when Israeli government
began to build the first settlement Arab East Jerusalem in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had noticed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had a positive stand on the Amud settlement and also
learnt that the settlement would be postponed, he said, adding
that settlements were final status issue and should not be an
unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been deadlocked since
February when Israeli government decided to build the
settlements. Talks to salvage the process have been mediated by
the international community, but none of them have produced any
positive results.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Dismisses Reported Tripartite Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) - Jordan's Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh here today dismissed as speculation a reported tripartite
meeting among Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the clarification after talks with
Mahmoud Abbas, top Palestinian peace negotiator and Secretary
General of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO), Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Peace coordination among Jordan, the Palestinians and Egypt
was now at its highest level, but a tripartite meeting was just a
"speculation," said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, efforts were underway for Jordan to foster
closer relations with the Palestinians, the minister said, adding
bilateral talks began soon after Abbas arrived in Amman Saturday
on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Jordanian consultation came after the Israeli
Jerusalem Municipality permitted a U.S. Jewish millionaire to
build 70 housing units in the heart of the Arab neighborhood of
Ras el Amud in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has condemned this move, the second in four months. The
Israeli decision in March on expanding Jewish settlement in Har
Homa put the Middle East peace process to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to revive the crippled peace talks between the
Palestinian and Israelis have so far been to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Jordan helped mediate in January this year the Hebron accord
setting forth the Israeli pullout from Hebron and West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Continue Voicing Opposition To New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
are continuing their strong opposition to Israel's decision to
establish a new Jewish settlement in the heart of an Arab
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ziyad Abu Zayad, Jerusalem member of the legislative
Palestinian Council, warned of disastrous consequences if the
construction goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Municipality approved Thursday the construction
of more than 100 housing units in the Ras El-Amud section of the
Mount of Olive, and Arab neighborhood. The decision triggered a
wave of furious condemnation from the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Zayad told Israel Radio that the settlement means that there
will be continuous provocations and fictions which will make
troubles and problems every day.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jerusalem is one of the issues of upmost
importance in the final-status talks. But now Israel wants to
change the fact on the ground in Jerusalem. If such a thing is
allowed, he noted, "there will be no chance for the future talks
because of fear and suspicion on both sides."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on press reports that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would try his best to block the construction, Zayad
expressed doubt about his sincerity, saying that this is not
the first time that this government and this prime minister
say something and do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said: "I hope sincerely that this time he
will stand by his words and will not allow Ras El-Amud project."
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian negotiator, expressed welcome to
Netanyahu's statement of opposition to the new settlement. But
he noted that the statements made by Netanyahu and other
government ministers would be translated into an act to cancel
all settlement constructions altogether.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, PLO Executive Committee member, and officials
from the Palestinian National and Islamic Committee to Confront
Settlements held an urgent meeting in East Jerusalem this evening
to discuss ways and means to cope with the Jerusalem
Municipality's decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian-Palestinian Technical
Committee met here today to put forth a joint mechanism to
facilitate the goods inflows between Jordan and the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were keen to boost trade exchanges, said Jordanian
Minister of Trade, Industry and Supply Hani Mulki, after holding
talks with Hany Salami, an adviser to Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Jordan and the Palestinians reached
21 million U.S. dollars in the first eight months of 1996,
compared to 20 million dollars in the whole year of 1995,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, Amman Chamber of Industry Chairman Khaldoun Abu
Hassan was quoted as saying recently that the goods flows were
slower than expected and this could only be attributed to the
Israeli security measures.
</P>
<P>
Israel wanted to continue its monopoly of the Palestinian
market which has no choice but absorbs between 2.7 billion
dollars and 4 billion dollars annually worth of Israeli-made
products, the chairman stressed.

<HEADLINE> Velayati Rejects Calls to Cut off Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati has rejected appeals from the hardline camp that Tehran
must completely sever its relations with Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"We can not forget the Egyptian nation and the great Islamic
country of Egypt," Velayati said in an interview appearing on the
Persian-language evening newspaper Kayhan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries resumed diplomatic ties in 1991 after a lapse
of 12 years, at a lower level of interest sections. However, their
relations again soured in 1992 after Cairo accused Tehran of
supporting Egypt's underground Islamic movement with money and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Egypt's position has changed over the past three
years - it has been distancing itself from the position it adopted
in the Camp David Accord hammering out peace between Egypt and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed by then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and

<HEADLINE> Sex Education Called for in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive sex education,
especially for young people, has been suggested as a measure to
curb the high incidence of unsafe abortion in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Unsafe abortion contributes to about 50 percent of Nigeria's
nearly 75,000 annual maternal deaths, according to a communique
released at a workshop on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of family planning options would drastically
reduce unsafe abortion, said participants, quoted by local media
today.
</P>
<P>
While calling for family planning information and services to
men, they said the abortion law, which was full of defects,
should be reformed to protect women from unskilled personnel and
reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by a local non-government
organization, the Campaign Against Unwanted Pregnancies, in Ogun
State, western Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Kills 9, Injures 57 in Belgian Air Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nine people including a
22-month-old girl were killed and 57 injured when a biplane
crashed during an air show in the Belgian town of Ostend late on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Five of the dead are Belgian and two are from France. The pilot
who was also killed in the incident is from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Of the injured who were hurried to local hospitals by
helicopters, 10 were badly hurt and several were in critical
conditions, local television reported on Sunday. Doctors of local
hospitals feared that the death toll might still rise.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of a Falco XT-300, which belonged to the Jordanian
air force, apparently lost control while doing a looping stunt and
the plane plunged into a Red Cross tent some 150 meters away from
spectators, some of whom were sprayed with burning kerosene, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Ostend is a seaside resort by the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Ostend air show has been staged five times and Saturday's
crash was the first.
</P>
<P>
Aviation experts and Falco engineers from Germany are
collecting parts of the crashed plane which had been specially
designed and manufactured for aerial stunts and the biplane was
made of light-weight composite materials.
</P>
<P>
The experts will also be helped by some video recordings shot
by photography amateurs on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Interior Minister Vande Lanotte, who accompanied the
Belgian king and queen as well as Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene
on a condolence trip to Ostend Sunday morning, said that
investigation was underway and it was too early to attribute the
cause of the crash to either human error or mechanical failure,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation may take some time to come up with any
conclusion. The crash of a Belgian air force C-130 transporter at
Eindhoven last year took two weeks to produce a preliminary report
on the accident.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Think Crime Is Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Most Canadians still live in fear
despite studies showing drops in violent crime across the country,
said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll, conducted for CTV News by the Angus Reid
group, indicated most Canadians, especially those in western
Canada, believe crime in their communities is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine of those surveyed said they believe crime in their
community has gone up in the past five years. Thirty percent think
the rate of crime hasn't changed, and only 8 percent believe that
crime is going down.
</P>
<P>
The anxiety about crime seems to grow in intensity in the four
western provinces. Seventy-eight percent in British Columbia said
they believe crime is on the rise, and 30 percent said there had
been a "great increase" in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, crime ranks atop the list of concern for people in
the four provinces, while unemployment is the chief concern for
those in Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one percent of those surveyed said they fear being a
victim of crime in their own community, with 5 percent having a
"great deal" of fear they will be a victim.
</P>
<P>
An earlier government report said violent crime in Canada is
decreasing, and the murder rate was at a 25-year low.
</P>
<P>
According to John Wright, senior vice-president of the Angus
Reid Group, fear remains high because media reports of crime,
especially violent crime, continue to bombard the public.
</P>
<P>
"People are sensitized to it because it makes news, because
it's in their face every single day," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Old Soldiers Meet To Mark Army's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of ranking army officers
and ex-soldiers who fought against the Kuomintang regime and the
Japanese invaders from the 1920s to 1940s held a panel discussion
in Beijing today to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of
the Communist-led armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Those participating in today's gathering spoke highly of the
army's successes since it came into being on August 1, 1927, when
Communists led an uprising against the Kuomintang warlords and set
up bases in some mountainous areas for armed struggle against the
reactionary Kuomintang regime.
</P>
<P>
General Liu Huaqing made a speech on behalf of the Central
Military Commission and the headquarters of the People's
Liberation Army and expressed his respect for all the old soldiers
who have fought for the nation's independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that the
present duties of the army are to sum up the past experiences and
improve its work so as to provide a powerful security guarantee
for the country's reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He urged everyone present to follow and promote Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics to keep the army on the correct
development path.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) has absolute leadership over
the army, and army act in harmony, ideologically and politically,
with the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, the
general said.

<HEADLINE> China To Be Top Color TV Manufacturer By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China will become the world's
leading producer of color TVs by the year 2000, when it is
expected to turn out 33 million sets, eight million of which will
be sold overseas, sources at the State Planning Commission said
today.
</P>
<P>
The country currently has the capacity to manufacture 30
million color TVs annually, with a yearly output of 25 million
sets, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But some problems have hampered the development of the industry
in China: The country mainly produces low- and middle-level
products, has difficulty developing new products, relies on
imports for some key parts, and moves slowly in exploring the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The commission has proposed that during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), the industry should speed up industrial
restructuring by forming more manufacturing company groups. It
should also put a stop to the practice of blindly setting up and
expanding production lines, improve the ability to develop new
products, and do more to open the international market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industry should further explore the domestic
rural market, and crackdowns should be made on the smuggling of
color TVs and parts.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Law on Donations  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting a law on
donations to promote the healthy development of its fledging
public welfare system, according to a top Chinese legislator.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunsheng, deputy director of the Commission of
Legislative Affairs under the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), told a symposium here last week that the
draft law on donations was created to keep the country's
increasing amount of monetary gifts under control.
</P>
<P>
"The law is expected to be adopted to encourage and guide
various kinds of donations for public welfare, and to standardize
the activities of donations, money raising and use of donations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A draft law was made during a symposium on the donation law
held from July 22-25. The meeting was sponsored by the Commission
of the Legislative Affairs under the NPC Standing Committee, the
NPC Overseas Chinese Affair Committee and the China Charity
Federation (CCF).
</P>
<P>
However, the legislative affairs officials believed that the
legal procedure for the donations law should be clarified, and
there is a need to consult with the public, since this is the
first law of its kind in the country and will be of interest to
the masses.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thomson-CSF and Siemens, two
European electronic giants, will be able to jointly develop air
traffic management under the approval by the European Commission
(EC).
</P>
<P>
The EC, the executive body of the European Union, said in a
press release today that it has approved a joint-venture agreement
between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
The two groups are to develop part of the airport turnkey
system known as the Airsys.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic management covers all the ground systems and
equipment needed to provide full air space surveillance and
control facilities to ensure full safety to civil air transport
activities.
</P>
<P>
Though market demand slowed down in the past few years after a
period of strong growth during the 1980s and early 1990s, it is
still a growing market due to the fact that many countries are
modernizing and will modernize and standardize their air traffic
management on the basis of emerging new technologies.

<HEADLINE> All People Urged To Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
called on the country to use water economically and to be fully
aware of the urgent need to conserve it.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun discussed the issue during today's
national telephone and TV conference on the work of water
conservancy which was jointly held by the State Planning
Commission, the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, who is also a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
China is short of water resources; It's per capita possession of
water resources reaches only one fourth of the world's average.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that there is a serious problem of wasting
water in the country as the use rates of water in agricultural and
industrial sectors stand at merely 30-40 percent and 50-60
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
To provide more water resources and save water has become a
strategic issue for the country's sustained economic and social
development, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
While trying to find more water resources, greater efforts
should be made to build up water-saving industries and cities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that more water conservancy projects be built, and
advanced technology be adopted to reduce the consumption of water
in farming and industries and prevent water sources from being
polluted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the conference that the central government has set
up a water conservancy fund to encourage the construction of
water-saving facilities.
</P>
<P>
From now on, he said, the government will not approve projects
that do not meet the requirements for water-conservancy.

satellite is in stable condition and has sent back many clear
photos of the earth since it was launched in June 10, according to
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The pictures have been shown as part of the weather forecast
broadcast by China Central Television (CCTV). The satellite will

Technical Physics in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the radiometer can monitor the dynamic
meteorological changes above China and neighboring countries in a
synchronous orbit 35,800 kilometers above earth. It also can
provide timely meteorological information that is valuable for
short- and long-term weather forecasts and for natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The radiometer is the result of 15 years' work by scientists
from the Institute of Technical Physics and five other institutes

KATHMANDU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The age-old discrimination
against women exists not only in other sectors but also in
communications, Nepali Minister for Information and Communications
Jhalanath Khanal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Women constitute 12 percent of the journalists working in the

journalists working in the private sector are included in the

Group.
</P>

enough to increase women's participation in the media, there
should be laws to encourage this, local press reported today.

<P>
Former Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said
scholarships should be awarded and incentives should be given to
women to take up journalism.
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Krishna Bahadur Bhattachan said women hesitate to
join the media because of negative attitude, male domination,

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Nigeria to Resolve Diplomatic Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and Nigeria's top leader Sani Abacha have been in
regular contact and would resolve the latest diplomatic row
between them, presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said today.
</P>
<P>
The tension follows Nigerian Information Minister Walter
Ofonagoro's slating of Mandela as the "black head of a white
country", and his claims that South Africa is spearheading
anti-Nigerian propaganda.
</P>
<P>
In a diplomatic note to Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Ministry
last week, the South African government objected to Ofongagoro's
"serious and unprovoked attack" and asked for "immediate
clarification".
</P>
<P>
The note said, "an apology to President Mandela and the people
of South Africa would seem reasonable."
</P>
<P>
However, no apology has yet been forthcoming, South African
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the South African government has
requested an apology from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Abacha described Mandela as "someone who has
lost touch with realities" after his 27 years in jail. The
military leader was asked to apologize for the statement after
both the ambassadors in Lagos and Pretoria were recalled.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries deteriorated in 1995
following Mandela's hardline approach against Abacha's government
for executing Ken Saro Wiwa and other activists.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Seismology Exhibition Takes Place in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijingers worried about what to
do in the event of an earthquake can ease their fears at China's
largest-ever seismology exhibition, currently on show at the
Geological Museum in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Computer images vividly illustrate facts about earthquakes and
important safety tips in case a quake hits. The exhibition will go
on tour nationwide after its run in Beijing closes on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zangli, director of the State Seismology Bureau, said that
China has frequent seismic activity; about 29 provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions have been hit with
earthquakes in this century with a magnitude of more than six on
the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in 1988 China entered its fifth period of
seismic activity, which will continue into the next
century. During this time, precautions against earthquakes will be
jointly taken by governments, special departments, and the Chinese
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is co-sponsored by the State Seismology Bureau,
the State Education Commission, the State Science and Technology
Commission, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the
People's Insurance Company.

PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China today urged
the European Union (EU) to avoid confrontation on the question of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos here,

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Maps on Display in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Well-known ancient Chinese maps
which date as early as 860 years ago are being displayed in a
unique exhibition which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition named "History Through Maps" in the Hong Kong
Museum is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Provisional Urban
Council (PUC) and the National Library of China.
</P>
<P>
Among the over 70 ancient maps on display are 29 pieces from
extremely rare cartographic documents on loan from the National
Library, more than 30 from the collection of famed Hong Kong
collector Tam Siu-cheung and the rest are lent by the Hong Kong
University, Hong Kong Museum of Art, Public Records Office and the
Hong Kong Museum of History.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits are of seven categories -- world maps and general
maps of China, maps of administrative divisions, maps of
metropolis, maps of scenic spots, maps of military significance,
maps of economic undertakings and maps of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Among those on display are the impressive Pingjiangtu, which is
the first and largest map of a Chinese city, and famous Yujitu
dated 1136 AD, which is the oldest map using lattice grid with
scale.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that most traditional ancient Chinese maps were
presented either pictorially in the style of Chinese landscape
painting with little concern of scale, or more scientifically in
the form of Jilihuafang with the land drawn to a grid scale of a
certain li (a Chinese unit of length which is approximately
equivalent to 0.5 kilometers) to each division.
</P>
<P>
The style was brought to Europe via Arabia about 700 years ago
by traders and commissioners, which directly prompted the
breakthroughs in European cartography.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Cuts Borrowing Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
said today it will reduce its overnight borrowing rate from 25
percent to 22 percent Tuesday with the country's currency peso
stabilizing in the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The local ABS-CBN television quoted central bank officials as
saying that the bank expected the peso to stabilize against the
U.S. dollar in the coming days after weeks of turmoil in the
foreign currency market.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time for the Central Bank to cut its key
borrowing rate since the peso was allowed to move in a wider range
in a de facto depreciation on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the fresh reduction in interest rate will help
buoy the local bourse which has been bearish for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank spiraled up its overnight borrowing rate to a
four-year high of 32 percent early this month in a bid to fend the
peso off the fierce speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
The bank has indicated that it will correspondingly reduce
hefty interest rates as the foreign currency market stabilizes.
Economists have warned that continued high interest rates will
slow down the economy.
</P>
<P>
The peso is pegged at 28.47 against one U.S. dollar today at
the Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic currencies
exchange. This represented a significant recovery of the peso from
its lowest level of 29.45 to one dollar recorded soon after the
announcement of the effective devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson has projected earlier the
average peso-dollar exchange rate to rebound to between 26.50
pesos and 27.00 pesos by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
But economists said it is very difficult for the peso to return
to the level of 26.40 pesos to one dollar kept by the Central Bank
prior to its depreciation.

<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li
Peng and his Japanese counterpart Ryutaro Hashimoto will exchange
visit this year, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister will visit China in early September
while Li Peng will visit Japan within this year with dates yet to
be fixed.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers
here today, the two sides expressed the hope that the visits would
further contribute to the healthy and steady development of
bilateral relations, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
during the meeting that the 25th anniversary of the normalization
of Sino-Japanese relations should be warmly celebrated.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda hoped the forthcoming
visits of the two prime ministers would lay a solid foundation for
the development of bilateral relations in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also shared the view that the two
sides should speed up the process of negotiations on a new
agreement on fisheries and finalize the accord soon, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two foreign ministers also discussed
international and regional issues of common concern including the
U.N. reform and the Korean Peninsula issue.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. reform, Qian said the reform should reflect the
demands of the developing countries and ensure their
representation.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed to strengthen their
consultations on the U.N. affairs.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- While the nation's current deficit
surpassed the 10 billion U.S. dollars mark in the first half of
this year, South Korea's central bank expects the current account
to be in better situation by year-end.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current-account deficit totaled 10.28 billion
U.S.dollars for the first half of this year, up 4.7 percent from
last year, the Bank of Korea said today.
</P>
<P>
The unrequited transfer deficit slid from 420 million
U.S. dollars to 330 million U.S. dollars, but the visible and
invisible trade deficits rose from 5.64 billion U.S. dollars and
3.76 billion U.S. dollars to 6.06 billion and 3.9 billion,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicted the current-account deficit for the
whole year would be 17 billion U.S. dollars against last year's
23.72 billion.
</P>
<P>
Kwak Tong-joon, senior research economist of the central bank,
said the trade deficit for the latter half of the year would be
less than one billion U.S. dollars, as the nation's economic
slowdown put brakes on import growth while exports continue to
rise.
</P>
<P>
In June, exports jumped 8.8 percent and imports rose 4.5
percent resulting in a trade surplus of 260 million U.S. dollars
for the first time since December 1995.

BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thomson-CSF and Siemens, two
European electronic giants, will be able to jointly develop air
traffic management under the approval by the European Commission
(EC).
</P>
<P>
The EC, the executive body of the European Union, said in a

</P>
<P>
The two groups are to develop part of the airport turnkey

Air traffic management covers all the ground systems and
equipment needed to provide full air space surveillance and
control facilities to ensure full safety to civil air transport
activities.
</P>
<P>
Though market demand slowed down in the past few years after a
period of strong growth during the 1980s and early 1990s, it is
still a growing market due to the fact that many countries are
modernizing and will modernize and standardize their air traffic
management on the basis of emerging new technologies.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa States to Join Hands Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are
scheduled to have an east African regional meeting to map out a
strategy in order to stop smuggling on their common borders and
on Lake Victoria, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper, "The East African", said that the meeting to
be held this week in Kisumu, western Kenya, is mainly designed
"to find concrete solutions to the sophisticated and usually
armed smugglers".
</P>
<P>
The Kisumu meeting is a follow-up to a recommendation made
earlier in Arusha, northern Tanzania, by a technical committee
appointed last year to deal with the taxation and revenue
problems of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the committee have held meetings
on how to deal with the problems affecting the operations of the
revenue authorities in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past, individual countries in the east African region
have tried to tackle the problem of smuggling without much
success.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Jack Bigirwa, acting Assistant Commissioner
in the Uganda Revenue Authority, as saying that "we realize that
no country can stop smuggling individually."
</P>
<P>
As a land-locked country, Uganda is worst affected by the
smugglers' activities. Besides the border posts at Malaba and
Busia, smuggling is rife at other points on Lake Victoria,
especially at Gaba landing site, six kilometers east of Kampala,
and Kasenyi in Entebbe.
</P>
<P>
However, investors in Uganda argued that unless taxes in the
east African region are harmonized, meetings like the Kisumu one
would not achieve much.

He said that China will approve no more polyester-manufacturing
firms which are solely-funded or controlled by foreigners.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Final Appeal (CFA),
the super appellate in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), is ready to accept and hear cases at any time as
of today.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the new appointments of 15 non-permanent judges of
the court took effect. This means the completion of final
formation of the CFA.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong had no power of final adjudication during the 156
years of British rule, which ended at midnight on June 30. In

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Launch Retirement Protection Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong sets to launch the
Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Scheme by the end of 1998, so as to
 provide an enlarged retirement protection umbrella for its aging
population, according to a principal official of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government here today.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Hui, secretary for Financial Services, said today, "The
target of the Hong Kong SAR government is to implement the MPF
Scheme as soon as possible." He hoped that most of the preparatory
 work would be completed by the end of next year, and the MPF
system could commence operations soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The MPF Scheme is a privately managed, mandatory, fully funded
scheme supervised by the government, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, protection for the aged in Hong Kong has been
based on individual savings or insurance arrangements, or on the
publicly managed Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme,
which is financed by tax revenue to offer bottom line support for
the needy.
</P>
<P>
"However, less than one third of the workforce of three million
 people is covered by voluntary retirement scheme," said
Hui. "Prudence demands that we establish a formal retirement
system as soon as possible, involving both employees and
employers."
</P>
<P>
Considering the aging population, he said that a MPF scheme
should be set up as soon as possible. "Otherwise, an intolerable
burden will be put on our taxpayers in future," he added.
</P>
<P>
People aged 65 or above currently accounts for ten percent of
Hong Kong's population of 6.4 million, and the percentage will
rise to 13 percent in 20 years' time and will further move up to
20 percent in another 20 years' time.
</P>
<P>
To implement the retirement protection system, the government
has worked out the MPF draft legislation to solicit comments from
various sectors. The next step is to study in detail these
comments and submit the legislation for enactment as soon as
possible, Hui said.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein, Britain Hold First Talks Since Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), held their
first talks with British officials today since the IRA called for
a ceasefire a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's vice-president Pat Doherty headed the delegation to
meet government officials in Belfast to discuss Northern Ireland
peace process and the substantive multi-party peace talks slated
for mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also planned to meet former U.S. Senator George
Mitchell, who is chairing the slow-moving negotiations between
pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has waged a military war against the British
rule of Northern Ireland over the past 28 years, declared a truce
a week ago, allowing Sinn Fein to gain a seat in the September
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
To date, there have been no IRA attacks although British
security forces and the armed 12,000-strong Northern Ireland
police remain on the alert against violence by Irish republicans
or their Protestant pro-British loyalist foes.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Protestant unionist parties, however, voted
against Anglo-Irish plans to seek "parallel decommissioning" of
IRA arms during the negotiations, which made a setback to the
government's arms surrender plan.
</P>
<P>
The vote will be discussed when Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam and Irish Foreign Minister Ray Burke meet in
Dublin on Tuesday.

<P>
BEIDAIHE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first mayors' workshop on
environmental protection ended here today after nine days of
discussion and brainstorming meant to improve local authorities'
environmental awareness and their ability to make effective
environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Organization Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP) and supported by the
World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
Experts from the SBEP, the WWF, Beijing University, the Wetland

<HEADLINE> Burundi Rivals Agree on Another Peace Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi parties, which
attended peace talks in Rome last March, are planning fresh
negotiations on peace in Arusha, northern Tanzania, local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Nairobi-based weekly, The East
African, said that the Arusha talks would be under the auspices
of Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Felix Mosha, spokesman of Nyerere, said that the talks would
be held in mid-August and the exact date would be announced
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Nyerere would like the meeting to be
"very carefully handled to avoid interference with the peace
process itself."
</P>
<P>
The Burundi FRODEBU party, which opposed the Rome talks on
ground that they closed the doors to many other Burundi parties,
said that it favors the Nyerere initiative.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome all peace talks under mediation of Mwalimu
Nyerere," said Simba Rushatsi, a spokesman for the exiled FRODEBU
president, Jean Minani.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the People's Reconciliation Party (PRP),
Mathias Hitimana, is on his way to Arusha from Brussels for the
talks, a close relative said in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The National Party for Reforms (PARENA), which is led by
former Burundi President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, will send a
delegate to Arusha, but Bagaza himself will not attend the talks
as he is not allowed to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
A faction of the Tutsi-majority party of the Union Pour le
Progress Natinale (UPRONA), is expected to attend the Arusha
conference, but the other UPRONA faction, is unlikely to go to
Arusha, according to an informed source.
</P>
<P>
The Rome talks last March were attended by representatives
from the Burundi government, the National Council for the Defense
of Democracy (CNDD), the largest Hutu movement, and the
mediators.
</P>
<P>
The Rome talks were described by CNDD leader Jerome Ndiho, as
mainly aimed at signing a cease-fire, which provided a "better
atmosphere for the political talks in Arusha to take place."
</P>
<P>
Ndiho's fighting movement of CNDD signed a framework agreement
in Rome on the basis of negotiations with the rival
representatives of Burundi President Major Pierre Buyoya who
assumed power after a coup a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Though a small country in Africa, political climate in Burundi
has been plagued by racial and political confrontations, with
bloodshed and military coups in the passing decades.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi
have dominated the political instability in the country. Hutu
takes up about 83 percent of the country's population, while
Tutsi has about 16 percent of the population.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Lays Down Economic Strategy for Last Year in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today made his last state-of-the-nation address, calling for the
two chambers of Congress to pass a number of strategic bills to
help the country pole-vault into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In his farewell message to the Congress here, he said he would
not be a lame duck president during the last 11 months of his term
which will expire next June. He reiterated that he would not seek
a second term.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the Philippines will be highly competitive in the
next century, Ramos asked the Congress to pass some pending bills
such as the remaining components of the Comprehensive Tax Reform
Program, Social Reform Agenda, the Electoral Reform Bill, the
Poverty Alleviation Act and other important economic measures.
</P>
<P>
Ramos stressed that one of his government's top priorities in
the remaining period is the modernization of the country's
agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
"To spur the development of agriculture and industry, this
Congress must now pass bills pending since 1995 that provide for
more funds for irrigation, agrarian reform and more electric power
from renewable indigenous resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Congress should also support the fisheries
sector, mandate the efficient allocation of land for agriculture
and industry and encourage the development of appropriate
technology.
</P>
<P>
On the financial situation of the country, Ramos said the
recent depreciation of the peso might be a blessing because the
country was given an opportunity to enhance the competitiveness of
the peso.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the peso will not only conserve the
country's foreign exchange reserves and increase the real incomes
of exports and tourism-related industries, but also reduce trade
deficit and create more jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the same speech, Ramos also enumerated the achievements of
his administration for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the Philippines made a
spectacular economic turnaround from an almost zero growth in 1992
to a solid 6.8 percent in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, he added, the Filipino's per capita
income grew from 840 U.S. dollars to 1,250 dollars and the exports
rose from a 4.3 percent growth to a 23.9 percent while the
inflation lowered from 18.7 percent to 4.6 percent and the poverty
rate declined to 35 percent from 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also said that in 1996 alone, the government created some
1.5 million jobs, reducing the nation's unemployment rate from 9.8
percent to 8.6 percent.

</P>
<P>
The Sino-African ties are the model of sincere, equal and
friendly cooperative relations between developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese officer briefed the Nigerian visitors on China's
defensive defense policy and its military construction.

</P>
<P>
The move applies to all container traffic of Jordanian and
non-Jordanian origins exported via Aqaba and is expected to
come into effect early next month after it is published in

<P>
COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka today denied its forces
destroyed an Indian trawler and shot dead two Indian fishermen off
the northern coast of island country, according to a news release
from the Foreign Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told Indian
High Commissioner in Colombo Nareshwar Dayal that a thorough
investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defense proved that
neither the navy nor the air force were involved in the alleged
shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
On July 16, Indian fishermen complained that the Sri Lankan
navy had shot and destroyed an Indian trawler, killing two Indian
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
On July 17, the Indian high commissioner complained that
another Indian fishing vessel had been attacked by the Sri Lankan
air force.
</P>
<P>
With reference to the July 17 incident, Kadirgamar said the
government of Sri Lanka categorically refutes the monstrous
allegation that Sri Lankan aircraft deliberately intruded deep
into the Indian territorial waters and attacked fishermen off
Arcotthurai on the Indian coast.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar told the Indian high commissioner that it must
always be remembered that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) rebels waging a 14-year war for a separate state, are
constantly looking out for opportunities of disrupting the good
relations that exist between Sri Lanka and India.

BAGHDAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has described the United States as the biggest environment
polluter in the world, accusing it of having been politicizing
the environment issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president made the accusation during a cabinet

</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity of giving attention to what takes
place at international and regional conferences, especially when
Westerners claim that a given branch of industry is
environment-polluting, for they have often abandoned such a
branch of industry and are subsequently attempting to deprive
other nations of engaging in it with the aim of keeping them
backward.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the cabinet meeting discussed a study of
environmental conditions in Iraq submitted by Iraq's Environment
Protection Council, and took measures to improve environmental
conditions giving special attention to keeping rivers clean.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Sell Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- As a solution to its persistent
fuel scarcity, Nigeria may hand over two of its refineries to two
multinational oil companies, Shell and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Tribune reported today that a deal to this effect
is now being worked out between the Nigerian government and the
two companies.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the talks now is whether the deal will be based
on a partnership and who would have the controlling share.
</P>
<P>
With a daily production of about two million barrels of crude
oil, Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The country, however, has been suffering from periodical fuel
shortages in the last few years, due to poor management and lack
of funds to keep its four refineries in good state.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Nigeria has been importing refined oil products
from Cote d'Ivoire, whose only refinery, a privately owned
business, depends on Nigeria for supply of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The government's new approach is a realization that
privatization might be the only solution before it gets rid of
fuel scarcity for good, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering increasing the prices of
petroleum products and cancel the subsidies so that privatized
refineries can run on commercial bases, it added.

<HEADLINE> Macao To Make 31.6 Million Dollars by Selling Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Macao is making a fortune by selling
stamps as the government is expected to gain 250 million patacas
(about 31.6 million U.S. dollars) from stamp-issuing, more than
eight times the amount gained last year.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Roldao Lopes, director of the Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Office, said in a press conference here today
that all nine sets of stamps issued so far this year have been
basically sold out, making a total of 160 million patacas (about
20.25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The amount of revenue is expected to go further to 250 million
patacas by the year end after another four sets of stamps are
issued. The 10th set of stamps, featuring Macao verandas, will
meet collectors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the office made a total of 35
million patacas (about 4.43 million U.S. dollars) by selling
stamps last year, up 75 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The demand for Macao stamps surged late last year, following a
similar trend in the demand of Hong Kong stamps. The office had
planned to increase this year's amount of stamps by 20 percent,
but it turned out to be nearly 10 times for each set of stamps
issued this year.
</P>
<P>
While the amount of each set of stamps issued last year stood
between 200,000 to 300,000 pieces, it has skyrocketed to two
million pieces this year.
</P>
<P>
Lopes said that Macao stamps featuring traditional Chinese
culture are most popular among collectors. Marketeers sell them
several times the face value to collectors.
</P>
<P>
The office will begin accepting orders for next year's stamps.
It plans to accept more orders than the 8,000 it received for this
year's stamps. The number of order for 1995 was only 3,000.
</P>
<P>
"We will raise the amount of issues for each set of stamps if
we think it necessary," said the director. "But the increase will
be on a reasonable basis."

JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa trade unions
are likely to lose thousands of members as local businesses turn
to cut costs and enhance their competitiveness in the global

<P>
According to industrial relations expert Jackie Kelly, total
trade union membership has dropped from 3.4 million in 1993 to
2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
The decline in trade union membership was due to the
widespread retrenchment and rationalization of companies, a trend
that would continue until there was a significant increase in
formal employment, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Currency Speculation Firms Reproached in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Two fund management firms have
been reproached by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for helping
their clients speculate against the Hong Kong dollar, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two houses, reported to be U.S.-based firms, were warned
that their mandate to manage part of the Exchange Fund of Hong
Kong might be taken away if they continued to undermine the
dollar's stability.
</P>
<P>
The speculation took place on July 18 when the dollar came
under mild selling pressure locally but stronger pressure in New
York and London after the local market had closed.
</P>
<P>
The pressure pushed the local currency to an unusually low
level of 7.762 to the U.S. dollar, triggering concern that the
currency turmoil plaguing other Asian countries could be spreading
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The authority is understood to have traced the selling
positions to fund managers stationed in New York, which later said
they were acting on behalf of clients.
</P>
<P>
After tracing the source of the selling, the authority pushed
interest rates higher last week to increase the cost of financing
the speculation and to alert other banks of its wrath.
</P>
<P>
Sources said through the Real Time Gross Settlement system, the
authority has a clear picture of banks' daily clearing balances.
</P>
<P>
The fund managers were later warned that similar action in
future would result in losing the business of managing part of the
Exchange Fund's reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's ruling Basotholand
Congress Party (BCP) has elected Molapo Qhobela as its new leader
at its annual conference, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Qhobela succeeds Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, who established
his own party, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy, in early June
and declared a hand-overnd of government power to his newly formed
political party from the long-ruling BCP.
</P>
<P>
The BCP conference was held in compliance with a ruling by
Lesotho High Court, which ordered the BCP to hold a conference
before the end of July to elect a leader after several senior
members attempted unsuccessfully to oust Mokhehle early this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's term of office in the BCP expired in January.
</P>
<P>
The BCP charged that Mokhehle's formation of the new party was
"an unashamed betrayal of the trust bestowed upon him by the
Lesotho electorate", and he was no longer the leader of the party
elected into National Assembly by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
The conference appealled to the country's Council of State
to call on Mohkehle to resign as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lesotho government has started arrangements for
the establishment of an independent electoral commission to
conduct the next election scheduled for January.

One of the main planks on which Taylor contested and won the
election as Liberia's post-war president was a promise to abolish
the national currency, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
About 650 million Liberian dollars are said to be in
circulation currently, which the new government of Liberia
reportedly plans to buy up with about 15 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. dollar is officially equivalent to one Liberian
dollar. It is reported the exchange rate became one U.S. dollar
to 70 Liberian dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar is highly patronized by businessmen in Liberia
apparently because of its universal usage. Users also complain
that the Liberian dollar is bulky.
</P>
<P>
Taylor won 75 percent of the votes cast during the country's
post-war election on July 19, taking the top seat he has fought
for since 1989.
He is scheduled to be sworn in on August 2 as president.

HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Public belief in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR)'s economic and political
future has risen, according to the latest confidence survey
conducted by the South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The index for economic confidence has gone up five points to 98

Attitudes towards the SAR's overall future have also remained
stable since last October, with 79 percent of people expressing
confidence in the years ahead.

before the handover, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Department recorded a 13 percent increase in
foreign arrivals to 438,200 between the end of December and June

<HEADLINE> PNG Soldiers Force Govt to Put Charges on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Rebel soldiers of the Papua New
Guinean (PNG) military today held their commander under armed
arrest, forcing the government to put on hold charges against
soldiers involved in the mutiny of the Sandline mercenaries'
contract.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected Prime Minister Bill Skate agreed to withhold the
charges until another inquiry into the contract was completed, the
Australian Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The overture came after a day of drama during which a key
Sandline mutineer, Major Walter Enuma, was freed from jail by
armed soldiers and military commander Brigadier General Leo Nuia
was placed under house arrest at Murray Barracks. He was later
released after a compromise was reached.
</P>
<P>
The compromise means former commander Jerry Singirok, who led
the rebellion against Sandline in March, would not be charged by
police with sedition tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Police said last week that they were preparing to arrest
Singirok when he returns from holiday in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers involved in today's operation sought a full
amnesty from the government over the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
However, after meeting with PNG Defense Force Chief of Staff
Colonel Eric Ani and Peter Donigi, Singirok's lawyer, this
afternoon, Skate said he could not legally grant a full amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he had directed Police Commissioner Bob
Nenta and Attorney General Sao Gabi to withhold any charges until
an inquiry into the Sandline contract was completed.
</P>
<P>
An earlier inquiry into the 35 million U.S. dollar deal to use
foreign mercenaries to resolve Bougainville's secessionist crisis
in PNG cleared former prime minister Julius Chan and two senior
ministers of corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
Acting Defense Minister Simon Kaumi met with military brass
late today to inform them of the Skate government's position.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the agreement was that the rebel soldiers
should free General Nuia from house arrest. Major Enuma reportedly
said tonight that General Nuia had been released.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Major Enuma last Friday triggered today's swift
retribution by a hard core of soldiers loyal to him and Singirok.
</P>
<P>
Major Enuma headed an operation directed by Singirok to expel
the foreign mercenaries from PNG in March.

<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 12 heads of state are expected
to attend the inauguration of Charles Taylor as president of
Liberia on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha who
is also current chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) and Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are reported to have played a key role in
resolving the Liberian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today quoted sources in Monrovia, the
Liberian capital, as saying that arrangements are in top gear to
receive the heads of state for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is said to have budgeted over four million U.S. Dollars
for his swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It is reported Taylor has received about 500 seats imported
from abroad for the occasion. About 300 of them will be used by
dignitaries at the Executive Mansion while others will be used at
his private residence he plans to use as State House.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three bullet-proof vehicles and 20 Triumph
motorcycles to be used by his out-riders have arrived.
</P>
<P>
As preparations are under full swing for the ceremony, west
African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) has enjoined Liberians to
shun all acts that might be capable of disrupting the peace in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the force's Deputy Commander Brigadier General
Joe kwateng, ECOMOG has been intensifying efforts to "to ensure
that all the (hidden) arms are retrieved before we leave
Liberia".
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is scheduled to withdraw six months after Liberia's new
government is put in place. But its chief, Major-General Victor
Malu said recently the stay of ECOMOG might be extended for the
training of Liberian army and police force.

<HEADLINE> North China Province's Tourism Prosperous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
received nearly 40,000 overseas tourists during the first half of
this year, a jump of more than 50 percent over the same period of
last year, according to the provincial tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province earned 11.27 million US dollars through receiving
overseas tourists during this period. Meanwhile, it hosted 10.29
million domestic tourists, earning some two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bureau experts say that the sudden upswing in the province's
tourism sector has something to do with improved airway,
expressway and telecommunications facilities, the result of the
province's concentrated efforts in infrastructure construction in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is a yellow-earthed hilly region along the Yellow
River. Though it possesses a wealth of ancient architecture and
other cultural sites, it used to suffer from lackluster tourism
interest because of its poor infrastructure facilities.

ABU DHABI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) said it was seeking to ban smoking on all public transport
and domestic flights in all its six member countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC general secretariat has also said it planned to ban
cigarette and tobacco advertising in all media in member states
which include Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates(UAE), the daily Emirates News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Advertising executives in the Gulf have said the proposed
media ban would strike a powerful blow to the region's young
advertising sector and local economies.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf is considered a major cigarette market, with annual
imports in Saudi Arabia alone estimated at 800 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The steps are part of the GCC's efforts to curb smoking. Gulf
Arab states have already agreed to a gradual rise in cigarette

<HEADLINE> 103 Muslim Rebels Surrender in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 103 members of the rebel
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) recently surrendered to the
government forces in the southern Philippines, the military said
today.
</P>
<P>
Col. Nestor Castillo, chief of the Armed Forces' Civil
Relations Service, said the surrender of these rebels in Basilan
and Bukidnon provinces "shows the confidence of the rebels in the
current political leadership".
</P>
<P>
He said this also reflected the confidence these rebels had in
the government peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Castillo assured these former MILF members that they would be
assisted properly and a livelihood program would be extended to
them soon.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Romeo Padiernos, chief of the Armed Forces' Southern
Command, said 38 rebels surrendered to the Army's 51st Infantry
Battalion in Tipo-Tipo town, Basilan.
</P>
<P>
In Bukidnon, 65 MILF rebels under Commander Balao Carnine
yielded to the Army's 8th Infantry Battalion in Maramag town after
long negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), which had forged a peace deal with the government
last September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which refused to be included in the MNLF-government
peace accord, began its exploratory talks with the government in
January. The two sides are expected to resume their much-delayed
sixth round of peace talks this week.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force in the
country with an estimated membership of 12,000.

<HEADLINE> Output Increasing in Philippine Manufacturing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A rebound by the Philippine
manufacturing sector continues as the Value of the Production
Index (VPI) in key enterprises slightly increased 0.5 percent to
438.2 in May from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But on a month-on-month comparison, the VPI decreased in May
0.8 percent from the 441.9 recorded in April, according to the
data released by the National Statistics Office today.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year increases were observed in nine out of the 16
major sectors led by electrical machinery and basic metals which
increased 33.5 percent and 22.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other gainers included miscellaneous manufactures, furniture
and fixtures, tobacco and non-metallic mineral products, beverage,
wood and wood products and food manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Significant decreases in the VPI were posted by textile and
petroleum products with 20.5 percent shares each to the negative
component of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
These figures were based on the results of the Survey of Key
Enterprises in Manufacturing, a regular monthly survey aimed to
provide flash indicators on the performance of key manufacturing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Volume of Production Index (VoPI) for
key manufacturing enterprises slightly decreased 0.5 percent from
148.1 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The VoPI is derived from the VPI and Producer's Price Index
(PPI) with 1992 as the base year. The index is a measure of change
in volume, net of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The VoPI for petroleum refineries dipped 17.3 percent, followed
by paper and paper products, textile, wearing apparel and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year increases were observed in eight sectors, with
basic metals posting the biggest rise of 35 percent to 128.6.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which posted double-digit VoPI growth were
electrical machinery, beverage, furniture and fixtures, and food
manufacturing.

The local currency finished in Sydney at 73.55 U.S. cents, half

Parer told a Digger and Dealers Conference in Kalgoorlie in the

SINGAPORE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore today urged the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and European Union (EU)
to work out practical ways to strengthen their relations.
</P>
<P>
Local television reported that Singapore Foreign Minister S.
Jayakumar made the call when meeting Singapore local media today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent expansion of ASEAN, Jayakumar said
that it brought a new set of challenges for both the nine-member
grouping and the EU. The ASEAN now comprises of Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam,
Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
How both side resolved these challenges to their mutual
advantage would be a test of maturity, wisdom and political
judgment, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he urged both sides to take a flexible and
pragmatic approach that has served ASEAN and the EU well and work
out practical ways to intensify the relationship, while managing
differences.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore minister stressed that as the ASEAN countries
took off, they presented the EU countries with enormous investment
opportunities. In the next decade, ASEAN countries will embark on
numerous infrastructure projects like the Mekong Basin Development
Cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
European technology could play a major role in this area, he
said, adding that ASEAN is uniquely placed to serve as a gateway
for the flow of trade and investment between Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> China, Philippines Satisfied with Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China and the
Philippines today expressed their satisfaction for the trend of
development of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here today, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon were also satisfied with their two countries' cooperation
in multilateral forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation and the ASEAN Regional Forum, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
state visit to the Philippines last November, leaders of the two
countries reached the consensus that China and the Philippines
should develop 21st century-oriented relations of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust, thus giving a strong impetus
to the development of Sino-Philippine ties.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed thanks to Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and the Philippine government for their congratulations extended
to China on Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the Philippines is enthusiastic about further
boosting its ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that trade and investment between the two countries
have been increasing rapidly and great potential exists for
setting up joint ventures and carrying out cooperation in civil
aviation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that increasing economic cooperation
and trade between the two countries are of great importance for
their long-term relationship and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian noted that the two countries should set
store by their friendly relations and cautiously handle the
differences between them.
</P>
<P>
They could set aside the problems that can not be solved at the
moment and prevent them from interfering with their relations as a
whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Siazon agreed, saying that the two sides
should act this way.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and Siazon were of the view that their countries
share the common goal of maintaining regional peace and stability
and they can continuously increase mutual trust and promote
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are here attending the ASEAN Post Ministerial
Conference.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Use Computers to Simulate Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A team of British scientists have
used computers to simulate the evolution of life forms which could
explain how it works.
</P>
<P>
The simulation has revealed how a certain gene may have forced
dramatic changes in living things, such as the development of legs
from the fins of a fish, or bird wings from dinosaur legs,
according to a paper to be presented at the European Artificial
Life Conference in Brighton this week.
</P>
<P>
The simulation, conducted by Johnjoe McFadden and his
colleagues at the University of Surrey, provides a new explanation
for the puzzle that evolution seems to occur by fits and starts,
known as "punctuated equilibrium," while it is not a pattern of
gradual change.

<HEADLINE> Tehran's Top Officials Arrested for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Three senior municipal officials in
Tehran were arrested Sunday on charges of corruption as part of
sweeping crackdown on corrupt bureaucrats in Iran, the Persian
daily Iran reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily, an organ of the Iranian government, said that these
officials are Gholamreza Qobbeh, deputy mayor for administrative
and financial affairs, Nassajiyan Bajian, director-general of the
municipality's security branch, and Morteza Shapouriyan, mayor of
District-5 in western Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The daily added that a number of managers working for
companies affiliated with the municipality have also been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The office of Tehran's Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi declined
to comment on the arrests. The public relations office of the
municipality could neither confirm nor reject the reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the public relations office of the justice ministry
said that the ministry is intent on bringing corrupt officials to
justice based on the orders of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow the rise of a class of people who have
become rich through illegal means," Khamenei told his people two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed justice ministry official clarified that the records
obtained by the ministry showed that the municipal managers
arrested were involved in squandering public resources.
</P>
<P>
"While searching the premises that belong to them, we found
documents that show they squandered the public treasury," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a dossier is formed in the judicial branches to
investigate the case. "We will inform the public with further
details on this case."

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister to Visit Three African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard will visit Gabon, Chad and the Central African Republic
from Tuesday to Thursday, French Defense Ministry officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
Richard is expected to announce the closure of the Bouar
military base in the Central African Republic, which was until
recently in the grip of a military mutiny against President
Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Africa by a French defense minister
after the coming to power of the Socialist government, whose
leaders have been critical of France's traditional policy toward
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that France will withdraw its 1,400 troops
from the Central African Republic in a period from six months to
two years.
</P>
<P>
But, France is expected to keep its military deployment in Chad
and Gabon, where 550 French soldiers are permanently stationed
under defense cooperation treaties.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse said that considering France's vital need
for oil supply, Gabon will be the most important leg of the visit
by Richard, who will hold talks with President Omar Bongo on
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
France also has troop deployments in Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire and
Djibouti.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues near Kabul, No Frontline Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Afghan Islamic
Taliban militia and their rivals was continuing today north of the
capital city of Kabul, but no changes in frontlines have yet been
reported.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was going on about 15 to 20 kilometers north of
Khair Khana Pass, Kabul's northwestern gate, at the contested
village of Hossein Kot, said Afghan sources in Peshawar, a major
border city in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The adjacent district center of Shakardara and its army base
called the Rocket Brigade were now under the control of forces
loyal to Ahmad Masood, former Afghan military chief, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The echoing booms of long-range rockets and howitzers could be
clearly heard in Kabul, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Masood's fighters, in a surprise infantry attack,
drove the Taliban back some 45 kilometers to establish new
frontlines well within artillery and rocket range of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Vardak province to the southwest of Kabul,
fighting continued between the Taliban militia and Masood's Shiite
Hezb-e-Wahadt allies west of the provincial capital Maidanshar.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the anti-Taliban alliance led mainly by Masood and
Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik sent an ultimatum to the Taliban,
demanding they pull out of Kabul in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The alliance warned in the ultimatum that if the Taliban failed
to meet the deadline, it would launch a three-pronged full-scale
assault against Taliban simultaneously from the west, north and
east side of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have controlled Kabul since last September,
have so far made no comment on the deadline set by the opposition
alliance.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Will Act Against Currency Speculators: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today said the government would take action
against rogue currency speculators but did not elaborate how.
</P>
<P>
"The government has got some ideas on what to do but obviously
we cannot just publish what we want to do as much as (American
financier George) Soros does not publish what he wants to do," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made these remarks in response to questions by
reporters after he received foreign ministers of ASEAN dialogue
partners at the Prime Minister's Department here, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government's action would be based on its
perception. "What we can do depends on our perception. If we
perceive this as a criminal act, then we will act. If you think
that it's normal, than you don't act," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and the dialogue partners had a good discussion,
which almost centered on currencies.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sets Final Deadline for Illegal Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has set August 9 as a final
deadline for illegal Egyptian workers to obtain proper work
permits, or to leave.
</P>
<P>
The government is not planning to extend deadline again and
labor laws will dully and fully be in force as of August 10,
Jordanian Minister of Labor Saleh Khasawneh said in a statement
available today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's measures are aimed at organizing the labor
force and easing unemployment in the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources estimated that out of 230,000 Egyptians
working in Jordan, only 95,000 have corrected the irregularities
in their documentation and gotten legal work permits.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian Minister of Manpower and Immigration Ahmad
Ahmad al-Amawi earlier gave a higher number, saying 125,000
Egyptians have rectified their working permits in Jordan under a
bilateral cooperation agreement on labor reached last year.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian workers in Jordan were previously given three
months to obtain work permits starting from the beginning of March
this year, then the mandate was extended for three weeks. On July
9 it was further prolonged for another month.
</P>
<P>
The second extension of the mandate was in line with a decision
made by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali during a
meeting in Cairo early this month of the Jordanian-Egyptian Higher
Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial figures, there are at least 300,000
non-Jordanian workers in Jordan and some 76 percent of them are
Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the Egyptian workers are employed in
agriculture sector and the rest in construction work, domestic
service, farming and a number of other services shunned by the
Jordanian nationals.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government started to limit the number of
foreign laborers entering Jordan in 1996, in fear that the large
number of foreigners might impose threat to its own job seekers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government issued an order to close 16
occupations to non-Jordanians. The Ministry of Labor only issued
42,976 work permits to non-Jordanian workers, 55 percent less than
the figure of 94,333 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President Arrives in Turkey for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov
arrived here today for a three-day official visit to Turkey aimed
at giving a new boost to relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel,
Stoyanov will, during his visit, hold talks with Turkish leaders
on bilateral relations and on finding ways to cooperate in the
struggle against international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the two countries are expected to discuss
the situation in the Balkans and the European Union (EU)
membership initiatives of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a member state of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), supported Bulgaria's application to join the
alliance at this month's Madrid summit, though Bulgaria was not
among the countries to join in the first wave of expansion.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency recently quoted
Asen Agov, president of Bulgarian parliament's Foreign Policy and
European Integration Commission as saying that "Turkish investment
in Bulgaria is ridiculously low. Our country is in need of
investments to create new jobs."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the negative effects stemming from the lack of
a cultural agreement between Turkey and Bulgaria, Agov said
that he hoped the two sides would also focus on cultural
affairs during Stoyanov's visit.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Claims to be on Right Track in Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- In an appeal to its donors for a
continued aid to the country, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi said the government has been on the right track in
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based daily papaer, "Kenya Times", today quoted
the minister as saying Sunday that Kenya enjoys reasonably warm
relations with international donors and the government is
currently holding amicable talks with donor agencies over
implementation of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Kenyan government has taken stern
measures to stamp out corruption, ensure efficiency and
accountability to maintain a stable economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that the government has so far undertaken
commendable measures in terms of liberalization and privatization
of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He cited the on-going restructuring of the Kenya Posts and
Tele-communications Corporation as one of the successful measures
in the privatization process of parastatal companies.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) blocked a 37
million U.S. Dollars loan to Kenya because of the High Court's
termination of the long-running 105 million Dollars Goldenberg
court case.
</P>
<P>
The 105 million Dollar fraud case involved millionaire
businessman Kamlesh Pattni and Former senior government officialsg.
</P>
<P>
The IMF last Thursday gave Kenya one week to show improvement
in economic reforms or risk losing the loan which had been agreed
upon.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that though the IMF had particularly raised
concern over the Goldenberg scandal, the matter was still in
court.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is seeking assurances that the Kenyan government is
taking concrete steps to recover the funds lost in the Goldenberg
and other financial scandals.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that if the government failed to satisfy
the IMF by Wednesday, Kenya would be deprived of the 37 million
Dollars second instalment of the three-year 220 million Dollars
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility agreed on by both sides
in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Also affected are a 72 million Dollars Structural Adjustment
Credit and a 125 million loan for energy sector reform and power
projects from the World Bank, they added.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi stressed that "we are making every effort to come to
an agreement with donors and under no circumstances should one
imagine an occurrence of a stalemate in the talks."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Further Cooperation Among APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China said today
that members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
should continue their cooperation under the principles of
diversity and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
In remarks made at a closed-door session of the ASEAN Post
Ministerial Conference here, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said APEC has made substantive progress in
its cooperation process in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"This is inseparable from the APEC way, which is characterized
mainly by the principles of diversity and flexibility," as
confirmed by the APEC meetings in Subic, the Philippines, last
year, Qian was quoted by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that at the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting this
year, the APEC way should be further improved so as to ensure
that APEC will continue to develop in a sound way in the future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the liberalization of trade and investment, Qian noted that
as different members have different levels of economic
development, it is necessary to take into account the interests of
all the parties in the liberalization process and follow the
timetable set at the APEC meetings in Indonesia in 1994.
Under the timetable, negotiations for the elimination of trade
barriers in APEC member economies will start in the year 2000 and
be completed within 10 years in developed economies, 15 years in
newly-industrialized economies and by 2020 in developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
Qian also urged that the liberalization be carried out in
accordance with the principles of consensus through consultation
and voluntariness and on a flexible and gradual basis.
</P>
<P>
On economic and technical cooperation, the Chinese foreign
minister pointed out that it is in the interest of all members to
carry out such cooperation between APEC members.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to establish a proper mechanism within
APEC for the cooperation process to achieve substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Canada, the host of this year's APEC meetings,
would like the APEC leaders to concentrate on questions of
strengthening infrastructure construction and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the focus of discussions on these matters
should be on cooperation in really solving the concrete problems
facing the developing members," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's activities in APEC, Qian said Hong Kong is now a
special administrative region of China and it should continue to
participate in APEC activities as an APEC member under the name of
Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
He said China is to announce at this year's APEC meetings its
decision to host APEC meetings in 2001 and hoped that APEC members
will give their support for the decision.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Sheds Light on Solving Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of "Outlook"
quotes a high-ranking Chinese official as saying that China's
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong should serve as a
reference for solving the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, vice president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said the principle of "one
country, two systems" sheds light on the solution of Taiwan issue
in four aspects:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
enjoys a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the law and
the Hong Kong people have the right to govern Hong Kong. This,
when applied to Taiwan, means that Taiwan compatriots are to
become their own true masters after the reunification with the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the HKSAR continues with its capitalist system. The
practices applied in Hong Kong indicate that the rights and
interests of Taiwan compatriots will, likewise, be protected
following reunification with the Chinese mainland. The residents
of Taiwan have no need to worry about maintaining their present
way of life.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the HKSAR is authorized by the central government
to handle a wide range of foreign affairs under the guidance of
the "one country, two systems" principle. Likewise, after
reunification, compatriots in Taiwan will be able to enjoy the
prestige in international affairs in its true sense together with
the people in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Finally, reunification in accordance with "one country, two
systems" principle will enable Taiwan to take full advantage of
the material and human resources, and commercial market on the
mainland, while the Chinese mainland will be able to take full
advantage of Taiwan's capital resources and business expertise to
develop national economy.
</P>
<P>
Tang urged Taiwan authorities to refrain from preaching the
inapplicabiltiy of the "one country, two system"
principal. Instead, according to Tang, they should realistically
study the successful application of "one country, two systems" in
Hong Kong, and make correct decisions which will benefit the
people in Taiwan as well as the interests of the entire Chinese
nation.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Stations Mushroom in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is speeding up its plan to
set up natural gas fuelling stations nationwide as part of a
campaign to check air pollution, according to officials quoted in
today's Egyptian Gazette daily.
</P>
<P>
A natural gas refueling station was opened Friday in Dokki
district, Giza, the first in the northern Egyptian governorate
sitting on the densely-populated and heavily-polluted Nile Delta.
</P>
<P>
This is also one of the first natural gas refueling stations
set up outside the metropolises of Greater Cairo and Alexandria
where seven stations have been set up in initial plans.
</P>
<P>
The use of natural gas as a clean alternative for benzene would
reduce pollution by over 30 percent, Minister of Oil Hamdi
al-Banbi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas also saves about 60 percent as fuel used by any
vehicle when compared with the conventional fuel, thus helping
direct petroleum production for exports, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Most of the envisaged projects will link consumption areas up
to natural gas pipelines and networks across Egypt, a country
which has a rich natural gas reserves of an estimated 330,000
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
To harden in its environment drive, the government established
an independent ministry for environment in an efficiency-oriented
cabinet reshuffle early this month.

LUSAKA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka Province Minister Sonny
Mulenga has charged that the problem of vendors in Lusaka is
getting out of control and threatened to crack down on them,
Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Mulenga as saying on Sunday that
his office cannot allow the situation to continue and that
measures will be taken to ensure that the capital city is cleaned
up.
</P>
<P>
"We need to make bold decisions even if they are unpopular, as
long as they are good for our city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga said the vendors have been let to take over the
streets making it very difficult for shop owners to do business
and that all parking lots have also been turned into "shops".
</P>
<P>
Vendors must operate their business hundred meters away from
shopping centers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
If the situation is not redressed in the shortest possible
time, Lusaka will remain the dirtiest city in the region, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The city council, vendors desk at the State House and his
office will soon meet to resolve the matter, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Officially Apologizes to Jordan for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel has officially
apologized to Jordan for its undiplomatic actions taken by the
army last week, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers detained a Jordanian diplomat at an army
roadblock near Maccabim between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for five
hours without explaining why. His car was searched despite its
CD diplomatic plate.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh presented an
official complaint in Amman to the Israeli ambassador there over
the incident, saying that the diplomat was insulted by the
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We are speaking about an incident that can only be explained
by the fact that soldiers at roadblocks sometimes ignore their
orders on the treatment of diplomatic personnel," said Israeli
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is expected to apologize
for the incident to King Hussein of Jordan when they meet in
Amman Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak
has ordered head of the army Central Command Maj.-Gen. Uzi Dayan
to appoint an officer to investigate the incident, according to
an army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic incident has apparently demonstrated a low ebb
in the relations between Israel and Jordan. King Hussein has
openly blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the
deep crisis in the peace process. Jordan is also unsatisfied
with the little progress in its economic cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel, for its part, is reportedly angry over the fact that
an Jordanian military court failed to give a death sentence to a
soldier who killed seven holiday-making Israeli school girls on
the Jordan River in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor on
July 19 28-year-old Ahmad Mousa Dakamseh who killed the Israeli
girls at Baqoura in north Jordan valley.

<P>
SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The heat wave, which has encompassed
South Korea for about a week, has caused various heat-related
accidents and deaths.
</P>
<P>
Sunstroke caused several deaths. On July 24, a 22-year-old
military trainee suddenly collapsed and died during a training
exercise. In an other case, a man collapsed on his way home after
a several-hour work on a construction site.
</P>
<P>
About 10 people have died from heart failure after the shock
from suddenly entering cold water.

Power supplies were suspended for hours in Seoul and other
cities due to excessive use of electricity, leaving some people
trapped in elevators and fans and air conditioners out of
operation.
</P>
<P>
Under the heat wave, a car in a ground parking lot in Seoul was
partially destroyed on July 26 by fire caused by an overheated
engine after a two-hour use of the air conditioner in the car.

JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading South African newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen
</P>
<P>
-- The Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa made an urgent
call Sunday for a summit of all political, civic and church
leaders to stop crime and violent abuses in the country, saying
the criminal justice system must protect the victims and not the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The Star
</P>
<P>
-- South Africa's private hospitals are battling each other
for quality staff as emigration, lucrative overseas posts and the
sliding stature of the nursing profession increasingly cause good
nurses to leave their posts, particularly intensive care and
theater-trained nurses.
</P>
<P>
Business Day
</P>
<P>
-- Central government should consider decentralizing certain
police functions to the provinces and devolving some political
authority to provincial safety and security ministers to address
the worsening crime problem in South Africa, according to a
government-sponsored report.
</P>
<P>
Sowetan
</P>
<P>
-- Most South Africans distrusted the validity of the 1996

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Quzhou Green Dinner Sets Co. Ltd.
recently opened a paper plate production line in Quzhou, east
China's Zhejiang Province, according to a recent issue of the
China Environmental News.
</P>
<P>
The new line has increased the company's daily capacity by
five-fold to 500,000 durable, oil resistant and waterproof dinner
sets, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The company's expanded production of paper plates will help to
solve environmental problems resulting from so-called "white
pollution" created by the widespread use of plastic boxes.
</P>
<P>
The Quzhou company recently signed a contract to supply 150
million paper dinner sets to the Guangzhou Railway Bureau on an
annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China's fast-food industry uses
well over 10 billion throwaway styrofoam fast food containers
annually. In July this year, the Ministry of Railways issued a
regulation prohibiting the use of plastic fast-food boxes.
</P>
<P>
Completion of a planned second phase project, scheduled for
next year, will enable the company to reduce costs and raise its
daily production capacity to one million units.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment continues to flow into the sector, with
joint ventures paper plate production plants currently under
construction in Xi'an and Xiamen.

<HEADLINE> Quick Solution Urged for Beirut's Garbage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Enraged by thousands of tonnes of
smelly garbage piling up next to their houses, residents of
Beirut's southern suburbs have threatened to relocate it in the
newly-built Sports City in the capital.
</P>
<P>
But Environment Minister Akram Shuhayyeb and other officials
were quick enough to promise a quick and efficient solution after
a crucial meeting this afternoon to prevent a health catastrophe
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The pyramids of wastes have been growing at an average of 600
tonnes a day for the past nine days as the government closed two
dumps earlier this month in response to protests by local
residents.
</P>
<P>
In Hay Al-Sillom, heaps of waste have become the haunt of
rodents and insects, sending an unbearable stench into the air.
</P>
<P>
Along the Ouzai highway and in areas adjacent to the airport
road, smoke billowed from the green garbage bins as residents set
the trash alight to suppress the odour and reduce the size of the
heaps.
</P>
<P>
"If things continue as they are and the garbage remains on our
streets, there will be a revolt. We will collect all this waste
and throw it in the Sports City or on the airport road," said
Moussa Ghazi, a local vegetable vendor was quoted today in the
Daily Star as saying.
</P>
<P>
Standing amid a crowd of supporters, Ghazi said the garbage on
every street corner was spreading disease. "If we the people don't
act, the government won't move. We have spoken enough but they
don't listen."
</P>
<P>
The environment minister was quoted the newspaper as saying
that a location for a new separation plant has been agreed. But he
admitted that setting up the plant will take weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said he has discussed the issue with Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, House Speaker Nabih Berri and representatives from
Hezbollah and Amal, the two Shiite groups which are most
influential in the southern suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Science Fiction Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is currently hosting
China's first-ever high profile international science fiction
conference,
</P>
<P>
The China Science and Technology Association (CSTA) is
sponsoring the event designed to exhibit the nation's power of
imagination. CSTA Chairman Zhou Guangzhao noted that "the
grand meeting has attracted the world's most imaginative people."
</P>
<P>
Well over 100 astronauts, science fiction writers and
publishers from the United States, Japan, Russia, Australia and
China, including China's Hong Kong and Taiwan, are attending the
conference which carries the theme "Science Fiction, Peace and
Development".
</P>
<P>
Zhou quoted Einstein as saying that "imagination is more
important than knowledge". Zhou also pointed out that the most
influential technological innovations and inventions introduced
during the 20th century have evolved from the imaginative
descriptions presented by science fiction writers.
</P>
<P>
According to the well-known Chinese physicist, "The 21st
century excites our imaginations and fills us with
expectations. Conferees have entered the next century much earlier
than most people".
</P>
<P>
Unlike developed countries which use science fiction as a form
of entertainment, China considers the genre as a means spreading
scientific knowledge and educating the general public in order to
modernize the country.
</P>
<P>
While many Chinese officials firmly believe the genre inspires
young people to love science and promotes patriotism, some critics
say it will turn China into a future oriented nation.
</P>
<P>
However, various factors have contributed to the
underdevelopment of science fiction in China, including Confucian
philosophy which dictated that people concentrate on a secular
life rather than thinking about the future.
</P>
<P>
The central government call for promoting science amongst the
general public has created an upsurge in the popularity of science
fiction in recent years. "Science Fiction World", China's only
sci-fi magazine, now has the largest readership for any
publication of its kind.
</P>
<P>
"The world is changing more rapidly and indeed more profoundly
than ever before. While science drives change, science fiction
deals with the possible implications of change, helps us to deal
with changes which have already occurred and prepares us for
things yet to come," said conferee Elizabeth Anne Hull, a famous
science fiction from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese sci-fi fan applauded Hull's remarks, with many
requesting the she pose for photographs.
</P>
<P>
The one-week meeting will move to Chengdu, the capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, following three days of
in-depth discussions on wide-ranging topics, including cyberspace,
the environment and space travel. The conference will also feature
sci-fi arts exhibitions and films.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Military Chief Endorses Sentence on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's military chief late Sunday
endorsed a military court verdict on July 19 sentencing a soldier
to life imprisonment for killing seven Israeli girls in March,
semi-official Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the endorsement by Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff of
Jordanian Armed Forces Marshal Abdul Hafez Marei Kaabneh, the
verdict for Ahmad Mousa Dakamseh can no longer be appealed nor
contested in any court as stipulated by the Jordanian law.
</P>
<P>
The marshal ratified the verdict in accordance with Article 8
of the Military Penal Code of 1952, which grants him full
authority to endorse or reject a military court sentence, the
paper quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the verdict can no longer be repealed in any court in
the future, King Hussein of Jordan, in his capacity as supreme
commander of the Jordan Armed Forces, is the only person
authorized by law to commute the sentence, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Dakamseh will serve his life sentence with hard labor in a
civilian prison.
</P>
<P>
He shot dead seven Israeli school girls and wounded four others
including a teacher at Baqoura in northern Jordan Valley along the
Israeli-Jordanian border on March 13.
</P>
<P>
After a marathon trial, the court decided that the former
corporal was guilty of murder and sentenced him to life
imprisonment with hard labor in consideration of the fact that
he has been "mentally unstable."
</P>
<P>
After the killing in March, King Hussein of Jordan visited the
families of the victims and paid a great deal of money to the
family members.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed its peace treaty with Israel in 1994, right after
Egypt conceived peace with the Jewish state. Jordan and Egypt
are now the only two countries in the Arab world that signed peace
agreements with Israel.

It revealed that 67 percent of the settlers would refuse
compensation in exchange for leaving the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The poll on "political views of Israeli settlers in West
Bank" also showed that 32 percent of the settlers believe the peace
process will crumble and the Israeli troops will retake
Palestinian population centers.
</P>
<P>
It was in contrast to the pessimism expressed by settlers 18
months ago. "The settler public believes that (Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu will protect their interests in peace
talks. Settlers feel less threatened, and therefore are more
defiant in relating to eventualities in the peace process."
explained Professor Efraim Inbar, director of the center.
</P>
<P>
A similar poll was conducted in December 1995, when Israeli
Labor Party was in power. That poll found 22 percent of the
settlers feared that "most" of their settlements would be
dismantled over the next 5-10 years.
</P>
<P>
Today, 62 percent believe most of the settlements will be
annexed to Israel or remain as they are.
</P>
<P>
Whereas 20 percent of those polled in 1995 said they would
abide by a Knesset (parliament) decision to withdraw from the
settlements, the latest poll showed that figure had dropped to 14
percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Arms Manufacturer Active in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Denel, the South Africa
state-owned arms manufacturer, has confirmed that it was active
in the Middle East market, but declined to admit or deny any
contract had been signed.
</P>
<P>
Local daily the Citizen today quoted Denel spokesman George
Masoek as saying that Denel was having "fierce competition" with
Britain, France and the United States to sell arms to the
Mid-east countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult and we are up against major players
there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denel was reportedly closing a deal with Kuwait for 100 G5
howitzers and G6 self-propelled howitzers. The deal with Kuwait
was worth for about 489 million U.S. dollars, according to
informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Denel's 155 mm howitzers are believed to be the most advanced
in the world, with a range of more than 40 km. The G5 and G6
cannons have firing range of almost 50 km.
</P>
<P>
Denel has prevented local press by court interdict from
publishing the name of the country or the financial structures of
the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars deal with another Middle East
country.
</P>
<P>
If the export deals were concluded, they would revive the
South African arms industry, which has been under pressure
following defense spending cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
The Rooivalk attack helicopter, made by Denel, has attracted
attention from the Middle East, including the United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

the source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lesotho's privatization unit, a body responsible
for selling public companies to private buyers, said the

cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Both parties "agreed in principle" that the new company, Air
Lesotho, would register to take over operations of Lesotho
Airways Corporation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> African Bank to Aid Zimbabwe's Social Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- President of the African
Development Bank (ADB) Omar Kabbar said his bank has committed
228 million U.S. Dollars for social and economic projects during
the next phase of Zimbabwe's reform program.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Harare-based daily, The Herald, at
the weekend, Kabbar said of this, 109 million U.S. Dollars will
be in support of the economic program, the Zimbabwe Program for
Social and Economic Transformation.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 119 million U.S. Dollars will be used to finance
water supply projects, an irrigation project, energy and other
service programs that will stimulate economic growth in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said ADB in conjunction with the other co-financiers of the
economic reform program will meet with government officials soon
to discuss policy issues and identify other priority areas before
releasing the funds.

<HEADLINE> EU Puts Cyprus Issue on Dead-End Road: Denktas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf
Denktas has said that the European Union's (EU) decision to open
accession talks with Cyprus has put the Cyprus issue on a
dead-end road.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Turkish Daily News
published here today, Denktas stressed that because of EU's
wrong attitude, neither he nor Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides
would continue the negotiations process.
</P>
<P>
He said Clerides had declared that if the EU postponed the
start of the accession talks because of Turkish Cypriot
objections, he would not attend the second round of the
U.N.-sponsored direct talks on Cyprus issue scheduled to be held
in Mondreux, Switzerland, in August.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the direct talks between Denktas and
Clerides was held near New York at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus is of the opinion that if the accession talks
between the EU and Cyprus began, this would mark the end of the
intercommunal negotiation process, Denktas said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that any solution to the Cyprus problem should
encompass three fundamental issues: Protection of the special
relationship between Cyprus, Turkey and Greece; protection of the
domestic and external balances on which the republic was founded
in 1960; and the guarantee scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops landed and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed Greek Cypriot coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the northern
part of the divided island to safeguard the security of the
Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which
is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Growing up in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Cottage industries that are part
of China's township enterprise sector in Zhejiang Province, east
China, are rapidly becoming large groups competing profitably
both in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The province is the cradle of China's township enterprise
system and has 160 of the country's 1,000 top township
enterprises. In 1992, it began to improve its township enterprise
system, which was characterized by small-scale, loosely-organized
operations that lagged behind in technology.
</P>
<P>
It has more than 150 groups made up of 900,000 township
enterprises, 237 of which have over 100 million yuan in annual
sales and 10 million yuan in profits, and 618 that have joined
China's large and medium-sized township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Haining city, which is known as the birthplace of China's
leather industry, has turned its helter-skelter leather factories
into large groups that now produce some name-brand goods like
Xuebao (Snow Leopard). Five of the groups do more than 150 million
yuan each in business annually.
</P>
<P>
Shaoxing County is another example. It spent 4.4 billion yuan
last year on technological improvement projects for the textile
industry, adding 11,000 more modern looms. Some of its businesses
like the Asia-Pacific Group have grown to more than a billion yuan
in annual sales, at a time when the rest of China's textile
industry is going downhill.

<HEADLINE> Profit Sharing System In China's Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A profit-sharing system that has
been widely used in China's enterprise reforms is now being
expanded to rural areas for agriculture and has proven successful
in coastal Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's Xiamen city used to have to bring in 70 percent of its
nonstaple food and vegetables from elsewhere, even though the city
government subsidized local food and vegetable companies with a
large amount of funds to ease the pressure.
</P>
<P>
Then, last year companies bought into Changtai County
businesses to establish pig farms and vegetable growing bases. As
a result, they have managed to form a production, processing and
sales network of more than 30,000 households. Farmers provide over
20,000 pigs, more than 20,000 tons of fresh milk, and 40,000 tons
of vegetables annually for Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Workers, officials, and urban dwellers in Fujian's Zhaoan
County have developed some 1,600 ha of aquatic products bases in
rural areas, 70 percent of which were backed by local farmers,
with the two sides' earnings based on the share of investment.
</P>
<P>
In relatively more developed Longhai city, some 7,000 farmers
have purchase and sales contracts with farmers in poor areas, and
this system is more efficient than a single family could
expect. But it can only be tried on a trial base in more developed
rural areas, said an official with the Ministry of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> China's First Penguin Nestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zoo-keepers at the Shanghai Zoo
have spent the past three months and more, carefully nurturing
China's first Jackahh Penguin raised in an artificial incubation
environment.
</P>
<P>
The 36-day incubation period ended on June 1 with the nestling
emerging during a period of high humidity and heat considered to
be beyond the normal endurance levels of the species.
</P>
<P>
Zoo-keepers decided to separate the nestling from its parents in
order to lessen the possibility of bacterial infection. Careful
nurturing has helped to raise the nestling's weight from 81 grams
at birth to 1.6 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Osaka, Japan, a sister city of Shanghai, presented five pairs
of Jackahh Penguin, including the young nestling's parents, to the
zoo in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The natural habitat of Jackahh Penguin is found on offshore
African islands. The relatively small Jackahh are considered to be
one of the rarest of the world's 18 penguin subspecies.

<HEADLINE> China Committed to Stronger Global Multilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China today
expressed its commitment to a stronger global multilateral
trading regime.
</P>
<P>
China's attitude toward regional trade and investment
liberalization has been both positive and realistic, Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today at the Post
Ministerial Conference of the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting which
opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
China is serious and responsible when it comes to fulfilling
its international commitments, Qian said. "Regrettably, till this
very day, China has still been excluded from the World Trade
Organization. An early solution to China's WTO membership not only
serves China's reform and opening up, but also helps strengthen
the global multilateral trading regime and advance economic and
trade cooperation in this region."
</P>
<P>
Qian said China's development and that of Asia and the world at
large are inter-related.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, he said, "China is
dedicated to its economic development and improvement of its
people's life. In the meantime, it is also committed to peace and
prosperity in the region."
</P>
<P>
"China's stability and development has already become part and
parcel of global stability and development. And a stronger China
will contribute positively to durable peace and development in
the Asia- Pacific region and throughout the world," he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that China's economic and trade links with the
other Asian-Pacific countries and across the world have become
even closer, and its cooperation with them will come to a new
high.
</P>
<P>
He noted the development in the Asia-Pacific region in recent
years has continued to attract world attention.
</P>
<P>
He is optimistic that the prospect of the region's future
development continues to look good.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Train Collision near India's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 28 (Xinhua)-- At least 12 people were killed
and 82 others injured, 22 of them seriously, when a speeding train
rammed into a stationary one near the Capital New Delhi late
Sunday night, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The toll is expected to go up as rescuers struggled to
extricate bodies and survivors in the pre-dawn hours here today,
cutting through the mangled metal coaches which were thrown off
the railway track upon collision.
</P>
<P>
Central Railway spokesman Rakesh Saxena put the toll at eight
killed and 42 injured.
</P>
<P>
The mishap occurred when the Delhi-bound Karnataka Express from
Bangalore, capital of Karnataka state, running 12 hours behind
schedule, overshot a signal and hit the Himsagar Express coming
from Kanyakumari from the rear at full speed at around 23:15 local
time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The entire rail traffic on the route has been disrupted and a
number of trains have been rescheduled or diverted. The train
traffic is likely to be restored tonight, PTI quoted railway
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry has been ordered into the incident. Preliminary
reports indicated that the Karnataka Express overshot the signal
and hit the stationary Himsagar Express, Divisional Railway
manager K.K.Gupta said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Capturing Vietnam's Credit Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks could capture
Vietnam's entire credit market as they expand their activities
rapidly in the country, said a newspaper report here today.
</P>
<P>
While foreign banks expanded rapidly in the first half of the
year, domestic banks recorded a proportional loss in their share
of the market, the English-language daily "Vietnam News" reported.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's state bank branches have so far increased their
capital by 11.8 percent and the country's stock banks by 0.6
percent, the State Bank of Ho Chi Min city was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign banks' share on the Vietnamese market has
risen by 29.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises' loan share has reduced by 40 percent with
stock banks, but rose by 106 percent with foreign banks, because
the domestic banks are extremely cautious in granting loans.
</P>
<P>
The local banking sector is losing competitiveness as flaws in
implementing state regulations have led to risky arrangements that
bring up overdue credit to over 20 percent of outstanding debt.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Nations to Adopt Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China today called
upon the developed countries to adopt a wise and constructive
attitude in their economic cooperation with developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen at the two-day Post Ministerial Conference of
the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that today when countries are "inextricably linked
economically, only coordination and cooperation can turn their
separate development opportunities into real benefits of common
development".
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we hope that the developed countries will adopt a
wise and constructive attitude, properly treat and handle the
frictions that occur in bilateral or multilateral economic
cooperation and create a more favorable external environment for
the growth of the developing countries," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that rapid economic growth of the developing countries
in Asia has offered great opportunities to the developed countries
and injected vitality into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"Economic globalization has stood out as the primary attribute
of world economy," he said, noting that certain developing
countries have accelerated growth and become stronger
economically, injecting fresh vitality to world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Noting that in recent years, the development in the
Asia-Pacific region has continued to attract world attention, Qian
Qichen believed that the prospect of its future development
"continues to look good."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Asia-Pacific region is also faced with
challenges to its development, including "uneven development
within the region, wide gap between the developing and developed
countries in economic, scientific and technological levels, and
continued constraints from the unjust and unreasonable external
factors on such issues as market access, terms of trade and
transfer of technology".
</P>
<P>
He is of the view that a sustained and sustainable economic
growth calls not only for continued reform and opening up by all
the Asian-Pacific countries and their full utilization of
potentials, but also for increased dialogue and cooperation on the
basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and
complementarity of advantages and expanded intra- and
inter-regional economic relations and trade.
</P>
<P>
Qian pledged that China is committed to a stronger global
multilateral trading regime and to peace and prosperity in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Call for Freezing Hotel Construction in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities in Vietnam have
recommended freezing hotel construction projects in Hanoi until
2003, the English-language newspaper Vietnam News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hotel construction in this capital city has far outpaced the
needs by foreign tourists, and the growth of the tourism sector
could continue to be slow in coming years, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Now having 321 hotels with 6,520 rooms, Hanoi is likely to see
10 more hotels opening in this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing hotels had an occupancy rate of 30-60
percent in the last six months and the business turnover was down
by 20 percent in the first half of the year compared with the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Arrest 55 at Party Supporters Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JARKATA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The police in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, Sunday arrested 55 supporters of the ousted leader of
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) for staging a convoy in the
capital without permission.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Gories Mere, chief of the Jakarta police detective
unit, said today that the 55 were apprehended because the
organizers of the convoy had got no permit to stage the event.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of PDI former leader Megawati Soekarnoputri had
planned to hold a flower-scattering ceremony at the PDI
headquarters in central Jakarta to commemorate an incident on July
27 last year.
</P>
<P>
At least five people were killed and 23 are still missing in
the riot, according to the National Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
In the riot, triggered by the forceful takeover of PDI's
headquarters by supporters of Soerjadi who ousted Megawati in June
last year in a government-backed congress, rival protesters set
alight or vandalized dozens of offices, banks, shops and
government buildings.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of police and security personnel were on standby
Sunday as crowds flocked to the PDI headquarters to mark last
year's riot.
</P>
<P>
As the crowds grew, the area of the PDI headquarters was closed
and more security officials were deployed around nearby streets.
All shops in the area were closed.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, about 5,000 Megawati supporters held a mass
prayer at her residence in south Jakarta in commemoration of the
July 27 tragedy. No disturbances were reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 11 people were reportedly arrested on Sunday in
Yogyakarta, central Java, for organizing a protest forum. They
demanded that Soerjadi, the current PDI leader, be tried for
allegedly ordering the raid on the PDI headquarters and causing
the riot.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Between ASEAN, Partners Called Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today called its conferences with
dialogue partners "an important event" in ASEAN's external
relations.
</P>
<P>
"It has provided the ASEAN with opportunities to promote its
interest and engage in exchange of views with the participation of
major players in the region as well as those outside the region,"
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here this
morning when he opened the two-day dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Badawi, who is also chairman of the dialogue, known as the
ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC), noted that ASEAN's
solidarity will be tested with new and more difficult issues, some
of the old issues could resurface in new forms and the rapid
growth of information technology adds another dimension to the
challenges faced by developing countries like those in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"To remain viable, the PMC must keep up with these new
demands," Badawi declared.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation and international political and economic
issues are expected to be discussed at the conference attended by
ministers of the nine ASEAN member countries -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam -- and those from the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners --
Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand,
Russia, the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia, Badawi said the country "should be given time and
support to resolve its problems."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was supposed to be admitted into the ASEAN earlier
this month together with Laos and Myanmar. However, its accession
was deferred because of the fighting between the forces of
Co-Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen on July 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
"A durable and enduring solution to the complex Cambodian
situation must include a heavy percentage of local content,"
Badawi said. "In other words, the Cambodians themselves cannot
avoid taking the necessary steps to solve their problems which are
basically home-grown."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the admission of Laos and Myanmar into
ASEAN has further consolidated Southeast Asia as a "cohesive
regional community" as it enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the ASEAN over the last three decades in
bringing the member countries closer together has strengthened my
belief that mutual understanding and dialogue is the key to peace
and stability in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister added that the ASEAN Regional
Forum, which met here Sunday for the fourth time since it was
started four years ago, has further helped encourage the habit of
consultation and cooperation in the area of security for the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door session this morning, the ASEAN countries
will start holding separate dialogues with each dialogue partner
this afternoon and tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka To Develop Industries In North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Industrial Development
Board (IDB) is to invest 2.54 million U.S. dollars to promote
small and medium-sized industries in the Jaffna Peninsula, local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The IDB is confident that with peace gaining ground in the
peninsula, it could help the people there to restart industries
with foreign aid following the devastation of the area due to the
ongoing ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels, who have been waging a 14-year war for a separate state in
the north and east of the country. Government troops recaptured
the Peninsula in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The reports said assistance to industrialists from small
businesses in the Jaffna Peninsula would help to generate
employment for the youth in the area.
</P>
<P>
The IDB has already carried out 144 training programs and
trained over 6,800 youth during the past 18 months, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is keen to develop the small and medium
industrial sector as industrial employment accounts for 53 percent
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the IDB's plans to hold an Industrial
Exhibition on July 31 to provide a window for local products to
foreign industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will run through to August 3, will
display a variety of items such as leather products, ceramic ware,
motor spares, furniture, handicraft, textiles, office equipment
machinery and components, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Record High Tourism Earnings Expected in Slovakia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Earnings by the tourism industry of
Slovakia are expected to reach a record high equivalent to 1.4
billion U.S. dollars this year, said the Slovak Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the country witnessed 9 percent
more tourist arrivals than the same period of last year, according
to the government bureau's latest statistics available today.
</P>
<P>
The quick rise was mostly attributed to an 18 percent increase,
to a total of 400,000, in the number of visits by foreign tourists
to this tiny Central European nation of 49,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak government in recent years has been taking measures
to protect the country's rich tourism resources, and improve and
expand facilities and services accommodating foreign visitors.

<HEADLINE> New Drafts Stress State Ownership of Minerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources has drafted provisional measures to help
implement new amendments to the Mineral Resources Law, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, which were approved by the National People's
Congress Standing Committee last August and became effective on
January 1 this year, stressed the State ownership of the country's
mineral resources. It also aims at meeting the need to transfer
mining rights.
</P>
<P>
The measures regulate the transfer of mining rights and
the registration work for the exploration and use of mineral
resources, the newspaper quoted Jiang Chengsong, vice-minister of
Geology and Mineral Resources, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drafting of the measures has received suggestions from the
State Planning Commission, China National Petroleum Corporation,
China National Offshore Oil Corporation and China National Star
Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The provisional measures will soon be issued after approval by
the State Council, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments in Shandong, Henan, Jiangxi, Sichuan,
Fujian, Liaoning and Hubei provinces are also working out detailed
rules to implement the new amendments.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that his ministry has made progress in the
administration of mineral resource reserves. By May 31,
two-thirds of China's provinces and autonomous regions had
finished registration of mineral resource reserves of state-owned
mining enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Notable progress has been made toward the drafting of a
national program for mineral resources for 1996-2010 period. The
program, which aims at strengthening the state's macro control
over the mining industry, leaves oil and gas fields and uranium,
tungsten, tin, antimony and rare-earth metals mines in central
government's control.
</P>
<P>
The final draft of the program has been approved by the
Ministry and will be submitted to the State Council for final
approval, according to Jiang.

<P>
SOFIA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov
will pay a state visit to Turkey on July 28 at the invitation of
his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the two leaders are expected to review a wide
range of regional and international issues and to sign agreements
on cooperation in defense and environment protection.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Bulgarian newspaper "Trud,"
Turkish President Demirel voiced his satisfaction over the rapid
development of Bulgarian-Turkish relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish-Bulgarian ties reached a really very good level,"
Demirel was quoted as saying before Stoyanov's arrival.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries are showing good will to promote them further
and adopt an identical policy in search for peace and stability in
the region," he told the newspaper, the biggest in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the two countries signed a friendship treaty to end
their tension that began with Bulgaria's assimilation campaign
against the Bulgarian ethnic Turks in the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Turkish government has expressed its support for
Bulgaria's bid to enter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and to integrate with the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Deliver Last Address, Push for Major Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
will deliver his sixth and last state-of-the-nation address here
today before a joint session of the House of Representatives and
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' speech is expected to give high priority to the
enactment of legislation vital to the implementation of the Social
Reform Agenda (SRA), which the president has been pushing for
since taking office in 1992, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the SRA-related bills, Ramos is also expected to
push for the passage of major bills needed to "pole-vault the
Philippines into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
With the May 1998 elections only 10 months away, the president
will likewise call on the legislators to pass the much-delayed
bill enabling the computerization of the electoral system to
ensure honest, orderly and peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly underscored the urgency of congressional
approval of the electoral reform measure in time for the 1998
elections.
</P>
<P>
Also likely to be included in the president's address are calls
for the congressional approval of an absentee voting bill and the
remaining components of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the absentee voting bill will pave the way
for millions of overseas Filipino workers to exercise their right
of suffrage.
</P>
<P>
Since this will be the last time that Ramos will be addressing
a joint session of congress, he is expected to sum up the gains
the country has achieved under his administration.
</P>
<P>
Today's occasion also marks the opening of the third regular
and final session of the 10th Congress.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has claimed on many occasions that he will not seek a
second term when his constitutional single six-year term expires
in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> 41 Ethnic Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 41 members of the Kayin
National Union (KNU), the largest remaining anti-government ethnic
armed group in Myanmar, surrendered to the government in June, the
official daily The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Those who surrendered in June included the latest turn-in group
of 21, who "traded their arms for peace" in the second half of the
month in the country's four military command areas and the
Tanintharyi division.
</P>
<P>
The KNU, one of the 16 ethnic armed groups in Myanmar, has been
active on the Myanmar-Thai border in armed opposition to the
government. It is also the last group which has not yet made peace
with the government although four rounds of peace talks have been
held.

<HEADLINE> Small Village A Global Model for the Good Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- In a small remote village in east
China, tidy rows of two-story buildings line the streets, the Old
Folk's Association sets local sanitary standards, farmers receive
a steady salary, and no fighting has been reported among residents
for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Tengtou, which was named one of the "Global 500"
model villages by the United Nations in 1993 and has done much in
the meantime to maintain its glowing international reputation.
</P>
<P>
The 810 villagers are proud of their now-fine ecological
environment, booming economy and high moral standards, and are
doing what's necessary to keep on living the good life.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the countryside outside the village in
Zhejiang Province was covered with 1,200 patches of rough,
flood-prone farmland. Now, the area is neatly gridded with some
200 tracts of farmland separated by irrigation ditches, over which
hang grape trellises. Alongside the farmland and next to
riverbanks are more than 4,000 orange trees.
</P>
<P>
A small part of the land to produce grain is managed by
individuals, the other 30 ha is run by six households. The farmers
turn in all the grain they grow in exchange for salaries. They may
be given awards if their grain production exceeds a certain quota.
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping to cultivate farmland, the village's
agriculture company deals with livestock breeding, gardening,
aquatic products, and fruit growing. Last year, the profit from
agriculture hit a high of 700,000 yuan (84,300 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fu Jialiang, village chief for 38 years and head of the Village
Committee, led local farmers in the campaign to turn their
community around.
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, we didn't know what the term 'ecological
environment' meant, but we did know what filthiness is," said Fu.
</P>
<P>
He said villagers decided to first get rid of "dirt and
disorder," then gradually moved on to environmental issues.

<P>
Fourteen elderly people, all members of the Tengtou Old Folk's
Association, are the village's designated sanitation
watchdogs. Once a month, they make a door-to-door check of local
households in search of general sloppiness. Those homes which
aren't up to snuff get a "Not A Clean Home" sign posted on the
front door.
</P>
<P>
The Village Committee requires that all residents behave
appropriately toward each other, keep the environment clean,
uphold social morals and live harmoniously with their family
members.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, no reports of fighting among villagers
or other crimes have been recorded in the local books.
</P>
<P>
But beyond the idyllic image lies Tengtou's economic
backbone: 21 businesses, including seven overseas-funded ventures,
which are concentrated in three industrial zones covering 33 ha.
</P>
<P>
Garment manufacturing is the community's pillar industry. Other
best-selling products made in Tengtou include building materials,
artificial gemstones and electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, total industrial output
value of the village stood at 180 million yuan, with a pre-tax
profit of 13 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, an environmental protection committee was set up
to oversee the village's environmental situation. Over the past
three years it has turned down 15 projects which were potential
polluters and might possibly have been hazardous to people's
health.
</P>
<P>
"To bring these projects into the village is equal to inviting
a wolf into your house," said Luo Zhengyao, who headed the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the per capita income of Tengtou villagers exceeded
7,000 yuan; the figure was only 300 yuan in 1980. In contrast, the
1996 net income of farmers in economically-booming Zhejiang
Province as a whole was 3,463 yuan.

Villagers are quick to point out that their crowning
achievements are the general prosperity and lack of crime. Fu
Jialiang attributes this to the willingness of local cadres to
help out and that all capable villagers are come to the aid of
others in need.
</P>
<P>
Shan Liangfa moved his family to Tengtou 12 years ago when they
were relocated from a reservoir area. Shan's legs are paralyzed
and his wife is mute. They have three sons and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
As soon as he arrived in the village, Shan was hired as a
sanitation worker and his children were recruited to work in the
village's enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We can earn 15,000 yuan a year, and we are living a happy
life," Shan said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Fu Jialiang says he's still aiming higher, and predicts the
quality of life for his fellow villagers will continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the thriving local economy, Tengtou has spent several
million yuan to build a kindergarten, an elementary school, a
library, newspaper stands, a village history exhibition hall, and
a closed-circuit TV system.
</P>
<P>
Various experts are often invited to the village to give
lectures. At present, more than 13 percent of the workforce hold
college-equivalent diplomas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the little village has attracted a
large number of visitors from both at home and abroad, including
some leading government officials.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun noted during his tour of
Tengtou last November that the village epitomizes the
future of China's countryside.
</P>
<P>
Following a visit to Tengtou in May, United Nations official
John R. Krummel said that the village sets a good example for the
world with its coordinated environmental and economic
achievements.

<HEADLINE> Georgian FM Prefers Russian Withdrawal From Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A mechanism should be created in
the conflict zone of Abkhazia to replace Russian peacekeepers
there, Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili said today.
</P>
<P>
It is more expedient, Menagarishvili was quoted as saying by
reports from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, to have the
peace-making mechanism than extending the peacekeepers' mandate.
</P>
<P>
In what he described at a press conference as his "personal
opinion," he said it is necessary to work out such a mechanism to
"exclude any possibility of the resumption of combat operations."
</P>
<P>
In a related development on Friday, Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze said the world community's opinion should be taken
into account in deciding the Russian force's presence in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Georgia's parliament speaker Zurab Zhvaniya said
the country's leadership had not been in agreement on the issue
but a decision "is to be made in the few days to come."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A sultry summer like this makes
the wind of benevolence under the wings of China's poor children
all the more gratifying.
</P>
<P>
A charity program -- Wind Beneath My Wings -- is calling or
donations from the international community, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The program, announced in Beijing on Saturday, is being
organized by the Expert Committee of China National Committee on
care for Children (CNCCC) and the Foundation for Underdeveloped
Regions in China (FURC).
</P>
<P>
The organizations will use donations to assist poor children.
The initiative will continue until August 26, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
On August 29, donors will receive certificates commemorating
their help.
</P>
<P>
One-third of China's 60 million poverty-stricken people are
children -- nine million under age four and with varying degrees
of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Universal Furniture and Stanley Works initiated the project,
assisted by the Mcphees, members of Plan International, a
non-governmental organization aiding the poor.
</P>
<P>
CNCCC was formed in 1991, after the Chinese government
developed the National Program of Action for Child Development in
China.
</P>
<P>
CNCCC is a non-governmental organization comprised of senior
experts and professors. It has 400,000 grass-roots organizations
with 2.4 million members in 30 provinces and municipalities.

<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, the nation's
leading foreign exchange bank, will try harder to hedge against
financial risks and improve its credit assets in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
The bank will strive to reduce non-performing loans by two to
three percentage points this year, and to cut the amount of poor
assets in the coming years, BOC President Wang Xuebin said
yesterday in Beijing, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Supervision and examination will be strengthened and the
reduction of poor assets will become an important standard to
judge the performance of branches, Wang said during the bank's
national work conference for branch presidents.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that clearing bad assets should coincide
with the business expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We will promote the readjustment of assets structure through
business development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Funds will be concentrated to meet the demands of key customers
and projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
And to ensure the continuous expansion of the bank's strength,
the bank will make greater efforts to attract deposits in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The bank's outstanding renminbi deposits by the end of June
amounted to 519 billion yuan (62.5 billion US dollars), 30 billion
yuan (3.6 billion US dollars) more than at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Its outstanding foreign exchange savings hit 31.4 billion US
dollars, still the lion's share of the nation's total.
