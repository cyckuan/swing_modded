<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Party Wants Role for Rebels in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's mainstream moderate
Tamil party said Monday that Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) rebels must be involved in a peace dialogue as part of
efforts to end the long-running ethnic bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) made clear its stand
to President Chandrika Kumaratunga during discussions Monday, the
party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The TULF impressed upon the government that the LTTE should be
involved in the negotiating process in order to bring an end to
the war and (ensure) an effective resolution of the conflict," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The TULF also conveyed its objections to the proposed new
constitution which will devolve more powers to regions including
one administered by minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The party said it felt the new constitution agreed by the
ruling People's Alliance and the main opposition United National
Party (UNP), which together represent the majority Sinhalese
community, had watered down the original proposals made five years
ago by Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
"The TULF made its rejection known to the president, but both
sides agreed to meet again and discuss the issues," a TULF
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The government had hoped that granting a greater degree of
devolution would win over the moderate Tamils and marginalize the
militant LTTE rebels who are fighting for an independent homeland
called Eelam in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983. The rebels
have rejected the peace plan, first unveiled by President
Kumaratunga in August 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Experts Suggest Integrated Approach for CHT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts on affairs in Chittagong
Hill Tracts (CHT), the unstable hill district in the southeastern
part of Bangladesh, Monday suggested carrying on integrated
development work in the district, aiming at smooth implementation
of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dialogue on "Peace Building in the CHT" organized
by Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies,
they said an integrated approach should be initiated to make the
accord between the government and the Parbattya Chattagram
Janasanghati Samity (PCJSS) (CHT People's Solidarity Committee)
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
They also laid emphasis on removing all misunderstandings and
fears existing between the members of both tribal and non-tribal
communities, and to establish real peace in CHT region after a two-
decade insurgency.
</P>
<P>
They noted the need for political consensus to restore peace in
the region, saying that all major political parties should come
forward in all national issues including the implementation of CHT
peace accord by giving up narrow party interests.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the experts' suggestion, State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury said the peace accord signed for
establishing peace in the region has brought tremendous changes in
the life style of the tribal people.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the implementation process, the minister said the
government has already rehabilitated the tribal refugees returned
from the Indian State of Tripura and is providing rations and
shelters for them.
</P>
<P>
He said as part of the rehabilitation process, the government
has recruited about 8,000 tribal youths into police force and many
others into different departments.
</P>
<P>
"A land commission which was formed after the signing of the
accord, is going to function to settle the land dispute in the
region," Chowdhury said, adding that the civil administration has
been established in the region after the signing of the accord.

<HEADLINE> Embattled Israeli PM Leaves for Camp David Summit EDS: Updates with Barak's speech at the airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (XInhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
departed on Monday for the Camp David summit due to begin on
Tuesday in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ben-Gurion International Airport, Tel Aviv,
before his departure, Barak said he is going to the mission with
the mandate of the entire people and "this is a time when all of us
have to make sacrifices."
</P>
<P>
He said that despite all possible difficulties, he would try
to "allow the best of our youngsters to come and prosper" and to "
create a different future" for the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that as a long-time solider, he fully understands
the pain and anguish of the parents and families that have lost
their beloved ones.
</P>
<P>
"The moment of truth has come", he said, when it is possible for
the Israelis and Palestinians to end the 52-year-old conflict and
achieve durable peace.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the principles to guide his negotiations with the
Palestinians in the U.S.-brokered tripartite summit, namely, no
return to the 1967 border, no foreign troops in the west of the
Jordan valley, the maintenance of a united Jerusalem under Israeli
sovereignty, a majority of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza strip to be kept under Israeli control, and no recognition on
the Israeli part of either moral or legal responsibility for
creating the problem of the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to stand fast by the principles in the negotiations and
will only sign an agreement that will strengthen the Israeli
security. Once there is a peace deal, he said, he will submit it to
the people for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who came to power a year ago with a major
mission to bring about peace, also called on the Palestinians to
clean up the atmosphere for the summit. He said:"We have come to
decisive crossroads", where there is a "choice between us" for
either flourishing peace or furthering violence and hostility.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that his peace partner, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, will have the backing of the people and will have the
ability to make decisions for peace.
</P>
<P>
Before heading for the airport, Barak has just survived in a no-
confidence vote initiated by the opposition aimed at toppling his
government and thwarting his efforts to conduct crucial
negotiations with the Palestinians in the U.S.-brokered Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak is aimed at hammering out a framework deal for the
settlement of such thorny issues as the status of Jerusalem, the
future of Jewish settlements, border, water resources and the
return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the no-confidence vote, which showed Barak's lack
of a majority support in the Knesset (parliament), together with
the shaky 42-seat minority coalition government left following the
resignation of three rebellious parties, increased doubts about the
prime minister's ability to make fateful decisions and decisive
compromises that the upcoming negotiations will require.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has been pursuing a peace deal with the Palestinians,
has overcome a number of hurdles on the way to the summit and is
finally approaching it after having swallowed so many insults and
disgraces in efforts to keep his shaky government from falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Barak is expected to go all out to seize
the chance. However, what lies ahead may prove to be even tougher
challenges for him.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians have conducted scores of rounds of
open and secret talks trying to strike a framework deal to guide
the settling of the most contentious final status issues. They have
also been trying to resolve the interim issues such as the final
redeployment of Israeli forces in the West Bank, the release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the opening of the
northern safety passage linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
However, little progress has been made in the talks, which led
to the mutual accusations of foot dragging and an escalation of
verbal threats on both sides with the looming of the September
deadline for a comprehensive and permanent peace deal and the
Palestinians' expected declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who had been reluctant to attend a summit meeting, called
for a three-way summit with him, Arafat, U.S. President Bill
Clinton, citing no further low-level negotiation efforts can break
the impasse. The Palestinians have been hesitant and skeptical
about the outcome of the summit, given the fact that the two sides
are far apart on their positions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have insisted on declaring a state with East
Jerusalem as its capital, urging the Israeli withdrawal from land
occupied since the 1967 Mideast War, and fighting for the refugees'
return. But these are sharply contradictory to the "red lines" that
Barak is bringing to the summit negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the difficulties is the mounting opposition Barak
encounters at home on various fronts. With the defections of the
his three ruling partners, the four-seat Yisrael Ba'aliya, the
five-seat National Religious Party and the 17-seat Shas Party,
Barak is left with a crippling minority coalition in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Center Party leader and Minister of Transport Amnon Lipkin-
Shahak, who is also part of the Israeli delegation to the Camp
David summit, predicted on Monday that an early election is
foreseeable.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government may somehow manage to stay for a while with
the support of some left-leaning parties outside the coalition. The
prime minister's objective is to bring a peace accord back home and
put it to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Despite serious concerns about the disintegration of Barak's
government, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed
the optimism that chances are good for Barak to clinch a deal with
the Palestinians. Barak's security advisor Danny Yatom also made an
optimistic assessment about the prospects of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Africa Must Assume Own Responsibility: Algerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Out-going chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika said here on Monday that Africa is rightly expecting a
greater and a more efficient assistance from the international
community, but it must assume its own responsibility in making
peace, stability, security and integration a reality.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an overall report at the opening session
of the 36th annual summit of OAU attended by over 30 heads of
state and government.
</P>
<P>
The proposed African Union is aimed at preparing Africa for the
radical changes brought about by globalization and powerful
regional blocks and at maximizing its economic, social and
political resources and potentialities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "if no significant improvement is brought
about or seriously considered to connect Africa to the world
system of exchanges, the marginalization of our continent fraught
with severe dangers could make Africa the victim of the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary summit held in Sirte, Libya last September
called for the creation of the African Union and Pan-African
Parliament as a major step to speed up the integration process.
</P>
<P>
The OAU foreign ministers adopted a draft treaty on the
establishment of the African Union in Tripoli, Libya in early June
this year and submitted it to the three-day summit in Lome for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Though most members agreed in principle on the need for
establishing the Union, differences emerged over the speed, the
nature and the form of the Union during the meeting of the council
of ministers ahead of the summit, with South Africa advocating a
progressive method and Libya insisting on establishing it no later
than 2001 as stipulated in the Sirte Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Such huge unifying project should evolve in a sure and
realistic manner according to the accepted schedule, Bouteflika
said.
</P>
<P>
The president also talked about the progress that African
countries have made in finding peaceful solution to the various
conflicts on the continent, especially the cease-fire agreement
between Ethiopia and Eritrea to bring an end to their two-year
border conflict under the OAU mediation.
</P>
<P>
He blamed lack of interest in peace of some warring parties to
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the
difficult peace process and delay in the deployment of the 5,500 U.
N. peacekeeping force to enforce the Lusaka cease-fire agreement
signed last July.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the appeal for the total cancellation of Africa's
external debt, which amounted to an estimated 359 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999.

Emirates Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan Tuesday issued federal
decrees endorsing the UAE's signing to regional and international
agreements as well as bilateral agreements with Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Demands Removal of New Turkish Checkpoint in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the U.N. Peacekeeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) Major General Victory Rana on Tuesday
demanded that the Turkish military remove a new checkpoint it set
up on the southeastern area of the island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military set up the checkpoint last month to
restrict the movement of U.N. peacekeepers on the island, in
retaliation for the United Nations decision to renew UNFICYP's
mandate without asking for Turkey's approval.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Cyprus News Agency, UNFICYP spokeswoman Sarah
Russell stressed that UNFICYP regards the new checkpoint as a
serious violation of the status quo in Strovilia in the
southeastern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
According to Russell, the UNFICYP commander went through the
checkpoint and walked around the Strovilia village on Monday in an
inspection.
</P>
<P>
She said Rana reported the situation there as being "quiet," but
noted that people there have complained about the checkpoint and
the additional Turkish military presence.
</P>
<P>
There are now three soldiers at the new checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Rana also met with an officer of the Turkish occupation troops
to protested about the checkpoint and demanded its removal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the east Mediterranean island after a short-lived
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Since then, about 35,000 Turkish troops have stationed in
northern Cyprus with the claimed aim of protecting the security of
the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Now there are about 1,240 UNFICYP soldiers on the island,
maintaining the 180-kilometer long ceasefire line between the two
communities.

<HEADLINE> UAE Workforce Registers Quantum Leap: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The workforce of the United Arab
Emirates has registered a quantum leap, with the overall volume
rising from just 288,414 in 1975, to 1,378,390 in 1999, the
official WAM news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a published report, the news agency said experts
attribute this rise mainly to a big increase in the number of
educated men and women entering the country's workforce every year.
</P>
<P>
The number of national women in the overall workforce has been
rising by an average of 14.3 percent per year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, there was a noticeable change in the
pattern, with the construction sector employing only 14 percent of
the workforce, as against 26 percent previously. The wholesale and
retail sector now accounts for 22 percent, up from 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 200,000 high school students will
graduate this year, and another 46,000 will acquire university
degrees.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Reject Jewish Star of David as Relief Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Tuesday rejected
the attempts made by the United States and Israel to pressure the
International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (ICRC)
into accepting the Jewish star of David as one of its symbols.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said that the
star of David stands for war and destruction carried by Israeli
warplanes that bombard Arab civilians.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Cairo-based pan-Arab organization added that
the ICRC should not use it simultaneously with the cross and
crescent
which symbolize peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Magen David Adom relief agency, which operates under a
red star of David, has been demanding its symbol be internationally
recognized along with the cross and the crescent, but the move has
been continually rejected.
</P>
<P>
According to an Arab League report, Israel and the U.S. are
putting political and financial pressure on the ICRC to make sure
the star of David be adopted as an internationally recognized
relief symbol.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said he told ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger
during a recent meeting in Geneva that Arabs would not accept any
addition to the two internationally recognized symbols currently in
use.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the reason behind numerous wars and massacres which
have left thousands of innocent Arab civilians dead, he said,
calling for a meeting of representatives of Arab governments and
Red Cross and Red Crescent societies to discuss the issue in
August.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Arrest of Turkish Cypriot Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government Tuesday
condemned the "illegal arrest" of Turkish Cypriot journalists by
the breakaway Turkish Cypriot regime as an attempt to muzzle the
press.
</P>
<P>
According to Greek Cypriot media, four journalists of the
Turkish Cypriot newspaper "Avrupa" and two other persons in the
Turkish Cypriot area have been arrested on charges of spying
against the Turkish Cypriot regime and Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Acting government spokesman Spyros Arotis said the arrest of the
journalists was aimed at muzzling and abolishing the right of
freedom of the press and terrorizing the people in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Arotis said the Cyprus government condemns such practice and
calls for the intervention of the international community,
particularly the Council of Europe and the European Union, to
safeguard the rights of the arrested persons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Union of Cyprus Journalists Andreas
Kannaouros Tuesday dismissed allegations of the breakaway state in
northern Cyprus that himself and a Turkish Cypriot journalist in
southern Cyprus were agents of the Cyprus Central Information
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Kannaouros said such false accusations are part of a "fascist
campaign" aimed at the Turkish Cypriot community.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided into
the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974
following a Turkish invasion after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway
state in northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) Tuesday urged its members to exploit all
the fishery potential in the region to increase export earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the COMESA secretariat in
Lusaka, the fish potential of the COMESA region is estimated at 6.
7 million tons per year, yet only about 2.8 million tons are
exploited.
</P>
<P>
Once the quality of fish and fishery products is improved and
more fish is harvested and processed, export earnings can be
increased greatly from the current 200 million U.S. dollars a year,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Expects China's Entry into WTO before Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Liu Hao, Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
LOME, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Mike Moore affirmed on Tuesday that China will
join the WTO within this year as the remaining technical problems
are to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Moore, who is here attending the 36th summit of the
Organization of the African Unity (OAU) as an observer, told a
press conference that as a big power, China will play an important
role in the WTO once its membership is obtained.
</P>
<P>
"There are just some technical problems. I've seen no great
problems of principle. I'm hopeful this will be done this year
before the new year, not the Chinese new year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moore said that besides China, Chinese Taipei, Jordan, Georgia,
Latvia, Croatia and Oman will also join WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries want to join the WTO because globalization is a
reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between the WTO and African countries, Moore
said that WTO has been making efforts to prevent Africans from
being marginalized in the economic globalization, because 41 of
the 137 WTO members are from Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore has attracted more investment than the whole Africa,
" he said. "Nobody says this (trade) system is fair or perfect, we
need to find the right way to improve it."
</P>
<P>
According to Moore, the WTO this year negotiated with the
developed countries over a wider access to the products from the
least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
But he also urged the Africans to increase their
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders are here considering the Draft Constitutive
Act of the African Union initiated during an extraordinary summit
on September 9, 1999 in Sirte, Libya and the Draft Protocol to the
Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community relating to the
Pan-African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
They are also debating the Decisions and Recommendations of the
71st and 72nd Ordinary sessions of the Council of Ministers and
Regulations of the 6th and 7th Ordinary sessions of the African
Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, the OAU is designated to promote the
unity and solidarity of the African states, defend the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of members, coordinate and
intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for
the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following eradicating all forms of colonialism from Africa, the
organization has been focused on peace and development in an
effort to reverse the growing marginalization of Africa in
economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges to Increase Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has urged his people to increase production in order to
improve welfare and pay back foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call on Monday when addressing a
gathering in the eastern Morogoro region after he inaugurated a 27.
5 million U.S. dollar hydro-power project funded by several
European countries and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We must get rid of the concept of receiving free things and
produce efficiently and pay back to lenders the money they gave us
for the development projects so as to maintain the country's image
and dignity," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent debt cancellation for Tanzania through the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries initiative, Mkapa said "it does not mean
that all our debts have been cancelled and we still have debts to
pay and we have to pay."
</P>
<P>
This will prove to donors and the international community that
Tanzania is capable of planning, executing, monitoring and
sustaining its own development projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
In April, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
approved 2 billion dollars of debt relief for cash-strapped
Tanzania, halving the east African country's debt servicing bill
for 2001-2003 and reducing it by a third in future years.
</P>
<P>
Before the cancellation, Tanzania had an outstanding external
debt amounting to about 6.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Belgian FM Defends Visit to Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian foreign minister
defended his trip to Kinshasa prior to his country's announcement
of an arrest warrant against the Congolese foreign minister, local
television reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel said that he went to the
Congolese capital for the 40th anniversary of the African country'
s independence and that he was there still with a final decision
pending on the Congolese government official, according to the
local television network, RTBF.
</P>
<P>
The network for the French-speaking part of the country said
that even though he knew about the arrest warrant, the foreign
minister would still make the trip.
</P>
<P>
Belgium last week announced that it had issued an arrest
warrant against Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia on
charges of crimes against humanity. The arrest warrant was signed
on April 11 by Brussels Magistrate Damien Vandermeersh but was
only issued almost a month later due to legal and technical
reasons, according to jurisdiciary explanations.
</P>
<P>
Michel explained that it was last week when his ministry
notified the Congolese foreign ministry about the issuance of the
arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
The African country has recalled its Brussels-based ambassador
to "consult with" the incident while two of the Belgian cabinet
officials had to call off their scheduled visits to the Congo, a
former colony of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Democratic Christian Party from the Flemish-
speaking half of Belgium labeled the incident as the start of a
political dispute domestically.
</P>
<P>
A fax document from the Belgian justice ministry confirmed that
Belgium had issued the arrest warrant on June 6, long before the
Belgian foreign minister's trip to the Congo at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was only made known on July 3 after Michel
had returned from a ceremony on June 30 in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians made the move after Congolese refugees had accused
their foreign minister of inciting hatred against them in August
1998 in speeches using such discriminative words as "vermin" and "
extermination
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued in line with a 1993 Belgian law
that demands arrest of those who have committed crimes against
international human rights no matter where they have committed the
crimes and what nationality they are of.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese foreign minister is now liable to arrest if he
enters Belgium or any other country that is willing to execute the
arrest warrant.

LIMA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 500,000 women die each year all
over the world due to causes related with pregnancy and childbirth,
said Tuesday here representative of United Nations Population Fund
(UNPF) Rogelio Fernandez Castilla.
</P>
<P>
"Every minute a woman loses her life resulting from pregnancy
and every minute between 10 and 15 women suffer injuries and
infections when giving birth", emphasized Fernandez in the

According to the UNPF official, maternal mortality is an
exclusive problem of underdeveloped countries, because in
developed ones this problem has been brought down to its minimum
expression.
</P>
<P>
According to official data of Ministry of Health, in Peru every
year between 500 and 1,700 deaths of women come about owing to
toxemia, hemorrhages, abortions, and other complications related
with pregnancy and puerperium.
</P>

The 36 percent of women dead were between 20 and 29 years old;
another 35 percent went between 30 and 39 years: and the remaining
29 percent corresponded to ones under 20," he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Are Looking for Romanian Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign companies are looking
for an increasing number of Romanian experts because they are
considered to be very good professionals, the official Rompres
news agency reported on Tuesday citing an article in the daily
Ziarul Financiar.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Ministry of Labor and Social Security has lately
signed labor agreements with Germany, Israel, Hungary, Spain,
Ireland, Switzerland Saudi Arabia, according to which Romanian
experts in different fields will go to work in these country for a
while, the daily informed.
</P>
<P>
Germany is ready for receiving 10,000 experts in information
technology from Central and Eastern Europe on the basis of an
expert exchange program. Since the Romanian experts in the field "
are very good", it is expected Romania will "get 5,000-6,000 jobs",
Secretary of State in the Ministry of Labor and Social Security,
Norica Nicolai was quoting as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel also wants 10,000 IT experts from Romania. Norica
Nicolai said that the Ministry of Labor and Social Security would
diminish this number because too many experts were supposed to
leave. Since Romania and Israel have not signed a frame agreement
on labor yet, the ministry will answer the Israeli side after the
publication of the methodological norms to be appended to the Law
of Labor abroad in order to be able to impose and follow the
minimal clauses of the contract that refer to wages, worktime and
payment of social security.
</P>
<P>
The first Romanians, out of a number of 8,000 people, start
leaving for Hungary for a seasonal work on the basis of a
cooperation agreement between Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Romania has also signed an agreement with Switzerland. As many
as 150 Romanian probationers will go to this country every year.
Through a negotiated agreement, the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security has obtained an equal treatment on wages and health
insurance for Romanians as extended to Swiss citizens.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is ready for offering work contracts for Romanian
physicians and oil engineers and authorities of this country and
officials in Bucharest are holding talks in this respect.
</P>
<P>
According to Norica Nicolai, Romania will also sign agreements
on manpower with Spain and Ireland. For instance, Ireland, mainly,
requires Romanian experts in construction, infrastructure, and
public utilities.

<HEADLINE> White House and Business leader Rap Nonproliferation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) The Clinton administration and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while trying hard to push for an
early passage of the China trade legislation through the Senate,
have lashed out at a bill floated by some senators calling for
punishment of China's arms sale by restricting its access to U.S.
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The senate bill, formally known as China Nonproliferation Act (
S.2645), was sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) and
Robert Torricelli(D-N.J.). It stipulates that the U.S. should
punish China's arms sale to America's enemies or war-prone regions
by barring its fund-raising activities in U.S. markets, and
restricting U.S. Export-import Bank financing and credit
guarantees for China-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
It calls for annual assessment of China's nonproliferation and
authorizes the U.S. president to carry out the sanctions once
relevant accords are found breached.
</P>
<P>
The White House, however, is strongly opposed to the bill,
regarding it as some senators' attempt to set up a new hurdle for
an early passage of the legislation granting Permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) to China.
</P>
<P>
"It is yet another example of an ill-conceived unilateral
sanctions bill," said Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstadt
in a speech.
</P>
<P>
"It would diminish our ability to work with China on missile
proliferation," and "it would hurt our interest more than China's
by undermining confidence in U.S. financial markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the National Security Council said
on Monday that such a bill is "unnecessary" and counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, also lambasted the Senate bill in an article published
by the Washington Post on Monday, stressing that unilateral
sanctions not only don't work, but also isolate the United States
from its allies and cost American jobs.
</P>
<P>
Donohue called the Thompson-Torricelli bill "fundamentally
flawed," since it would trigger "elaborate and counterproductive
unilateral sanctions" against the Chinese government and any
person, company or group operating in China, and end up "hurting
American farmers, manufacturers and workers."
</P>
<P>
He wrote that it is unnecessary to have the bill, because it
could also "hinder U.S. efforts to prevent proliferation by
politicizing the process of determining violations."
</P>
<P>
The bill could "deal a devastating blow to U.S. exporters" by
putting their eighth-largest export market, China, at risk,
Donohue wrote, adding that "losing China which the U.S.
Department of Agriculture projects could account for one-third of
growth in U.S. farm exports would be a major setback."
</P>
<P>
"The Thompson-Torricelli bill would end up isolating the United
States, not China," Donohue wrote in the article.
</P>
<P>
"Decades of experience suggest that our European and Asian
allies will not support unilateral U.S. sanctions. Consequently, U.
S. security will suffer by inciting hostility from our key allies
and China against U.S. nonproliferation objectives," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the bill would undermine U.S.- Sino relations," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Donohue called on the Senate to reject the Thompson-Torricelli
bill, "which is being rushed through Congress without appropriate
deliberation."
</P>
<P>
"If it wants to advance America's national security, the Senate
should pass permanent normal trade relations for China, which will
bring the Asian giant under the world's rules-based trading system
and broaden our engagement and our ability to bring about positive
change," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate Minority leader Tom Daschle said Monday that
he was "alarmed" that no date had been set for a vote on China
PNTR this month, and he thought the Republicans were now trying to
delay the vote until after the Congress returns from its August
recess.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott, a Republican, said that he
supported the PNTR bill but would not decide on a date for a vote
at present. He said the major obstacle to setting a date is
Democratic objections to taking up the Thompson-Torricelli
legislation as "a parallel bill."

<HEADLINE> Research: Intense Competition Reshapes Worldwide Consulting Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Along with large growth, the
worldwide consulting market will experience heightened competition,
significantly altering market dynamics, a U.S. research firm
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the Internet
economy will help to more than double worldwide consulting
revenues from 60.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 124.5 billion
dollars in 2004. However, Internet services pureplays and spin-off
companies from other industries will all fight to get in on the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time that the Internet has provided tremendous
opportunities for consulting services, the changes it has
instigated have created considerable challenges to the more
established firms, which are finding themselves in a completely
new competitive environment," IDC said in the report. "New
consulting firms are springing up almost every day and grabbing
clients' attentions. These newcomers are beginning to usurp the
position of the established firms. To fight off this threat, the
older firms will have to revamp and reinvent themselves." In the
spirit of seeking new opportunities, some consulting firms have
taken the step to offer consulting online.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the tight competition, IDC believes consulting
firms will have the chance to experience tremendous growth. The
United States is and will remain the biggest opportunity. In 1999,
it accounted for 52.3 percent of worldwide revenues, and will
account for 51.6 percent of the market in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The fatest-growing regional market for consulting services will
be in Asia-Pacific. Revenues in this region excluding Japan will
increase at a compound annual growth rate of 26.8 percent from
1999 to 2004, compared with a 15.5 percent annual growth rate for
the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing and banking spend more on consulting than other
industries. Discrete and process manufacturing spent 6.7 billion
dollars on consulting last year and will spend 13.5 billion
dollars in 2004. Banking consulting revenues will grow from almost
5 billion dollars in 1999 to 11.5 billion dollars in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Violence Could Erupt if Summit Fails: Israeli Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Violence could erupt throughout
the territories if the three-way Camp David summit fails, said a
senior Israeli military intelligence officer here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians could take to the streets again and militant
groups in the West Bank and Gaza Strip could storm the Jewish
settlements and conduct other anti-Israel activists, Military
Intelligence Chief Amos Malka told the Foreign Affairs and Defence
Committee of the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The information gathered by the military intelligence showed
that the Palestinians are watching closely the development at Camp
David and if no agreement is reached during the summit, the
situation in the territories could again spin out of control, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The military intelligence is of the view that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will unilaterally declare an independent Palestinian
state in the territories if the summit achieves no results, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership does not want violence to erupt
again, but they are also worried of the situation if the summit
fails to resolve the emotive issues that have fueled the Israeli-
Palestinian bloody conflict for decades, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas (Islamic Militant
Resistance Movement) and Islamic Jihad (holy war fighters) are
ready to sabotage the summit by launching attacks, and in the long
run their aim could be directed at Jewish settlements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said, the Israeli military was instructed to be well
prepared and Israeli and Palestinian security forces had been put
on high alert to prevent the sort of bombings and shootings that
have derailed peacemaking in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak are at Camp David
near Washington and will start their summit Tuesday to try to
resolve the key issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, borders and Jewish settlements, under the watchful eyes
of United States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The summit will last for over a week.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Summit Could Achieve Positive Results: Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin expressed optimism here Tuesday that the three-way Camp
David summit could achieve positive results and agreement could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that agreement could be reached at this Camp
David summit because both (Israeli) Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat realize that the price of failure
at the summit talks would be high," Beilin told foreign reporters
at a press conference organized by the Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Barak, Arafat and United States President Bill Clinton gathered
at Camp David near Washington Tuesday for the crucial summit, which
will try to reach a framework agreement on the key issues of
Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and
water.
</P>
<P>
"Without an agreement it will be bad, ....but I think the high
expectations and hopes create a situation whereby it is almost
impossible to return home without an agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beilin was one of the architects who helped forge the 1993 Oslo
accords between Israel and Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization that provided outlines and principles for the
settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
Each side has much to pay if there is a failure at the summit,
he said, adding that the agreement could not be reached without
compromises from both sides.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Deputy Interior Minister Summoned to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Interior Minister
Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was in charge of election affairs during
February's parliamentary polling, was summoned to a public court in
the capital city of Tehran on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since reformists landslide victory in the February parliamentary
elections, the conservative Guardians Council, an election
watchdog, has repeatedly alleged widespread rigging and held
Tajzadeh responsible for the "dishonest behavior."
</P>
<P>
However, Tajzadeh said before going to the court that the summon
had nothing to do with the elections, adding that he was summoned
to give evidence in connection with a so-called video-cassette
case, the official IRNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Tehran public court issued arrest warrants for two
prominent reformist lawyers, Mohsen Rahami and Shirin Ebadi, on
charges of making and distributing insulting remarks in video-
cassettes against some officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the IRNA report, Tajzadeh said he had "important
and revealing" points to make about the video-cassette case and he
hoped to have a chance to disclose them to the public in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of his detention since he was
summoned as an informed source in the case.
</P>
<P>
Tajzadeh accused the powerful conservative bloc of plotting to
create problems and crack down on the reformist movement. "Some
hands behind the scenes" are at work to create new problems or
exert pressure on the judiciary to take action on reformists, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while the court decision to summon him was
apparently made Monday night, some conservative newspapers had
already announced the possible action five days ago, which he said
indicated a clear plot.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's justice department should provide a convincing
explanation to the public as to why some publications opposed to
the government had been informed of the issue five days earlier and
even published it before it was formally announced, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether President Mohammad Khatami and Interior Minister
Musavi Lari were aware of the summon in advance, Tajzadeh said
neither of them "had any prior knowledge of the issue."
</P>
<P>
Tajzadeh said that since Khatami, the architect of the reformist
movement, is currently on a visit to Germany, he could not rule out
the possibility that some people are moving to "overshadow such an
important visit."
</P>
<P>
Despite their humiliating defeat in the parliamentary elections,
the conservatives still control most of the powerful state organs
such as the judiciary and the military.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, any legislation passed by the reformist-dominated
Majlis must be approved by the conservative Guardian Council before
becoming law.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Issue on Cheaper Drugs Dominates AIDS Conference by Yu Dabo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The price of AIDS medication,
unaffordable to millions of people, remains to be one of the most
heated debates at the ongoing 13th International AIDS Conference
which was opened in Durban, South Africa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from varying political parties have almost unanimously
demanded lower price of AIDS medicine while some delegates
presented to the meeting papers focusing on the topics of
providing cheaper drugs and treatment to poor countries with large
populations suffering from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major international pharmaceutical companies and the
UN anti-AIDS project, the UNAIDS, are facing the wrath of AIDS
activists who claim that the companies' programs for cheaper AIDS
medicine were appalling.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,000 people gathered in front of the conference center
prior to the meeting, demanding greater access to drugs for people
in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
They were eager to know when the price of drugs will come down,
saying that promises for cheaper drugs had been made a long time
ago, without any specific action taken by either UNAIDS or the
relevant pharmaceutical departments.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 90 percent of those who need
HIV drugs have no way of getting them, fueling the spread of the
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS explained that it had sought to bring down the cost of
drugs from between 25,000 U.S. dollars and 12,000 dollars a year
to below 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) released a
detailed five-year working agenda on Monday, vowing to make AIDS
vaccines available to developing countries. A key element in the
agenda is a firm commitment from richer nations to purchase
vaccines for use in hard-hit developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure, pharmaceutical companies have also
promised to donate medicine and money to help African countries
fight the devastating AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the international Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation pledged 50 million dollars over five years to help
South Africa strengthen its primary health care system. South
Africa has an estimated 4.2 million AIDS sufferers, the highest
rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical giant Merck and Co. said it would donate 100
million dollars worth of medicine and money to help fight AIDS in
Botswana, where nearly 36 percent of adults are infected.
</P>
<P>
A German drug company Boehringer-Ingelheim Friday promised to
offer the drug Nevirapine free for five years to developing
countries to help reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
Boehringer-Ingelheim and Merck are two of the five major drug
companies which announced on May 11 that they would work with
governments in Africa and other poor regions to sharply cut the
overall costs of HIV/AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
But activists noted that the fact is that the promises have not
been worked even two months later when a total of 24.5 million
Africans infected with the virus that causes AIDS are still
suffering from the pain of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Many government officials and activists are unimpressed by the
pharmaceuticals' offer and accuse the companies of simply trying
to garner good publicity to distract people from the high price of
their vital medicines, claiming that many of the donations are
limited both in amounts and time.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want giveaways. We don't want (some) free drugs. We'd
rather they reduce the price of (all) their drugs," said Sharon
Ekambaram, an official with the HIV/AIDS People's Treatment Action
Campaign in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism, Merck said the companies were
working to solve the problem of high drug prices and defended the
offer made in May.
</P>
<P>
South African Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang stressed
that one of the conditions which the South African government
wants the companies to adhere to is that offers made to South
Africa should also be made to other Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) countries, whose health ministers have made clear
their need and desire for cheaper drugs.

<HEADLINE> AZT Treatment Overwhelmingly Positive: U.S. Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Renowned American scientist
Dr. David Ho on Tuesday said anti-retrovirals such as AZT have
achieved overwhelmingly positive results.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the treatment caused certain side effects,
the scientist said that " the balance of the equation is so
clearly positive."
</P>
<P>
This has been clearly demonstrated by the drop in AID mortality
rates when drugs targeting the HIV were administered, said Ho,
adding that "this is what changed the industrialized world."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the South African government to provide AZT
to pregnant women to prevent the disease from being transmitted to
their unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
"It is cheaper to have healthy babies, than to give medical
treatment to HIV-positive babies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of 1 million women pregnant annually in
South Africa, around 250,000 are HIV positive. As a result, 5,000
babies are born with HIV every month.
</P>
<P>
Ho, scientific director and chief executive officer at the
Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Centre at the Rockerfeller University
in New York, has done ground-breaking work on the effects of anti-
retrovirals on AIDS patients.

<HEADLINE> West African Leaders Discuss Sierra Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Six west African countries have held
a mini summit on the Sierra Leone conflict on the sideline of the
ongoing 36th annual summit of the Organization of African Unity (
OAU) in the Togolese capital of Lome, sources from the OAU summit
revealed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the meeting on Monday night, shortly
after the opening ceremony of the OAU summit, were presidents of
Togo, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana and Mali as well as Liberian
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
They discussed a proposal submitted to the OAU summit by the
Council of Ministers calling for the U.N. Security Council to take
appropriate measures to prosecute rebel leader Foday Sankoh for
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) refused to disarm
under the Lome peace agreement signed last July with Sierra Leone
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to end an eight-year-long brutal
civil war, during which rebels maimed, killed and raped civilians.
</P>
<P>
The rebels even took over 500 U.N. peacekeeping troops hostage
in May and fired at demonstrators in front of Sankoh's residence
in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to strangle the ability of Sierra Leone's rebels to
finance a civil war, the U.N. Security Council imposed a ban on
July 6 on illicit diamond exports from the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution bans all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone until
President Kabbah's government can set up a proper certification
system for the gems, as well as regain access to diamond mining
areas under rebel control.

<HEADLINE> 12 Million to Die Because of Prohibitive Cost of Drugs: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Twelve million HIV sufferers
in the developing world probably die in the next five years
because of the prohibitive cost of anti-retroviral drugs and the
failing health care infrastructures of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the United Kingdom-based Panos Institute
at the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa
on Tuesday. Panos is a fraternity of non-profit organizations
disseminating information on HIV/AIDS with offices in 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with AIDS sufferers in developing countries,
thousands of people living with the disease in the industrialized
world lead full and healthy lives, because they had access to
medicine which suppressed the Human Immune Virus and cured
opportunistic infections, the institute said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Presently an estimated 35 million people worldwide -- the bulk
in poor nations - are suffering from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The report said the price of anti-retrovirals was not the only
factor preventing treatment for AIDS. The dearth of medical
workers and adequate facilities in poor nations often meant that
even if the medicine was available, the treatment would not be
followed through.
</P>
<P>
"For anti-retrovirals to be effective, those taking them must
have access to regular laboratory tests and skilled personnel able
to interpret those tests and to advise on appropriate treatment.
</P>
<P>
"But in most countries to implement such improvements would
cost as much as the drugs themselves," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the price of drugs had to be reduced by 95 percent or
more to be affordable to all those who need them.
</P>
<P>
"To buy anti-retroviral drugs at current prices for all those
who need them would cost 60 billion U.S. dollars a year -- less
than a quarter of the annual U.S. military budget.
</P>
<P>
"In the poorest countries annual health expenditure is
frequently under 20 dollars per person; in Western Europe and
North America, up to 1,500 dollars per person is spent," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dr. Wilbert Bannenberg, who sits on the Panos panel
as well as in the World Health Organization and advises the South
African Health Department, expressed dismay that Pretoria had
still not given medicine to prevent the spread of HIV from mother-
to-child.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity. Of the 1 million women pregnant annually in
South Africa, around 250,000 are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
"About 5,000 babies a month are born with HIV. It's a disaster,
" he said, adding that many people die from opportunistic, or AIDS-
related illnesses like tuberculosis or pneumonia because they do
not have access to drugs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christopher Ouma, a doctor working for Medicines Sans
Frontiers, said the problem of fighting AIDS in the developing
world, was exacerbated by the fact that governments were paying on
average 14 times more for external debts than they were spending
on their health systems.
</P>
<P>
Ouma said he had yet to see an anti-retroviral drug in his
hospital, and conceded that his country did not have the medical
infrastructure to manage an anti-retroviral program.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Ssanyu-Sseruma, a writer, originally from Uganda, now
living in the United Kingdom, said anti-retroviral drugs had saved
and extended her life when she started taking them several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"I am literally here to give a face to the disease," Sseruma
said.
</P>
<P>
Sseruma, who has been HIV positive for 12 years, said HIV/AIDS
never got the attention it needed in Africa, stressing it was time
that Africans took responsibility of the disease themselves, and
not rely solely on the west.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition Parties Form Alliance for General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's two main
opposition parties have agreed to forge an alliance to field joint
candidates in the forthcoming general elections to be held in
October this year, newspapers here reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
National Chairman Bob Makani of the Party for Democracy and
Progress and his Civic United Front (CUF) counterpart Ibrahim
Lipumba were quoted as saying here on Monday that their parties
would field joint candidates in the general and civic elections to
be held simultaneously with the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, named "alliance for liberation", is aimed at
defeating the ruling Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM) in the
polls, Makani said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two political parties have nominated
Maalim Seif Shariff Hamad from the CUF to vie for the presidency
of the semi-autonomous Zanzibar isles region, while Lipumba will
contest the presidency of the Tanzanian union government.
</P>
<P>
Doors are still open for other opposition parties who want to
join the alliance, Lipumba said, adding that the legal document
will be signed on the last day of this month.
</P>
<P>
Lipumba contested the union presidency in 1995 as the CUF
candidate and emerged third among the four candidates by winning 6.
4 percent of the total votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president, CCM's national chairman Benjamin Mkapa
won the ballot with over 61.8 percent of the total vote. Mkapa is
seeking for a second five-year term.

<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will help
improve the humanitarian situation of the displaced people across
the country, the country's minister of assistance and social
reintegration Albino Malungo said in northern Angola on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Angolan government has put aside
34 million U.S. dollars for transportation of food for the needy
population. Another amount estimated at 5 million dollars was
invested in the purchase of medicines and hospital utensils.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that although the number of displaced
persons in Angola is declining, there are still some 3.7 million
of them in the country, gathering in major cities such as Luanda,
Uige and Huambo.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Angolan province of Uige, Malungo will meet
with the provincial governor and the commander of the Angola's
north front to discuss issues on the humanitarian situation of the
displaced and how to encourage them to "work for food".
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficult living conditions, some international
humanitarian organizations, such as the "Doctors Without Border",
are operating in the war-torn Uige province bordering with the

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- About 200 people are reported to
have been burnt to death in an explosion at a petrol pipeline near
Warri in southern Nigeria, according to reports reaching on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened on Monday at Adeje village, near the
town of Warri in the oil-producing Delta State, when people were
using buckets to collect petrol flowing from the pipeline after it
had been punctured by thieves on Sunday night, a local firefighter
said.
</P>
<P>
The firefighter said that he had counted the charred remains of
140 people, but witnesses claimed that as many as 250 people may
have been burnt to death in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The explosion came after a series of fires caused by the
frequent vandalism of pipelines carrying fuel supplies from the
Delta region to northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Pipe vandalism, a very common activity by the armed young men
in the oil-producing areas of the country, usually resulted in
terrible fire.
</P>
<P>
An oil fire caused by the pipe explosion in the same area in
1998 killed up to 1,000 people.

In a message to mark the World Population Day, which falls on
Tuesday, Annan said, "the challenges ahead of us is clear: to find
ways to support all the world's people in peace and dignity, and
to ensure the people -- especially women -- are able to make
informed decisions about the size of their families."
</P>
<P>
"We can all recognize the anguish of the person who loses wife
or mother in childbirth, because of a lack of proper care," Annan
said. "Of teenager whose options in life are suddenly foreclosed
because she gets pregnant and drops out of school. Of the woman
who has to go on having children even though she knows her health
is at risk. Or the refugee who has been raped but is too
frightened, or too ashamed, to ask for help."
</P>
<P>
"Better understanding of women's issues has brought real
change in the daily life of millions of people," Annan said. "
Women now have wider choices, and can make key decisions about
their own lives. Yet there is still much left to do."
</P>
<P>
"Too many girls do not have the same chance of education as
boys. Too many women still cannot choose when or whether to become
pregnant. Too many women are victims of sexual violence,
especially during conflict," said Annan. "Too many women resort to
abortions that are not safe. Too many are subjected to genital
mutilation and other harmful traditional practices."
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go," Annan said. "But population
programs have made a difference. Without them, the world's
population would be much larger. Many societies would be less
developed economically and socially."
</P>
<P>
"And, most important, millions of families around the world be
less healthy, prosperous and hopeful than they are," he said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Population Day is "Saving Women'
s Lives."
</P>
<P>
With the world population reaching 5 billion on July 1, 1987,
the United Nations Population Fund decided to designate, starting
from 1988, July 11 as the World Population Day, to arouse deeper
concerns of the international community over the population issue.

<HEADLINE> (Updates with more details) Clinton leave for Camp David for Israeli-Palestinian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He hoped to push Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into a final agreement to settle
the 52-year-old conflict between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters before departure that the two leaders now
face "profound and wrenching questions" -- that can't be resolved
without compromise.
</P>
<P>
The road for peace, as always, is a two-way street," Clinton
said. "Both leaders feel the weight of history but both, I believe,
recognize this is a moment in history which they can seize. We
have an opportunity to bring about a just and enduring end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is the key to lasting peace in
the entire Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that both Barak and Arafat have demonstrated they
are determined to reaching an agreement. "in the process, they
have passed the point of no return. The only way forward now is
forward. Both sides must find a way to resolve competing claims,
to give their children the gift of peace."
</P>
<P>
"It will take patience, creativity and courage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'll do everything I can over the coming days to see that this
moment of promise is fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course there is no guarantee of success," he said. "But not
to try is to guarantee failure."
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted that his task to solve the conflict between
Israel and the Palestinians was very difficult. The difficult
issues he and his Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are going
to solve include the status of Jerusalem, the final border between
Israel and the Palestinians and the refugees, who fled the first
conflict between the Israelis and the Arabs in 1948, to come home.
</P>
<P>
Barak who survived a no-confidence vote in the Israeli
parliament on Monday, has signaled his willingness to expand
considerably the 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians,
and to expand Palestinian local control in areas of Jerusalem to
Arab-populated suburbs. But there is still a long way to reach the
demands of the Palestinians who claim that the whole West Bank,
captured by Israel during the 1967 Mideast war, be returned to
their hands and Jerusalem would be the capital of a future
Palestinian state. Arafat also said refugees should be returned
home, which Barak said would not be accepted.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Make Progress in Mad Cow Disease Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The team from the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in
Zurich discovered great similarities between the molecular
structure of healthy prion proteins in human beings and those in
cattle. The prion protein is involved in the development of both
Mad Cow Disease (BSE)in cattle and its human variant, Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
The research team, from the Institute for Molecular Biology and
Biophysics at the ETH, has published its findings in the latest
edition of the prestigious United States scientific journal "
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences".
</P>
<P>
In the journal, the ETH researchers, led by Professor Kurt
Wuthrich, describe for the first time the spatial structure of the
bovine prion protein in its normal healthy form. There are
differences in the distribution of the electronic surface charge,
but not in the spatial folding of the protein.
</P>
<P>
The almost identical nature of the molecular structure could
help identify how BSE is transferred to humans, according to the
research team. This could prove the link between the consumption
of certain meat products from cattle and the deadly CJD.
</P>
<P>
The only difference in the structure of bovine and human prion
proteins is in the distribution of the electrostatic surface
charge.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1999 about 50 people, mainly in Britain, died
from the so-called new variant of Creutzfeld-Jakob (nv CJD).
Scientists believe that eating cattle meat infected with BSE could
cause this disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the ETH researchers, their latest findings could
also lead to ways of preventing the transmission of prion-
dependent diseases between different animals.

<HEADLINE> Hazardous Waste From U.S. Up 138 Percent in Canada's Ontario </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada's most popular and important
province Ontario has become a dumping ground for U.S. polluters,
which were up 138 percent between 1994 and 1998, according to a
study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy said in
its latest study that Sarnia ranked first in receiving U.S. waste
with a growth rate of 220 percent over the four-year period.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton and Burlington were close behind, with respective rate
of 173 percent and 154 percent, illustrated the study, entitled
Open Toxics: A Study of Hazardous Waste Generation and Disposal in
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Ontario became a dumping ground for U.S. polluters in the early
to mid-1990s after the United States strengthened its environment
laws, said Anne Mitchell, executive director of the institute, at
the release of the study.
</P>
<P>
"This just shows that Ontario is open for business in toxic
waste," she said, urging the province to act to reverse the trend
in order to protect the health of Ontarians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hal Vincent, spokesman for provincial Environment
Minister Dan Newman, stressed the determination by the government
to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry already put in place an action plan in September
1999 to close a 14-year-old loophole in management, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The province is planning more action," Vincent said, adding "
some measures we're hoping to have ready to be announced within a
month."

<HEADLINE> Working Party on Macedonia's WTO Accession Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Working Party on Macedonia's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) met here Monday
for the first time to hear Macedonia introduce its trade regime.
</P>
<P>
The meeting went quickly, ending after the first morning
instead of running the full two scheduled days, according to trade
sources. This was partly because the former Yugoslav republic had
only provided broad information on some subjects such as customs
valuation and TRIPS, and partly because the Macedonian delegation'
s reply to comments tended to take note and return with replies
later.
</P>
<P>
Many delegations stressed the importance of Macedonia's
membership in the WTO as a contribution to regional peace and
prosperity. Several key members said they expect Macedonia to
conform with WTO agreements no later than the date of accession.
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns raised were: import licensing, investment
regime, customs valuation, TRIPS and questions about whether
reforms underway might reduce foreign investors' rights. The most
active members were the US, EU and Australia, with questions from
Slovenia on excise duties on tobacco, and from India on safeguards
on food products. Macedonia said it was taking members' comments
into account.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there seemed to be a feeling that the
accession could go quite fast, although much remains to be seen
when they get down to negotiating specific commitments and
schedules.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Price Fuels Inflation in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) - Rising petrol prices helped drive up
the UK's rate of inflation to its highest level for two years,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported Tuesday that
headline inflation in June rose from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent -
its highest since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The key underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments and is used by the Bank of England when setting
interest rates, was also up from 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise, the underlying rate remains well below the
Government's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has kept interest rates unchanged at 6 percent for the
past five months as signs have grown that the economy is slowing
down.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the main reason for the rise in inflation was a
steep increase in prices at the petrol pumps because of the higher
coast of crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Debt Relief, IT Access for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday called on the Group of Eight countries, the seven
Western industrialized nations plus Russia, to "give particular
attention" to debt relief for poor countries and help them gain
full access to the new information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
The debt relief and IT are the two main issues that Annan
dealt with in his report to the Millennium Assembly and the
Millennium Summit, which is slated to open in September.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the heads of state and government of the
Group of Eight (G-8), who are to convene a summit in Japan on July
21-23, Annan said that only few debtor countries have so far
qualified for relief although "donors have long since agreed in
principle that debt relief is essential."
</P>
<P>
"Yet only five debtor countries have qualified for relief to
date, and even those that have had, on average, only 35 percent of
their debts canceled," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile in Africa, the world's poorest region, 40 percent
of government revenues are now being allocated to servicing a
total debt of some 350 billion U.S. dollars -- to the detriment of
health, education and other essential social services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Annan called upon the G-8 leaders, "with a view to
urgent action," to consider that the donor countries and the
international financial institutions should cancel the official
debts of all the highly indebted poor countries, in return for
those countries making demonstrable commitments to poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
"Debts owed by countries that have suffered major conflicts or
natural disasters should be canceled," he said. "Debt repayment
should be pegged at a maximum percentage of foreign exchange
earnings."
</P>
<P>
"To help resolve some of the disputes that are currently
preventing progress, a debt arbitration process should be
instituted that would balance the interests of creditors and
sovereign debtors, introducing greater discipline into their
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan also asked the G-8 leaders to "give serious
attention" to the role of new information technology in promoting
equitable and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"While IT cannot by itself solve all the problems of
developing countries, its potential benefits -- in improving
healthcare and education, in making governance more transparent,
in supporting agriculture and trade -- are becoming more and more
obvious," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But access is crucial," he said. "Countries in which most
people do not have access to IT cannot play a full part in the new
global economy."
</P>
<P>
"The divide must be bridged if we are to realize the full
potential of IT," he said. "Only global leadership can do it --
and this can be provided only by your countries, the richest and
most powerful in the world."
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to commit yourselves to the goal of making IT
accessible to all the world's people, and to make a major
commitment of resources for that purpose," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Begins to Confiscate German Property for WW II Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday began to confiscate
the German Goethe Institute property in Athens in order to
compensate relatives of the massacred Distomo villagers whom
Germany refuses to pay.
</P>
<P>
Police arrived at the building at the request of the Goethe
Institute director and the court officials started recording the
institute's assets in the presence of police officers, according
the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA).
</P>
<P>
Greece's Supreme Court in mid-April upheld a previous decision
by a Livadia court awarding a sum of 9.5 billion drachmas (about
27 million U.S. dollars) to the Distomo victims' families.
</P>
<P>
According to the court's ruling, German state property could
be confiscated in order to pay reparations to the relatives of the
218 villagers of Distomo, near Delphi, massacred by German
occupation troops on June 10, 1944.
</P>
<P>
The three German cultural institutions, the Goethe Institute,
the German Archaeological Institute and the German School, could
be auctioned as early as September to raise the 9.5 billion
drachmas for the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that Greek courts do not have jurisdiction on
compensations, Germany says that the matter of compensations has
been settled in 1960, with the signing of a bilateral claims
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has said in recent days that the
confiscation of a foreign state property could not be done without
the permission of the country's minister of justice, but the
attorney representing the relatives of the victims said that no
previous approval by the minister of justice was necessary.

<HEADLINE> Shop Owner Testifies Lockerbie Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Maltese shop
owner on Tuesday testified at the Scottish court on Dutch soil
that the items found in a Lockerbie suitcase were sold by him to a
Libyan man.
</P>
<P>
The shop owner, Anthony Gauci, said that he had sold a blue
babygrow and an umbrella to the unidentified man weeks prior to
the December 1988 mid-air bombing of the Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
"It was slightly before the Christmas holiday," said the
Maltese shop owner, "I can't remember the exact date, maybe a
fortnight before Christmas."
</P>
<P>
The Scottish court resumed hearing from the prosecution after
being adjourned for 12 days upon request from the prosecution that
needed extra time to examine the statements they had taken from
defense witnesses listed just before the Lockerbie trial went
underway on May 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
Suspect Abdel Basset al-Megrahi is named in the indictment as
having bought "a quantity of clothing and an umbrella" on December
7, 1988, from Gauci's shop, known as Mary's House in Malta.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are aiming at proving that al-Megrahi and co-
accused Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima placed a bomb concealed within a
radio-cassette tape recorder inside a suitcase and loaded it onto
a plane in Malta. The suitcase was then transferred in Frankfurt
onto the New York-bound airliner.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese shop owner told the court that he sold a Libyan man
two pairs of winter trousers, two shirts, a tweed jacket, two
pairs of pajamas, a blue babygrow, two cardigans and an umbrella
with a curved handle.
</P>
<P>
"It was not important to him what he was buying," said Gauci,"
for when I asked if he wanted to try on the trousers, he said that
they were not for him."
</P>
<P>
Last month, forensic scientist Alan Feraday told the court that
his research had identified fragments of clothing similar to the
type sold in the Mary's House.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans are accused of placing the bomb in the Pan Am
Flight 103 and of conspiracy of murder, murder and breach of
international aircraft safety laws.
</P>
<P>
The December 21, 1988, mid-air bombing of the New York-bound
airliner killed 259 people on board and 11 others on the ground
when the plane crashed on the Scottish town.

<HEADLINE> Not to Boost Interest Rate: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The French finance minister on
Tuesday said at the European Parliament that he saw no reason for
raising the interest rate in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that we now have a stable euro at a higher
level," said Laurent Fabius who expected the single currency to
strengthen as the European Union's economy grows.
</P>
<P>
"I think the positive economic indications we have at the
moment show that there is room for appreciation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French finance minister said that the European Central Bank
did not have to raise the interest rates beyond the 4.25-percent
mark last raised in June in spite of fears for higher oil prices
and an inflation hike due to revived economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We need a strong euro that does not penalize growth and I do
not see any reason now to increase the rates," Fabius said at the
economic and monetary affairs committee of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The French minister took over as the EU finance minister on
July 1 when his country took over from Portugal the six-month
rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Fabius is scheduled to chair his first meeting next Monday with
his counterparts from other EU member states and the EU finance
minister council is expected to push for coordinated economic
policies, particularly policy coordination among the 11 nations
that have joined the single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"I want to create a common economic culture," said Fabius.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman said that EU finance ministers could cooperate
more on taxation and employment issues. Increased coordination
among the euro zone nations would not necessarily seek to isolate
those EU nations that still remain outside the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Greece has just been accepted into the single currency zone
starting next January.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Sweden and Denmark are still outside the euro zone.
Both Britain and Sweden have opted for an out while Denmark is
scheduled to hold a referendum on whether to join the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The euro has enjoyed a modest recovery after having fallen in
May to a record low at one euro trading at 88.45 United States
cents. It is still well below its launch value when it traded at
95.04 cents late Tuesday in Europe. The euro was inaugurated
trading at 1.18 U.S. dollars on January 1, 1999.

<P>
TOKYO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama Tuesday expressed his support for the Japanese
government's efforts to normalize ties with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Murayama conveyed his support during a meeting with Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori at Mori's official residence in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties between the two countries should be normalized
by the 2002 World Cup finals, which Japan and South Korea will co-
host, said Murayama, who is leading a group on normalizing
relations between Japan and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Murayama, a former leader of the opposition Social Democratic
Party (SDP) also stressed that Japan should be proactive on the
issue and should not be left behind after last month's historic
inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Mori said his government will exert its utmost efforts to
resume negotiations with the DPRK as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Japan and the DPRK met in April to resume
talks on normalization that collapsed in 1992. A second round of
talks scheduled in May was subsequently postponed.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak narrowly survived a no-
confidence vote Monday evening and immediately departed amid pomp
and ceremony for a critical Middle East peace summit convened by U.
S. President Clinton at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Thirty-five years after the dismantling of legalized
segregation, a majority of Americans maintain that race relations
in the United States are generally good, but blacks and whites
continue to have starkly divergent perceptions of many racial
issues and they remain largely isolated from each other in their
everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak face down an unruly
Parliament Monday night, surviving a vote of confidence just an
hour before leaving for what he hopes will be historic peace talks
with the Palestinians in Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Deutsche Telekom is in serious talks to buy VoiceStream, a
wireless company that operates licenses throughout the U.S., in a
deal that could be valued at more than 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S. jury was asked to return as much as 196 billion U.S.
dollars in punitive damages against the nation's cigarette makers
in Florida's class-action smoker lawsuit. A lawyer said the
tobacco industry left a "half-century trail of deceit."

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left the White House by helicopter around 10:45 a.m. (1445 GMT) on
Tuesday for Camp David in the U.S. State of Maryland to launch
what is called "a difficult task" for peace between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has expressed the hope to push Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into a final
agreement to settle the 52-year-old conflict between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters before the departure that the two leaders now
face "profound and wrenching questions" -- that can't be resolved
without compromise.
</P>
<P>
"The road for peace, as always, is a two-way street," Clinton
said, "Both leaders feel the weight of history but both, I believe,
recognize this is a moment in history which they can seize. We
have an opportunity to bring about a just and enduring end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is the key to lasting peace in
the entire Middle East."

forward. Both sides must find a way to resolve competing claims,
to give their children the gift of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will take patience, creativity and courage," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I'll do everything I can over the coming days to see that this
moment of promise is fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there is no guarantee of success," he said, "But
not to try is to guarantee failure."

<HEADLINE> Ang Lee's Chinese-Language Movie Beijing Premiere Postponed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reserved, thoughtful, and ever-charming director said he
brought together into his cast and crew actors and actresses from
the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong regions and the U.S., using
them to re-create the China of his imagination.
</P>
<P>
"I was born and grew up in Taiwan. I only knew about China from
books and what was in my imagination until I came here to shoot
the movie," said Lee, who has just finished promoting the film in
Taipei and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With extraordinary photography featuring landscapes as diverse
as the Gobi Desert, the green bamboo forest in south China and the
summer residence of Qing emperors in north China's city of
Chengde, the dramatic movie tells the story of two pairs of ill-
fated lovers.
</P>
<P>
The main characters are warrior Li Mu Bai, played by Hong Kong
action star Chow Yun-fat, known internationally for his role in "
Anna and the King" opposite Jodie Foster, and a female warrior,
played by Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh. Stunning newcomer Zhang
Zi Yi stars as the beautiful daughter of a governor, and Taiwan
film star Zhang Zhen as her errant, desert-dwelling bandit
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he used martial arts in the film as a metaphor
for the conflicted inner world of the characters.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the characters use martial arts to vent their
repressed feelings of resistance against the fall of the empire of
the late Qing Dynasty, when China was forced by the western powers
to open for opium trade.
</P>
<P>
"The chivalrous characters are struggling between sense and
sensibility," said the director.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Chinese filmmakers who want to promote
Chinese movies overseas should use sophisticated cinematography to
interpret films with authentic Chinese flavor. He also encouraged
Chinese screenwriters to write scripts in English so that they can
get a foothold in western film markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese movies, with their rich plots and passion,
can easily gain an edge in the world's film industry.
</P>
<P>
The director, based in Taiwan, has gained world fame for his
exquisite cinematic interpretations of stories set in foreign
cultures.

<HEADLINE> North China Museum Sues for Damaged Relic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Municipal
Intermediate Court in this capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province held a hearing today for a case involving 27 million yuan
(3.2 million US dollars) in compensation for a heavily damaged
cultural relic.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Imperial Palace Museum sued the Fumanlou Catering
Co. for ruining a stone tablet in front of the Imperial Palace of
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in Shenyang, and asked for the high
amount.
</P>
<P>
The relic was broken into five pieces when an employee of the
catering company drove his speeding car into it in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Archeological experts said the relic cannot be repaired.
</P>
<P>
The stele, placed as a notice to officers to dismount from
their horses in front of the residence of the imperial family, has
been considered of high archeological value. Words inscribed on
the stele are written in five languages including Mandarin, Manchu,
Mongolian, Hui nationality language and Tibetan. There are only
two such stone tablets in China.
</P>
<P>
The imperial palace in Shenyang is the best preserved example
of palace architecture in China after Beijing's Forbidden City. In
order to protect the relic, the municipal government had renovated
the street in front of the palace into a pedestrian thoroughfare
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The driver, surnamed Lu, illegally drove his white Mercedes
Benz into the street, and was critically injured when the car
crashed into the stone tablet. He died in hospital two days after
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The museum claimed in court that Lu and his employer should be
held responsible for the accident.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people were in the courtroom today for the
hearing. An official with the municipal culture department said
that no matter what the verdict is, the case has increased people'
s awareness of the need for relics protection.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong -- Potential E-Finance Test-bed for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- E-finance is turning colorful in
Hong Kong, with incumbents getting religion and rolling out ever
niftier business-to-customers products, and online upstarts rising
across the value chain, analysts here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers on e-finance believed that this momentum is
underpinned by well-developed telecom and Internet, regulatory,
legal and venture capital infrastructure, very high Internet and
mobile phone penetration, and Hong Kong's trademark
entrepreneurial culture.
</P>
<P>
"While Hong Kong will likely remain a relatively small
financial services market, we see it as a potential e-finance test-
bed for China and the rest of Asia," said Roy Ramos, a senior
analyst from the global equity research center of Goldman Sachs,
one of the world's leading investment banking and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that from an e-finance laggard a year ago or
so behind Singapore, Hong Kong banks have turned into true e-
converts, with ever-niftier business-to-commerce rollouts, plus
interbank consortiums and alliance with other sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), at least 14
banks in Hong Kong offer some form of online or mobile banking
services and more banks, including the three clearing banks, HSBC,
the Bank of China Group and Standard Charttered, are scheduled to
roll out a full array of online banking and financial services by
yearend.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, online upstarts are springing up across the
value chain, such as virtual banks, online foreign bank and non-
bank lenders, online stockbrokers, financial portals, aggregators,
systems providers, e-payments enablers, online financial
marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
"They are altering the financial landscape," stressed Wanna
Matanachai, also senior Goldman Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
Some e-finance trends that have taken root in the United States
and Europe are starting to emerge in Hong Kong online stock
broking, virtual banking, online loan broking, aggregation,
reverse auctions, open finance and outsourcing, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
As the HKMA Deputy Chief Executive David Carse noted in a
recent presentation focusing on impact and implications of
Internet banking, Hong Kong's penetration rates for electronic
delivery channels are among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that of the total households in Hong Kong,
over 50 percent have PCs, and 80 percent have access to broadband.
And over 55 percent of the population use mobile phones and 30
percent are Internet users.
</P>
<P>
"Internet banking will succeed in Hong Kong because there is
the supply, demand and the infrastructure, in addition to the
strong venture capital support and legal framework and government
support in place," Carse explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Joe Lee, Goldman Sachs' infrastructure analyst,
Hong Kong has one of the best and most competitive telecom
infrastructures in Asia. It has a fully digital telecom network in
place with broadband networks reaching almost all office buildings
and 85 percent of residential buildings.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Tele-Education Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The 7th annual conference of the
International Education and Resource Network (IEARN) opened today
in Beijing, drawing more than 400 education experts, teachers and
students from 60 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day conference will exhibit the world's most
successful tele-education models and promote education through the
Internet, especially in China.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly sponsored by IEARN and the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC)
, is the first annual meeting of IEARN in Asia. The meeting is
expected to strengthen exchanges and cooperation on network
education between China, Asia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaolin, vice-president of CPAFFC, said at today's opening
ceremony that 10 years ago people couldn't imagine collecting E-
mail on a mobile phone or buying CDs on a personal computers, and
no one thought teachers would ever correct students' homework and
give lessons through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The development of information technology will help education
to bloom in the 21st century, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Mao said the Chinese capital, which is
home to the most colleges and scientific research institutes in
the country, will give priority to developing science and
education in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city has more than two million Internet users,
and quite a number of them are students. Therefore, Beijing
supports the application and popularization of tele-education,
added Zhang.
</P>
<P>
IEARN is a non-profit educational telecommunications network,
which has facilitated educational and development projects since
1988, pioneering an interactive approach to using the World Wide
Web by encouraging students to actively contribute to, rather than
just passively "surf" the Internet. IEARN currently operates in
over 90 countries with thousands of schools and youth
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The conference will contribute 30 computers to under-developed
regions of China, and the computers will be linked to IEARN.

<HEADLINE> Ang Lee's Chinese-Language Movie Beijing Premiere Postponed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The eagerly-anticipated Beijing
premiere of Ang Lee's Chinese-language movie "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon," originally slated for July 17, has been postponed,
the co-producer of the movie announced here.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Quangang, president of China Film Co-operation Production
Co., explained at a press conference that Lee's new martial arts-
epic romance will not debut this week, as cinemas in the Chinese
capital are showing a number of Hollywood hits such as "Shanghai
Noon" and "Dinosaur."
</P>
<P>
"Producers have decided to postpone the premiere of the movie
in Beijing," he said, without providing the rescheduled date.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-born director Ang Lee, in Beijing to promote his first
Chinese-language movie set in the mainland, agreed with some film
critics' assessment that his film can be regarded as the Chinese
equivalent of his 1995 Oscar-nominated film "Sense and Sensibility.
"
</P>
<P>
His adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel garnered seven
Academy Award nominations, receiving the statue for best adapted
screenplay, and secured Lee's position as an A-list director in
the western film industry.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he had both Chinese and overseas audiences in
mind when shooting "Crouching Tiger," which is packed with
Hollywood-style action, adventure and romance as well as
traditional Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
The movie version of an epic love story set in China's Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911) was hailed by critics at the Cannes Film
Festival at its press screening in May.
</P>
<P>
In the 17 million-US dollar movie, Lee combines western
cinematographic techniques with Hong Kong-style martial arts
choreography, complete with fly-wires to carry lead characters up
and down walls, across roofs and through tree-tops in gravity-
defying battles.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 2.5 Tons of Opium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces seized some
2.5 tons of opium on Monday in the Mirjaveh region of the
southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan Province, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Provincial security forces commander Brigadier General Nasser
Shabani said the forces seized three pistols and a vehicle in the
gunbattle with drug traffickers, but the five traffickers managed
to flee to neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has called for the extradition of the traffickers
by Islamabad, based on a protocol signed with Pakistan on
cooperation in drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
He added that in an operation on Sunday, the provincial security
forces seized some 500 kilograms of heroin and 230 kilograms of
opium in the Khash region. Three armed drug traffickers were
arrested in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become very common in Iran as the country sits
on a major route for smuggling narcotics from the eastern neighbors
of Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Gulf,
Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Iran started a strict anti-drug campaign in 1989 after the
Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the campaign, some 3,000 personnel of Iran's
security forces have been killed in fighting against drug
traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Buy 16 Used F-16 Fighter Jets From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday approved
the air force's plan to buy 16 used F-16 fighter jets for 5.31
billion baht (136 million U.S. dollars), a Government House press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the approval was based on the
consideration of "national security" and under the principle that
the used aircraft can be used for no less than 4,000 flying hours
or 20 years and will not require any additional budget allocation
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The purchase is part of Thai air force's plans to deploy five
air wings of fighter jets. The air force was allowed to finance
the purchase with the refund of deposits on F-18 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Due to the economic crisis happened in the mid-1997, the Thai
military canceled the purchase of the new F-18 jets from the
United States but reserved the right to spend the money on F-16s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military essentially agreed to refund the deposits on
the F-18s. The purchase of used F-16 fighters would be done
through the United States' foreign military sales program,
bypassing aircraft agents.
</P>
<P>
The refund deposits are supposed to purchase not only the jet
fighters but also weapon system as well as spare parts and
components.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Fail to Make Breakthrough in Talks on NTT Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States Tuesday
failed to reach an agreement on a reduction of interconnection
charges by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) after
Washington rejected a compromise proposal by Tokyo to shorten the
period required to achieve a 22.5 percent reduction target.
</P>
<P>
After suspending working-level talks on the trade dispute
Tuesday evening, the two sides agreed to meet again Wednesday,
Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan appears to have presented a plan to shorten the period
required to achieve the 22.5 percent reduction from the earlier
proposed four years, but the U.S. rejected the offer, the Kyodo
News Service quoted sources close to the talks as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials attending the talks contended that Japan's
previous refusal to shorten the reduction period is no longer
valid, given that the NTT's financial results for fiscal 1999,
which ended March 2000, showed stronger earnings than expected.
It means that there is room for the NTT to effect a reduction more
swiftly than anticipated, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said that the U.S. apparently did not budge
from its previous demand in late March that the NTT reduce the
interconnection fees it charges to other carriers by 22.5 percent
in two years and then swiftly reduce them further by a total of 41.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NTT dispute is a thorny issue which the United States and
Japan are making last-ditch efforts to solve before the Group of
Eight (G-8) summit in July 21-23 in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The working-level talks resumed Monday to try to settle the
biggest bilateral trade row before the upcoming G-8 summit.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian police killed another bear
late Monday on Highway 417 near Ottawa to take a driver out of
danger.
</P>
<P>
Police said a young black bear ran out of the woods to collide
with a Dodge Charger at about 0730 p.m. local time, just five
kilometers outside the suburban high-tech city Kanata.

Police shot to death the injured bear of the size of a large
Saint-Bernard dog. The driver was not injured in the accident.

This is a second bear to be killed within a week to ensure

<HEADLINE> Majlis Speaker Rejects U.S.-Style Reforms in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Mehdi Karrubi on Tuesday rejected U.S.-style reforms, but vowed to
push forward reforms "in line with Islamic revolution and Islamic
values."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an open session of the Majlis, Karrubi voiced
support for a recent call by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei to make a distinction between the genuine reforms
sanctioned by the Islamic revolution and those advocated or
supported by Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei told high-ranking officials on Sunday that reforms and
efforts to reform are inherent elements of the Islamic revolution,
but he questioned the true motive of Washington and London in
calling for reforms in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, responsible for bringing despotic and
tyrannical rule to Iran for more than 50 years, have no genuine
reason for being sympathetic to the Iranian nation today, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei asked the government of President Mohammad Khatami and
the nation as a whole to agree on a definition of reforms and their
goals.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khamenei's speech, Karrubi said that reforms would be
acceptable only within the framework of the country's constitution
and should be geared toward progress and not retrogression of the
country, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the radical-turned reformist Majlis speaker assured that
Iran's policy of detente continues to be supported by the leader,
despite of continuing problems and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
He said the reformist-dominated Majlis puts its support behind
the detente policy and reform programs of Khatami's government.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "freedom of thought" should be within the
framework of the constitution which allows criticism and will stand
firm against untimely destructive designs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams Turkey for Arresting Iranian Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday castigated Turkish police for rounding
up more than 200 Iranian nationals living in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that Iran wants its nationals to be respected abroad
and any inappropriate behavior towards them by foreign states under
the pretext of disobeying law is not acceptable, the official IRNA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police raided houses of Iranian nationals Monday night,
arresting more than 200, a source at the Iranian consulate in
Istanbul was quoted by IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The police have not given valid reasons for the arrests made
under various pretexts and unfounded charges," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the Iranian Foreign Ministry is seriously
following up the case and expects turkey to show a sense of duty
and release all detainees. He also warned that Turkey bears
responsibility for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial figures, over 50,000 Iranian nationals
are currently residing in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iran lodged its protest in May by summoning the Turkish
ambassador Turan Moraly after Turkish police arrested over 300
Iranian citizens in Istanbul amid an intensified crackdown on
Islamic activists.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest of nine Islamic activists in Turkey, the
Turkish press accused Iran of being involved in bomb explosions
that killed two Turkish journalists in 1993 and 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iran Voices Opposition to Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday voiced opposition to
the coming summit at Camp David between leaders of the
Palestinians, Israel and the United Sates to remove the obstacles
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, the negotiations have just imposed
Israeli demands on the Palestinian side and Iran opposes such a
summit which is not in the interest of Palestine," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that such a summit would only worsen the crisis in the
region, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak have arrived in the U.S. to join President Bill Clinton for a
three-way summit aimed at solving the thorny final-status issues
between Israel and the Palestinians in a bid to reach a peace
agreement by September.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for the summit, Barak underlined five "red
lines" which he vowed not to compromise in the summit.
</P>
<P>
They include no return to the 1967 lines, no foreign troops west
of the Jordan Valley, a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty,
a majority of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
be kept under Israeli control, and no recognition of any
responsibility for creating the problem of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said he will only sign an agreement that will strengthen
Israel's security and that he will submit the peace deal to the
Israeli people for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Barak's statement, the Iranian spokesman said
Jerusalem belongs to all Muslims and the Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
Asefi condemned any reconciliation which may jeopardize
Palestinian sovereignty and reiterated Tehran's support for the
liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"From Iran's point of view, full restoration of the Palestinian
rights is the only way to bring stability to the region and put an
end to the current crisis," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which refuses to recognize the Jewish state, opposes peace
talks with Israel and calls for armed struggle against Israeli
occupation of Arab lands.

help Lebanon rebuild power stations knocked out of action by
Israeli warplanes.
</P>

CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's daily oil output declined in June to 716,667
barrels from 724,516 barrels in May, according to the Egyptian
Petroleum Authority (EPA).
</P>
<P>
EPA said daily natural gas sales surged in June to 54.04 million
cubic meters out of the total daily production of 67.4 million
cubic meters compared to the daily sales of 52.08 million cubic
meters out of the daily production of 65.04 million cubic meters in
May.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas sales are slightly less than the produced amount
because the companies involved keep some for its utility operation.
</P>
<P>
Distilled oil production hit 58,667 barrels per day in June,
down from 60,645 barrels per day in May whereas liquefied gas
production was 32,333 barrels in June as against 32,903 barrels in
May on daily basis.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said it
would offer its Palestinian Corporation for Commercial Service
(PCCS) for sale.
</P>
<P>
PCCS' General manager Mohammad al-Rashid said the PNA would keep
a quota of the firm under the Palestinian Investment Fund while the
remaining portion would be privatized.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat issued a decree early this year
involving the establishment of the Higher Council for Development
and the Palestinian Investment Fund that will be responsible for
managing the the PNA's funds.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Central Bank on Monday dismissed media
report of a police raid on its two representations in Germany over
suspected tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The report, which appeared in a Turkish-language daily in
Germany and mass-circulation magazine Der Spiegel, suggested that
more than 100,000 Turks holding accounts with the Central Bank
offices in Frankfurt and Berlin earn a 13-percent interest without
paying tax.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank described the allegation of police raid as
untrue, but admitted that inspectors from the Frankfurt revenue
service visited the Frankfurt office on June 27 and asked about the
contents of a denunciatory letter from a Turkish citizen.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- At 220.5 billion U.S. dollars, Turkey came on the 22nd
place among 174 countries and regions in the world in terms of the
gross national product (GNP) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Human Development Report 2000 issued by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United States came
on top with its GNP of 7.9 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the only country in the Middle East to be listed among
the top 25 in terms of the GNP.

Singapore-Malaysia relations have seen ups and downs and
continue to be fraught with problems in recent years due to
disputes over the relocation of the Malaysian Customs, Immigration
and Quarantine in Singapore, the agreement on developing railway
land in Singapore, the water supply agreement between the two
countries, the plan to build a bridge across Johore Straits to
replace the existing causeway linking the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Launches Project to Protect Sundarbans Mangrove Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to protect the bio-
diversity in the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest of the
world located in the southwestern coast of the country, the
Bangladeshi government has undertaken an ambitious project with an
estimated cost of 4 billion taka (77 million U.S. dollars),
Environment and Forest Ministry sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Work on the six-year project, "Bio-diversity Conservation in
the Sundarbans Reserved Forest", is likely to begin this month,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide 60 percent of the
estimated project cost while the rest will come from the
Netherlands, Global Environment Fund and Bangladesh's own
resources.
</P>
<P>
The project is split into four components, namely introduction
of effective management system, bio-diversity conservation and
sustainable property management, socio-economic development of the
people dependent on the Sundarbans and their participation in
property management and flourishment of eco-friendly tourism.
</P>
<P>
A project implementation unit, headed by a deputy forest
conservator, will also be formed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, six committees -- Sundarbans Management Committee,
Sundarbans Stewardship Commission, Stakeholders Advisory Council,
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee and Certification and
Investigation Committee -- will be constituted to successfully
implement the project, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Environment and Forest Ministry approved a
proposal to set up a gene bank in the Sundarbans to preserve the
plants species in the mangrove forest with the financial help of
the World Bank.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has joined other Sub-
Saharan countries demanding for the total cancellation of external
debts for the region, Vice Chairman of Uganda Debt Network Jossy
Bibagambah said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Activities are being organized from July 9 to 15 to mobilize
civil societies to ask donors to honor their commitments of
providing comprehensive debt relief, Bibagambah told Xinhua in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The activities launched throughout the country are targeting
the G8 summit to be held in Okinawa, Japan from July 22 to 23,
said the vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 40 developing countries, 34 are from Sub-Saharan
Africa, he said, adding that Uganda alone owes the donor countries
3.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Africa as a continent is very concerned, because almost 50
percent of the population in the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
is living below the poverty line, Bibagambah said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we are seeking total cancellation of all debts owed
by African countries, so that we can use these money to increase
investments and improve standards of living of our people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan summit is to be attended by the biggest lending
countries, and Japan itself is owed about 10.5 billion U.S.
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign ministers
on Tuesday expressed their hope that the newly-elected Zimbabwean
government is committed to steering the country to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers agreed at their two-day general
affairs council meeting that the heavy presence of international
observers had contributed to the Zimbabwean general election held
on June 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed a report handed in by the EU observer team and
noted that though the election campaign was marked by violence,
large-scale intimidation and procedural irregularities, the voting
was generally calm and that all the Zimbabwean political forces
have generally accepted the voting results.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign minister council urged the Zimbabwean government
to tackle the country's economic and social problems as a matter
of resolute priority and in a spirit of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The council also hoped that the Zimbabwean authorities are
committed to restoring the confidence of international financial
backers by demonstrating their ability to lead their country onto
the path of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The EU has dispatched 109 observers to monitor the elections
held after four months of holdings of white-owned farms by
veterans from the liberation war that led to the Zimbabwean
independence from Rhodesia in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5 million people were eligible for casting their
ballots in the elections for the 120 parliamentary seats and the
turnout was reported to be the highest since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has provided the southern African country
with 1.83 million euro (1.75 million U.S. dollars) for the
preparation and process of the two-day elections.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers called on the Zimbabwean government to
work toward a rapid, fair and just solution to the recurrent
problem of land reform in the country.

IT companies that sell self-developed products to tax-payers in
general will be levied up to 17 percent in value added tax, while
newly-launched software firms will be income tax-free for the
first two years they record profits; for the following three years,
their income tax will be cut by half.
</P>
<P>
Investors of more than eight billion yuan can also enjoy
favorable tax policies, according to the new regulations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Urged to Work For Better Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call was made by Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao in a
message of congratulation to the First Plenum of the Ninth
National Committee of the All-China Youth Federation (ACYF) and
the 23rd National Congress of the All-China Students' Federation (
ACSF), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
said peace and development are the main themes of the times.
</P>
<P>
The emerging trend of political polarization and economic
globalization will have a profound impact on the political,
economic, cultural life of mankind, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
And the rapid progress of high technology and its
commercialization, as seen in information and biological
technology, will open doors for the development of productive
forces and social progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
All of these changes have created both historic opportunities
and challenges for China's development in the new century, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Only when China constantly improves its economic, scientific
and technological, and national defense strength and national
unity can she gain a firmer foothold in the intense international
competition and develops into a rich and powerful, democratic and
civilized country, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged Chinese youth to be the generation responsible for
invigorating China, and to study hard so they will be well-
acquainted with the achievements of all advanced civilizations.
</P>
<P>
He said young people in China should stretch their creativity
as innovation is one of the deciding factors determining a country
's success, he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 4, 1949, the ACYF safeguards the legitimate
rights of Chinese young people and organizes social activities for
youth, including volunteer programs for assistance to the poor,
and selecting outstanding youth and young scientists of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Establishment of More High-Tech Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The process of converting more
State-run scientific research institutes into businesses needs to
be speeded up, and the establishment of more high-tech ventures by
scientists must be encouraged said Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the
remarks here Monday at a national conference on reform of
scientific research organs attached to the State Council
ministries.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing said the converting of research organs into ventures
can help realize industrialization of scientific discoveries and
develop a number of high-tech businesses using China's own
advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of the State-run research institutes have been
launching similar research programs and the institutes employ too
many personnel who are not qualified to do the research.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of reform of the income
distribution system of the research institutes.
</P>
<P>
He believed that most of the scientists will have more
opportunities to make technological inventions as a result of the
reform.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Ministry of Science and
Technology, a total of 134 research institutions attached to the
Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Communications and nine
other ministries and State Council departments will be turned into
businesses by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 242 large state-run research institutions have been
changed into ventures and a number of them have received more
research funding either from local governments or by listing on
the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Acquits Main Suspects in Student Dorm Case 1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A military court Tuesday acquitted
former Tehran police chief and 17 other fellow police officers who
had stood trial for forcibly entering a Tehran University dormitory
and beating students on July 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict issued by Branch Seven of the Tehran
Military Court, of the total 20 suspects tried, only two were
sentenced to prison terms, while Brigadier General Farhad Nazari,
the main defendant, and 17 others were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Farhad Arjomandi was sentenced to two years in jail for breach
of order, while Oroujali Babrzadeh was sentenced to 91 days in jail
plus a fine of 1 million rials (about 120 U.S. dollars) for
stealing an electric razor from the dorm, the Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted the verdict as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the suspects ended in May after 15 sessions. But
all the defendants rejected the allegation that they are
responsible for the dormitory incident, insisting they had acted on
orders of superiors and in accordance with their legal duties.
</P>
<P>
They blamed their charges on rumors and accusations and
expressed hope that they will be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The July 1999 police raid on the dorm, meant to disperse
students protesting against press restrictions, sparked six days of
nationwide riots, the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution. At least one student died and many others were injured
in the riots.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict, some 34 students will receive
compensations from the public properties department.
</P>
<P>
However, the verdict is expected to invite criticism and
protests from reformers and students, who believe the trial process
was just symbolic and those who were really responsible for the
incident are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Tehran University students held a peaceful rally
to mark the first anniversary of the dorm incident. They pledged to
commemorate the event in peaceful means and avoid violence, in case
the conservative authorities took the chance to undermine the
country's reformist campaign.
</P>
<P>
But violence did occur near the Enqelab square in Tehran due to
clashes between a group of reform supporters and a group of
conservative radicals. At least 10 people were injured in the
clashes, and some were arrested by the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The Office to Foster Unity, the leading student organization,
has denied any involvement of students in Saturday's clashes,
maintaining those who were involved in the protests and
demonstrations acted independently and had no connection with the
student movement.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Southern States Leaders Meet Against Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from Nigeria's Christian
dominated southern states have threatened to boycott the continued
allocation of the crude oil revenue to the northern states, which
have adopted the Islamic law of Sharia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, including some governors, state parliament
speakers also called upon the inspector-general of the country's
police to sack any police officer who enforces the Sharia,
Nigerian press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at Monday's meeting, the southern states
leaders endorsed an earlier call on the National Youth Service
Corps not to post college graduates from the south to the northern
states to "protect their rights as Nigerian citizens".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's northern state of Katsina last week announced plans
to introduce the Sharia on August 1, swelling the ranks of Sharia
states.
</P>
<P>
Zamfara became the first Sharia state this January, followed by
Niger, Sokoto and Kano states in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
While Muslims in the north described the law as a must and new
way of life, Christians in the south objected the move, saying the
country's secularism, prescribed by the constitution, made the
introduction of a religious law as a state law illegally.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to introduce the law in Kaduna early this year led
to violent clashes between Christians and Muslims in the state and
throughout the country, killing more than 1,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Business Climate Index Rises to New High (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBS said that the after-tax profits index has emerged from its
slump of the past few years and entered a more promising zone. The
index rose by 11.3 points over the first quarter and 19.3 points
over one year ago to 102 points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The corporate sector saw reduced stockpiles, more orders and
sales and much greater demand for labor from April to June,
according to NBS.
</P>
<P>
NBS predicts that the performance of the corporate sector will
continue to improve in the third quarter, with the business
climate index growing to 123 points. It predicts that the indices
of all industries except the service industry will continue to
improve in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
However, growing costs and inadequate current funds are
concerns of the corporate sector, NBS said. The cost index dived
to its lowest level of 85 points in the second quarter, while the
index of current funds languished at a low of 65 points.
</P>
<P>
NBS said that the strong bounceback of major indices of
corporate performance and the sudden surge of entrepreneur
confidence over the past two quarters are positive signs that
China's economy has come back to life.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that the economy will grow faster this year than
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS, the surge of the business climate index was
mainly due to government investment and growing exports. The surge
is unstable because of inadequate domestic demands, weak micro-
economic mechanism and imbalance between demand and supply.

<HEADLINE> Sina.com Chairman Sees Great Potential in China's Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China will play a leading role
in the development of Internet industry, said Daniel Chiang,
chairman of Sina.com, here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China, with its huge market, will attract lots of talents and
capital like a huge magnet, Chiang said at a luncheon panel
discussion sponsored by the Asia Society Hong Kong Center.
</P>
<P>
Chiang also pointed out that portals must provide viable
channels and own a solid business model to survive in the tough
competition in Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the gap between the leading Internet
companies and the fledgling ones will be widened and the latter
will gradually be squeezed out of the market.
</P>
<P>
"The first is the winner in cyberspace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiang told the press that Sina.com, created in March 1999, is
still at a loss, but is expected to break even in the next one or
two years.
</P>
<P>
Sina.com, listed on the Nasdaq stock market on April 13 this
year, does not rule out the possibility of being listed on other
markets in the future, according to Chiang.
</P>
<P>
Chiang admitted that the timing of Sina's listing on Nasdaq may
be the worst in the past 10 to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
"But we do not rule out the possibility of a second or third
public offering when the public market bounces back," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that advertisement is the main source of Sina's revenue,
like the case at many other portals.
</P>
<P>
"Though electronic commerce begins to grow, our edge is the
huge information base," he said.

LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment Minister Ben
Mwila has lost his ministerial portfolio after he was expelled
from the country's ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
last Friday, according to chief government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Newstead Zimba, who is also information minister, was quoted by
Tuesday's Zambia Daily Mail as saying that Mwila could not
represent government any more because he is no longer a member of
parliament after his expulsion.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian constitution only allows parliament members to hold
ministerial portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Mwila was suspended last month by MMD National Secretary
Michael Sata, who charged that in the past 18 months, Mwila has
been involved in anti-party activities that has greatly
destabilized the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency on 26 of

<HEADLINE> 9,100 Angolan Women Die Annually due to Pregnancy or Childbirth Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 9,100 women die annually in
Angola due to pregnancy or childbirth problems, the office in
Luanda of the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNPF representative to Angola Rosemary Barber-
Madden, who made the announcement on the occasion of the world's
population day which falls on Tuesday, one woman dies every hour
in Angola, which ranks Angola among the countries with the highest
maternal mortality rate in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In several occasions, women's death occurred due to the lack of
ready communication means and transportation to take them to
hospital for assistance, said Barber-Madden, urging the health
system, the local governments and communities to help solve the
problem through all-out mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the children death rate in Angola is also high
because whenever a woman is at childbirth there are two lives at
risk, the mother and the baby. According to statistics, out of
every 1,000 delivered babies, 395 die because of malnutrition,
poverty or family's disability to support them.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Controls Most of Diamond-Rich Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) have
managed to reverse the military situation in the northeastern
diamond-rich provinces of Lunda-Sul and Lunda-Norte over the last
few months, controlling 11 of the 13 districts in the region, an
official source of the Angolan military said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The information was released by the commander of the eastern
military front Gen. Sa Miranda, who said that after the FAA's
operation in the region, the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi had
abandoned several areas of prospection.
</P>
<P>
The illegal prospection and sale of diamonds in the Angolan
northeastern provinces, mainly Lunda-Sul and Lunda-Norte,
constitute the economic pillar for the Angolan rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) during
the past 26 years of civil conflicts in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
"In other areas they (the rebels) are restricted to manual
extraction of diamonds, as they no longer manage to get fuels for
their machinery that extract diamonds in industrial scale", said
Miranda.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the rebels' main threat currently lies with
their guerrilla actions against the civilian populations, which
brings the number of displaced persons to higher figures in the
northeast part of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to data issued by the Ministry of Assistance and
Social Reintegration, there are 133,000 displaced people in the
Lunda-Sul Province, among them 115,000 staying in the city of
Saurimo.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled Cashmere Seized in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Custom officials in this capital
city of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
recently seized 170 kg of cashmere smuggled from Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the move is to cut off the inflow of animal by-
products from the areas plagued by the hoof-and-mouth disease in
neighboring Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Cashmere has been China's traditional import, which is sold at
a price of ranging from 200 yuan to 400 yuan per kg. To prevent
the epidemic disease spreading to China, China's State
Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection issued a circular,
banning the inflow of livestock products from Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
However, smugglers continued to ship cashmere into Altay, in
northern Xinjiang, by breaking big-batch imports into smaller
parts. The custom officials uncovered three smuggled cases and
confiscated 100,000-yuan worth of cashmere in May and June.
</P>
<P>
The hoof-and-mouth disease, a deadly disease affecting the
livestock, has spread around in a southeastern province in
Mongolia since early May. About 17,700 animals, mostly cattle,
were found infected with the disease, which is highly contagious
and fatal to cloven-hoofed animals such as cows and pigs but
cannot be transmitted to humans.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S., Britain for Blocking Oil Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Only 21 percent of the oil
contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries during the past four
phases of the United Nations oil-for-food program were approved,
due to obstacles placed by the United States and Britain, a senior
Iraqi official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said
that during the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh phases of the U.N.
oil-for-food deal, Iraq signed oil contracts worth 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars with foreign countries, but only 300 million dollars worth
of contracts were approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The minister held the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee "fully responsible" for obstructing approval of
the contracts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed a total of 1,989 contracts Iraq signed with
foreign countries during the past seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-
food program were put on hold, and among them nearly half are oil
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has frequently accused the U.S. and British members at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking vital imports to impede
the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was launched in late 1996, the U.S. and
Britain have blocked contracts worth over 3 billion dollars for
Iraq to buy daily necessities, oil equipment and spare parts,
according to U.N. statistics released in last April.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord allows Baghdad
to export crude in return for U.N.-supervised imports of food,
medicine and humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says the decade-old sanctions have claimed lives of over 1.
3 million people, causing a humanitarian crisis in the country.

Analysts said the visit was made amid Russia's recent efforts to
reassert itself in the newly independent countries in Central Asia
and Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Turkey have been historic rivals in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey has worked hard
to increase ties with Turkic-speaking countries in the Caucasus and
Central Asia, including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. promotion, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia reached
an agreement on the construction of a multi-billion-dollar inter-
governmental oil pipeline to transport Caspian oil, on the
sidelines of the Istanbul summit of the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) last year.
</P>
<P>
When complete, the pipeline will transport up to 50 million tons
of oil per day from the Caspian Sea, through the Azeri capital of
Baku, Georgia capital of Tbilisi to the southern Turkish port of
Ceyhan and on to the global markets.
</P>
<P>
The parliaments of Turkey and Azerbaijan along with Georgia have
approved the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline project, which has recently
accelerated its construction.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the project, Turkey and Azerbaijan have started to
work on the possibilities of transporting Azeri natural gas to
Turkey and European markets since Azerbaijan discovered rich
natural gas resources in the Caspian Sea recently.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline via Turkey to western
markets is of more political importance than economic significance
for the U.S., which aims to undercut the former Soviet republics'
dependence on Russia.
</P>
<P>
For Turkey, it can enjoy both political and economic gains.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ankara said it has the "same concern" as Russia,
China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the members of the "
Shanghai Five", which held a summit earlier this month in the
Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe and decided to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara fears that Russia is taking advantage of the
terrorist threats in the region to regain its control over the
newly independent countries which face security challenges from
ethnic separatism and radical religious elements.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Foreign Trade Up in First Six Months of This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's foreign trade performance
in the first six months of this year showed positive signs with
total export value registered at 6.4 billion U.S. dollars, a year-
on-year rise of 26.2 percent, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Export items that recorded speedy increases over first six
months of the year included fruit and vegetable, pepper, tea,
aquatic products, crude oil, textile and garment, footwear,
handicrafts, electronics and computer accessories.
</P>
<P>
Apart from shipping goods to traditional markets in the
European Union (EU), Vietnamese exporters expanded their outlets
in the United States, South America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen importers regularly buying Vietnamese goods worth more
than 100 million U.S. dollars a year include Britain, the United
States, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Australia,
Singapore, China and France.
</P>
<P>
Because of growing export activities, imports of machinery and
materials for industrial production and processing of export items
increased remarkably, bringing the country's total import value
recorded in the past six months to 7.1 billion U.S. dollars, up by
33.8 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's surplus import value in the first half of the
year estimated at 727 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is likely to record a surplus import value of about 1
billion U.S. dollars this year, making up around 8 percent of its
annual targeted export value of 13.5 billion U.S. dollars, VNA
said.

<HEADLINE> Peso to Bounce Back Since Mindanao War Is Over: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
expressed the hope Tuesday that the Philippine peso will be able
to bounce back now that war in Mindanao "is practically over."
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Estrada also said the fall of the peso
against the U.S. dollar is part of a regionwide development that
has also affected currencies in Indonesia, Thailand and even
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is regionwide, not only here. Their currencies
easily decline in value, especially in Indonesia where the decline
is even bigger, also in Thailand and even Singapore," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, it is the way the free market goes,
with local currencies affected by the global reaction to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
As of 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, the peso was down to 44.609 pesos to
the dollar, the lowest in a 23-month period.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said now that Camp Abubakar, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF)'s biggest stronghold in Mindanao has
fallen into government hands and peace and stability are expected
to return to Mindanao, the economy will be able to recover fully.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Suppliers Call for Fair Play With Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chamber of Mines of Zambia (CMZ)
has urged the government to level the playing field for foreign
and local suppliers of goods and services to the new mines, Zambia
's Financial Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Giving unilateral concessions to foreign suppliers of goods and
services has numerous repercussions on the local industry and
general public, CMZ was quoted as saying by the weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
CMZ's interim chairperson Eric Naish said once local suppliers
are sidelined by denying them competitive incentives, many
Zambians will lose their jobs because all local suppliers of mines
would fail to compete.
</P>
<P>
Nashi suggested that while the new mines would be enjoying
certain government concessions on imported production materials,
the government should also introduce certain incentives for the
local suppliers.

<HEADLINE> COMESA, SADC to Facilitate Movement of Goods and Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) and Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) have agreed in principle to work together to facilitate
easy movement of goods and people between the two regional groups,
Zambia's Daily Mail Tuesday quoted a COMESA senior official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Berhane Giday, COMESA senior program analyst on insurance said
that the two regional groups will issue yellow cards to ensure the
easy and secure movement of goods and people, stressing that this
is an important prerequisite once some member countries go into
the Free Trade Area in October this year.
</P>
<P>
"The advantages of yellow cards are that they increase
efficiency in goods delivery as a transporter does not need to
stop at every border to purchase insurance scheme."
</P>
<P>
"In case of an accident while delivering goods, you can avoid
wasting perishable goods as there would be no need for police in
individual countries to detain the vehicle because we have
national bureaus in member states," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Giday, the yellow card covers injury to person's
body, property and medical expenses and full guarantee to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
He said even American Express cards are accepted for the
purchase of the yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the yellow card scheme is operated in Zambia,
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, Giday added.

<HEADLINE> China's T-bond Market Quiet on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond trade was still
sluggish. Bonds fluctuated within a narrow range of no more than 0.
10 percent. Turnover on the market totaled 1.25 billion yuan, up
slightly by 78 million yuan over yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that 000696, an 11.83 percent bond due 2006, stood
stable at 142.96 yuan while its trade was extremely thin with a
volume of 32 million yuan. Bond 010004, the only bond with
floating interest rate on the market, stayed almost unchanged, too.
However, the turnover on the bond shrank to 286 million yuan, 133
million yuan less than the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
And 009908, a 3.30 percent bond due 2009, edged down 0.06
percent to 101.51 yuan, buoying the yield up 0.02 percentage
points back to 3.48 percent. The bond is today's most active
performer on the market.
</P>
<P>
The equity market on both of the two domestic stock exchanges
closed up again. However, investors are now very cautious, as the
stock indices are already pretty high. Conservative investors may
turn to T-bond market for safety later but a wait-and-see attitude
is still dominant among them at present. As a result, current
treasuries kept inactive these days.
</P>
<P>
China's repo market plunged suddenly following yesterday's boom.
The trade volume on three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day
transactions plummeted from 12.19 billion yuan to 2.34 billion
yuan. Meanwhile, the interest rate on the three-day transaction
lost 3.21 percentage points to 3.89 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China urges the United States to
abandon the National Missile Defense (NMD) system plan at an
earliest time, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sun was responding to a question about the failure of missile
defense system tests conducted by the U.S. recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. development of the NMD system will break the
global strategic equilibrium and stability, hinder the nuclear
disarmament process, spoil the efforts of the international
community on non-proliferation and may trigger off another round
of arms race.
</P>
<P>
"This is against the interests of all nations across the world,
including the U.S. itself," he stressed. "We reiterate that on the
NMD issue, the U.S. faces not only technical obstacles, but more
importantly, objections from the international community."
</P>
<P>
"We therefore urge the U.S. to abandon the plan, which is
harmful both to itself and others, at an earliest time."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sun said China will, in accordance with the
changes of the international situation, decide on its own to
guarantee its national security against any harm.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Monday a
failure by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to make hard decisions at the Camp David summit might
lead to an eruption of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to arrive at Andrews Air Force base around 5 a.m.
Tuesday and then helicopter directly to the Camp David presidential
retreat in northern Maryland. Clinton is to convene a three-way
meeting with Barak and Arafat later in the day before negotiators
divide into different talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians in the self-rule Gaza Strip are stocking
up on food, gasoline and water. They are anticipating violent
clashes with Israel, following a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state in September if the summit fails and no peace
deal can be reached by then.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An unwritten agreement has finally been reached between
Israel and Lebanon over the northern border village of Rajar. Under
a U.N.-brokered understanding, Israel has agreed to respect
Lebanon's sovereignty in the northern part of the village and
Israel soldiers will not patrol the area, Ha'aretz has learned.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is only partially exercising its authority in the split
village, and the arrangement has been accepted by all sides as an
unwritten understanding that has finally brought an end to
international discussion on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The international border in the middle of the village has not
been marked because of continued opposition by residents who
threatened onto to allow U.S. inspectors into the area.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak declared before departing
for the Camp David summit that he was embarking on a mission "to
try and return with an agreement that will strengthen Israel, an
agreement that will be brought for the approval of the people,
because the people sent me and gave me a mandate and only they will
decide.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak suffered a defeat in the Knesset when the
government was defeated in a no-confidence motion submitted by
Likud by a vote of 54 to 52. However, the government did not fall,
as 61 votes are required to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman dispatched his Director
General Arye Shumer to deliver a letter of resignation to Knesset
(Parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg Monday, ending his tenure in
office.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said he was leaving the presidency with a satisfied
felling about his decades of service to the nation and the first
thing he wants to do, now that he is retired, is "get some sleep".
</P>
<P>
Weizman's seven years in office ended early after he was
investigated for accepting 453,000 U.S. dollars from French
millionaire Edouard Saroussi.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Monday a
failure by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to make hard decisions at the Camp David summit might
lead to an eruption of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to arrive at Andrews Air Force base around 5 a.m.
Tuesday and then helicopter directly to the Camp David presidential
retreat in northern Maryland. Clinton is to convene a three-way
meeting with Barak and Arafat later in the day before negotiators
divide into different talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians in the self-rule Gaza Strip are stocking
up on food, gasoline and water. They are anticipating violent
clashes with Israel, following a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state in September if the summit fails and no peace
deal can be reached by then.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An unwritten agreement has finally been reached between
Israel and Lebanon over the northern border village of Rajar. Under
a U.N.-brokered understanding, Israel has agreed to respect
Lebanon's sovereignty in the northern part of the village and
Israel soldiers will not patrol the area, Ha'aretz has learned.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is only partially exercising its authority in the split
village, and the arrangement has been accepted by all sides as an
unwritten understanding that has finally brought an end to
international discussion on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The international border in the middle of the village has not
been marked because of continued opposition by residents who
threatened onto to allow U.S. inspectors into the area.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak declared before departing
for the Camp David summit that he was embarking on a mission "to
try and return with an agreement that will strengthen Israel, an
agreement that will be brought for the approval of the people,
because the people sent me and gave me a mandate and only they will
decide.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak suffered a defeat in the Knesset when the
government was defeated in a no-confidence motion submitted by
Likud by a vote of 54 to 52. However, the government did not fall,
as 61 votes are required to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman dispatched his Director
General Arye Shumer to deliver a letter of resignation to Knesset
(Parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg Monday, ending his tenure in
office.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said he was leaving the presidency with a satisfied
felling about his decades of service to the nation and the first
thing he wants to do, now that he is retired, is "get some sleep".
</P>
<P>
Weizman's seven years in office ended early after he was
investigated for accepting 453,000 U.S. dollars from French
millionaire Edouard Saroussi.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Establish Mindanao Health Development Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
establish a health development office in Mindanao as part of its
efforts to give residents quick access to medical treatment and
health care, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alberto Romualdez of the Department of Health (DOH)
said this is part of the government's initiative to accelerate the
delivery of social services to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We have secured the consent of the president to establish the
Mindanao Health Development Office, which will be headed by an
undersecretary of the DOH," Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
He added this effort is part of the Mindanao Health Development
Plan, which also aims to build medical centers in Mindanao using
national funds and foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
The president, according to Romualdez, earlier ordered
concerned government agencies to work out a program that would
accelerate the delivery of social services to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Covered by the directive are the DOH and the Department of
Social Welfare and Development, the Department of Education,
Culture and Sports, the Department of National Defense and the
Department of Budget and Management.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Romualdez said the DOH will continue to
establish supply lines in conflict-hit areas in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said the DOH aims to mobilize resources, attend to emergency
requirements, and build makeshift facilities to accommodate
residents displaced by the recent fighting between government
troops and secessionist rebels.

<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it is ready to handle splinter groups of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) following the fall of Camp
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Government troops captured Camp Abubakar, the MILF's biggest

</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada raised the Philippine flag in the
captured camp a day later and commended the troops responsible for
the fall of the MILF fortress.

ammunition, including rockets, machine guns, and even land mines,
inside the camp.

Soldiers also continue to hold scouring operations to recover
other resources in the captured camp, he added.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Conflicts Kills 91 Tamil Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 91 Tamil Tiger rebels
have been killed in fresh conflicts in the north and northeast of
Sri Lanka as government troops launched counter offensives against
the separatists, a government statement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government troops Monday destroyed a rebel bunker line and
captured one strong point at Colombuturai in the northern Jaffna
peninsula, killing 62 rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) and wounding 118 others, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said troops suffered casualties due to rebel mortar fires.
The government said in a statement on Monday that one officer and
18 soldiers were killed in action while 94 security forces
personnel were wounded.
</P>
<P>
In another conflict at Chavakachcheri in Jaffna peninsula on
Monday, troops destroyed a bunker and a house occupied by LTTE
rebels, killing 12 rebels.
</P>
<P>
Government troops engaged a group of rebels with small arms at
Poonari also in Jaffna peninsula, killing five rebels.
</P>
<P>
The statement said government troops attacked and destroyed a
tractor carrying 12 rebels at Otiyamalai in the northeastern
Welioya region.
</P>
<P>
In a latest development, LTTE rebels Monday evening fired
mortars at the Vilgamwehera detachment which is located close to a
temple in the northeastern Trincomalee district. A priest received
injuries and four civilians were killed due to the mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
The battlefields in Jaffna have been mostly quiet since May,
after weeks of heavy fighting between government troops and LTTE
rebels who were engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to retake
their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting since 1983 to carve out a
separate homeland called Eelam in the north and east for minority
Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Ban Timber Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will not ban raw timber
exports but will instead strive to encourage investors to engage
in processing timber in the country, the weekly Financial Mail
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Permanent Secretary of the Commerce Ministry
Moses Banda as saying that instead of banning raw timber exports,
the government will look at how it can work together with various
stakeholders to add value to the timber before it leaves the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Encouragement of timber processing should be paramount. Above
that, we should look at not only processing for the local market
but for export as well," said Banda.
</P>
<P>
The government has been previously urged to ban the export of
raw timber to benefit Zambia, whose annual timber productivity is
estimated at 200,000 to 400,000 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Kenya,Uganda to Expand Cooperation: Kenyan Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan and Ugandan businessmen and
investors should boost trade between the two countries and jointly
invest in each other's telecommunications, railway and road
projects, a Kenyan official has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ugandan trade and investment conference held
here Monday, Kenyan Minister Nicholas Biwott for Tourism, Trade
and Industry said business leaders in the two countries should
forge contacts for their mutual benefits, The East African
Standard newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said that with the recent ratification of the East
African Community (EAC) treaty by Tanzania, the EAC has paved the
way for expanding trade and economic cooperation among the three
east African nations, namely, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He noted all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in the EAC
region will be removed to adopt a common external tariff under a
customs union arrangement currently under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, the minister said, the EAC was now one
market and the free movement of labor and capital would be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda is Kenya's most important trading partner
as it absorbs close to 20 percent of Kenya's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the balance of trade which is in favor of Kenya,
Biwott said Kenya was supportive of any appropriate measures from
Uganda that may lead to equitable trade between the two nations.

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has been hit by a sustaining drought and heat
this year, the Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unusual long spell of heat, persisting by far in almost all
areas of the country, was caused by hot and dry air moving across
large areas of the Asian continent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the last week, temperatures in some major cities and
provinces were registered at 34-37 degrees Celsius, an all-time
high in the meteorological observation. The average temperature
was 6-12 degrees higher than normal temperature.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, maize, rice and other crops were badly
affected by the sustaining heat and drought, which left roots of
rice plants rotten and non-paddy crops dried up in some areas on
the west coast, including Pyongyang, South Pyongan province, North
Hwanghae province and Nampo city.
</P>
<P>
Crops in those areas are badly damaged by blight and harmful
insects due to the drought and heat, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In consequence, agricultural production this year is expected
to suffer a sharp drop, said the report.

LOME -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has urged the rest of
the world, especially the developed countries, to provide
assistance to promote development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 36th summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) here on Monday, Annan said the industrialized countries are
obliged to ensure that Africa has a fair chance to compete in the
new global economy by opening their markets to African products. "
They should halt their subsidized exports which drive African
farmers out of business," he said. "They should cancel debts so
that African governments no longer have to repay them at the
expense of the people's health and education." (Annan-Africa-

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday
the failure of the proposed U.S. National Missile Defense (NMD)
system test was "not fatal," and does not automatically mean the
Clinton administration will abandon its goal of having it ready
for use by 2005.
</P>
<P>
In his first public comments on Saturday's test failure, Cohen
said he would await a full report of the test before making his
recommendation to President Bill Clinton, who is expected to
decide later this summer whether to go ahead with construction of
the first phase of the system. Early Saturday, a U.S. interceptor
missile failed to hit a speeding target warhead in space in a 100-
million-U.S.-dollar test of the system. The warhead-busting "kill
vehicle" failed to separate from its booster rocket and passed
harmlessly by the target missile. (US-NMD)

LOS ANGELES -- Most wildfires in U.S. Western states -- Wyoming,

containment Monday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters contained a wildfire Monday that had devoured 36,
700 acres of juniper and sagebrush in Wyoming, just north of the
Utah border. "It is contained, but control is still going to be a
while," Bureau of Land Management spokesman Mike Brown said. No
injuries or structure loss were reported since the fire was
sparked by lightning on July 2. Lower temperatures, higher
humidity and spotty showers helped firefighters bring the fire
under control over the weekend. (US-Wildfire)

<HEADLINE> Birds Find Paradise in Yellow River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Birds have found a paradise in the
reed marshes on the Yellow River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The harmonious ecological environment came into being after the
government of east China's Shandong Province adopted the policy of
turning farmland into marshes.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, reed marshes on the Yellow River Delta were
turned into farmland. However, farmers did not get expected
harvests either in grain or in cotton, due to saline-alkali soil
there.
</P>
<P>
Land reclamation also caused soil erosion and destroyed the
nests of birds.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the local government became aware of the
importance of ecological balance and realized that reeds can
produce money as well.
</P>
<P>
The local government has encouraged people to plant reeds. In
Wudi County alone on the delta, farmers have planted more than 4,
000 hectares of reeds.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese and foreign businessmen have established reeds
processing companies, manufacturing reeds curtain and other
products.
</P>
<P>
In Wudi, reeds products have been sold to more than 20
countries and regions, earning the county 26 million U.S. dollars
annually, official statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman: WB's Decision for Qinghai Project Regrettable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi here this afternoon expressed regret for a
recent decision made by the World Bank (WB) to reject approval of
a poverty reduction project in a remote Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders from developed members of the WB on July 8
rejected the recommendations of the Management of the World Bank
on the Qinghai Component of the China Western Poverty Reduction
Project.
</P>
<P>
Sun commented in response to a journalist's question at a
regular press conference that "The Qinghai Poverty Reduction
Project is aimed at helping the people of various ethnic groups in
the project region eradicate poverty and raise the economic and
social development level."
</P>
<P>
"It fully conforms to the policy and the Articles of Agreement
of WB, and has been welcomed by the people in the region," Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
Sun attributed the approval failure to the "unreasonable
demands" and "obstacles for political reasons" from some developed
countries, the United States and Japan in particular, adding that
their move "is in violation of" the WB rules.
</P>
<P>
"China strongly opposes politicization of WB activities," he
said. And "any attempt to obstruct the implementation of the
project is doomed to failure."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to use its own fund to
implement the project to help local people shake off poverty,
according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
"The determination of the Chinese government to speed up its
poverty relief efforts will never waive," he said.

<HEADLINE> One-China Policy Key to Breaking Deadlock </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official for Taiwan
affairs yesterday reiterated the central government's position
that adherence to the one-China principle is the only way out of
the current cross-Straits stalemate.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a delegation from Taiwan's New Party, Li
Yafei, secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, said that under the one-China
principle, both sides of the Taiwan Straits have equal weight in
consultations to discuss the reunification issue.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member delegation, led by Feng Hu-hsing, flew into
Beijing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Feng as saying that his party
opposes any form of "Taiwan independence." Both Taiwan and the
mainland are parts of China, Feng added.
</P>
<P>
Li said the association and Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation reached a consensus in Hong Kong in November 1992 by
agreeing to adhere to the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
Going back to this consensus is the starting point for the
resumption of talks between the association and the foundation, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He said some people in Taiwan distorted such consensus by
coming up with different interpretations of one China, which has
placed barriers between the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Association Chairman Wang Daohan held a summit with his
Taiwanese counterpart, Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation, in Singapore in 1993, leading to a series of
technical negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Talks broke off in 1995 after then Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui
visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
The New Party delegation expressed its hope for the resumption
of "Wang-Koo" talks on the basis of the agreement reached in 1992.

to stay away from Fiji."

<HEADLINE> Another Police Station in Fiji Taken by Coup Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Another police station has been
reportedly taken Monday morning in the village of Lambasa, about
250 km north of Suva.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press reported that a caller to
Sydney radio 2UE said his 55-year-old Indian father had been taken
prisoner, along with other government workers, until police
detainees charged with looting were freed.
</P>
<P>
"He was at this police station where 300 of George Speight's
supporters went in and seized the police station," the caller was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However the coup leader George Speight denied he was behind a
fresh wave of kidnappings. The kidnappings were representative of
widespread dissatisfaction with the interim civilian government
appointed by the military last week, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
A new government is expected to be appointed on Thursday
following a meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The caller told the Radio 2UE that "they are going in,
detaining the government workers, in this case police officers,
and then drinking grog with them in a sit-down fashion until the
outcome of the meetings this Thursday."
</P>
<P>
At least one police station was occupied by Speight's
supporters last week.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by Speight and the military
authorities in the night Sunday, the all 27 hostages will be
released on the same day the Great Council of Chiefs convene its
meeting on Thursday. Speight has reportedly promised he would
released them in the morning that day, before the council's
meeting opened.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Company reported this morning that
Speight raised doubts about the timetable and said the hostages
may be released on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Water Rationing in Kenya's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Kenya's capital
Nairobi will brace themselves for hard times starting from July 11
as the city council has announced a tighter water rationing
program.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Mayor John Ndirangu
as saying that the move was inevitable as power rationing has
affected the water pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
Ndirangu said the program, which divides the city into four
zones, will last until the rains come. Normally, the short rains
come in October.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Ndaka-ini Dam, which provides the city with
most of the water, is now recorded a low level of 34 million cubic
meters as against 70 million cubic meters when full.
</P>
<P>
The mayor added that at present, the city was pumping 1,000
cubic meters of water an hour, down from 1,400 cubic meters
previously.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, areas under the lower supply zone
including the city center and the industrial area, which will
receive water every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 6:00 p.m. to
6:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
There will be no supply of water on Sundays to any zone because
the council will be building water levels in the reservoirs which
provide water to the city.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has experienced a prolonged drought since last year and
introduced an intensifying power rationing nationwide since late
May.

<HEADLINE> Diet Plus Exercise Reduce Blood Pressure: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Regular exercise and weight
loss can help to lower blood pressure in people who are overweight,
said researchers in a report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
While exercise alone has been shown to reduce blood pressure in
overweight people with high blood pressure, weight loss can
enhance the effect, wrote Dr. James A. Blumenthal with Duke
University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, in the July
10th issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that diet and exercise may be an alternative to
blood pressure-lowering medication for some patients.
</P>
<P>
The researchers conducted a study of more than 100 overweight,
inactive men and women with slightly elevated blood pressure. They
were assigned either to do aerobic exercises, or participate in a
weight management program including exercises, or do nothing,
without taking any medication.
</P>
<P>
Patients in the aerobic exercise group worked out 3 to 4 times
a week, including 35 minutes cycling, walking or jogging.
Individuals in the weight management group worked out for the same
amount of time and at the same intensity but they also
participated in a program that helped them lose about 1 to 2
pounds per week.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, blood pressure declined the most
among patients in the weight management group. Individuals in the
exercise group reduced their blood pressure more than patients who
did not exercise or lose weight.
</P>
<P>
In other findings, blood glucose and levels of insulin--the
hormone that assists glucose entry into cells--also declined among
patients who lost weight and exercised, suggesting that the
regimen sensitizes the cells to insulin. When cells do not respond
well to the hormone, the individual is at risk for type II
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
People who only exercised and those who did nothing did not see
improved insulin sensitivity, the findings indicate.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it is important for physicians to (add) a
weight loss program to an exercise prescription if the goal is to
lower glucose and insulin levels," Blumenthal said.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Teaching Discussed in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of two institutions of
higher learning said at an on-going seminar here that the teaching
of Portuguese language should be continued even though Macao has
returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Iu Vai Pan and Li Xiangyu, presidents of the University of
Macao and Macao Polytechnic Institute respectively, said the
number of students applying to study Portuguese would decrease in
the new semester. Both expected that the teaching should be
carried on and Macao should become a Portuguese training center in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Students should know the significance of studying Portuguese,
Li Xiangyu said, adding that his institute would try to recruit
more students from China's inland areas, east Asian countries and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 scholars from Portugal, China's inland areas and
Macao attended the seminar on Portuguese teaching.
</P>
<P>
However, local Chinese newspaper of Va Kio commented that less
than five percent of Macao residents understand Portuguese
although it is one of the official languages in Macao. The
government of the Macao Special Administrative Region should work
out policies in accordance with practical needs to avoid waste of
money.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expected to Record 9 Pct GDP Growth in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product growth for the second quarter of this year will be about 9.
0 percent, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the estimated percentage is lower than the 11.7
percent growth in the first quarter of this year, "it is still a
good figure," he told reporters after officiating the Malaysian
Structural Steel Convention and Exhibition 2000 here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the remarks when asked whether there would be a
revision in the annual GDP growth projection of 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Some people say more but we are very conservative," he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether the 2001 Budget would have a surplus,
he said "there is a possibility but it also would depend on how
the government wants to spend."
</P>
<P>
"We think we need to spend money to stimulate the economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To another question, Mahathir said the government would not re-
peg the ringgit against the U.S. dollar unless the situation
became uncompetitive for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"It (the peg) will remain until we reach a situation where we
become totally uncompetitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the pegging (of the ringgit at 3.8 to a U.S.
dollar) has done very well for the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Asian Experts Call for Good Urban Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- South Asian experts said here
Tuesday that the South Asian countries are facing severe
infrastructural constraints due to rapid urbanization and called
for central governments to promote good urban governance.
</P>
<P>
As a direct result of the rapid urbanization process, South
Asia is facing with enormous challenges and problems, such as
inadequacy in roads and transport, electricity, water supply,
sanitation and telecommunications, said the experts at the three-
day South Asian conference on "Urbanization and Good Urban
Governance" that kicked off here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-organized by Nepali Ministry of Physical
Planning and Works and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), is
aimed at exploring new avenues for capacity building of the local
governments on urban governance and sharing experiences of good
urban governance practices among South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Acting resident representative of UNDP to Nepal Saraswothi
Menon said at the meeting that the problems of urbanization will
be resolved if the South Asian countries are able to decentralize,
develop management capacity, increase people's participation, and
awareness and minimize the divisions between the urban and rural
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The management of cities and municipalities must be brought
closer to the people, and urban governance must address the issues
related to migration from rural to urban areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's Minister for Physical Planning and Works Khum Khadka
said at the meeting that good governance will play a leading role
in the resolution of problems arising from urbanization and
population increase. He called for the South Asian countries to
strengthen mutual cooperation and collaboration for this end.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, while only one fifth of the population
of South Asia lived in urban areas in 1975, the percentage has
increased to 30 percent now and will reach 40 percent in the next
15 years.
</P>
<P>
Participating the conference are about 100 representatives from
the governmental and non-governmental organizations of the South
Asian countries -- Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, India,
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh -- and some other Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Lee Hsien Loong Spurs Singapore's Public Service to Greater Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong has spurred his country's civil service to be more
open and responsive in the new environment and nurture a culture
of innovation and enterprise in the future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public service symposium to mark the 5th
anniversary of the Public Service 21 plan, the deputy prime
minister said to build a more open and responsive as well as
innovative and enterprising civil service are two key imperatives
the Public Service faces for change in the future.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public servants to reach out to the wider public,
develop a shared understanding of issues, particularly of those
affected by government's actions, and tap the widest range of
experience and knowledge available to develop and execute sound
policies.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's future success will depend on the public, private
and people sectors coming together, working in close consultation
and as partners," he said, adding "this is essential for
formulating and implementing policies properly."
</P>
<P>
Lee pushed the Public Service to encourage creativity and
innovation from officers at all levels and change culture so as to
get people at all levels to constantly examine the way things are
done, and come up with ideas to refresh the system.
</P>
<P>
He said "We cannot afford to wait for a crisis to force changes,
we have to be proactive, putting things in place ahead of time,
opening up new avenues, and trying out initiatives which can
benefit Singapore."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of calculating the cost of taking a chance on an
untested idea, we should consider the opportunity cost of not
taking the chance," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lee also urged the civil service to avail themselves of the
advantage of IT technology to create dynamic, vibrant
organizations which freely share and pool ideas and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that it is not easy to change the mindsets of 70,
000-odd civil servants in Singapore, he asked the Public Service "
to consider what further steps to take, to build on and go beyond
what we have achieved thus far."

KUALA LUMPUR, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday he is confident Malaysia will remain

Mahathir made the statement when asked to comment on a Far
Eastern Economic Review report quoting the United States Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) as forecasting instability in Malaysia
after Mahathir's departure.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement would ensure that the country's development
could continue even without him, he told reporters after
officiating the Malaysian Structural Steel Convention and
Exhibition here.
</P>
<P>
"I think that is what they are expecting, they would like. Any
country that is stable, they will try to destabilize," said
Mahathir who has been the prime minister of the country since 1981.

<HEADLINE> Survey Predicts Rise of Salaries in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Salaries are rising at a
healthy pace in the United States, faster than inflation, said a
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by The Conference Board based in New York,
said that executive salaries are seeing the biggest net gains and
that the richest executives will see their salary increase 4.8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The median U.S. workers will see their salary rise 4.0 percent
in 2000, according to the board's survey of salary budgets at 600
companies.
</P>
<P>
Salaries have virtually risen at that same 4 percent rate for
the past seven years, since the end of the recession around the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"While you could say that 4 percent looks modest, if you look
at it against inflation, they're coming out ahead," said Charles
Peck, compensation specialist at The Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The board, which serves business members, particularly senior
executives, predicts inflation will remain at 2.7 percent the rest
of this year and for 2001.
</P>
<P>
Wages will also rise 4.0 percent next year for non-exempt and
exempt employees, the board predicted. Executives will see a gain
of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
That means salary earners are seeing a real gain in their
standard of living, after inflation. The median real gain, after
inflation, is 1.3 percent this year and next.
</P>
<P>
But certain products and services -- such as rents and energy
products like gasoline -- have been rising faster than inflation
as a whole. So employees who have large expenses on those product
groups could in fact be losing ground.

cooperation here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day convention of the Mixed Committee on Trade and
Economic Cooperation Between China and Qatar is intended to expand
bilateral trade and cooperation in all areas including oil and gas
sectors.
</P>

the department of economy of Qatari Ministry of Finance, Economy
and Trade, said Qatar and China have maintained friendly relations
since diplomatic ties were forged between the two countries in

</P>
<P>
The successful state visit of Qatar Emir to China last year, he
said, helped promote the overall friendly relations and trade and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He sees massive potential for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, China and Qatar signed several agreements
on bilateral trade and mutual investment.

Two-way trade volume during the first five months of this year
reached 140 million US dollars, and China has bought 130 million
US dollars worth of Qatari goods, five times over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, the two sides held in-depth
discussions on cooperation in a wide range of fields covering oil,
natural gas, mutual investment, trade, contractual engineering and
labor cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They reached consensus that China will build an investment and

HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The outlook of Hong Kong's
garment trade is optimistic in view of the economic recovery in
full swing across Asia, said Christopher Cheng, chairman of the
Garment Advisory Committee of Trade Development Council (TDC) of
Hong Kong.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Illegal CD Production Lines Closed Down in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Economic and police authorities of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) government four days
ago succeeded in detecting and closing down another two production
lines making pirated optical compact disks, the Macao Daily News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following investigations for a certain period, inspectors with
the economic authorities concluded that one factory was suspected
of making pirated CDs found on the market.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of police forces, economic inspectors
raided the factory on the evening of July 7 but no workers were
found there. In addition to two CD production lines, inspectors
discovered a package printing machine and large amount of glue
particles for making disks.
</P>
<P>
Police found several cameras surrounding the factory. The
cameras would help workers evacuate rather quickly when there was
something wrong.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the factory held the license to produce video compact
disks. However, it secretly turned out pirated disks in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
Economic and police authorities had closed down three similar
CD production lines on July 3.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hounds Military Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
warned all those people employing and sheltering armed force
deserters that they will be subjected to severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
The Irrigation and Power Minister and Deputy Defense Minister
Anuruddha Ratwatte Monday evening said the armed forces and the
police will conduct street to street and house to house operations
in Colombo within the next few days to nab those deserters since
the Ministry has received information that a large number of
deserters had been given jobs in various institutes in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said the intensified operations launched recently islandwide
to nab deserters had proved a success as around 4,700 armed forces
deserters have been arrested during these operations.
</P>
<P>
The Minister added that the people had responded positively to
the request of the government and provided vital information about
deserters.
</P>
<P>
He called for further cooperation to arrest the estimated
balance of 18,000 more deserters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the government's Special Media
Information Center, these operations are conducted by special
committees comprising District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries,
regional police chiefs and police officers.
</P>
<P>
Other special rounding up operations have been made at venues
the deserters have been residing in and their places of work in
Colombo city and the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
A program has also been launched by the government for
rehabilitating deserters who have undergone traumatic problems at
their respective homes.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has conducted amnesties on many
occasions since 1995. Many of the deserters reportedly returned to
the army. However, there are still some deserters who failed to
respond to the amnesties.

<HEADLINE> "One Baht Doctor" Popular among Poor Thais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A medical program which charges
only one baht (0.025 U.S. dollar) per treatment is highly popular
among Thailand's underprivileged, The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "One Baht Doctor" program, set up eight years ago by Dr.
Boonruang Trirungworawat, is a volunteer medical team which
travels to remote areas to give poor villagers access to medical
services.
</P>
<P>
Although medical charities are not new, the growing number of
such groups is a reassuring sign there are idealistic doctors
prepared to devote themselves to the care of the underprivileged,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a shortage of doctors. With the ratio of one
doctor per 4,000 people, villagers in remote areas must travel
long distances to receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, villagers often must queue and wait for days at
state hospitals before receiving medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Boonruang launched the program after his appointment as a
hospital director in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He organized volunteer doctors into a mobile team, on call to
provide medical services in remote areas. To finance his charity,
he arranged various fund-raising schemes.
</P>
<P>
The team makes one or two trips a month. During a recent trip
about 40 volunteer doctors provided medical treatment to hundreds
of people in a remote district in Pathum Thani province in central
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Although the volunteer medical team has been commended by the
public and media, Dr. Boonruang has also had to overcome many
obstacles to fulfill his ambition.
</P>
<P>
Some critics voiced skepticism his program would not last long.
They also viewed the program as self-promoting.
</P>
<P>
"I am serious in my work and I will not waver. The people know
me because of my work and my determination," Dr. Boonruang was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. June Flight Delays Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary government data
released Monday shows a record number of delayed flights in June
in the United States, largely attributed to summer thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
shows there were 48,905 flights delayed for 15 minutes or more in
June, up 18 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Weather, normally responsible for about 70 percent of flight
delays, resulted in 79 percent of late flights in June. On June 27
alone, the aviation weather center issued a record 281 warnings of
thunderstorm activity.
</P>
<P>
"It was an exceedingly bad month for weather but early July has
been better," said FAA chief spokesman Eliot Brenner.

<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters contained a wildfire Monday that had devoured 36,
700 acres of juniper and sagebrush in Wyoming, just north of the
Utah border.
</P>
<P>
"It is contained, but control is still going to be a while,"
Bureau of Land Management spokesman Mike Brown said.
</P>
<P>
No injuries or structure loss were reported since the fire was
sparked by lightning on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Lower temperatures, higher humidity and spotty showers helped
firefighters bring the fire under control over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, fire officials began pulling firefighters away
from an 11,033-acre fire, hoping to keep them rested in case more
large fires break out.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center said the
lightning-sparked blaze, which has burned land in and around the
Dinosaur National Monument in extreme northwestern Colorado,
should be fully contained Tuesday or Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Fire information officer Dennis Saville said the fire was 95
percent contained Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend two other major wildfires in western Colorado
were brought under control. The Cone Mountain fire near Gateway
burned 4,580 acres and the blaze near Rangely burned 1,700 acres.
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, a wildfire about six kilometers northwest of Reno
was 80 percent contained, officials said. No evacuations or damage
to homes were reported as a result of the fire, which burned about
900 acres.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faces Blood Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The American Red Cross said
Monday that there is a blood shortage across the country and urged
eligible donors to give blood to save lives.
</P>
<P>
The shortage has reached crisis proportions in the New York
metropolitan region, said Dr. Robert Jones, president and CEO of
the New York Blood Center.
</P>
<P>
He said the shortage has forced the center to reduce blood
shipments to New York and New Jersey hospitals by as much as 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is an immediate and dramatic donation increase,
these reduced blood shipments will continue or grow worse, placing
hospital and trauma patients at severe risk," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Red Cross officials said there are several causes for the
shortage, including the fact that fewer donors are available with
colleges and high schools not in session during the summer.
</P>
<P>
They also said that, despite an overall increase in blood
collections this year, the supply has not kept pace with demand,
because more advanced medical procedures such as organ transplants
and cancer treatments are being performed.
</P>
<P>
The New York Blood Center, which is the main supplier for 200
hospitals in New York City, Long Island, northern and central New
Jersey and the Hudson Valley, currently has approximately 1,000
pints of O positive blood and 200 pints of O negative -- a one-day
supply.
</P>
<P>
"We typically like to have about a five-day supply," said blood
center spokeswoman Linda Levi.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soccer Body Warns Foreign Players to Behave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Soccer Association of
Indonesia (PSSI) warned foreign players who are competing in the
quarterfinals of the Bank Mandiri national soccer league in
Jakarta to improve their behavior following an incident that
occurred on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
PSSI official in charge of the disciplinary commission Andi
Darussalam Tabusala said that he would meet with team managers
from four clubs competing in Group A and their foreign players.
</P>
<P>
"We want to tell the foreign players that they are here to show
local players and spectators how to play beautiful soccer. If they
are arrogant and feel more superior to local players, they'd
better not come," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Darussalam said his commission would sanction Brazilian
midfielder Luciano Leandro of Persija club from Jakarta by banning
him from playing in the next five matches. He has also been fined
3.75 million rupiah (403 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Leandro was given a red card by referee Yulius Dede after he
hit Arema's Chilean midfielder Rodrigo F. Araya in the 68th minute.
It is believed that Leandro was provoked by Araya, who became
annoyed after Leandro knocked his fellow countryman Juan Pacho
Rubio down in the 68th minute. Dede issued a yellow card to Araya.
</P>
<P>
Darussalam said he would send a warning letter to Arema,
telling the East Java club to discipline Araya and Rubio.
</P>
<P>
"We will warn Arema because their foreign players have violated
the rules of sportsmanship, and both players have shoed violent
tendencies," he said.

<HEADLINE> Use of Thai Herbs Endorsed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, five Thai
herbs have been placed on the National Essential List of Drugs,
guaranteeing their use in place of modern drugs at the hospital
level, according to the Health Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The five herbal treatments, namely plygesal cream, phaya yo
cream, curmin capsules, fa thalai chon capsules, and chum-hed
mushroom powder, have been selected from some 4,000 herbs
registered as traditional Thai medicines, the ministry said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
Korn Dabbaransi, the public health minister, was quoted by the
report as saying that the approval meant that from now on, all 92
regional and general hospitals and 714 rural hospitals throughout
the country may confidently prescribe the drugs to patients in
place of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
Noting that most doctors preferred to prescribe modern medicine
for patients due to quick results, as well as kickbacks in the
ordering process, Korn urged health officials to be more open-
minded about herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't trust and support its use, who will?" he asked,
adding that the nation could save many money spent on import of
western medicine.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official Media Warns of Dissolution of NLD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar Tuesday warned of dissolution soon of the
National League for Democracy (NLD), a winning political party in
the 1990 general election held by the present military government.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper signaled in a signed article that the NLD is to
be outlawed in a few weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
"Things have come to such a pass that NLD is coming to a bad
end in a few weeks' time," it warned.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the incumbent government dissolves NLD without fail
in accord with the wishes of the people, will it amount to
decisively standing on the side of the people," it urged.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that there are two "genuine" wishes of
Myanmar people which are to dissolve the NLD the soonest and to
draw up an enduring state constitution.
</P>
<P>
The article charged that the NLD, resorting to the head-on
confrontation policy, is disturbing the government by creating
imposition of economic sanctions on Myanmar with the assistance of
the West bloc, preventing some nations from giving assistance to
Myanmar, attempting to remove Myanmar from the United Nations and
the International Labor Organization, and preventing tourists from
visiting Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The NLD, formed and registered in late 1988 after the military
took over the state power on September 18 that year in the height
of the country's political crisis, participated along with 92
other political parties in the general election in May 1990.
</P>
<P>
It then won 396 or 82 percent of the 485 parliamentary seats in
the election.
</P>
<P>
The government media said the NLD won the election because the
public was tired of the then situation and thus voted for NLD for
a change.
</P>
<P>
However, the NLD complains that the government still fails to
implement the result of the election which is to call the people's
parliament elected and transfer the state power to the elected
government as promised then.

BELGRADE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadia

At the meeting, Dmitry Rogozin, chairman of the international

become the tools of the countries pursuing the hegemonist policy
to weaken and disrupt the stability of an independent and
sovereign state.

International Court of Justice to continue to exist since it has

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Navy, Air Force Ready to Secure Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Navy and Air Force are
committed to providing full backup to the police and Army in
securing the capital during the General Session of People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) next month, according to the Jakarta
Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The assistant to the main naval base commander for operational
affairs Col. Masruchan and the assistant to the Air Force's
operations commander Col. Wardjoko held a joint meeting here
Monday to discuss security around the general session.
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to deploy our combined troop of some 300 marines
and sailors to back up the city's public order operations. They
are our standby contingent, which can be deployed at any time. We
are also preparing three battalions of some 1,500 marines to
safeguard the MPR session," Masruchan said.
</P>
<P>
Wardjoko said: "We'll deploy our troops based on the request of
the city police and the administration. We can, for example,
dispatch helicopters to speed up the deployment of soldiers. Our
field soldiers will also be deployed upon request. At least, we
will secure our own base and its surrounding areas."
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting was the second of five such meetings to
discuss security during the MPR session. Also in attendance at the
meeting were senior officers from the Jakarta Police, the Jakarta
Military Command and top officials from the Jakarta administration.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor for administrative affairs Abdul Kahfi said the
meetings are aimed at designing an integrated scheme to overcome
public order and security problems in the city during the general
session.
</P>
<P>
"We can't solve the problems just by ourselves. We need back up
from the police and the military," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several parts of the city have been the popular spots for
protesters to express their views. Demands for better welfare for
teachers and factory workers, and serious and thorough prosecution
of alleged corruption, collusion and nepotism by former president
Soeharto, his family and cronies, have been the main themes of the
protests.
</P>
<P>
On July 4, a bomb blasted at the Attorney General's Office
compound, causing some minor damage to a lavatory on the ground
floor of the five-story office building. The blast came just an
hour after prosecutors questioned Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo "
Tommy" Mandala Putra in connection with his father's alleged
involvement in graft.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official on Forest Management System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been managing its
forest by the country's selection system initiated by a German
scientist since 1856.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Myanmar Minister of Forestry U Aung
Phone at the opening here on Monday of a three-day third meeting
of senior officials on forestry of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has never practiced clear cutting system in its forest
and always tried to strike a balance between conservation and
utilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that Myanmar's Forest Department is doing
conservation, while the state-run Myamar Timber Enterprise is
utilizing the timber for down-stream processing.
</P>
<P>
Due to proper management, Myanmar still has a forest cover of
50.8 percent, he noted, quoting the resource data of the Food and
Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also developing the wood-based industries for
maximum utilization of its timber resources by going down stream
and encouraging the production of the finished products instead of
selling logs.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the country's Forest Department and the Dry
Zone Greening Department are planting in the country a total of 66.
2 million seedlings on a total of 46,000 hectares annually, adding
that the forest of Myanmar is diminishing in some areas.
</P>
<P>
On the ASEAN strategic plan for forest sector, he called for
strengthening of cooperation among member countries and joint
approaches in addressing international forestry issues.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN senior officials' meeting on forestry, the first of
its kind hosted by Myanmar, is being attended by delegates from
all ASEAN member countries except Singapore.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Lowers Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC basket oil price went down
slightly over the past week, following the word that Saudi Arabia,
the power house for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), will increase its production.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based OPEC secretariat reported here Monday that the
price of the so-called OPEC basket of seven different crudes
lowered to 29.49 U.S. dollars a barrel last week from 29.80
dollars a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told the official Saudi Press
Agency on July 3 that his country will soon increase its oil
output by 500,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Since Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil producer and exporter,
the remark by its oil minister triggered a sweeping downturn in
oil prices across the world markets.
</P>
<P>
OPEC deems 25 dollars a barrel to be a sustainable price for
the oil market.
</P>
<P>
With the oil price hanging over the OPEC reference price
continuously, OPEC countries made a decision at a special meeting
on June 21 to raise its oil production, in an attempt to curb the
oil price.
</P>
<P>
However, oil experts say that with the production raised not
high enough, the oil price had remained high, with no signs of
falling before last week's moving down.

<HEADLINE> Alarming Rise in Number of HIV Carriers in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of those infected with
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) has shown an alarming increase
in Indonesia this year, with the total number of new sufferers in
the first five months of 2000 nearly equal to last year's 12-month
total.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Health officials have revealed that there were 214
new cases of HIV and AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) up
to the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The total number of those infected in 1999 was 225.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total number of HIV carriers in Indonesia to 1,
257.
</P>
<P>
But observers have suggested that this number is just the tip
of the iceberg. Some reports said the number may reach as many as
52,000.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the alarming increase continues to be a point of
controversy among officials and AIDS activists, according to the
Jakarta Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials maintain that 80 percent of the new cases
were caused by sexual contact, while activists claim that the
significant rise is due to an increase in the number of drug
addicts and the sharing of needles of Intravenous Drug Users.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank Governor's Detention Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's
Office Monday extended the detention of central bank governor
Sjahril Sabirin to another 40 days, pending the completion of the
investigation into his involvement in the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
The extension took effect on July 11, one day after Sabirin's
first 20-day detention ended, according to the Jakarta Post
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin's lawyers condemned the extension, saying it is
baseless and has no urgency.
</P>
<P>
Later on Monday, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said that
Sabirin is facing other charges.
</P>
<P>
"We will treat them separately. The ongoing process of
investigation into Sabirin could develop further and could be
linked to other cases and other names ... we'll see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin is suspected of involvement in the Bank Bali scandal in
which 904 billion rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) was reimbursed
by the government for defaulted loans, but less than half the
money was received by Bank Bali.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe the money was used largely by then ruling
Golkar Party to bankroll then president B.J. Habibie's campaign
for election.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Climbs to 60 in Manila Dumpsite Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of casualties in the
Payatas garbage dump collapse that occurred Monday morning in
Quezon City, Metro Manila has climbed up to 60, the local
government said Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Quezon City Disaster Coordinating Council reported Tuesday
morning the recovery of the body of a 9-year-old boy, bringing the
death toll to 60.
</P>
<P>
Five casualties of the deadly collapse remain unidentified
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the 51st Engineering Brigade of the Philippine Army
has said that search and rescue operations will continue despite
the looming rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Mathay, mayor of Quezon City, said Monday that more than
500 families were affected and 100 shanties were buried in the
landslide in Payatas dumpsite.
</P>
<P>
Mathay said the shanties were inhabited by squatters who were
once resettled to other safer places but kept on returning, saying
that the place is their only source of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted to its erosion and eventually
became a landslide, said Mathay.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in October 1999, but the
closure was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for
Quezon City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Session Ends in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The five-day ninth annual
session of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly ended here Monday with the adoption
of "The Bucharest Final Statement."
</P>
<P>
The document summarized the participants' basic stands and
views on the OSCE's "three baskets" -- politics and securities;
economy, science and technology and environment; and democracy and
human rights, and contained a series of resolutions on the
situation in North Caucasia, Southeastern Europe, Belarus and
Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the statement marks a major step
forward taken by the OSCE toward the settlement of new security
problems in North Caucasia, Moldova and Southeastern Europe, and
indicates that the OSCE will be more responsibly and resolutely
involved in issues such as economy, democratization, crisis
prevention and post-conflict reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 delegates from 54 of the 55 OSCE member countries
elected Romanian former Foreign Minister Adrian Severin new
chairman of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Severin said that during his one-year term he would make
efforts to promote the cooperation between the OSCE ministerial
council and the parliamentary assembly and to establish more
temporary councils to deal with crises.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the organization could make greater contribution
to crisis prevention.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly was set up in 1990 at the Paris
summit to promote the organization's parliamentary dimension.
</P>
<P>
At the latest OSCE summit in Istanbul last November, Romania
was designated to take over the presidency in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Failed Test Not to Slow NMD Deployment Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first public comments on Saturday's test failure, Cohen
said he would await a full report of the test before making his
recommendation to President Bill Clinton, who is expected to
decide later this summer whether to go ahead with construction of
the first phase of the system.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, a U.S. interceptor missile failed to hit a
speeding target warhead in space in a 100-million-U.S.-dollar test
of the system. The warhead-busting "kill vehicle" failed to
separate from its booster rocket and passed harmlessly by the
target missile.
</P>
<P>
"What I need to do is sit down with all the experts and get
their best judgment in terms of the feasibility of this system,"
Cohen told reporters en route to China. His plane stopped at
Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska State to refuel.
</P>
<P>
"The test itself was a disappointment but it was one of those
failures that was least expected, something that was routine,"
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been desirable to have two successful intercepts,
but it doesn't mean the technology is not there yet," he said. "I
still could make a recommendation."
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department, meanwhile, continued to analyze the
latest test failure, while a spokesman for its Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization said, "We're going to press forward" for
another test as early as October.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 U.S. states against ballistic missile attacks from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

polluting and loss-making enterprises in the Three Gorges area in
the next few years, today's "China Daily" reported.

enterprises in the Three Gorges area that are big polluters and
are losing money should be shut down instead of moving to other
location.
</P>
<P>
"Beside the firms that will be closed down, another 706
enterprises will merge to form 398 new companies," said Feng.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the trial closing and merging is under way, while

<P>
Micronutrient deficiency in food is a major problem of health
facing developing countries, and food fortification is a useful
means to solve it.
</P>
<P>
Survey shows that Chinese people are inclined to suffer from
anemia caused by iron deficiency, with 14.9 percent of the male
Chinese and 21.2 percent of the female.
</P>
<P>

the Ministry of Health, said that about 700 million Chinese people
suffer from iodine deficiency, accounting for 40 percent of the
world's total.
</P>

Day since 1994. It has called on the whole society to use iodized
salt.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wenjie, an official from the State Administration of

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges to Help Development in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
urged the rest of the world, especially the developed countries,
to provide assistance to promote development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 36th summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) here on Monday, Annan said the industrialized countries are
obliged to ensure that Africa has a fair chance to compete in the
new global economy by opening their markets to African products.
</P>
<P>
"They should halt their subsidized exports which drive African
farmers out of business," he said. "They should cancel debts so
that African governments no longer have to repay them at the
expense of the people's health and education."
</P>
<P>
Annan pointed out that Africa, which is home to 33 of the world
's least developed countries, is the only region where conflicts
are not decreasing.
</P>
<P>
"Africa contains almost half of the world refugees and
internally displaced persons," he said, adding that the impact of
HIV/AIDS has made the economic growth impossible though a growth
rate is witnessed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to pay attention to the
epidemic in Africa because it can not be isolated from issues of
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"We must all speak up and join the fight against AIDS. We must
speak up particularly with the leaders for silence means death,"
he said, noting that the epidemic killed more Africans than all
the conflicts in the continent last year alone.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general praised the OAU in maintaining peace in
the continent with the help of sub-regional networks. The OAU has
shown great assistance in making peace between its member states,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Taking power by unconstitutional means is no longer welcome. I
look forward to the day when the General Assembly of the United
Nations take the same principled stand and follow the lead of the
OAU," he said.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged Africa to promote education, economic development
and good governance.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 African heads of state and government are here in
a three-day summit meeting which is focused mainly on regional
cooperation and integration, security and stability, and the
challenges of widespread AIDS and poverty in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Inflation Under Full Control: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Victor
Yushchenko urged on Monday not to exaggerate the inflation rise in
June and the first half of the year in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is fully under control," he said at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's inflation reached 3.7 percent in June and 18.7
percent in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister attributed the inflation growth to higher
social payments in cash in the first six months, rise in foodstuff
prices and the money printing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"That is short-term dynamics, and I am sure July will make it
possible to ease inflation pressure through boosting the GDP and
the farm sector," Yushchenko noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yushchenko underscored that such a soaring
inflation rate was a "temporary effect" and would exhaust itself
as early as in the following few months.
</P>
<P>
Due to higher costs in housing and utilities, inflation in 2000
will exceed the previously predicted rate of 15.9 percent and
reach 18.5 percent, according to the government's latest forecasts.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak can make peace with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat despite Barak's political problems at home.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to note that, ... a solid majority of
the people want him to come and want him to pursue peace," Clinton
said to reporters before flying to Pennsylvania for a governors'
conference.
</P>
<P>
"This is difficult. It is perhaps the most difficult of all the
peace problems in the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that "both Prime Minister Barak and Chairman
Arafat have the vision, the knowledge, the experience and the
ability and the sheer guts to do what it takes, ..., to reach an
agreement and then take it back to their people and see if they
can sell it." (US-Israel-Palestine)

<HEADLINE> Pollution in Guangdong Decreasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Officials announced Monday that
heavy pollution in Guangdong province is decreasing, which is good
news for nearby Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The province's air pollution index has dropped by 0.3 points
compared with last year, and air quality in 14 cities has improved
remarkably, said Xu Deli, deputy governor of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, Guangdong has been experiencing fast
industrialization as Hong Kong and Southeast Asian businessmen
moved their factories into the province, where labor is cheap.
</P>
<P>
But the environment has paid the price.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong media have complained of more and more pollution-hazy
days, and factory smoke often wafts over from the interior land.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong last year closed 500 enterprises that were heavy
polluters, and adopted anti-pollution measures in 1,100 industrial
projects, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the province has invested more than 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) to curb air and water
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The situation is still extremely serious, according to Xu,
citing the threats of vehicle emission, acid rain and garbage. He
noted that the province aims to create a sound ecological
management system by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Togolese President Calls for Closer African Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Togolese President and new chairman
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Gnassingbe Eyadema
Monday urged member states to act without delay and hesitation to
establish a closer union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the opening session of the 36th annual summit
of the 53-member continental organization in the Togolese capital,
Eyadema said the achievement of the African Union put forward by
the extraordinary summit in Sirte, Libya last September would
enable Africa to form a united front so as to meet the challenges
and get the best benefit of the economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Sirte Declaration was aimed at turning Africa into a more
united, stronger and more responsible continent to face other
political and economic blocs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a full changing world where big political and economic
groupings are being built and consolidated, Africa will still be
marginalized if she does not constitute a united, solid and strong
bloc to make herself better understood and demonstrate her
capacity as an actor to reckon with on the international scene,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the integration objective cannot be reached without a
stable socio-political and quiet environment," he said. "Peace and
security should be the foundations on which we are to build our
great union for sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the new international economic order which is
already taking shape through the globalization must be conceived,
built up and implemented to the benefit of the people of the
industrialized and developing countries.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chairman Urges to Escalate African Unity to Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has urged his African
fellows to escalate their unity to a higher level, the African
Union.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 36th OAU summit here on
Monday, Salim said the African continent has reached a new
threshold since the Sirte Declaration on September 9, 1999 in
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The decision to elevate the unity of the continent by
establishing an African Union is a new impetus and another
defining moment for Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU was created by African leaders 37 years ago
with a common vision when the continent emerged from centuries of
colonialism and its legacies.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU has provided our continent with the framework for a
collective action, a common conscience, and a platform where the
quest for ideals could be attained by the people of Africa," he
said. "It is the totality of these elements that empowered us to
launch the final onslaught against colonialism and apartheid."
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, by enhancing unity and cohesion at the
community, national, regional and continental levels, the OAU has
achieved a lot in the last four decades in overcoming the
multifaceted challenges facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever and wherever we have failed to forge such unity, we
have had to face more complex problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim told the more than 30 heads of state and government in
the Palace of Togolese Parliament that the time has come for the
Africans to be responsible for their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter into a new millennium, global trends in the area
of development are such that we have no option but to take charge
of that destiny through concerted collective action, clarity of
purpose and a focused vision," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that Africans are still faced with
immense difficulties and problems, some of which are of their own
making.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the unenviable reputation that we have acquired
as the continent that generates the largest number of refugees and
displaced persons is the direct and indirect consequences of some
of our own actions," he said, adding that the continent is also
seriously being undermined by the recurrence of natural disasters,
especially HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS is devastating our communities, causing more death
and misery than all other casualties, producing orphans at a
dramatically alarming rate and crippling our efforts at socio-
economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said that African leaders have enunciated a firm resolve
to promote a new political culture that engenders peace, security
and stability and provides a firm basis for putting an end to the
practice of unconstitutional change of governments.
</P>
<P>
"We can take pride in the fact that it is now no longer
tolerable to use force or any other non-constitutional means in
changing governments that are freely elected by our people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also appealed to all member states and the
international community to assist the new governments in Guinea
Bissau and Niger in consolidating their young and fragile
democracies.
</P>
<P>
On the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, Salim said the
OAU-brokered agreement, with the support of external partners,
needs to be consolidated through the earliest possible attainment
of a comprehensive peace package.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the speedy deployment of the U.N.
peacekeeping force need not be overemphasized," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The African heads of state and government are here in a three-
day summit meeting which is focused mainly on the three themes of
regional cooperation and integration, security and stability, and
the challenges of widespread AIDS and poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the draft treaty on the establishment of
the African Union initiated during an extraordinary summit on
September 9, 1999 in Sirte, Libya as well as the treaty on the
African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Ways to end various conflicts on the continent, particularly in
Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra
Leone, and the related situation of refugees will also be on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, the OAU is designated to promote the
unity and solidarity of the African states, defend the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of its members, and
coordinate and intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a
better life for the people of Africa.

KAMPALA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni

women in the development process including planning, policy and

</P>
<P>
Although the population program in Uganda has made some

children to have and when to have them, according to Minister of

<HEADLINE> New Anti-AIDS Drug More Effective: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A new anti-retroviral drug,
more effective and cheaper than AZT, could save millions of babies
in the developing world from infection by their HIV-positive
mothers, a group of South African scientists said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One dose of Nevirapine given to the mother during labor and one
dose given to the baby is equivalent to, if not better than,
multiple doses of the more expensive AZT/3TC cocktail, according
to findings by the South African Interpartum Nevirapine Trials,
also known as "Saint", released Tuesday at the 13th International
AIDS Conference being held in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The research involved trials of more than 1,300 women,
according to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The Saint results came as the government continues to defend
its decision not to provide the more established anti-retroviral
drug AZT to HIV-positive pregnant mothers.
</P>
<P>
Each year, 60,000 babies are infected by their mothers in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Daya Moodley, a researcher at the University of Natal's medical
school, said the data demonstrated that Nevirapine could be a
viable option in the prevention of mother-to-child-transmission of
HIV in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, the drug costs only 25 rand (about 3.6 U.S.
dollars) per dose and the adverse affects of the drug are minimal,
Moodley said.

KAMPALA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said on Tuesday that there will be no meaningful economic
integration in Africa without political union, according to a

Kampala.

Mere large markets will not necessarily bring development
unless good policies are in place, the president said while

<HEADLINE> European Commission Announces Anti-AIDS Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
Tuesday announced a new initiative to help developing countries
combat the AIDS virus, malaria and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Under the new initiative, AIDS sufferers will have expanded
access to existing prevention and treatment options characterized
by more affordable products and increased investment in new anti-
AIDS medications.
</P>
<P>
Lieve Fransen, who coordinates the European Union's HIV/AIDS
programs in developing countries, told a news conference at the
13th International AIDS Conference in the coastal city of Durban
that "the existing efforts are clearly not sufficient. We don't
have these three diseases under control."
</P>
<P>
No specifics were given about how much money would be dedicated
to the plan, but Fransen said "we are committed to increasing
resources seriously around this initiative."
</P>
<P>
The European regional body will look at changing policy on
tariffs on drugs, generic competition and new licensing for
producing drugs to try to make them more affordable, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the EC will hold a high-level meeting of its members
to discuss the initiative on September 28 in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The initiative has received a positive response from the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
"The diseases of poverty -- HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria -
-altogether have a death toll of 4 million a year and that death
toll is rising," Fransen said, noting that "there are treatments
and tools available that are not being used."

JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will
earmark a budget of over 200 million U.S. dollars for this year to
contain the spread of AIDS in the developing world, according to a
U.S. official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Thurman, head of the White House AIDS Office, also urged
other countries and international organizations to step up their
efforts as well.
</P>
<P>
"The United States cannot do it alone," she said at a news
conference at the 13th International AIDS Conference being held in
Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. government earmarked 100 million dollars to
fight AIDS in 12 sub-Saharan countries and India.
</P>
<P>
Congress is expected to debate on Wednesday the administration'
s plans to give another 100 million dollars to the program,
Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
"With no vaccine or cure in sight, we are at the beginning of
an epidemic, not the end of an epidemic," she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that transmission of the AIDS virus
would be reduced by 25 percent in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics indicate that the number of people infected
with HIV has reached about 35 million across the world.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets Prodi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, Tuesday had a
friendly and candid exchange of views on China-EU relations and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that this is Zhu's first visit to the EU
headquarters and that the EU-China relations are entering a new
stage. There is a firm foundation in the friendly relations and
cooperation between the EU and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, the EU and Chinese leaders hold talks every
year and their contacts have strengthened mutual understanding and
communication, the EU executive head said.
</P>
<P>
The EU-China bilateral agreement signed recently on China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will not only
promote the development of the EU-China economic and trade ties,
but also have very active impact on the full development of EU-
China relations.
</P>
<P>
The 15-country European bloc is looking forward to enhancing
cooperation with China, the president added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Zhu agreed with Prodi's positive comments on
current Sino-European relations. Zhu emphasized that China
attaches importance both to the important role and position of the
EU in the process of multipolarizational world and to the
development of relations with the EU and its member countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU occupies an important position in China's overall
diplomacy, Zhu said. China is willing to broaden and deepen
cooperation with the EU in various fields to develop a new century-
oriented long-term and stable relations with the EU. The relations
are not only in the fundamental and long-term interests of both
sides, but also conducive to the establishment of a new
international political and economic order that is more just,
reasonable and balanced, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also briefed Zhu on the development of European
integration. Zhu expressed China's support for the process of
European integration and its hope that the development of European
integration will be conducive to peace and stability in Europe and
the world, and to the development of relations between the EU and
the other countries of the world, especially the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Prodi reiterated that the EU will stick to the one-China policy
and maintains only economic and cultural contacts with China's
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Prodi agreed that on handling the differences over
human rights in other issues, the two sides will continue their
dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Zhu met with Javier Solana, the EU's high
representative for foreign affairs and security policy. Solana
said the EU attaches great importance to the important role played
by China in the world arena. He expressed his belief that Euroepan-
China relations will witness a greater development in the new
century with joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China hopes to see that Europe will play a more
and more important role as the world moves to multipolarization.
China is willing to further strengthen its cooperation in all
fields with the EU on the basis of the current friendly and
cooperative relations between the two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan met with
Christopher Patten, the EU commissioner for external relations, to
exchange views on Sino-European cooperation. Tang also met with
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Orange Protest Ends in Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Street violence escalated in
Northern Ireland Tuesday following the ban on a contentious
Protestant parade.
</P>
<P>
Protestant militants and police have been locked in
confrontation since July 2, when authorities barred the pro-
British Protestant Orange Order from parading from Drumcree
through the pro-Irish Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown, Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Belfast city center was almost deserted Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Protestants flooded onto the streets Monday night in response
to Orange Order protest calls, setting up makeshift barricades and
bringing Northern Ireland to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
In overnight violence, cars were torched and in separate
incidents shots were fired and a homemade bomb was thrown at
police.
</P>
<P>
Seven shots were fired at a police vehicle in a staunchly
Protestant loyalist area in east Belfast but no injuries were
reported, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In Portadown meanwhile police used batons and a water cannon to
quell rioters.
</P>
<P>
Catholic republican extremists were suspected of several arson
attacks on Orange Halls overnight, while protesters were suspected
of attacking a Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
Police said several people were inside one Orange Hall when
petrol bombers attacked it. Three Protestants were later treated
for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
Traditional bonfires blaze at midnight when Orangemen usher in
"the Twelfth of July," the climax of the annual four-month-long "
marching season," when they celebrate William of Orange's victory
over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

<HEADLINE> British Nuclear Fuels Ends Japan Nuclear Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to take back the flawed
shipment of nuclear fuel sold to Japan from the Sellafield plant
in Cumbria last year.
</P>
<P>
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) admitted in September it had
misled the Japanese by falsifying records about safety checks on
the consignment.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese reacted with fury and insisted that BNFL should
pay for the radioactive shipment of reprocessed plutonium pellets
to be returned to Britain for disposal.
</P>
<P>
As diplomatic efforts continued, the nuclear fuel rods sat
unused in a Japanese port.
</P>
<P>
But now BNFL has agreed to pay for the shipment back to Britain,
expected to cost several million pounds.
</P>
<P>
BNFL is also paying 40 million pounds in compensation to the
Japanese customer, Kansai Electric.
</P>
<P>
In return Kansai is lifting its moratorium on new shipments of
mixed oxide (Mox) fuel from Sellafield, opening up the way for
around four billion pounds of future contracts put in jeopardy by
the falsification scandal.
</P>
<P>
Warships could be needed to protect the vessel from pirates
interested in its nuclear cargo.
</P>
<P>
And permission will be required from governments around the
world reluctant to allow such an environmentally sensitive
shipment to pass through their territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The British government has already apologized to Tokyo over the
matter and is now hoping to rebuild confidence in its nuclear
industry.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians aim to reach
an agreement to declare a viable Palestinian state this year at
the three-way Middle East summit which began at Camp David,
Maryland, on Tuesday, Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Ashrawi said that the summit
could determine the course of history for the entire Middle East
region and the Palestinians were not prepared to give in on the
core issues, including the status of Jerusalem, the borders of a
Palestinian state, the fate of Palestinian refugees and water
rights.
</P>

President Bill Clinton began the summit on Tuesday with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
a bid to break a deadlock in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
"There are central issues that cannot be dismissed lightly,"
Ashrawi noted.
</P>
<P>
She said the Palestinian delegation was "extremely realistic"
about the outcome of Camp David summit. "I don't expect to see
miraculous, substantive breakthroughs. I know how difficult and
complex these issues are," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will take more than just a summit -- eight days of
talks," she said. "It will be long, difficult and will probably
involve even more meetings afterwards, what some people call
rolling summits or negotiations."

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Discuss With Taliban on Edict Banning Women From Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
coordinator for Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, would travel to
Kandahar, Afghanistan, Wednesday to hold discussions with Taliban
Foreign Minister Mullah Mutawwakil, the U.N. announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesperson Marie Okabe said the discussions would focus
on the edict, promulgated by Taliban's Vice-Minister of Planning
and issued in Kabul last week, prohibiting Afghan women from
working with national and international non-governmental
organizations and U.N. agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian organizations in Afghanistan have already received
a letter from the Ministry of Planning reiterating the new rule in
writing, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
While women were not allowed to work in Taliban-controlled
areas of Afghanistan, in the past exceptions had been made for
women working in the health sector and in various essential
capacities in international and national organizations, Marie
Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of women would be affected by this edict, and without
their continued participation, many humanitarian assistance
programs for Afghanistan would be severely affected, Marie Okabe
said.
</P>
<P>
De Mul's mission is a follow-up to meetings between local
authorities, U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations in
Kabul and in Islamabad, seeking clarification and resolution of
this issue, said Marie Okabe.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hoped that the issue would be resolved soon
as to avoid any negative impact on the provision of humanitarian
aid at such a critical moment for the Afghan population, which was
currently suffering from one of the worst droughts in decades in
addition to the effects of 22 years of civil strife, the
spokesperson added.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday and Thursday, Radio Shariat in Kabul and local
newspapers in Afghanistan's capital issued a new edict promulgated
by the vice-minister of planning according to which Afghan women
were no longer allowed to work with non-governmental organizations
or U.N. agencies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday that it
will build three new destroyers for the Royal Navy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the House of Commons, Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon announced the construction of the 1 billion pounds( about 1.6
billion U.S. dollars) order.
</P>
<P>
He said the ships would be built by a new "modular" system.
Different parts of the vessels could be built by different yards
across Britain before being brought together for construction.
</P>
<P>
The announcement has been particularly welcomed by unions
representing shipyard workers.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,500 jobs will be sustained in the country's defense
industry with the construction of three new Type 45 destroyers.
</P>
<P>
The destroyers are the first in a planned series of 12, and an
order for a second batch is expected in 2004. Total cost of the
project is estimated at 6 billion pounds( 9.6 billion U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
The new vessels are due to enter service from 2007. They are
expected to provide the backbone of the Royal Navy's air defenses
for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Each new destroyer will be able to protect itself and other
ships from sophisticated missiles and be able to go close to shore
to protect British forces engaged in battles from air attacks.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Denies Providing Firearms to Colombian Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 11 (Xinhua)-- Venezuelan government categorically
rejects rumors regarding providing arms to Colombian guerrillas
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a communique made known Tuesday
that to wish to control arms trafficking on such an extensive
border is nearly impossible for both countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is so for Venezuela due to the peculiar and irregular
borders and it is for Colombia due to the insufficient presence of
its governments' forces in an area dominated by guerrillas," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Military Forces commander General Fernando Tapias
Tuesday told the press that Venezuelan Armed Forces keep on
providing Colombian guerrillas with arsenals.
</P>
<P>
He said that since January 1991 up to July 5, year 2000, 3
machine-guns, 470 Fal 7.62 rifles, 96 pistols, 18 revolvers, 58
sub-machineguns, 4 grenades, 744 providers and 90,090 ammunition
cartridges have been seized, together with weapons from Panama,
Bolivia and Germany.

<HEADLINE> News Blackout Imposed on Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- All sides involving in the Camp
David summit Tuesday agreed to impose a news blackout on the
substance of their discussions, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart made the announcement at his first press conference in
Thurmont, a small village about 30 kilometers away from Camp David,
where President Bill Clinton launched a week-long summit with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it was agreed that "any substantive
announcements would be made by a representative of the United
States government, and the United States government would, unless
explicitly agreed by all sides, keep the discussions and the
substance of the discussions in the Camp David meeting areas and
not air them out in the public."
</P>
<P>
He said both Israeli and Palestinian sides agreed that "this
was in the best interest of reaching an agreement and in the best
interest of avoiding spending and wasting a lot of time discussing
various newspaper accounts each day of what's going on in the
session."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge to Hear Clinton Disbarment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. judge in Arkansas State
decided Tuesday to hear a case that might deprive President Bill
Clinton of his Arkansas law license.
</P>
<P>
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Leon Johnson, who was appointed
only last month, called the clerk's office of the court and said
he would accept the case.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was the fifth judge to accept the case after four
others refused to hear it because of their ties to Clinton, the
former governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct
sued to disbar Clinton on June 30, charging the president with
telling lies in his testimony relating to his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said that his lawyers will fight for the case, but
he himself will not get involved personally. He has 30 days to
respond to the case.
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision is likely to be appealed to the Arkansas
Supreme Court and a final decision might come after Clinton and
the judge have left office.

<HEADLINE> Annan Appoints New UNDOF Force Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday appointed Major-General Bo Lennart Wranker of
Sweden as Force Commander of the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (UNDOF) with effect from August 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wranker will succeed Major-General Cameron Ross of Canada who
has served as Head of the Mission since October 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
UNDOF was established by the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 350 of 1974 to maintain the cease-fire between Israel
and Syria, to supervise the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian
forces, and to supervise the areas of separation and limitation,
as provided in the Agreement on Disengagement.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of UNDOF has since been renewed every six months.
The current mandate expires on November 30, 2000, in accordance
with Security Council Resolution 1300 of 2000.
</P>
<P>
In recommending the extension of the mandate, Annan observed
that despite the present quiet in the Israeli-Syrian sector, the
situation in the Middle East continued to be potentially dangerous
until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the
Middle East problem was reached.
</P>
<P>
In the prevailing circumstances, he considered the continued
presence of UNDOF in the area to be essential.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's blue chip stocks
rose Tuesday after the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
made upbeat comments on the new economy. But the tech shares fell.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 80.61 at 10.727.19,
expanding its gain of 10.60 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 23.87 at 3,
956.42. The index lost 42.91 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 5.26 at 1,480.88.
</P>
<P>
The blue chips rose after Greenspan told the National Governors
' Association that the high technology has made contributions to
the long expansion of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's comments raised hope that the Federal Reserve will
end the year-long cycle of rate rising despite no wards on rates
mentioned in the chairman's speech. Six hikes in interest rates in
the past year has slowed the economy and kept inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
Aluminum maker Alcoa and International Paper led the Dow's
advance. Alcoa rose today in the second straight session on its
higher-than-expected earnings reported Monday while International
Paper was also higher with its own strong profits report today.
</P>
<P>
But Yahoo! dragged the Nasdaq lower. The Internet company fell
today in the second straight session largely because of negative
comments on its future earnings from Wall Street analysts even
though the company was expected to announce its strong earnings in
the second quarter later today.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.61 at 659.90 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 16.64 at 953.20. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 1.09 at 529.74.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,624 up, 1,313 down and 474
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 976.13 million shares from 814.94
million in the previous session.
